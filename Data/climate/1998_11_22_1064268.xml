        <p>Asia's economic collapse will depress oil and gasoline prices for nearly a decade, saving motorists in the United States about 13 cents a gallon in 2000 alone, the Energy Department said this week.</p>
        <p>While the Asian crisis has already helped to lower energy costs, the report offers by far the strongest evidence that the effects will be deep and long-lasting.</p>
        <p>In the United States, continued low energy prices are likely to limit inflation, economists say. Weak Asian demand and heavy global production also reduce the nation's vulnerability to any sudden disruption of oil imports, which account for about half of America's demand.</p>
        <p>But the low oil and gasoline prices also hamper the fight against global warming. With oil at $13 or $15 a barrel, there are few economic incentives for saving energy or using renewable energy sources to reduce pollution that is blamed for global warming.</p>
        <p>The oil glut has also resulted from falling production costs and the opening of new regions. The Energy Department expects higher production from the Caspian Sea, the North Sea and the waters off West Africa, as well as from Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. While some oil companies are trimming their investments, many are too far along on projects to turn back, said Jay Hakes, chief of the department's Energy Information Administration, which issued the report.</p>
        <p>The 13-cent-a-gallon savings in the year 2000 are from the prices forecast if there had been no Asian crisis. Analysts at the Energy Department and the oil companies doubt that oil prices will necessarily remain at the present levels of less than $13 a barrel. The partial resumption of Iraqi output has recently forced prices down, leaving unleaded regular gasoline at less than $1 a gallon.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department, relying on economic forecasts by DRI/McGraw Hill, sees Asia recovering so slowly that the average oil price in the year 2000, adjusted for inflation, will still be less than $14 a barrel. That price is about $5.50 a barrel less than the $19.50 the department predicted last year.</p>
        <p>''Last year we were sort of seeing this like Mexico,'' said Mr. Hakes, referring to that country's crisis four years ago. ''Where there were economic problems, they bounced back pretty quickly. This year we are seeing it as more sustained.''</p>
        <p>He cautions that it is unclear how quickly Asia will recapture foreign investment. But even if energy demand there soars once again, he says, global production can keep up.</p>
        <p>Joseph Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, agreed that Asia's situation had reshaped the oil market. ''The upward moving balloon of demand has been pierced by the Asian crisis,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Oil companies, already trying to cut their staffs and economize, have been pessimistic about prices for the next few years. Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's largest oil company, recently predicted prices of $12 to $16 a barrel over the next two to three years.</p>
        <p>While oil producers like Mexico and Russia might suffer, low oil prices are a boon for the United States, reducing not only inflation but also the trade deficit.</p>
        <p>Continued low prices and rising consumption of fossil fuels, including coal, will raise carbon emissions in about the year 2010 by 33 percent over the 1990 level, the agency predicts. To comply with the Kyoto agreement to slow global warming, the United States has pledged to reduce emissions over this period by 10 percent from the 1990 level.</p>
