        <p>LEAD: RARELY have so many news reports strengthened the case for strong implementation of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which gave auto companies 10 years to reach an average fleet mileage level of 27.5 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>RARELY have so many news reports strengthened the case for strong implementation of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, which gave auto companies 10 years to reach an average fleet mileage level of 27.5 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>Just this year, the American people have experienced or read about health-damaging urban and suburban air pollution, acid rain, the greenhouse effect and the steady increase in oil imports which are nearing 50 percent of total domestic consumption. Wasteful gasoline consumption contributes to these conditions.</p>
        <p>In passing the 1975 Act, Congress devised a way to push technological development to achieve regularly higher gasoline efficiences for motor vehicles. Until 1981, when Reagan's deregulation began, the progress was promising. The General Motors Corporation went from a record low average of 12 miles per gallon in 1974 to about 21 miles per gallon in 1980.</p>
        <p>Assurances for further major advances came from industry and government. G.M. formally committed in 1980 to an average level of 31 miles per gallon by the 1985 model year, to exceed the regulation by 3.5 miles per gallon. This announcment came after the Carter Administration modified a large 1977 Chevrolet to meet the 27.5 miles per gallon standard.</p>
        <p>But by the mid-1980's, G.M. and the Ford Motor Company were out of compliance with the fuel economy regulations. According to the law they could have paid their penalties for the degree their average fleet fell below 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 and still sold their cars quite profitably. Instead, the two companies, while reporting record profits consistently during this period, initiated a lobbying effort that persuaded an utterly supine Reagan Administration that their ''best efforts'' stopped at 26 miles per gallon for 1986-88.</p>
        <p>Now, James Burnley, Secretary of Transportation, is proposing reducing the fuel economy requirement from 27.5 miles per gallon to 26.5 for the 1989 and 1990 model years. Along with G.M. (whose ads tout high technology now for the 21st century), Mr. Burnley wants to repeal fuel economy standards entirely. Congress rejected these demands. Nonetheless, Reagan Administration officials scrapped the post-1985 fuel economy proceedingswhich cost this country 8 years of valuable time in moving fuel efficiency standards toward the 50-60 miles per gallon range by the mid 1990's. And they signaled a permanent green light to industry demands.</p>
        <p>The arguments G.M. uses to justify this technological backsliding are specious and have little to do with the 1975 act. The statute authorizes the Government to issue standards that achieve maximum feasible fuel economy in ways that are technologically possible, economically practical and meet the need of the nation to conserve energy. Levels of 27.5 miles per gallon and higher meet these criteria.</p>
        <p>So G.M. asserts that thousands of jobs for auto workers will be shifted to its overseas plants if the law is enforced. Of course, G.M. can make this threat anytime it wants to weaken Federal laws, but the 1975 Energy Conservation Act does not provide for such excuses. Moreover, the average fuel efficiency rules for domestically produced cars have forced G.M. to build many small cars in this country whose production might otherwise have been shifted overseas. These rules have also reduced the job-depleting effects of what would have been an even larger foreign trade deficit due to even higher oil import levels. By fighting to keep their cars wasting more gasoline, G.M., Ford and their allies are fueling a trend that has seen oil imports go from 6.2 million barrels a day in 1986 to 7 million barrels a day so far this year.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s other argument is that gasoline prices dropped and consumers want larger cars. Just as is the case with safety advances, automotive engineers have long had lists of practical ways to make these cars much more efficient. Instead of again plunging into the 150 miles per hour muscle car, horsepower race, these auto makers should make up for lost time and build their cars in the interest of the consumers' pocketbooks, a healthy environment, the country's economy and national security.</p>
        <p>Instead, G.M. and Ford are in the business of delivering last-minute ultimatums to the Federal Government, which has let these industry leaders avoid the fuel efficiency law since 1983. After meeting with G.M. and Ford officials last month, Mr. Burnley proposed to relax the fuel regulations for 1989 model cars that were on their way to the showrooms.</p>
        <p>When Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole started the concessions more than three years ago, Chrysler, which had invested $4 billion to comply with the energy savings law, was outraged. In a rare public display of dissent, Chrysler's executive vice president, Robert S. Miller, Jr., said: ''I'm getting tired of going down to Washington to ask what the law is going to be. I think next time I'll just go to General Motors and Ford and ask them what it is.'' That's the nub of this damaging dereliction. The rules are being set in Detroit, not Washington.</p>
