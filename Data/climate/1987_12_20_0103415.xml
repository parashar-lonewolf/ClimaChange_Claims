        <p>LEAD: THERE is the stuff of high melodrama in the case of Michael Keith Deaver, whose trial ended last Wednesday with a jury verdict of guilty on three of five charges of perjury.</p>
        <p>THERE is the stuff of high melodrama in the case of Michael Keith Deaver, whose trial ended last Wednesday with a jury verdict of guilty on three of five charges of perjury.</p>
        <p>The story opens on a Horatio Alger note: The poor but charming son of a hard-drinking small-town filling station owner, Mr. Deaver puts himself through San Jose State University by playing the piano at cocktail bars under the stage name Michael Keith. His bachelor's degree, in political science, is the family's first. He moves up fast in the Santa Clara County Republican Party and joins Ronald Reagan's Statehouse staff in 1967.</p>
        <p>In Sacramento, he meets and marries a shy, appealing young Statehouse secretary, a favorite of Nancy Reagan. Assigned to tend Mrs. Reagan's schedule - he and others call it ''the Mommy Watch'' - he begins a 20-year, almost-adopted-son relationship with the Reagans. At one memorable moment, he steps forward boldly to rescue the choking Governor with the Heimlich maneuver.</p>
        <p>That was the start of a career that may, if appeals fail, end with a prison sentence. What happened along the way was summarized by Whitney North Seymour Jr., the special prosecutor in the case: ''There's too much loose money and too little concern in Washington about ethics.'' Corporations and foreign governments, he said, are eager to hand ''vast sums of money'' to ''consultants whose stock in trade is their friendship with persons in high office.''</p>
        <p>By 1981, Mr. Deaver had not only a uniquely intimate rapport with the Reagan family, but also a growing reputation as a skillful image-maker. As White House deputy chief of staff, he was the Presidential appointments gatekeeper and the planner of TV camera angles on Presidential trips. He had the choicest White House office, with a door opening directly into the Oval Office. He made the ''A list'' of Washington hostesses; some weeks the Deavers were out seven nights in a row.</p>
        <p>But after Mr. Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984, there were signs of burnout. He complained publicly that he could not support his family on a top Government salary. He began drinking too much, most of it secretly. He stirred a storm of criticism by having Mr. Reagan visit a cemetery at Bitburg, West Germany, where Nazi Waffen SS troops were buried.</p>
        <p>In May 1985, at age 47, he opened the consulting firm of Michael K. Deaver and Associates Inc. By Christmas his office had signed clients paying more than $3 million, and his company car was a dark green Jaguar with a telephone.</p>
        <p>His piously avowed intention to offer only ''strategic planning'' and to avoid ''the quick fix'' was violated almost immediately. Under a $250,000-a-year contract with Trans World Airlines, which was fighting a takeover by the corporate raider Carl Icahn, he called to solicit - but failed to get - a delaying action from Elizabeth H. Dole, then the Secretary of Transportation. Under new management, TWA never asked him to do more: He had made a quarter-million-dollar phone call.</p>
        <p>Another contract, with the Government of Canada for $100,000, prompted a House inquiry and a Federal grand jury investigation as to whether Canada, which wanted the Administration to do more to curb acid rain, might have hired a former policymaker to help it shape the debate. That would make him a violator of the ethics act. In sworn testimony, Mr. Deaver said he did not remember White House meetings on acid rain.</p>
        <p>Under oath, he said he could not recall, or he simply denied, more than 20 lobbying contacts with White House and other officials on behalf of the Government of South Korea, Philip Morris International, the Boeing Company, Rockwell International Inc. and others. Enthralled with his access to the Oval Office, South Korea paid him $475,000 a year; each of the others, $250,000. Then, last March, the grand jury indicted Mr. Deaver on charges of lying to it and to the House investigating subcommittee. The President said he had confidence in his friend, but the clients did not. They fled.</p>
        <p>When the jury found Mr. Deaver guilty of three of the five counts in the indictment, he asserted his disappointment and his innocence. But barring a successful appeal, he faces a sentence of as much as 15 years in prison and $22,000 in fines, not to mention legal fees estimated at more than $600,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver has sold a kiss-and-tell book manuscript for a reported $500,000. Excerpts published in a national magazine made the President look silly, and the First Lady even sillier. On Thursday Mrs. Reagan said that, while she is ''terribly sorry'' for Mr. Deaver, White House lawyers have advised no contact with him while his appeals are pending.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, two special prosecutors are investigating another Reagan friend, Attorney General Edwin Meese III, in regard to the Iran-contra affair and the Wedtech scandal. And a third friend, Lyn Nofziger, goes on trial next month on charges of peddling influence for more ''loose money.''  THE NATION</p>
