        <p>Editorial hails bipartisan House votes blocking Bush administration plans for oil and gas exploration in eastern Gulf of Mexico and in national monument lands, upholding mining reforms Pres Bush opposes and restoring funds for land protection and energy conservation programs he tried to cut; cites poll showing Bush is alarmingly out of touch with public on energy and environmental issues</p>

        <p>The House of Representatives has now provided further evidence of the widening gap between the Bush administration and the American people on environmental and energy issues. In a series of votes on Thursday, an impressive bipartisan majority blocked administration plans for oil and gas exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and in national monument lands, upheld important mining law reforms that Mr. Bush had opposed and restored millions of dollars for land protection and energy conservation programs that he had tried to cut.</p>
        <p>The votes followed closely on a New York Times/CBS News poll that showed the administration alarmingly out of touch with the public on energy and environmental issues. In legislative terms, it was Mr. Bush's darkest hour. In every case, moderates from the president's own party provided the margin of difference.</p>

        <p>The House of Representatives has now provided further evidence of the widening gap between the Bush administration and the American people on environmental and energy issues. In a series of votes on Thursday, an impressive bipartisan majority blocked administration plans for oil and gas exploration in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and in national monument lands, upheld important mining law reforms that Mr. Bush had opposed and restored millions of dollars for land protection and energy conservation programs that he had tried to cut.</p>
        <p>The votes followed closely on a New York Times/CBS News poll that showed the administration alarmingly out of touch with the public on energy and environmental issues. In legislative terms, it was Mr. Bush's darkest hour. In every case, moderates from the president's own party provided the margin of difference.</p>
        <p>Three votes stand out. By a 247-to-164 margin, the House, with 70 Republicans ignoring pleas from their own leadership, blocked new oil and gas exploration off the Florida coast for six months, amid promises to make the ban permanent. The only Bush who was happy with this vote was Jeb, Florida's governor, who had defied his brother on the issue. By a slightly smaller margin, the House also voted to bar the administration from oil, gas and coal exploration on public lands designated as national monuments -- areas on which the president and his secretary of the interior, Gale Norton, had cast covetous eyes.</p>
        <p>In a third rebuff to the extractive industries that donated so heavily to Mr. Bush's election campaign, the House voted to uphold Clinton-era rules requiring mining companies to pay for cleanups, while giving the federal government new powers to block mines that could cause irreversible environmental damage.</p>
        <p>In addition, environmentalists could celebrate a  subcommittee vote blocking a mischievous Bush proposal that would have undermined a citizen's right to seek protection for imperiled animals under the Endangered Species Act. On money issues, the House restored $800 million overall to the Interior Department's budget and refocused spending for land and wildlife conservation programs on areas of obvious need instead of giving states the discretionary authority Mr. Bush wanted. It also added $294 million for various energy conservation programs and for accelerated research into alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>These actions send two unmistakable messages. The House is clearly eager to restore balance to Mr. Bush's energy strategy, which is weighted toward exploration for fossil fuels. It also wants Mr. Bush to know that his administration's dismissive approach to the nation's natural resources reflects a grievous misreading of the public temper.</p>
