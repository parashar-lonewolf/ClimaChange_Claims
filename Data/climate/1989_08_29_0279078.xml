        <p>LEAD: Two decades ago, a British scientist named James Lovelock put forth an imaginative and poetic view of how the Earth functions. The planet's living organisms, he said, act together to regulate the global environment: Life interacts chemically and physically with the air, the waters and the rocks to maintain optimum conditions for itself.</p>
        <p>Two decades ago, a British scientist named James Lovelock put forth an imaginative and poetic view of how the Earth functions. The planet's living organisms, he said, act together to regulate the global environment: Life interacts chemically and physically with the air, the waters and the rocks to maintain optimum conditions for itself.</p>
        <p>In fact, Dr. Lovelock said, the Earth itself appears to behave like a living organism. He named the organism Gaia (pronounced GUY-uh), after the Earth goddess of the Greeks. The Gaia hypothesis beguiled environmentalists and others inspired by the unitary view of Earth from space as a ''dappled sapphire,'' in Dr. Lovelock's phrase. The concept acquired mystical overtones, and not least for that reason it was shunned by other scientists, some of whom ridiculed it as a fairy tale.</p>
        <p>But times change and theories with them. And today, as the prospect of global climactic change infuses the ecological sciences with new urgency, the Gaia hypothesis, whether true or false, appears to have significant influence on the way some scientists study the Earth and the questions they ask about it. For these scientists, it has provided an organizing focus for research as they step up their efforts to learn more about how the enormously complex global environment functions, what maintains it and what disrupts it. And it has stimulated a spirited debate over the role of life in governing the Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>In one study bearing on the issue, appearing in the British journal Nature this month, two American scientists have suggested that without life's influence on climate, the Earth would be up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it is now.</p>
        <p>The Gaia concept has evolved considerably since the late 1960's, when Dr. Lovelock first proposed it.</p>
        <p>''I see it now as a kind of theory in its early stages,'' Dr. Lovelock said in a telephone interview from Coombe Mill in Cornwall, England, where he works out of a barn converted into a laboratory. As he explains the Gaia concept now, it is essentially this:</p>
        <p>The Earth proper - its crustal rocks, oceans and atmosphere - and the life on it have evolved together as a single, tightly coupled system. The system compensates for changes in the global climate by adjusting the rates at which such gases as oxygen, methane and carbon dioxide are produced and removed from the atmosphere. This effectively holds the climate within bounds favorable to life as a whole.</p>
        <p>But there are limits to this capacity for regulation. The environment can be changed too much by cataclysms like meteor or asteroid impacts or, increasingly, by human activity. If that happens, the environmental changes can overwhelm the efforts of the system to regulate itself and can force the climate to a new and different stable state: either a sharply higher or lower global temperature, for instance. As a result, some species will be extinguished and others will flourish. This, Dr. Lovelock believes, is likely responsible for the mass extinctions of Earth's remote past.</p>
        <p>In this view, the Earth is neither as fragile as some environmentalists would have it nor as forgiving as some people, who have taken the Gaia hypothesis to mean that the environment will adjust to pollution and disruption by humans, would like to believe. It will adjust, Dr. Lovelock says, but the adjustment may well be disastrous for Homo sapiens.</p>
        <p>''The idea that we're wrecking the Earth is wrong; but wrecking ourselves is another story,'' says Lynn Margulis, a microbiologist at the University of Massachusetts and Dr. Lovelock's main American collaborator.</p>
        <p>Critics attacked and even scorned the Gaia concept in its original form mostly because it held that the global system creates optimal conditions for life and because, they said, it held that the planet's self-regulation was in some sense purposeful. Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis have abandoned the first idea, and Dr. Lovelock says that neither ever espoused the second. Effect of Life Long Accepted</p>
        <p>Earth scientists have long accepted as fact two components of the revised concept: the proposition that plant and animal life, or biota, have a substantial influence on the nonbiological world - in the production and maintenance of atmospheric oxygen by photosynthesizing plants, for instance - and that life and the inanimate world influence each other's evolution.</p>
        <p>But while mainstream scientists agree with that much, they say it is unclear whether the system regulates itself, as Dr. Lovelock holds, through a complex set of feedback relationships in which the biota and the physical world are tightly coupled. This is the novel part of the Gaia theory in its present state, and the place where debate now focuses. The debate involves the extent and nature of life's interrelationship with the inanimate world and seeks to identify the mechanisms through which the planetary system works.</p>
        <p>This is an area where uncertainties abound, and many scientists have long been exploring it quite apart from the Gaia concept. ''I think everyone who's actively involved in studying the system will agree there's an enormous amount we don't understand,'' said Heinrich Holland, a geochemist at Harvard University who has been a critic of the Gaia hypothesis. ''Until we know more it's premature to say what the role of the biota is or has been over time.''</p>
        <p>Some scientists say that the search for answers has been stimulated by the Gaia theory and the attendant debate, and to them this is more important than whether the theory itself holds up. ''What is really new in Gaia may not be right, but it's interesting enough to motivate people to work hard to shoot it down or prove it true,'' said Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Correctness Less Important</p>
        <p>Dr. Schneider last year organized a conference of mainstream scientists in San Diego sponsored by the American Geophysical Union. Because it was the first meeting of this kind, it did much to clarify the often muddy Gaia picture. After the meeting, a report in the journal Nature said that whether the theory is correct may matter less ''than that it is stimulating.''</p>
        <p>''It's not really a theory, it's more of a new way of observing, a way of asking questions,'' says Tyler Volk, a scientist at New York University. He describes the Gaia concept as ''not so much a hypothesis as a generator of hypotheses.''</p>
        <p>A central question emerging from the Gaia debate is whether conditions favorable to any but the most primitive forms of life could be created and maintained by the interaction of the Earth's rocks, water and atmosphere alone, without the influence of the biota. One school of more traditionally oriented earth scientists, arguing against the Gaian position, says yes. But they are being challenged in the scientific give-and-take over the issue. A particular global mechanism is central to the exchange of views, and it offers a revealing example of the kind of feedback that lies at the heart of the revised Gaia theory.</p>
        <p>Working with mathematical models, the group of scientists arguing against the Gaian position has proposed that the Earth's temperature has been regulated over eons by fluctuating levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide traps heat from the Sun inside the atmosphere. When the global temperature rises, in this formulation, carbon dioxide levels decline, allowing the Earth's surface to cool. When the surface cools, carbon dioxide increases and the surface warms. Most scientists believe that the Sun has become brighter since Earth was formed, and many say the carbon-dioxide thermostat has kept the Earth's temperature in tolerable bounds as the Sun's intensity has grown.</p>
        <p>The mechanism for this thermostatic effect, according to James C. G. Walker and Paul B. Hays of the University of Michigan and James F. Kasting, now of Pennsylvania State University, is what is called the carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle. The process, they said, accounts for about 80 percent of the carbon dioxide exchanged between the solid earth and the atmosphere. The rest comes from photosynthesizing plants. A 500,000-Year Cycle</p>
        <p>The carbonate-silicate cycle, the existence of which and its general role in stabilizing the climate are well accepted by scientists, takes place over more than 500,000 years. It begins when carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere in rain water and changed into carbonic acid. The rain erodes, or weathers, silicate rocks. The carbonic acid reacts chemically with the rocks, releasing calcium and bicarbonate ions into the groundwater. These are ultimately carried into streams, rivers and the ocean. Plankton in the sea incorporate the ions in their shells, which are made of calcium carbonate. The plankton die and settle to the ocean floor, forming carbonate sediments. As the sea floor slides under the continental land masses, the sediments are carried toward the planet's interior. They are eventually converted back to carbon dioxide and come back into the atmosphere through volcanic eruptions and midocean ridges.</p>
        <p>If the temperature of Earth were to increase, the rate of evaporation of the oceans would also increase. This would cause rainfall to increase as well, which would remove more carbon dioxide. The weathering of rocks would also increase and this would cause more carbon dioxide to cycle through the earth. And because there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the Earth would cool.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kasting argues that if the plankton were removed from the cycle, carbonate sediments would still form. He and colleagues have also calculated that if land plants disappeared, the global temperature would rise by about 18 degrees. This would produce a climate about as warm as that of Earth at the time of the dinosaurs. He and his collaborators concluded, they wrote in Scientific American last year, that ''Earth would still have remained habitable even if it had never been inhabited.''</p>
        <p>But calculations reported by Dr. Volk and David W. Schwartzman of Howard University in the Aug. 10 issue of Nature suggest that in the absence of life, the weathering of rocks would decrease so much that Earth would be up to 80 degrees warmer than it is today. This, they wrote, would make the planet ''uninhabitable for nearly all but the most primitive microbes.'' They concluded that ''life may have been crucial in cooling early Earth and maintaining relatively cool conditions.'' This appears to be consistent with the Gaia theory.</p>
        <p>They suggested that microbes enhance weathering by creating soil, which in turn creates more surfaces where weathering can take place.</p>
        <p>Dr. Volk and Dr. Schwartzman have made ''a plausible case'' that ''the biotic effect is bigger than we said it was, but not necessarily as big as they say it is,'' Dr. Kasting says now.</p>
        <p>As this sort of scientific of back-and-forth goes on, it is taking place within a conceptual framework that sees the Earth whole, rather than in unrelated segments confined within scientific specialties. In some measure, this is requiring scientists to cross the traditional lines and, in effect, create new disciplines.</p>
        <p>That has been a goal dear to Dr. Lovelock's heart. Along with the fact that scientists are increasingly investigating what he sees as Gaian questions, he says such change has produced satisfaction to offset 20 years of criticism.</p>
        <p>''I cannot grumble at all,'' he said.</p>
