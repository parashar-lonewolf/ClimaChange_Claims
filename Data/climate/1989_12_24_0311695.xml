        <p>LEAD: Where is the world headed? The Week in Review asked a number of people to hazard some predictions about life in the 1990's. Some stuck their necks out farther than others, but, if experience is any guide, all of us are in for surprises.  Economic Warfare</p>
        <p>Where is the world headed? The Week in Review asked a number of people to hazard some predictions about life in the 1990's. Some stuck their necks out farther than others, but, if experience is any guide, all of us are in for surprises.  Economic Warfare</p>
        <p>The long and tortuous contest between capitalism and Communism is coming to an end. We'll all declare capitalism victorious and then discover a curious thing, that there are two quite different forms of capitalism. One might be called a cosmopolitan capitalism, in which national boundaries are irrelevant; the free market reigns supreme. The other form might be called national capitalism, in which governments join with the private sector to advance national interests. Japan, South Korea, East Asia will be the centers of national capitalism. Instead of technology embedded in weapons systems, the new contest will be over goods and services.</p>
        <p>The most fortunate and skilled among us will find themselves with ever-larger markets willing to pay them ever-larger sums. The least fortunate and skilled will find themselves competing with workers all over the globe willing to work for a fraction of the wages. - Robert Reich, Economist</p>
        <p>The Democrats will finally give up trying to micromanage the economy and produce a candidate who understands the nature of growth in the U.S. and around the world and who will give the Republicans a serious run for power.</p>
        <p>We may have had an end of history in the Francis Fukuyama sense, in terms of victory of democracy over command economies. It really will be a contest between entrepreneurial capitalism and state corporate capitalism, what we used to call fascism. Our advantage is in entrepreneurial capitalism, so I'd expect a contest of those ideas, both of which may in fact be legitimate. - Jude Wanniski, Political Economist  Class and Race</p>
        <p>After two decades of Reagan-Bush policies, we'll be increasingly divided along lines of class, which will mean among other things that there will be more and more homeless people, and we can expect them to be organized into nomadic bands who will be in rural and suburban areas as well as the cities. The overclass - the top 10 or 15 percent - will probably not grow any more and become less visible as it retreats into guarded enclaves.</p>
        <p>However, there will be new social movements; probably they will call themselves democracy movements -movements of the poor and of students. I think there will be students who will be increasingly unwilling to take their places in an isolated and arrogant overclass. And I think more of these movements will be led by women. - Barbara Ehrenreich, Writer</p>
        <p>We will see for the first time social policies designed to address the problems of poverty, education, employment and labor market efficiency simultaneously. There seems to be a growing recognition that these problems are interrelated and that if they are not addressd the country will face a major economic disaster by the year 2000. Some will support this policy out of concern for fate of minorities, but it will draw even greater support because of concern over the devastating effect that a poorly trained work force will have on the economy in the decade ahead. - William Julius Wilson, Sociologist</p>
        <p>If the business community keeps up the pressure and Washington provides the leadership, we have a chance for overhauling public education in the new decade. It is not a question of whether politically it is going to happen - it has to happen. If this President does not do it, then the next Presidential campaign will be fought over this issue. Our place as a world economic power is at risk, as is our ability to maintain the quality of life in this country. - Donna Shalala, Educator  Pressured Planet</p>
        <p>The 90's will be the make it or break it decade in terms of conservation worldwide and especially in the tropics where the bulk of the world's biological diversity is found. We're facing a wide variety of problems from ozone layer depletion and global warming to soil and water and air pollution and toxic waste disposal and acid rain. But to me the single most important conservation issue is the loss of the planet's biological diversity because that's the biological capital, the resource base on which we depend for our own survival. We can develop technologies to combat most forms of pollution but once we lose a species of plant or animal it's gone forever. - Russell A. Mittermeier, Conservationist</p>
        <p>I think the record since 1970 has proved the adage to expect the unexpected when it comes to energy. Are we going to see a real rebound in energy demands in industrial countries and even more so in developing countries? Then the question becomes how to meet that demand.</p>
        <p>In the 90's the environment will provide the incentive for conservation rather than security or price. And the environment will provide the motivation for looking again at the portfolio of alternatives, an effort that fell by the wayside in the 1980's. But I don't see anybody rushing to sign up to build a new nuclear power plant. - Daniel Yergin, Energy Consultant  Return of Beauty</p>
        <p>Art is not going to go on the way it did in New York in the 60's. It's been a long time since there was anything remotely like a new art movement. That doesn't mean there is not a lot of interesting work being done. I just don't think that it's historically important. I don't know what an art world would be like that reconciled itself to the fact that the borderlines are now understood and the task of art is no longer to drive them into the unknown. Who knows, beauty may make a new appearance.</p>
        <p>I think there will be a decentralization of artistic creativity. There have been so many new museums and socially they are the most important institutions we have. Each will be a center of some kind and people will be using them for all sorts of purposes. Artists will have all kinds of things to do when they no longer feel they have to come to New York. - Arthur C. Danto, Art critic and philosopher</p>
        <p>It's very depressing. There are lot of fairly sinister attacks on artists and their works. There must be a struggle on the part of artists, organizations and institutions to protect the work of artists, writers and visual artists, cineastes and so on. The attacks tend to make government support rhetorical, and they tend to persuade large communities of people that their lives are threatened by candor. But even if the struggle is protracted, we, the artists, will prevail. - Toni Morrison, Novelist  With Governments Of Their Own</p>
        <p>There will be cooperation and mutual understanding between Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Ecological problems in that area are awful. Those countries fight for their survival in an ecological sense.</p>
        <p>I see good chances of democracy in those countries, but economic problems are tremendous. There is a great readiness of the populations to go along with hardships, provided the governments are considered their own. - Czeslaw Milosz, Writer</p>
        <p>Unity of Germany will be achieved in the next decade, in one way or another; it is almost inevitable. It will have to come through the agreement of outside powers and will be dependent on the shape of the European Community and events in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>In Eastern Europe Communism is very much finished. Democracy may turn out to be a very fragile development. The possibility of right-wing dictatorship or authoritarian regimes is not excluded. Much will depend on how those governments deal with their economic problems; one cannot be overly optimistic on that. - Adam B. Ulam, Historian</p>
        <p>Espionage activity between the East and West will increase. As you draw down your military strength, there is an increase in the amount of information you need. The relative threat tends to increase as military strength decreases. You have to increase your warning time.</p>
        <p>Increased intelligence gathering will focus not on capabilities - you get that from satellites - but on intentions. And to gather information about intentions, you have to do human intelligence. You don't get that from a satellite.</p>
        <p>The world is in the best shape it's been in my lifetime. Marxism is dying at the roots. No natural law says America has to have an external enemy. But if there is anything we've learned in the past 12 months it is how fast things can change. - Tom Clancy, Novelist  Manipulating Mind and Life</p>
        <p>The next 10 years will bring us just to the beginning of general purpose robots - the PC with arms and legs and eyes. I think developments will be pretty small in 10 years but it will be the beginning of an industry that will eventually absorb everything else. In 40 years the robot will in some ways be equal to a human in its ability to move around and see; in other ways it will be tremendously superhuman. Somewhere in between there will be a machine that will probably be able to earn its living. It will be physically inadequate and clumsy but logically it will be a match for most people and probably more diligent.</p>
        <p>As machines eventually acquire all the capabilities of humans and lots more besides, humans will become superfluous. Do we gracefully bow out to what amounts to our children or do we join them? We will be able to make ourselves smarter using the same techniques that make machines smarter. - Hans Moravec, Computer Scientist</p>
        <p>The novel field that will emerge in the 90's will be organ replacement with biologically synthesized organs. Bone marrow transplantation will also become common and that will eliminate blood cancer and blood diseases. As a teen-ager you could put down a marrow sample and know that 40 years later you'd be protected against a whole variety of cancers.</p>
        <p>I suspect that we will have a broadbased knowledge of genetic causes that will enable us to identify diseases early - both the obvious genetic disorders like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy and common diseases such as heart disease, predisposition to cancer and probably mental illnesses. During the decade we will probably come to know about half of all the human genes, compared with maybe 1 percent now. Suddenly we'll have a different grasp of how the human body develops from an egg and a different grasp of human evolution -and all of evolution. - Walter Gilbert, Molecular biologist</p>
