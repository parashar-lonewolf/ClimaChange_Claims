        <p>LEAD: Warning that global warming could cause devastating floods and food shortages in wide areas, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain called on the United Nations today to complete by 1992 a treaty that would require action toward stabilizing the world's climate.</p>
        <p>Warning that global warming could cause devastating floods and food shortages in wide areas, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain called on the United Nations today to complete by 1992 a treaty that would require action toward stabilizing the world's climate.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher told the United Nations General Assembly that the treaty should be supplemented by specific, binding agreements regulating the production of gasses that trap heat in the atmosphere and that could raise global temperatures enough to melt glaciers, cause rising sea levels and disrupt rainfall and other climate patterns.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher said the restrictions would have to be be obligatory and their application carefully monitored. Otherwise, she said, countries that respect them would find themselves at a competetive disadvantage in world trade because of the costs the curbs will impose on industry.</p>
        <p>This year's United Nations General Assembly is expected to approve a resolution next month setting up a negotiating body to draft a climate-stablization treaty for approval by the second World Environment Conference, which is to meet in Brazil in 1992. 'Common Sense and Leadership'</p>
        <p>But the speeches made so far in the General Assembly suggest that the negotiations will be difficult, with third-world countries demanding increased aid and access to Western technology in return for meeting a global challenge they say is caused by their own poverty and overconsumption by the industrialized world.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher's address, which was devoted entirely to global warming, was welcomed by members of the National Governors Association Task Force on Global Warming, a group of American state governors that held its first meeting at the United Nations today.</p>
        <p>The group's chairman, Gov. James R. Thompson of Ilinois, described her address as ''elegant, straightforward and full of common sense and leadership.''</p>
        <p>Several governors criticized President Bush for joining with the Soviet Union and Japan in vetoing an attempt to set timetables for reducing carbon-dioxide emissions at a 68-nation international environmental conference in Holland earlier this week. Call for More Scientific Study</p>
        <p>''I would have preferred the President to manifest the leadership of this nation on that occasion,'' Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said at a news conference after the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher warned that limiting emissions of such gasses as carbon dioxide will be particularly difficult because it involves restricting consumption of oil and other fossil fuels and planting new forests.</p>
        <p>Many scientists predict that if emissions of heat-trapping gasses, sometimes called ''greenhouse gasses'' continue at present rates, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by about 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century, a faster rate of change than occured at the end of the Ice Ages. That could cause droughts and severe storms in some regions of the world, turning farm lands arid and leading to severe flooding in low-lying areas.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Thatcher left no doubt about her own concern over global warming, she also stressed that more scientific study is needed before the international community decides precisely what steps should be taken to halt it.</p>
        <p>''The mesures we take must be based on sound scientific analysis of the effect of the different gasses and the ways in which they can be reduced,'' she said. ''In the past, there has been a tendancy to solve one problem at the expense of making others worse.'' Dangers Seen by Third World</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher said the world should wait for an international scientific panel to submit its report on global warming next summer before making detailed plans for action.</p>
        <p>In their speeches to the General Assembly, representatives of third-world countries have stressed that pollution of the atmosphere and other environmental dangers stem mainly from the industrialized world's high standard of living and wasteful consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Overgrazing, the destruction of forests and the spread of deserts is occuring in many third-world countries. But third world speakers argue that that is mainly a reflection of their poverty and underdevelopment, which they say is being aggravated by the economic policies of the West.</p>
        <p>They argue that if the industrialized countries want to protect the environment, they must help poor countries to pay the costs involved and to take steps to speed up their economic development.</p>
