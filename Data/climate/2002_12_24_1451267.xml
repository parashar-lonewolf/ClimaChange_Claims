      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For more than a year, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman diligently prepared for a campaign for president that might never begin.</p>
        <p>He delivered 11 policy speeches and published them in a pamphlet. He talked endlessly to friends and supporters and gave television interviews offering his views of world affairs. He played host to quiet dinners and receptions for Democratic strategists looking for a presidential campaign to ride, asking them to be ready -- just in case.</p>
        <p>Just in case came in the form of a text message Mr. Lieberman received a week ago Sunday on his BlackBerry pocket pager from Al Gore saying that he would not be running for president again in 2004. Mr. Lieberman had long said he would not run if Mr. Gore did.</p>
        <p>Now, in an instant, what had had the potential of being a mock exercise in presidential campaign planning became the almost certain candidacy of the man looking to inherit Mr. Gore's mantle, ''but without the baggage,'' as one adviser put it.</p>
        <p>Already, Mr. Lieberman benefits from a celebrity that exceeds that of his potential competitors: reporters and camera crews were lined up two-deep against a wall outside his Senate office the day after Mr. Gore disclosed his decision.</p>
        <p>This genial and generally well-regarded Democrat from Connecticut, who came within 537 votes of becoming vice president of the United States, enjoys the goodwill of many members of his party, including Gore supporters who took note of how Mr. Lieberman deferred his own candidacy to await Mr. Gore's decision -- and who now welcome the idea of Mr. Gore's No. 2 taking off on his own.</p>
        <p>''The president came to Washington saying he was going to change the tone,'' Mr. Lieberman said in an interview the other day, laying out part of the foundation of his likely challenge to Mr. Bush. ''But I think this place is as partisan -- more partisan -- than it was before. Though he campaigned as a moderate, seeming moderate, he really has governed much more from the right, particularly in areas like environment and public health care matters like stem cell research. These are critical differences that whomever becomes the Democratic candidate has to carry directly to the administration.''</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Lieberman prepares to try to move from No. 2 to No. 1 on the presidential ticket, some Democrats question the political plausibility of a three-term senator who does not quite fit the mold of the recent Democratic presidential candidates, and who acknowledges that he would not be where he is today were it not for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Had I not run for vice president in 2000, I might be thinking of running for president in 2004,'' Mr. Lieberman said with a laugh. ''But my prospects would have been much less plausible, in all honesty.''</p>
        <p>He is arguably the most conservative of the prospective Democratic candidates, particularly on defense and national security issues; his Senate office telephone system plays military marches to callers when they are put on hold. If recent history is any guide, the perception of Mr. Lieberman as a conservative Democrat could prove to be a disadvantage in a Democratic presidential contest that tends to draw voters from the left side of the scale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who is an Orthodox Jew, is promising a campaign that would place more emphasis on values and spirituality than Democratic primary voters are accustomed to hearing. Democrats inside and outside the Lieberman camp suggest that could feed the perception of Mr. Lieberman as cloyingly sanctimonious, a view his allies say he needs to guard against.</p>
        <p>In a business that is not known for cordiality, there is reason to wonder if Mr. Lieberman, the son of a Stamford liquor store-owner, might ultimately provide proof of that old adage about nice guys and where they finish.</p>
        <p>''I guess I should be happy that the worst thing they can say about you is you have no enemies, but . . . '' Mr. Lieberman stopped and shifted in his chair, his hands crossed as he sat in his spartan seventh floor office on Capitol Hill. ''Of course I do have enemies. Perhaps it's about this: I'm not a screamer. I've been raised to treat people with respect. But the fact that I may speak softly more often than not doesn't mean that I don't carry a big stick.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats said Mr. Lieberman was, by temperament and philosophy because of his centrist appeals, the ideal candidate to put up against a Republican president who has been aggressively trying to win defectors from the Democratic base.</p>
        <p>''The issues that he would naturally run on are exactly the issues that the Democrats have to be able to retake in order to win the presidency,'' said Al From, the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council, the organization of moderate Democrats that helped elect Bill Clinton and is likely to rally around a Lieberman candidacy. ''He will be strong with national security -- and we have to deal with our security gap. He has strength on values. He has growth-oriented economics.''</p>
        <p>But other influential Democrats, who want to draw sharper contrasts with the Republicans, expressed concerns about Mr. Lieberman's fortitude and his ideological positions.</p>
        <p>''I think Joe Lieberman is a good man who has worked very hard for our country, but I don't see him having a lead on getting the nomination -- and I think it will be a tough fight,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm, the leader of the Texas Democratic Party. ''Some may see him as not being tough enough and there will be some who don't agree with what he stands for.</p>
        <p>''What Democrats are going to be looking for in this election is somebody who stands very firmly on Democratic principles and are able to articulate a clear message separating us from Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who is 60 years old, disputed that the party nomination inevitably goes to the candidate on the left of the field, pointing to the success of Mr. Clinton in 1992. He argued that the party needed to rethink what its candidates stand for -- starting off by taking clear and firm stands on the issues of national security and foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>''I think the party is open to a different kind of Democrat,'' he said. Mr. Lieberman said that while he ''may be more conservative, more pro-defense, more pro-security than a lot of Democrats are,'' for the most part, he was ''in tune with the mainstream of my party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman sponsored the Homeland Security Act, and was at Mr. Bush's side last fall as he pushed through a Congressional resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. By noting that he had also voted in favor of the first resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, in 1991, Mr. Lieberman drew an unstated contrast with other Democrats in the race like Representative Richard A. Gephardt and Senator John Kerry, who opposed that resolution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has also been one of the leading Congressional advocates against excessive violence and sex in the entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman also once seemed to be receptive to allowing Americans to put some of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts, a stand that set him apart from the mainstream of his party. ''There was a time when I was intrigued by it, five or six years ago,'' he said. ''And I spent some time meeting with people about it, and I concluded that it was a bad idea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman would be the first Jewish major-party nominee for president. It is a distinction that does not appear to worry him.</p>
        <p>He said his experience of 2000 convinced him that it might not be the handicap that some Democrats feared. He said he had not encountered a single instance of anti-Semitism while campaigning in 2000.</p>
        <p>''I'm not getting back into whether we won or not, but the fact is that Al and I got more votes than any ticket in the history of any party except Reagan in '84,'' he said. ''At least from those numbers, it's clear it didn't hurt.''</p>
        <p>But even some of Mr. Lieberman's supporters said they were concerned that the notion of a Jewish president, at a time when parts of the Muslim world are showing increasing hostility to United States policy, could be unsettling to some voters. Some Democrats sympathetic to Mr. Lieberman questioned whether he was prepared for the extent to which his Judaism could become a subject of discussion.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Lieberman paused momentarily when asked whether there would be a Christmas tree in a Lieberman White House. ''I think, because the White House is a national home, it certainly would,' he said. ''It's a symbol.''</p>
        <p>Other Democrats suggested that the very fact that Mr. Lieberman is devoutly religious could turn into a political plus and prove the most distinctive element of a Lieberman candidacy.</p>
        <p>''Part of our problems as Democrats is we've allowed the Republicans to capture the values debate, because we're nervous about talking about faith as a source of values,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''I'm probably going to talk more, not less, of that language.''</p>
