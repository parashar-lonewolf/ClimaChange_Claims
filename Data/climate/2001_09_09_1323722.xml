        <p>NOTICE the common thread running through these three tales?</p>
        <p>*The Starbucks Corporation, responding to concerns that growing coffee caused rain-forest carnage, spends some $200,000 to help Mexican farmers improve the quality of beans grown under a forest canopy. ''We weren't sure they'd ever grow beans we would sell,'' said Orin C. Smith, the company's chief executive. In fact, the premium-priced coffee produced by the Mexicans turns out to be so tasty, and is selling so well in the United States, that Starbucks is introducing it overseas and to institutional customers. It has increased its order for Mexican shade-grown beans tenfold since the program began in late 1998 and is negotiating with shade-growers in four other countries. ''We risked this for the environmental benefits, but it now has potential to be a really profitable product,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>

        <p>NOTICE the common thread running through these three tales?</p>
        <p>*The Starbucks Corporation, responding to concerns that growing coffee caused rain-forest carnage, spends some $200,000 to help Mexican farmers improve the quality of beans grown under a forest canopy. ''We weren't sure they'd ever grow beans we would sell,'' said Orin C. Smith, the company's chief executive. In fact, the premium-priced coffee produced by the Mexicans turns out to be so tasty, and is selling so well in the United States, that Starbucks is introducing it overseas and to institutional customers. It has increased its order for Mexican shade-grown beans tenfold since the program began in late 1998 and is negotiating with shade-growers in four other countries. ''We risked this for the environmental benefits, but it now has potential to be a really profitable product,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>*At the fervent request of local environmentalists, the Chesapeake, Va., plant of Nova Chemicals sets aside 11.5 of its 60 acres for a habitat that Van White, the plant's environmental affairs manager, calls a ''bed and breakfast'' for migratory birds and other wildlife. The one-time cost is about $8,000 to plant 24 species of trees and fruit-bearing shrubs. The unanticipated yearly savings is $16,000. ''Turns out, that's what we'd been paying to mow those 11.5 acres,'' Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>*Managers of the Los Angeles International Airport, which dumps 19,000 tons of food waste each year, figured that California regulators would soon restrict the practice. So they set up a pilot program with the sewage and utility plants next door. First, the airport grinds up the food scraps. Then the sewage plant puts them through its huge digesters and sends the resulting methane gas back to the utility. ''It looks like we'll not only meet future regulations, but we'll save $12 a ton in disposal and get $18 a ton for the energy,'' said Louise Riggen, the airport's recycling coordinator. The yield may be even better: the digesters will also turn out reusable water, a precious commodity in California, and a nutrient-rich sludge that can be sold as fertilizer.</p>
        <p>The pattern? All these projects were undertaken with only environmental goals in mind, yet they also yielded unexpected savings or revenue streams.</p>
        <p>''The notion that environment is just an expensive cost is way out of date,'' said Glenn T. Prickett, executive director of the Center for Environmental Leadership in Business, a unit of Conservation International created with money from the Ford Motor Company. Mr. Prickett's group worked with Starbucks on the shade-grown coffee project; has helped the Mobil Corporation protect a rain forest while it explored for oil in Peru; and aided Asarco, a mining company, in safeguarding wetlands when it searched for gold in French Guiana.</p>
        <p>By now, some 30 years after the environmental movement took hold, many companies are giving second lives to raw materials, fuels and other products that previously went to landfills. Water from their process cooling systems is being used to heat and cool their plants. Fly ash and other pollutants scrubbed from the air often show up in concrete and highway asphalt. Once-disposable cameras are being refurbished for reuse. And makers of deodorants, toothpastes and cold medicines have all but dispensed with cardboard shells for tubes and bottles, reducing paper waste -- and package costs.</p>
        <p>But those kinds of projects represent the easy pickings of environmentalism. Today, companies have to do much more. They are often required by law to pull gases from air and materials from water and trash that they never had dreamed would be on any list of environmental problems.</p>
        <p>The landfills that have been accepting the nonrecycled wastes, meanwhile, are growing saturated, while dumps where hazardous substances were supposed to find a safe resting place are springing leaks. Gases that were once thought innocuous, like carbon dioxide, are among the greenhouse gases that may contribute to global warming, while others, like the so-called volatile organic compounds found in solvent and paint fumes, have been implicated in depleting the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Societal demands have changed, too. Previously, communities were  satisfied when companies simply complied with regulations. Today, they want them to set aside wilderness areas, clean up rivers that they never had a hand in soiling and be far more squeaky-clean than the government insists. And companies are loath to fight back.</p>
        <p>''When you reduce waste and emissions, a community is a lot more willing to issue permits for other operations down the road,'' said Samuel L. Smolik, vice president for global environment, health and safety at the Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Mich.</p>
        <p>Most companies assume that they are already using the least expensive materials and most cost-effective processes. They also assume that solving the latest crop of environmental headaches will cost them plenty. So discovering that the answers to environmental demands can shift to the profit side of the ledger is a big financial surprise.</p>
        <p>''When they substitute chemicals or processes, they often have to put in expensive equipment, retrain workers, do lots of costly things,'' said Gaytha A. Langlois, professor of ecology at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I. ''But then they find that the new equipment or process really is more efficient and that there are all kinds of savings to be had.''</p>
        <p>EXAMPLES abound. Everyone talks about dreaded holes in the ozone layer -- but the fear is even greater for plant managers who find that some of the chemicals with jaw-breaking names that they have used for years may be making those holes wider. Until last year, the Roanoke, Va., factory of ITT Industries, a diversified manufacturer, used an inert, nontoxic compressed gas called sulfur hexafluoride to test tubes used in the night-vision devices it makes for the military. Then Usha Wright, ITT's director for environment, safety and health, put sulfur hexafluoride on a list of ozone-depleting gases that she insisted the plants eliminate.</p>
        <p>Its hand forced, the Roanoke plant started trying other gases instead. It  settled on nitrogen, which worked as well, did not deplete ozone and cost $500,000 a year less to buy and to handle. Ms. Wright said many other ITT plants had received similarly pleasant surprises from other environmentally inspired substitutions.</p>
        <p>''We haven't tallied up the numbers, because we did not include cost reductions as a goal,'' she said. ''But it looks like a lot of plants are going to realize overall savings.''</p>
        <p>FOR some companies, the benefits come not only in savings but also in sales. You know those thin slabs of wallboard that are increasingly used instead of plaster in building new homes? There is a chance that they started out as scrubber waste.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public power utility, switched to new air pollution control equipment that, although much more expensive, yielded powdery residues instead of the gooey ones produced by its old equipment. The T.V.A.'s aim was to end up with a substance that would be easier for its on-site landfill to handle.</p>
        <p>The results have been much better than that. The utility now sells the 1.2 million tons of the powder, calcium sulfate, that it generates annually to  a company called Synthetic Materials, which turns it into gypsum, the main ingredient in wallboard. Most of it is bought by Temple-Inland, a wallboard manufacturer that has set up shop at the T.V.A.'s largest plant, in Cumberland City, Tenn. Synthetic Materials sells the rest on the open market. When gypsum supply exceeds demand, the T.V.A. dumps the powder on the landfill; when demand exceeds supply, Synthetic Materials dips into the landfill for more.</p>
        <p>Cherie Miller, the T.V.A.'s byproduct specialist -- a title created just 11 months ago -- said the arrangement added $3 million to the T.V.A.'s coffers last year. That is on top of the $5 million or so that the T.V.A. has been gleaning from selling other wastes  like fly ash, for use in concrete, and boiler slag, for use in abrasives. ''Marketing byproducts has really become a profit center here,'' Ms. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere as well. Several other utility plants, including the Palatka, Fla., operations of the Seminole Electric Cooperative and a Shippingport, Pa., plant of FirstEnergy are selling gypsum for wallboard, too.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, a little bit of internal sleuthing can turn a company into its best customer for its own waste.</p>
        <p>Last year, an alert waste-plant operator at Textron's Bell Helicopter unit in Fort Worth, looking for ways to reduce the amount of messy sludge left over when Bell cleaned up its process water, noticed that the sludge always seemed to be a lot lighter in color than he would have expected.</p>
        <p>He guessed -- correctly -- that a lot of magnesium hydroxide, a pure white powder that Bell used for electroplating, was moving through the process unused. So Bell conducted tests and found that it could pump the sludge back into its electroplating process three or four times before it needed to be dumped. Bell saved $100,000 last year just by dumping less sludge and buying less magnesium hydroxide.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to stop landfilling hundreds of tons of sludge, but we wound up solving an internal inefficiency,'' said Donald L. Legg, Bell's director for environmental and industrial safety.</p>
        <p>WITH a variety of forces putting ever more pressure on them to clean up their acts, companies might well hope that their environmental projects yield many more such hidden bounties.</p>
        <p>So-called socially conscious investing has been growing in popularity in recent years, as more investors include environmental performance as a factor in picking stocks. And many companies -- Procter &amp; Gamble is a notable example -- use such performance as a criterion in choosing suppliers. Banks are taking potential  environmental liabilities into closer account when they decide whether to make loans. Insurers, too, are insisting that companies prove that they are running clean shops before they issue policies covering environmental accidents.</p>
        <p>And some customers are pushing their own environmental problems into their suppliers' court. A couple of years ago, customers of the Xerox Corporation started asking the company to help them dispose of excess toner from their Xerox machines. Customers for the most expensive copiers had the influence to make that request more of an order -- a pretty tall order.</p>
        <p>''It was costing us half a million a year just to collect and transport the stuff,'' said Jack C. Azar, vice president for environment, health and safety. So Xerox's chemists spent a hefty chunk of their research budget to learn to incorporate the toner waste into new toner. The company still has to pay for collection and transportation, but it is saving about $800,000 a year on new toners for expensive machines. This year, Xerox will expand the recycling program to toner waste for less-expensive copiers.</p>
        <p>The Internet is also making corporations more sensitive to environmental issues. ''Environmental groups have become truly sophisticated in using the Web to move information to millions of people literally overnight, and to attack companies on a global scale,'' said Carol M. Browner, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>For example, Greenpeace wanted the Coca-Cola Company to stop using hydrofluorocarbons, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, as a refrigerant in Coke machines. During the Olympic Games in Sydney last year, the Australian chapter of Greenpeace put sticker designs on its Web site that showed polar bears on melting ice caps, and encouraged site visitors to download them and plaster them on Coke machines. Many did so -- and sure enough, Coke soon announced it would phase out use of the gas. Coke has always said it planned to do so anyway, ''but Greenpeace really gave them an awful time,'' Ms. Browner recalled.</p>
        <p>The switch to a Republican administration in Washington may spur many more such attacks. Many environmentalists worry that their issues now have low priority in the federal government, notwithstanding the E.P.A.'s recent decision to force General Electric to dredge the Hudson River for P.C.B.'s, or polychlorinated biphenyls. Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. administrator, declined to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>''The environmental movement was deflated in the 90's because people thought Bill Clinton was an environmental president,'' said Andrew J. Hoffman, assistant professor of management at the Boston University School of Management, who has written about corporate environmental activity. ''It's being ignited again in opposition to George W. Bush.''</p>
        <p>Alan Metrick, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that 100,000 more people had joined his group since Mr. Bush was inaugurated.</p>
        <p>''Americans feel this government will not protect their air and water, and they are energized to a degree we haven't seen in years,'' Mr. Metrick said. ''We now have more than half a million members, and that means more funds to take on more cases.''</p>
        <p>But those are not necessarily fighting words. Few executives today dismiss environmentalists as hippie tree-huggers, as they might have during the 1970's. And fewer environmentalists view business executives as the devil incarnate. Companies and environmentalists are now as likely to be partners as adversaries.</p>
        <p>Starbucks gives Conservation International equal credit for the shade-grown coffee project. The Natural Resources Defense Council worked closely with Dow Chemical to reduce pollution at Dow plants in Midland and has offered its services to other companies. (So far, to Mr. Metrick's dismay, there have been no takers.) The Alliance for Environmental Innovation, a unit of the better-known Environmental Defense, helped McDonald's figure out a replacement for its much-criticized polystyrene clamshell packaging in the mid-1990's and more recently helped United Parcel Service develop a reusable overnight mailer.</p>
        <p>Advocacy groups have learned to incorporate the corporate focus on profits into their environmental pitches. The Alliance for Environmental Innovation persuaded Federal Express to promise carmakers that it would buy more fuel-efficient, cleaner-driving trucks, even if they cost a little more.</p>
        <p>''We realize that the auto companies need committed customers to justify what will probably be a very expensive R &amp; D project,'' said Gwen Ruta, the director of the alliance.</p>
        <p>Many companies are reaping the benefits of environmental projects that they started in the 90's, when regulatory scrutiny seemed more intense, and when the booming economy made potentially costly projects more palatable.</p>
        <p>Consider Corning Inc. Its plant in Canton, N.Y., which makes super-pure glass used in manufacturing computer chips, was within the legal limits set by New York State for emissions of hydrochloric acid, but company executives figured that the state would soon tighten the rules. So, in 1999, the plant started making a chlorine-free glass.</p>
        <p>The new glass-making chemicals are no panacea -- for example, they freeze at 60 degrees Fahrenheit, in a city where winter temperatures can plunge to 30 below. ''Researching it, trucking it in, building new storage bins and handling equipment -- it cost well over $5 million, and frankly we didn't enjoy doing it,'' said Raymond F. Leinen, manager of Corning's semiconductor materials business.</p>
        <p>They are, however, enjoying the results. Glass samples that Corning has been monitoring for more than a year remain free of distortion; the chlorinated glass would have warped slightly by now.</p>
        <p>Corning hopes that the improvement will help the company gain market share. ''We won't raise the price of the new glass, but this subtle property may well get more semiconductor companies to buy it,'' Mr. Leinen said.</p>
        <p>Sikorsky Aircraft, too, may be getting some new bragging rights from an environmentally induced product change. Last year, Sikorsky, a unit of United Technologies, switched to a new kind of paint for its helicopters, because the old one was sending ozone-depleting fumes up its factory stacks. The change cost a bit in retooling -- but, it turns out, the new paint can be applied with a thinner coating. That means that less paint is used, and that the finished helicopter weighs less -- a fact that Sikorsky is trumpeting to military and commercial customers alike. ''Saving even an ounce on a helicopter is a big deal,'' said Leslie Carothers, vice president for environment, health and safety at United Technologies.</p>
        <p>But even as the environmental pressure on companies heats up, the number of surprising benefits from environmental programs may dwindle. That is because more and more companies are installing formal programs to ferret out savings at the outset.</p>
        <p>Dow Chemical now routinely applies complex statistical analysis to environmental projects to ensure that its businesses are wresting the maximum economic benefits from meeting the company's anti-pollution goals. Dow has even assigned dollar amounts to intangible benefits like community good will or employee satisfaction, then plugs those numbers into its formulas for evaluating environmental projects.</p>
        <p>''Historically, projects were discussed in either the language of economic value or of environmental performance, but we've figured out how to translate from one language to the other,'' said Mr. Smolik of Dow.</p>
        <p>Often, corporate environmental officials are using such translation to persuade plant managers that profit, not environmental benefit, is the primary goal even when it is not. For instance, in March, William Blackburn, vice president for environment, health and safety at Baxter International, the medical products maker in Deerfield, Ill., pulled together a group of purchasing and engineering people to discuss ways  to reduce energy use. They are now exploring several.</p>
        <p>''My goal was to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the only greenhouse gas we emit,'' he said. But he recognized that managers with bottom-line responsibilities would be more attracted to cheaper energy bills. ''Environment is heart and economics is head, and to motivate everyone, you need to combine the two.''</p>
        <p>INDEED, Mr. Blackburn has used that psychology to persuade profit-oriented plant managers to revisit environmental problems that they had thought were solved. To  incinerate blood plasma waste at a plant in Austria, Baxter had been spending $70,000 a year -- not a particularly painful hit to the bottom line. Still, at Mr. Blackburn's urging, the plant ''asked some local professors to look at this stuff and get creative.'' The professors figured out how to turn the waste into fuel and fertilizer, which the university now uses. The project cost Baxter $350,000, but it cut disposal costs to zero.</p>
        <p>''There's a real interplay between environmental and financial motives,'' Mr. Blackburn said, ''and we're pushing that idea across the entire company.''</p>
