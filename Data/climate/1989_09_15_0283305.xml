        <p>LEAD: In an effort to harness the power of computers to the problem of dirty air, California officials voted yesterday to require new automobiles to carry better computers that will continuously monitor 10 pollution control systems and diagnose malfunctions.</p>
        <p>In an effort to harness the power of computers to the problem of dirty air, California officials voted yesterday to require new automobiles to carry better computers that will continuously monitor 10 pollution control systems and diagnose malfunctions.</p>
        <p>The regulations will take effect in California in 1994 and are likely to be adopted to cover new cars in eight Northeastern states as well. New York, New Jersey and the New England states announced last month that they intended to adopt California's anti-pollution standards. The eight Northeastern states, plus California, make up 30 percent of the national car market.</p>
        <p>While the cost of the computer chips used in cars, consumer appliances and other equipment is falling, the California requirement would also make automakers install more sensors, raising costs. The staff of the California Air Resources Board estimated the cost at $45 per car, but the Chrysler Corporation said it could be $245, partly because the company would have to add a second computer chip to each vehicle. Emphasis on Road Performance</p>
        <p>The regulations reflect a growing emphasis on the state of cars on the road, not at the factory gate. The computers are an aid to assure that as cars age, their emission systems are not allowed to wear out.</p>
        <p>Many states already require tailpipe tests as a condition of re-registration, and experts say the test on the new computer could replace that, or be an adjunct. In California, a check of the information in the computer would be part of the inspection before a car's registration could be renewed.</p>
        <p>The Air Resources Board voted 7 to 0 yesterday to approve the new rules, after seven hours of testimony, much of it from auto manufacturers seeking a delay. William Sessa, a spokesman for the board, said the supporters included the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which he said was using the California rules as a standard for developing nationwide rules of its own, and Porsche Cars North America Inc., the subsidiary of the West German car maker, which believes that the rule could be the basis for a wordwide standard.</p>
        <p>The board hopes that the rules will simplify the job of mechanics in figuring out why a car is not running cleanly. The computer would store ''trouble codes'' like those that photocopiers or other electronic equipment display to guide a technician to the source of a problem. A technician would retrieve the data by attaching a standard cable to a receptacle under the car's dashboard. Manufacturers' Opposition</p>
        <p>The regulations would cover light-duty trucks and some heavier vehicles as well as passenger cars.</p>
        <p>The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association opposed the requirements as too specific. ''What concerns us is being dictated to in a regulation on how we decide whether or not some piece of equipment is operating properly,'' said Dr. Fred W. Bowditch, vice president of the association's technical affairs division. ''There may be other ways of measuring a temperature, or we might rather measure pressure, or some other aspect of how this particular component works.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bowditch said the technical problems did not seem insurmountable, though some sensors that would be required have not been demonstrated in a working car and the durability of others is unproven.</p>
        <p>Some automotive groups like the idea of computer monitors. ''Anything that makes it easier for the independent repair shops to diagnose and treat, as it were, car difficulties, we're in favor of,'' said James J. Conner, executive vice president of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents parts makers. ''It should lower repair costs, as a function of reduced time required to diagnose.'' Computers for Car Diagnoses</p>
        <p>But Mr. Conner said the new computer might only represent a clue. ''It might tell you only that the injectors are not putting out enough fuel, but it won't tell you the cause,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Most cars already carry less sophisticated computers. Some car dealers can retrieve data from those computers and pass it to a larger computer maintained by the manufacturer that will suggest where the problem lies.</p>
        <p>Auto repair shops already use their own computers to diagnose car problems, but the California Air Resources Board reasoned that ''the primary benefit of an on-board device is the ability to monitor the engine control system under actual driving conditions.''</p>
        <p>It adds: ''This permits identificaiton of malfunctions which oftentimes will not be detected under engine operating modes possible in a repair shop.''</p>
        <p>In addition, under the proposal approved yesterday, ''These systems promote the use of more durable emission-related components since manufacturers do not want the malfunction light illuminating frequently throughout the vehicle life, which would be a source of aggravation to the owner.''</p>
        <p>The new requirement puts California on three tracks toward cleaner air. Earlier this year, state officials approved a plan to phase out gasoline-powered cars in Southern California. And on the first of this month, ARCO, the state's biggest gasoline retailer began selling a fuel designed to make old cars run cleaner and said it is working on a formulation to accomplish the same thing in newer cars. And Under the Hood . . .  The California rules will require monitoring in several under-the-hood systems that were not previously covered. One is the level of chlorofluorocarbon coolant in the air conditioner. Leaks of that coolant are contributing to the destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Another test would be for engine misfiring, or skipping, which dumps unburned fuel into the air and is a source of pollution. The unburned fuel also passes through the catalytic converter, which it can damage.</p>
        <p>The computer would also track the converter's performance.</p>
        <p>Another anti-pollution device that the computer would track is the canister purge system. As gasoline evaporates, it releases polluting fumes, and California cars have canisters to capture the fumes and dump them into the engine when the car is running. But deteriorating hoses or other failures can make the canister useless.</p>
        <p>The new computer would also keep closer watch on five systems that are tracked by computers in cars today. These include the exhaust-gas recirculation system, which pumps some of the exhaust into the air intake for a second trip through the engine, to assure a fuller burning. It may recirculate too much gas or too little.</p>
        <p>The authors of the new program said the computer would detect a degree of engine misfiring too small to be noticed by the driver but that could make a car emit double or triple the legal limit on some pollutants.</p>
        <p>The new computers would be designed to be tamper-proof. The staff of the California Air Resources board noted that ''some manufacturers of aftermarket performance parts have been selling computer chips which can be easily installed in some computers.''</p>
        <p>''These chips alter the emission control system calibration,'' it said, ''and in some cases disable emission-control equipment.''</p>
        <p>The new regulations represent the second round of applying on-board computer technology to emissions control. California's first standards were issued in 1985 and took effect with the 1988 model year.</p>
        <p>But the number of systems and the degree of control was limited then, because of technological constraints, the staff of the board said.</p>
        <p>The first round of rules covered gasoline-powered vehicles, but the new regulations will also cover those that run on methanol or other alternative fuels, ''thus maintaining their superior emission benefits throughout the vehicle's useful life,'' the board's staff said.</p>
