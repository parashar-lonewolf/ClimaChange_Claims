        <p>PROFITING FROM ID THEFT -- Fear of identity theft has helped give rise to a nearly billion-dollar business in credit monitoring services sold by the major credit bureaus, direct marketers and banks. Some say the services are oversold. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>SUPPORT FOR EMISSIONS CONTROLS -- James E. Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, a coal-burning utility in the Midwest and the Southeast, has emerged as an unexpected advocate of federal regulation that would for the first time impose a cost for emitting carbon dioxide. The stance by Mr. Rogers, above, is far from universal in the power industry, but it has surprising support, particularly from those who, like him, also produce electricity from carbon-free nuclear reactors. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A QUESTION OF OBJECTIVITY -- Newly disclosed documents relating to a public utility rate case brought by customers of Portland General Electric open a rare window into the internal workings of the corporate credit rating business, raising questions about the independence and integrity of rating services whose reports are relied upon by millions of investors in choosing stocks and bonds. [C1.]</p>
        <p>RULES TRIP UP ARMS MAKERS -- Arms makers who export to the United States are in a squeeze because of a complex set of rules that govern who can work on military projects for the United States government. [C1.]</p>
        <p>CHINA PRESSED ON PIRACY -- In a rebuke to China on the eve of a high-level visit by American officials, the Bush administration formally accused Chinese leaders of failing to meet commitments to open the nation's economy and crack down on piracy of foreign goods. [C1.]</p>
        <p>MEDICARE PAY, WITH INCENTIVES -- Doctors who had been fearing a pay cut under Medicare instead got a small bonus from Congress, with strings attached. To get the money, doctors will have to report how often they provide quality care, as defined by the government. [A27.]</p>
        <p>A BAN ON BILLBOARDS -- Come the new year, São Paulo, a city of 11 million, plans to prohibit outdoor advertising like billboards. [A4.]</p>
        <p>WATER BILLS UNCOLLECTABLE -- For years, New York City has failed to collect on millions of dollars in overdue water bills because its records are so riddled with factual errors and outdated information that pursuing deadbeats and delinquents has become virtually impossible. [A1.]</p>
        <p>FUND OFFERS RIVAL BOARD SLATE -- A hedge fund run by Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that it would nominate a slate of directors to oppose incumbents at its largest holding, the restaurant chain Applebee's International. [C4.]</p>
        <p>E.P.A. REVISES MILEAGE MATH -- The Environmental Protection Agency is changing the formula for calculating miles-per-gallon numbers on the window stickers of new cars, to take account of higher speeds, more aggressive driving, more air-conditioning use and other factors. [C4.]</p>
        <p>DP WORLD SELLS U.S. HOLDINGS -- Dubai's giant port company, DP World, sold off its United States holdings to the American International Group, bringing to an end a contentious deal that left a bitter taste for Middle East investors. [C4.]</p>
        <p>RETIREMENT OF AN AD MAGNATE -- An era in advertising will end Dec. 31 when Edward H. Meyer -- known as the Rupert Murdoch or Sumner Redstone of Madison Avenue -- plans to do something that neither media mogul has done: retire. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C6.]</p>
        <p>SHAKE-UP AT CITIGROUP -- Citigroup investors got the management shakeup they had been waiting for, as Robert Druskin, the head of its corporate and investment bank, was named chief operating officer, filling a role that has been vacant since Robert B. Willumstad left in July 2005. Market Place. [C1.]</p>
        <p>SHARES ADVANCE ON DEALS -- Wall Street extended its advance as investors digested new takeover developments and placed bets ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. [C10.]</p>

        <p>TEXAS INSTRUMENTS, the maker of semiconductors for mobile phones, cut its forecast for fourth-quarter sales and profit because of lower revenue from handsets. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
        <p>JEFFREY K. SKILLING, the former Enron chief executive sentenced to 24 years in prison for his role in the fraud that destroyed the company, won a last-minute delay of his sentence, which was to begin today. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
        <p>TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, maker of the Grand Theft Auto video games, said that it improperly dated stock options for as long as nine years. Also, the board of Sunrise Senior Living, operator of homes for the elderly, appointed a committee to review its stock options practices and stock sales by directors and executives. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
        <p>THE FORMER CHIEF FINANCIAL officer of U.S. Foodservice, Michael J. Resnick, was sentenced to three years' probation after pleading guilty to manipulating entries in U.S. Foodservice's books to help the food distribution unit meet quarterly profit targets. The company is a unit of the Dutch retailer, Ahold. (REUTERS)</p>
