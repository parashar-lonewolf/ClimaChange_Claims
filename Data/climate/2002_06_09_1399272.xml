        <p>Letter by James Gustave Speth, dean of Yale's environmental studies school and former head of UN Development Program, on global warming scorns defenders of business-as-usual, and marvels that Bush administration has collapsed years of evasions into half a presidential term (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I tell my students that the defenders of business-as-usual on climate change began telling us 20 years ago that concern about global warming was not scientifically justified. Then, a decade ago, they said yes, concern is justified, but we have ample time to prevent it. Now, a decade later, they are saying it is too late to prevent major climate change, and we have no choice but to adapt to it (front page, June 3).</p>

        <p>Remarkably, the Bush administration has collapsed this string of evasions into half a presidential term. Here is the truth of the matter: there is no way that societies will be able to adapt to the climate change that will occur in this century unless we get serious now about prevention.</p>
