        <p>THERE was Christie Whitman, canoeing down a pristine stream in the interior of New Jersey. This was not a tourism advertisement, but rather a back-to-nature touch strategically inserted into the governor's State of the State address several weeks ago.</p>
        <p>And this was not just any governor, but the woman who had just been chosen  by President-elect Bush to head the nation's Environmental Protection Agency. As the state's own Senator Robert G. Torricelli put it, ''There are few training grounds that could better prepare someone for this position than the governor of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>But as Mrs. Whitman begins her new career, there is some debate over the depth of her concern for the environment. Her efforts to preserve open space and to protect the coastline have received high marks from nearly every environmental group. But the governor's overall record -- particularly in her first term, when ''open for business'' was a campaign theme -- has another side. Faced with a deep economic slump, Mrs. Whitman took office pledging to slash not only taxes but regulations that stood in the way of business.</p>
        <p>''She is certainly good on open space,'' said Edward Lloyd, a professor at Columbia University Law School and a former director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic. ''That is what she is best known for in the environmental area. On the regulatory side, there is a very different story to tell.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in her last address as governor, Mrs. Whitman cited her program to protect a million acres of woods and farmland from development, and used the speech to unveil a new effort to improve state parks.</p>
        <p>''Even as the state has been growing, our air and water are cleaner, with fewer days of high ozone and carbon monoxide and far fewer beach closings,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''All policy is personal, and for me few policies are more personal than our efforts to preserve open space in the Garden State. Raised on a farm, I want every New Jersey child now and in the future to enjoy the character of the state that I have always loved.''</p>
        <p>The reality is far more complex.</p>
        <p>For instance, the State Department of Environmental Protection was one of Governor Whitman's first targets. She clearly intended to shift the organization and philosophy of an agency long viewed as an enemy of business and developers. In her first budget, Mrs. Whitman cut more than 200 positions from the department, an action that included transferring the Board of Public Utilities to the  Treasury Department.</p>
        <p>When environmental groups and public employee unions strenuously protested, the governor was unmoved, saying increased regulation was not the best way to get a cleaner environment.</p>
        <p>The cuts Mrs. Whitman proposed for later budgets were so deep that they drew opposition from her own party. In May 1996, some state senators including John O. Bennett, the majority leader from Little Silver, said Republicans would oppose the governor's budget unless she restored money for environmental programs.</p>
        <p>''The proposed budget would require dramatic reductions in scientific, technical and human resources,'' Senator Bennett and six other senators wrote in a letter to the governor. ''We feel strongly that the proposed layoffs of D.E.P. personnel will negatively impact the department's ability to effectively safeguard the environment and protect public health.''</p>
        <p>In subsequent years, Mrs. Whitman restored much of the agency's financing -- though her budget allocations did not reach the 1994 level until the fiscal year 2000.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Eileen McGinnis, the governor's chief of policy and planning, said that although some of Mrs. Whitman's policies in her first term were a response to the state's economic problems, the changes at the Department of Environmental Protection were not among them.</p>
        <p>''The department needed a more focused mission,'' Ms. McGinnis said.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the Whitman administration marked a deep change for New Jersey's environmental policies -- from a trend toward greater regulation and control to a more cooperative relationship with industry and developers. While her predecessors created large blocks of rules to shape the environment -- the Byrne administration's creation of the Pinelands commission, the financing of municipal sewage plants in the Kean years and the Florio administration's stringent pollution regulations -- Mrs. Whitman concentrated on adjusting existing rules rather than creating new ones.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGinnis said the intent was not to simply cut down on regulation, but to replace a thicket of confusing requirements with clear timetables and concrete goals. She said the plan was to maintain strict environmental standards while eliminating the creation of what some considered unneeded regulations.</p>
        <p>''I would say sensible regulation,'' Ms. McGinnis said.</p>
        <p>But the definition of sensible can vary depending on one's agenda, and that change in philosophy is controversial to this day. Many of the steps taken by Mrs. Whitman still rankle environmental groups in the state, including these actions:</p>
        <p>*Elimination of the Office of Environmental Prosecutor and the office of the Public Advocate and the creation of the Office of the Business Ombudsman.</p>
        <p>*Downsizing the Department of Environmental Protection, which saw its staff drop to a low of 3,022 in 1998 from 3,729 in 1994.</p>
        <p>*Elimination of the Department of Environmental Protection lab.</p>
        <p>*Support for the expansion of controversial highways and such developments such as Merrill Lynch's corporate park in Hopewell.</p>
        <p>*Reduction in both staff and financing for the state's parks.</p>
        <p>*Elimination of more than 100 stations that monitor water quality.</p>
        <p>*Removal of more than 1,000 chemicals from a group of hazardous industrial chemicals, called the right-to-know list, that are subject to state inspection.</p>
        <p>David S. Pringle, the campaign director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, a private watchdog organization, maintained that Mrs. Whitman's policies had a drastic effect. Although he was quick to credit the governor's efforts to preserve open space, he said she had been ''exceedingly poor on enforcement and regulatory funding.''</p>
        <p>''There was a 20 to 30 percent cut in funding for environmental programs,'' Mr. Pringle said. ''There was a two-thirds cut in the toxic right-to-know list. All of these had the cumulative impact of sending a message to polluters that they could get away with significant compromises to environmental and public health.''</p>
        <p>Other critics pointed to a sharp drop in money collected in fines and penalties for environmental violations in the seven years Mrs. Whitman held office -- as much as 80 percent in some of those years. In addition, the number of inspections conducted by environmental regulators dropped to 23,686 in 2000 from 27,826 in 1994. In 1999, the inspector general of the federal agency that Mrs. Whitman would later inherit issued a report critical of the state's water-monitoring program for failing to meet federal guidelines. Ultimately, the environmental agency suspended some financing because the state did not file its water-quality reports on time.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Whitman administration officials disagree vehemently with the critics. Cathy Tormey, an assistant commissioner at the state Department of Environmental Protection, attributed the drop in the number of inspections to a change in the inspections themselves rather than a lax attitude.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Tormey said the number of legal actions taken against major polluters remained virtually the same after Mrs. Whitman took office in January 1994. She said that the federal environmental agency assessed penalties of $225 million in 2000, with New Jersey collecting $12 million in fines.</p>
        <p>''We are out there and we are assessing penalties against people who are violating environmental laws,'' Ms. Tormey said. ''We do have a strong enforcement program and it does respond with penalties.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, critics say the $12 million collected by the state pales in comparison with $26 million in fines collected in the last year of the Florio administration. While Ms. Tormey and others in the Whitman administration contend that the amount of the fines has little to do with environmental quality, critics insist it is an important measure of the state's aggressiveness in sanctioning polluters. If the state is not willing to punish violators, they say, then it naturally follows that more companies are willing to take risks.</p>
        <p>''That has bad consequences because people don't try to comply until they are caught,'' Mr. Lloyd said. ''It sounds good to say we want to assist, we want to foster compliance. But the question is what happens in the field. It makes a difference when you have the hammer.''</p>
        <p>Before Mrs. Whitman took office, the willingness of state environmental regulators to use an enforcement hammer had long been a complaint of industry. Businesses -- particularly those in heavy industry and land development -- often found themselves at odds with state officials.</p>
        <p>''There was a command and control atmosphere in Trenton, and businesses were viewed not as friends but as enemies,'' said Joseph Gonzalez, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, the state's largest private business advocacy group.</p>
        <p>And while business did not always agree with Mrs. Whitman's approach -- the two sides fought bitterly over the state's sewer rules -- Mr. Gonzalez said the governor was always willing to work with industry, particularly in shortening the time needed to receive environmental permits.</p>
        <p>''We have seen real improvement in that across the board,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Critics, on the other hand, said that Mrs. Whitman's concern for economic growth caused problems for the administration in several cases.</p>
        <p>One example often cited is the controversial Merrill Lynch office park in  Hopewell, a rural town in Mercer County. Faced with the prospect of the investment company moving 3,500 jobs out of state, Governor Whitman stepped in with more than $100 million in incentives to persuade the company to stay. The project, a sprawling office development with the potential to house more space than the World Trade Center, was seen as a betrayal by town residents, particularly in light of the governor's support for open-space preservation.</p>
        <p>''The state capital is eight miles away, and they are building this giant office building in a cornfield, while Trenton is going begging for jobs,'' said Mayor Marylou Ferrara of Hopewell Township. ''The state gave them subsidies and tax breaks like you can't believe. They made it more attractive to build in a soybean field than a city.''</p>
        <p>Then there was the state energy efficiency fund, with nearly $1 billion that was supposed to pay for renewable energy and heightened efficiency. Environmentalists contend that the state Board of Public Utilities has dragged its feet and has spent none of the money, even though the first $128 million has been available for nearly a year. Utility companies have fought for control of the funds, while environmentalists argue that the money should be disbursed by the state or by a combination of industry and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>''There has been no articulation of an energy policy,'' said Curtis Fisher, legislative director for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher, whose group successfully pushed for the money as part of the 1999 energy deregulation bill, said recent problems in California underscored its importance. New York recently doubled available funds for energy efficiency, he said, while New Jersey had been slow to move. ''So far they have refused to move forward with this money, and it is critically needed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even more embarrassing for the Whitman administration was fallout from a settlement between state regulators and a large cranberry grower over accusations that the company's operations had expanded into the state's wetlands. Under the proposed agreement, A. R. DeMarco Enterprises said it would turn over another large parcel of land to the state to settle any complaints lodged by New Jersey environmental regulators.</p>
        <p>Critics raised an outcry, pointing to a longtime friendship between Garfield DeMarco, the company's president, and Robert Shinn, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. Although Mr. Shinn said he had recused himself from the settlement, Governor Whitman requested an investigation by the state inspector general.</p>
        <p>In November, the inspector general criticized the regulators' actions, saying the settlement was flawed for several reasons. And although he found no improper actions by the commissioner, the inspector general said Mr. Shinn did not totally shut himself out of the process.</p>
        <p>''The appearance of impropriety coupled with an inappropriate enforcement process leads the office of inspector general to conclude that it would not be in the public interest to finalize'' the agreement, wrote Edward M. Neafsey, the inspector general.</p>
        <p>The Department of Environmental Protection is still working on a final settlement based on the guidelines recommended by the inspector general, a spokeswoman said last week.</p>
        <p>Despite the criticism of her stewardship of the state's natural resources, the Whitman administration's response has been consistent: Look at results, not at regulations.</p>
        <p>''Is the air and water cleaner?'' Ms. McGinnis asked. ''That is where the focus should be.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, many environmental groups credit Mrs. Whitman with improving the state in several areas. Her most ambitious effort was the plan to save a million acres of open space and the protection of Sterling Forest on the New York State border.</p>
        <p>Even so, aides to Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that the loss of open space in New Jersey -- the nation's most densely populated state -- actually increased during her terms in office.</p>
        <p>In addition, the beaches are much cleaner than they were as recently as 10 years ago, when the sight of medical waste and industrial sludge washing up on New Jersey's beaches was not unusual. Indeed, there have been no beach closings in recent years.</p>
        <p>''Our program is one of the best in the nation,'' said Cindy Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, a private environmental advcocacy group.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zipf said Mrs. Whitman led the effort to stop the dumping of toxic harbor sludge off the New Jersey coast, and was a strong proponent of the state's beach-monitoring programs. And though Ms. Zipf said her organization would like to see even tighter regulation of pollutants in the water, she conceded that under Mrs. Whitman, ''the ocean experience has been a positive one.''</p>
        <p>In other areas, the record seems to be more mixed. A report prepared for Governor Whitman by an aide concluded that water quality had improved in some areas but worsened in others. According to the memorandum, 42 percent of streams and rivers were identified as polluted in last year's water-quality report as against 33 percent in 1994. But the memorandum also said that the number of streams identified as severely polluted dropped to 1 percent in 2000 from from 5 percent in 1994.</p>
        <p>Air quality is better since Mrs. Whitman took office, according to reports filed with the Environmental Protection Agency by state regulators, with lower levels of such pollutants as lead, sulfur and airborne particles. Critics of Mrs. Whitman acknowledged that she took a strong position on reducing the amount of pollution emitted from power plants and praised her for sticking with her program to toughen emissions testing for vehicles despite the political fallout from a disastrous and costly implementation.</p>
        <p>Still, critics contended that the improvements in air quality were part of a trend that had begun in the 1970's with  passage of the federal Clean Air Act and the banning of such pollutants as leaded gasoline. In addition, they said that in recent years, improvement in the air quality had flattened when compared with the strides made in previous decades.</p>
        <p>''We should have been a lot better,'' said John Paul Guinan, a staff attorney for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. ''Our technology has improved, but the results have plateaued.''</p>
        <p>While supporters and critics alike agree that it may be too soon to evaluate Mrs. Whitman's performance on the environment, Assemblyman Leonard Lance, a Republican from Flemington, says that overall, ''the record is strong, particularly in the second term.''</p>
        <p>Speaking in defense of her checkered record, Mr. Lance said Mrs. Whitman did not have the ability to finance many of her environmental initiatives until the state's economy rebounded at the beginning of her second term, and that programs like the 10-year open-space plan would bear fruit many years in the future.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Fisher of the public interest organization said that many of the programs that have helped to clean up the state's air and its beaches were begun by Governors Kean and Byrne, and that the results of Governor Whitman's efforts might not become apparent for some time.</p>
        <p>''Environmental policies take years to see all of the positives and negatives,'' he said. ''It will take years to know exactly, but the early indication is there is damage that needs repair.''</p>
