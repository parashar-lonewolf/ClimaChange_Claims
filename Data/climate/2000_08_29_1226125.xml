        <p>It's all so depressing; we must be doomed. Except that in the flood of distressing developments comes a breakthrough. A study led by James Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, suggests that our basic understanding of greenhouse gases should be overturned -- and that reforms could be more practical and affordable than widely assumed.</p>
        <p>Until recently, scientists studying global warming focused nearly all their attention on the deleterious effects of carbon dioxide, which is known to trap atmospheric heat. Every year, cars, trucks and power plants release billions of tons of carbon dioxide by burning fossil fuels.  Some combination of advanced nuclear energy and clean renewable fuels may eventually change this; but for the next few decades, at least, continued buildup is inevitable. Even the ratification of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which would commit industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions, could not stop carbon dioxide buildup. If the treaty's rules went into effect (no major country has ratified it), rising carbon emissions from the developing world would outweigh any reductions in the West.</p>
        <p>Enter Mr. Hansen's team to suggest that focusing on carbon dioxide is a fundamental error. Carbon dioxide is a concern, the study says, but other factors may be equally significant. Black soot from industrial smoke, for example, may turn out to be a leading warming force. (Basically it makes the atmosphere soak up more of the sun's heat, since black absorbs sunlight.) Compounds like SF5 CF3 , may be doing more damage than expected. And most of all, methane, which has far more heat-trapping power than carbon dioxide, may be a much greater greenhouse malefactor than today's scientific models assume.</p>
        <p>Here is the beauty of Mr. Hansen's insight. While fossil fuels are an essential, much of the world's methane emissions have no economic utility; they are the unintended byproduct of natural-gas exploration, poor landfill management and gas-pipeline leaks. These sources could be eliminated with little sacrifice to our lifestyle or economic growth. Likewise, rare chemicals like SF5 CF3 , could be controlled without harm to industry.</p>
        <p>Black soot emissions have already nearly disappeared from Western industry without any economic harm. Today such soot comes mainly from the developing world, where choking smoke rises from unregulated industry and from unelectrified homes that use fires for cooking and heating.</p>
        <p>While regulating smokestack emissions and expanding access to electricity in developing nations would be an expensive undertaking, it would also be a huge boon. Public health as well as the environment would benefit. The World Health Organization says that more children in the developing world die each year from respiratory diseases caused by smoke and soot inhalation than all those who die each year in the United States and the European Union from  all causes at all ages.</p>
        <p>This breakthrough study of greenhouse gases comes from a guru of the environmental movement. In 1981, Mr. Hansen authored one of the first papers linking rising levels of carbon dioxide to rising global temperatures. Yet much of the environmental movement has greeted the new study with skepticism; many environmentalists worry that any lessening of fears regarding fossil fuels will hurt efforts to reduce global warming.</p>
        <p>Rather than grousing about the Hansen study, however, environmentalists should be extolling it as the greatest news in years. First, it revives hope for the Kyoto agreement -- which, at the insistence of State Department negotiators and Vice President Al Gore, contains a little-noticed clause saying that reductions in other greenhouse gas can be substituted for cuts in carbon dioxide. A Kyoto treaty that is fixated on reducing fossil fuel use may never be ratified, but one that goes after methane and SF5 CF3 , seems eminently practical, politically.</p>
        <p>Second, Mr. Hansen's study means that even if the Kyoto agreement is never ratified, affordable, realistic steps against global warming could start right away, without economic harm. A warming world need no longer be our destiny.</p>
