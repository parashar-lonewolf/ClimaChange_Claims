        <p>THE FRAGILE EDGE</p>
        <p>Diving and Other Adventures</p>
        <p>in the South Pacific.</p>
        <p>By Julia Whitty.</p>
        <p>292 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $25.</p>
        <p>There's something about ocean diving that inspires deep thinking -- or at least thoughts that are apparently profound. Once while wreck diving for a television documentary, I unexpectedly found myself surrounded by several pregnant tiger sharks. Euphorically succumbing to nitrogen narcosis, I was drawn to the sharks, dopily fixated on the commingling of species, wondering why we couldn't all just get along, until my dive master dragged me to safety. (Perhaps I should have been more concerned about the food chain.) In any case, I initially wrote off my ill-timed reverie on interdependence as the reaction of a stoned neophyte diver. But I've since read enough about diving to realize that insight comes from unlikely places under those refracted waters.</p>
        <p>For Julia Whitty, the author of a book of short stories, ''A Tortoise for a Queen of Tonga,'' and a veteran oceanic documentary writer and producer, revelations both profound and informed ping from all directions. To her, the ocean is a ''world that feels purely and extravagantly sensual yet exists mostly outside our own sensory realm. ... So the dive you've just made tends to be felt rather than accurately remembered.''</p>
        <p>Whitty's mission is to ''comprehend and then translate the otherworldly marvels under the surface into the alien world topside,'' and her subject is exploring the South Pacific's fertile atolls, going on ''the underwater equivalent of an African big-game safari.''</p>
        <p>''The Fragile Edge: Diving and Other Adventures in the South Pacific'' does offer a handful of true-life big-game tales. There is mention of ''Bloop,'' the mysterious ''low glugging burp'' that can be heard over a span of 3,000 miles. Best guess: an elusive giant squid. And there's a loco French diver who might have become chum for a lone tiger shark with the girth of a rhino.</p>
        <p>But by and large, Whitty is loath to trade on Shark Week sensibilities. Her rapture is more subtle, grand, intelligent and cosmological; and her primary devotion is to the coral reefs. Among the natural world's most fertile masterpieces, they cover only one-tenth of 1 percent of the earth's surface but may harbor upward of nine million species.</p>
        <p>Whitty has a penchant for Eastern spiritual philosophy, and she uses it to draw the reader into a revelry with coral reefs and their riotous biodiversity. She slips into the waters, often practicing pranayama, the yogic breathing exercise, or reflecting on concepts like the Tibetan lhun drub (''spontaneous perfection''). She guides us through a symbiotic potpourri of critters and wonders: gender-bending eels and hermaphroditic corals; pink shrimp acting as community dental hygienists; bacteria that manufacture carbon dioxide on a huge scale; a sleeping pilot whale in mystical repose.</p>
        <p>Whitty's prose is supple and scientifically informed (a rare and graceful mix), and her intimacies with the ocean's curiosities captivate. The less charming and more sobering subjects -- say, the atrocities of cyanide fishing; or an island nation at 12 feet above sea level that is quite literally drowning in the juggernaut of global warming; or France's vast atmospheric nuclear testing in Polynesia (which caused birth defects in newborns and turned reefs into nuclear waste dumps) -- provide a visceral understanding of humanity's relationship with the oceanic world.</p>
        <p>''The Fragile Edge'' is a quietly ambitious, if sometimes meandering, book. Are you up for tales of microscopic dinoflagellates? Interested in how the ancient Indian philosophy of Jainism may affect your interpretation of light playing off a lagoon? And don't be misled by the ''hot girl swimming with a dolphin'' cover photo or take the word ''adventures'' in the subtitle at face value. The book is as much scientific and spiritual meditation as it is eco-treatise or diving expedition.</p>
        <p>But it is Whitty's daring pursuit of the micro that ultimately leads to a larger vision. ''Coral reefs are powerful arbiters of life both in the sea and on the land,'' she writes. ''The oceans they help stock are the chemical engine driving the planet, stabilizing our climate, refreshing the air we breathe, making the rain that feeds the rivers and lakes, which water the crops upon which we depend. This water world, and its most fertile and fragile edge, the coral reefs, are the continuing cradle of life on earth.'' In all likelihood (save some freak, momentous reversal of fortune) our contemporary reef ecosystems will not survive. Whitty buries this particular lead, perhaps thinking the reader would have been reluctant to fall in love with a terminal patient. And by now we've got more than an inkling that this isn't just a matter of our zingiest dive sites going dull.</p>
        <p>She draws comfort from the geologic record, which shows that reefs have suffered extinction, or near extinction, over the billions of years, and have returned. Having noted earlier in the book Darwin's belief that ''species and groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from another, and finally from the world,'' Whitty leaves us wondering if the pertinent question is not ''Can the coral reefs survive us?'' but rather, ''Can we survive without them?''</p>
