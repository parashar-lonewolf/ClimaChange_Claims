        <p>LEAD: ''SKI SOUTH POLE,'' say the T-shirts, ''two inches of powder, 10,000 feet of base.''</p>
        <p>''SKI SOUTH POLE,'' say the T-shirts, ''two inches of powder, 10,000 feet of base.''</p>
        <p>In all candor, though, the skiing at the South Pole is not to be recommended. There are no mountains, and the surface is uncomfortably crusty even for cross-country.</p>
        <p>There are also no hotels or restaurants. The shopping is negligible. The bar operates on a bring-your-own basis. With the wind-chill factor, the average temperature in the warmest months is 47 degrees below zero.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the price of an airline ticket from Chile to the Pole and back runs about $28,000. That will buy a couple of hours on the ground, including a tour of the geodesic dome that houses the United States Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, the scientific research center with a summer population of about 75. All in all, there isn't much to see.  Unless you count a land so white and a sky so blue that they make Danish porcelain seem drab.</p>
        <p>Or the dome, glinting like an immense marquisat in the 24-hour daylight.</p>
        <p>Or the copper pipe and plaque a few hundred feet from the dome that mark the true geographic South Pole - elevation 9,301 feet; average temperature 56 degrees below zero; ice thickness in excess of 9,000 feet. A few steps away is an American flag, tattered by the wind.</p>
        <p>Standing in the wind during a week's visit in January 1988 as a guest of the United States Antarctic Program, I thought about Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian, and Robert Falcon Scott, the Englishman, racing each other to the Pole in 1911; about Amundsen getting there first and planting a black flag to mark the spot; about what Scott must have thought when he saw the flag, and about his fatal return trip.</p>
        <p>The wondrous thing about the Pole lies not in what is there, but what isn't: no indigenous population; no civilization; no vegetation; no wildlife; no darkness in summer; no light in winter.</p>
        <p>Just ice and sky and sky and ice.</p>
        <p>And a blue plastic luggage tag.</p>
        <p>I was cross-country skiing around the copper marker when I spotted it, a blue dab a few inches below the surface of the snow. I poked at it with my ski pole and dug it out. It belonged to a man from Portland, Ore. Finding it made me feel sad and angry, like discovering the first scratch on a new car, in this case a Rolls-Royce.</p>
        <p>''Man is a disgustingly dirty animal,'' said Jim Butler, a scientist at the University of Colorado who was at the South Pole last summer studying the hole in the earth's protective ozone layer. ''Wherever man goes he fouls his own nest. He has no track record of anything else. The community here is by and large environmentally aware, but I still see cigarette butts.''</p>
        <p>Still, it is easy to make a case for scientists and their support staff to be there. It is where Florida researchers set up a telescope to watch the stars around the clock in the 24-hour-a-day darkness of the polar winter. It is where, in the Pole's recent summer season, three projects studied cosmic radiations in an effort to relate the Big Bang theory of creation to the formation of galaxies.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation, a governmental body that runs the United States Antarctic Program, also invites official visitors to the South Pole - Congressmen, for example, who vote on the appropriations that keep the scientists in business, and journalists who, it is hoped, will build support for the polar program by publicizing it.</p>
        <p>But tourists? Vacationers? My feelings are a jumble.</p>
        <p>The first tourists ever to visit the South Pole arrived just over a year ago, 35 of them in all, traveling in ski-equipped Twin Otter planes. According to residents of the station, they were polite and considerate and thrilled. And although several needed oxygen to cope with the altitude, there was no suggestion that they left anything behind but footprints. Last month 11 people took part in a cross-country ski trip across the continent, arriving at the Pole Jan. 17, where they spent an hour and a half touring the station.</p>
        <p>It is the tourists, the American ones at least, whose tax dollars go toward providing the $135 million annual budget for the science foundation's polar program. So, as long as the visitors don't interfere with the scientists, a tour does not seem unreasonable.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union makes territorial claims in Antarctica, and both refuse to recognize such claims by other countries. That being the case, it is an open continent. No governmental permission to travel is required.</p>
        <p>The science foundation has weighty objections to tourism at the Pole, most of which center on the question of who is supposed to do what when something goes wrong. And, if the accident rate of the last 30 years is any guide, something will, all good intentions of self-sufficiency on the part of tour operators notwithstanding. Fifty people have died in United States Government programs in Antarctica since 1946, 32 of them in aircraft accidents. Air New Zealand canceled sightseeing flights over the continent in 1979 when one of its planes crashed into Mount Erebus, killing all 257 people aboard.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has ski-equipped Hercules planes at the Pole, is not cheered by the prospect of risking a $35 million plane and Navy crew to bail out sick or stranded vacationers who are not there under its auspices and not subject to its eligibility requirements and safety rules.</p>
        <p>Still, conceding the inevitability of more tourists at the Pole, the foundation is formulating policies to deal with them.</p>
        <p>A more fundamental problem, as some see it, is the threat to the environment. Problems that revolve around things such as logistics and liability ''are fixable,'' said Mr. Butler, the Colorado scientist; the tainting of a pristine environment is not.</p>
        <p>''I'm not worried about what's happening right now,'' he said about the very limited tourist trade here so far. ''They can't do much damage in two hours.</p>
        <p>''But when it gets to less than $5,000 per head, there will be incredible demand for flights. They'll want to camp. Four years from now we'll have that. Then there will be more cigarette butts, beer cans, whisky bottles - buried in the snow, of course.'' He also expressed concern that tourist planes might unwittingly interfere with the zone designated for atmospheric studies.</p>
        <p>The concern is that in the long run Mr. Butler may be right. I did not spend my time in Antarctica, 12 weeks in all, as a tourist or with tourists. But residents play tourist in their off time, and not all of them behave.</p>
        <p>I am thinking about waiting in line on the outskirts of McMurdo Station, the main United States center in Antarctica, to tour the hut built by Scott in 1902 and from which he left on his doomed mission to the Pole. Somebody behind me, an off-duty military man, was trying to balance himself on the edge of a box of supplies. In the process he was breaking down its sides. What I wanted to say, but didn't, was: ''What do you think you're doing? Stop it! That box has been here for more than 80 years.''</p>
        <p>I am thinking about a helicopter tour of the McMurdo Sound area taken by a Congressional delegation. According to a witness, the lawmakers ignored repeated requests by an official of the science foundation to stop harassing penguins. Under the Federal Antarctic Conservation Act, Americans who harass wildlife are subject to a $10,000 fine.</p>
        <p>I am thinking about friends who returned from a cruise to the Antarctic peninsula and nearby islands. They have pictures of graffiti-splotched rocks at Elephant Island where Ernest Shackleton, the British explorer, found temporary refuge after his ship was crushed by the ice in 1915. Since the island has no indigenous population or permanent residents, the culprit has to have been a visitor.</p>
        <p>Finally, I am thinking about my own visit to a penguin rookery. Even having been fully briefed on the penalties provided by the Conservation Act, I could not resist snatching a few feathers for a young friend in Arlington, Va., who had begged me to bring some home.</p>
        <p>Looking around to make sure no one was watching, I scooped them up, tucked them in my parka pocket and took them back to McMurdo via helicopter.</p>
        <p>They felt awfully heavy, for feathers. I remembered a childhood visit to Washington to see the cherry blossoms and asking an aunt if I could pick just one. What would happen, she replied, if everbody took just one.</p>
        <p>Guilt prevailed; I returned the feathers on a subsequent trip. I was lucky to have a second chance.</p>
