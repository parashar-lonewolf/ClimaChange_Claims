        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Unfair Shots at a Fair Tax," your Oct. 13 endorsement of Ross Perot's proposed gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon only proves once again that some of the American people, and you with them, have a 10-minute memory.</p>
        <p>Your back issues for 1978 and 1979, when the country was faced with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gas crisis, will show you that gasoline soared from 79 cents to $1.40 a gallon and thereby caused the greatest period of inflation in the 20th century. It took the failed Presidency of Jimmy Carter, the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and also the Presidency of George Bush to bring inflation and interest rates down.</p>
        <p>If you look at some of the prices of the 70's you will understand that the $10,000 Cadillac of 1978 now costs $35,000. Better yet, the 39-cent can of tuna fish now costs $1.39, and that translates into a 356 percent increase over 14 years.</p>
        <p>Nothing in this country moves without transportation of some kind, and it is all dependent upon gasoline or other fossil fuels. Raising gasoline prices is the biggest cause of inflation because every product large or small contains 20 percent or more of built-in transportation costs.</p>
        <p>Figure it out for yourself. Wouldn't you have to raise the price of your newspaper 20 percent to account for it in the final tally? Wouldn't that be inflationary?  PAUL L. SHERMAN  East Brunswick, N.J., Oct. 21, 1992</p>
