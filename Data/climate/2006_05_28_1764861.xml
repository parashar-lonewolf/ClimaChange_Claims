        <p>COASTAL towns and cities all around America are deciding whether to let the government pay 90 percent of the cost of having the Army Corps of Engineers protect property along their shore by dredging and pumping sand to replenish beaches that have suffered from decades of erosion and overdevelopment. With sea levels rising and stronger, more frequent storms all but certain, how can communities pass up this offer?</p>
        <p>Recently, though, the City Council of Long Beach, the largest coastal community in Nassau County, voted unanimously against a corps proposal to protect them from storms.</p>
        <p>The reason? These projects do bring in sand that then protects storm waters from damaging coastal property, but they can also make swimming more dangerous and surfing the waves less appealing. The projects often destroy fishing and marine habitat and dump coarse, dark sand on the beaches, making them less aesthetically pleasing. (In 1994, a beach replenishing project in Coney Island brought dredged up rocks and mud to the beach there.)</p>
        <p>So while these projects may sound like a good idea, there are several downsides. Communities like Long Beach are right to say no if they don't feel that the corps is taking into proper consideration the effect that a project will have on the beach.</p>
        <p>In the mid to late 1990's, 11 municipalities in Monmouth County, N.J., received a huge dredge and fill replenishment project -- one of the biggest in our nation's history. Sea Bright, Monmouth Beach and the beaches from Asbury Park to Manasquan had become severely eroded because of natural erosion and poorly planned development.</p>
        <p>The corps's design for these beaches was essentially a big box of sand about 10 feet high and 140 feet wide. Immediately after construction, these enormous beaches were very steep, especially at the watermark. Swimming was hazardous because of the steep slope and deep water close to shore. Furthermore, the project buried sandbars and rock jetties, which had broken up incoming waves, so now the waves crash directly onto the beach, making swimming even more dangerous.</p>
        <p>Normally, sandbars and rock jetties shape waves, making them suitable for bodysurfers, body boarders, surfers and kayakers to ride. But to this day, there are very few surfable waves in Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach because of what the corps did to those beaches.</p>
        <p>Moreover, sandbars and rocks attract and harbor bait and fish. When the corps smothered the sandbars and rocks, marine life disappeared too. In the southeastern United States, altered beaches like these have made it nearly impossible for endangered sea turtles to nest.</p>
        <p>What's worse is that these expensive projects -- the one for Long Beach was estimated to cost $98.5 million -- offer no guarantee of protection from storms and the resulting wind damage. For instance, the plans for barrier islands like Long Beach, did not offer protection from bay-side flooding, nor do plans for another barrier island, Long Beach Island, N.J., which is currently working out final details with the corps on a beach replenishment project.</p>
        <p>It's clear that we need to redefine success in these projects. An engineer's idea of a good beach is different from a beach user's view. While the corps claims that its projects are intended to protect property -- the most desirable and expensive property in the country -- they often destroy or diminish the very things that make that real estate so valuable.</p>
        <p>Part of the solution is to change how Congress finances and reviews these projects and the corps. Bills have been introduced that would subject these large projects to an independent review board, but their passage is a long way off. So in the meantime, states and municipalities dealing with the corps should recognize that they have some control.</p>
        <p>Even though corps guidelines say their plans must maximize the economic benefits of protecting structures, communities have the right to lobby for an alternative. Project designs can and should be modified to consider recreation in light of local needs and how the beach is used. Smaller, less expensive projects should be options even if they provide less storm protection.</p>
        <p>The decision reached in Long Beach reflects that view of local control. Many residents said they knew and accepted the risks of living on a barrier island. And while some risk to their homes was acceptable, the possibility of a damaged beach was not. They decided to take their share of the project cost and put it toward real storm-preparedness measures like evacuation plans, stricter building codes and devices to reduce wind damage -- all good alternatives to replenishing beaches.</p>
        <p>In the long run, the health of our economy and that of our environment are inseparable. The coast is where this realization is easiest to see, and where an unlikely decision by an unlikely city council -- like that in Long Beach -- represents a small but promising step in the right direction.</p>
