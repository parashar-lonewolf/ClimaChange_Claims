        <p>A recent study by the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory shows that coal-to-liquid diesel fuels will be at least as clean as the fuels they replace, or cleaner.

        <p>Re ''The Coal Trap'' (editorial, May 30):</p>
        <p>A recent study by the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory shows that coal-to-liquid diesel fuels will be at least as clean as the fuels they replace, or cleaner. In fact, the laboratory concluded that coal-to-liquid fuels can be up to 46 percent cleaner in terms of carbon dioxide emissions using a biomass co-feed.</p>
        <p>The laboratory also found that coal-to-liquid fuels will dramatically reduce emissions of harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter.</p>
        <p>The Idaho National Laboratory report is a case study of a real-world coal-to-liquid facility set for construction in southeastern Ohio. A limited package of federal support for coal-to-liquid fuels is needed to reduce America's foreign oil dependency and to guard against foreign energy cartel price manipulation.</p>
        <p>A robust domestic coal-to-liquid industry offers the dual benefit of greater energy security and environmental performance.</p>
