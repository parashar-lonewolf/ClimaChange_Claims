        <p>At age 59, Tom Cadigan says he is ''winding down.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, he sold his appliance store in a neighboring town so he and his wife, Kay, could move to a mobile home on land they own here. On summer evenings, they like to take in the view of the rolling hillsides that surround their home and watch the birds visit their backyard feeder. ''It's very, very peaceful,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But lately, Mr. Cadigan and hundreds of others are concerned that the tranquility of this rural community, 60 miles south of Rochester, may be disrupted by wind farms.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's call to increase the state's so-called green energy 6 percent by 2013 has prompted a flurry of proposals that could add 46 wind farms to the three that already exist in the state. The two wind farms proposed in Prattsburgh would add 90 wind turbines that stand roughly 400 feet tall -- higher, opponents like to say, than the Statue of Liberty. ''My gosh, it looks like there's going to be five around us,'' Mr. Cadigan said. ''The whole neighborhood could be driven right out.''</p>
        <p>In many cases, the wind-farm proposals are pitting the people who would benefit financially from them -- including local governments and the land owners willing to lease their property -- against those who would not benefit, especially neighbors who say they worry the turbines will drive down the market value of their homes and intrude upon their lives.</p>
        <p>Many of the wind farms are proposed for small agricultural communities with few other development options to consider. ''I feel like it's a done deal,'' said Mr. Cadigan, adding, ''I'm not a crusader.''</p>
        <p>But he has the support of a powerful ally. Tom Golisano, a billionaire who lives in the region and is a potential 2006 candidate for governor, has started a nonprofit organization called Save Upstate New York, which aims to galvanize people like Mr. Cadigan.</p>
        <p>The organization is not opposed to all wind farm development, Mr. Golisano said, but would like to limit it. ''I've grown up here and lived here all my life, and I couldn't imagine an absolutely beautiful area with the turbines and all that came with it -- the noise, the strobe lights, the shadows and the ice throws,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Common complaints against turbines are that their huge blades create a constant whoosh-whoosh-whoosh sound as they spin. In the winter, the blades can throw ice. The turbines require constant lighting as a marker for small planes. Then there is the issue of efficiency. Electrical energy is most needed in the summer, but wind turbines create the most energy in the winter, when it is generally more windy.</p>
        <p>Proponents say they reduce, although minutely, the country's dependence on fossil fuels and are not considered optimum terrorist targets like nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>A typical turbine costs $1.5 million to $2 million to build and lasts 20 years. It produces enough electricity to meet the needs of 1,000 homes at any given time.</p>
        <p>With hundreds of turbines needed to meet the state goal, the New York State Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, will start charging electric customers fees in October ranging from 0.1 percent to 2.2 percent of their bills. For example, if a homeowner paid $50 a month, he or she might see a monthly increase ranging from 5 cents to $1.10, or possibly a little more, depending on the wholesale market.</p>
        <p>By 2013, that would generate $760 million that would be used as incentives for wind-farm development -- with some of the money funneled back to town budgets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golisano, who in October stepped down as the chief executive of Paychex, the payroll company that he founded, is visiting small towns to discuss wind energy. On Tuesday, he was in Prattsburgh, where the Town Board let him show a 20-minute videotape. In it, people living near wind farms in Fenner, N.Y., and in Pennsylvania said the turbines had harmed their quality of life.</p>
        <p>After the videotape presentation, the Town Board declined to take questions and adjourned. About 60 people stayed behind, asking Mr. Golisano questions for the next 45 minutes. During the exchange, he told them his organization would help coordinate their fight and potentially finance their lawsuits if neighbors could make a case that the turbines would create a nuisance.</p>
        <p>''I'd fight it tooth and nail myself, but I don't have the money,'' said Kathy Rosenthal, who has multiple sclerosis and moved to Prattsburgh for its quiet hillsides.</p>
        <p>In a phone interview after the meeting, the town supervisor, Harold J. McConnell, said the Town Board favored the wind farms. Just one, he said, would bring the town $500,000 in annual revenue.</p>
        <p>He characterized the opposition as a handful of residents -- even though people at the Town Board meeting said that several hundred people had signed a petition against the turbines. Mr. Golisano, he said, has ''alienated the Town Board.'' ''They've been very critical of us and in some cases accused us of chicanery,'' Mr. McConnell said.</p>
        <p>In Sardinia, 40 miles southeast of Buffalo, developers lost interest in a $50 million wind farm after facing ''very vocal'' opposition from residents, a project representative said. Another project near Cornell University in Ithaca was also turned down after much dissent. But in Tug Hill -- a remote region between Lake Ontario and the Adirondacks -- a $320 million project with 120 turbines was approved in the spring with few complaints.</p>
        <p>Companies are trying to find ''places where people will favor them,'' said Eric J. Miller, a business manager with Invenergy Wind, a Chicago company that has proposed five wind farms in New York. ''In some cases, they allow communities to stay agricultural because they provide a supplemental income to farmers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Wyoming County, southwest of Rochester, town leaders are following seven wind farm proposals, hoping to negotiate the best possible deals for their towns. In Wethersfield, the supervisor, John F. Copeland, said he would never support a proposal like a deal for a 10-turbine farm that brought in a mere $20,000 for the town -- especially after learning that the nearby town of Sheldon is now considering a farm that would increase town revenue by 50 percent, or $230,000. He said the 10-turbine deal was negotiated in 2000, when his predecessor was supervisor.</p>
        <p>Even after the meeting with Mr. Golisano, Ms. Rosenthal of Prattsburgh said she felt disheartened that a tower might be placed at the end of her dirt road. ''They're being shoved down our throats, and there's nothing we can do about it,'' she said. ''We have no power.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 26, 2005, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about local opposition to proposals for dozens of wind farms in upstate New York referred incorrectly in some copies to the community where two such farms, with a total of 90 wind turbines, are planned. It is Prattsburgh, a town 60 miles south of Rochester, not Plattsburgh, the city 160 miles north of Albany.</p>
