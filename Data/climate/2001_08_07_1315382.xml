        <p>President Bush may be on vacation, but it's work, work, work. The Middle East. Stem-cell research. Global warming. Heavy topics all, to which the president is diligently applying himself, even as the mercury here pushes past 100 and the rest of the country kicks back.</p>
        <p>If studying was not enough, Mr. Bush is planning to dart around the country -- hitting at least eight cities -- to talk informally about compassionate values as he demonstrates his own by helping nail together a house for Habitat for Humanity in nearby Waco on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>And if that was not enough, his aides report that he is undertaking lots of down-home activities, including daily trips to his fishing hole (stocked with bass) and clearing brush on his 1,600-acre ranch for a nature trail.</p>
        <p>For many, August is a chance to chill from the daily grind. But for Mr. Bush, this is a ''working vacation,'' in which he will work to overhaul his image and send some deliberate signals. He is on vacation, yes, but not from work. Just from Washington.</p>
        <p>The White House has packaged this 31-day period, which began on Saturday, as a ''Home to the Heartland Tour,'' in which the president is fleeing the elitism of Washington for the terra firma of solid American values represented by home, themes that Mr. Bush intends to extol in his next radio address on Saturday.</p>
        <p>In case the message escaped notice, Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, opened his briefing, or ''gaggle,'' for reporters here today by using the word ''home'' three times in the first sentence.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to the first gaggle of the Home to the Heartland Tour, and welcome to Texas, welcome to Crawford, home of the heartland tour and welcome to the home of President and Mrs. Bush,'' Mr. McClellan told reporters, whose work space is in the gymnasium of the Crawford Elementary School, seven miles from the ranch.</p>
        <p>In a slight jab at members of Congress, who leave Washington for shorter stints, Mr. McClellan added: ''The president, much like members of Congress -- although for a shorter period of time, I might add -- believes it's important to come back home. That's why we're spending the month in Crawford, Tex. -- this is his home.''</p>
        <p>Early this morning, before the sun scorched the land, Mr. Bush went for a four-mile jog, a burst of freedom from the treadmill to which he is often confined in the White House. He talked by phone with Condoleezza Rice, his national security adviser, about Macedonia, and to his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr. And he met with four staff members.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClellan emphasized that Mr. Bush wanted to listen to average Americans in informal settings, and would be doing so as he traveled. Polls have suggested that while a majority of people have a favorable impression of Mr. Bush, they think he fails to understand the concerns and lives of ''people like me.''</p>
        <p>''It's important to hear what's on the minds of the people and what their concerns are, and get outside of Washington, D.C., where too often those values are not readily visible,'' Mr. McClellan said, referring to the values of compassion and an involved citizenry that Mr. Bush intends to discuss on his travels.</p>
        <p>Just what is Mr. Bush up to?</p>
        <p>''He's running against Washington,'' Marshall Wittmann, an analyst at the Hudson Institute, said by telephone from Washington. ''And he's fighting the perception that he's loafing. To be in Crawford is to be removed. This is the way a president establishes the perception that he is a man of the people, to have disdain for Washington and not be of it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wittmann, who grew up in nearby Waco, said Central Texas also had the advantage of projecting a heartland image, the opposite image of the rich and elite Martha's Vineyard, where Bill Clinton frequently vacationed. ''This is the anti-Clinton presidency, so you go to the anti-Clinton vacation spot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The off-ranch travel begins modestly on Tuesday morning, with a golf outing nearby. On Wednesday Mr. Bush helps build the Habitat for Humanity house. Next week he travels to Estes Park, Colo., to talk about character education and ''the values of right and wrong,'' and to Albuquerque, for a back-to-school event.</p>
        <p>Later, he is off to Milwaukee to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars and two stops in Pennsylvania, including Williamsport to watch the Little League Baseball World Series Championship. After that he is to visit the American Legion's 83rd annual convention, in San Antonio.</p>
        <p>The tour itself has the air of a campaign, not only because Mr. Bush is trying to reposition himself in the American psyche but also because some states he plans to visit -- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin among them -- were closely contested in the last election and Mr. Bush would like to add them to his column in 2004.</p>
