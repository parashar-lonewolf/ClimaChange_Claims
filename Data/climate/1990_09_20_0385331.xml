        <p>There's a potent prescription that at a single stroke would slash America's dependence on foreign oil, trim the trade deficit, roll back smog and avert global warming. It's to mandate that auto manufacturers produce more fuel-efficient cars. The Senate is considering a bill by Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada to raise the fuel efficiency of new cars 20 percent by 1995 and 40 percent by the year 2001. That's not the best way of improving fuel efficiency, but it's a lot better than doing nothing.</p>
        <p>The most efficient way of making the national auto fleet guzzle less fuel would be to slap a stiff tax on gasoline. Fuel efficiency standards mandated by Congress are in effect a hidden tax that bites by raising the price of cars. The standards are less effective than a gas tax would be because they hit only new-car owners. Owners of old cars will hang on to their gas guzzlers longer, as the efficient cars will cost more. And even new owners, if tempted to drive more, may use nearly as much fuel as before.</p>
        <p>A gas tax would impinge on everyone equally; in addition, each cent per gallon would raise $1 billion in revenue. But half of Washington refuses to raise new taxes, and the other half lacks the courage to explain to voters why a gas tax is necessary. In this Sahara of leadership, the Bryan bill is a beckoning oasis.</p>
        <p>Under a law passed after the 1973 oil crisis, the average fuel economy of new cars has nearly doubled, from 14 miles per gallon to 27. Each mile-per-gallon increase saves 420,000 barrels of oil a day. The Reagan Administration opposed these standards on ideological grounds, and in 1986 the Task Force on Regulatory Relief, under its chairman, Vice President Bush, proposed abolishing them altogether. Yet without the standards, the United States would be even more dangerously dependent on foreign oil than it already is.</p>
        <p>Further gains in efficiency are certainly possible as existing technologies spread to all new models. The Bryan bill won't be cheap; manufacturers will bear heavy retooling costs to meet this and other legislated requirements. And the feasible gains may not be as great as Senator Bryan avers. But the auto manufacturers' contention that his standards will make all cars Pinto-sized is hard to swallow whole. Detroit cries wolf so reflexively when asked for cleaner, safer or more efficient cars that its credibility runs short.</p>
        <p>Senator Bryan may also be overly optimistic in saying his standards can be met without forcing manufacturers to offer smaller and lighter-weight cars. Reducing weight is such an obvious route to fuel efficiency that the average car is almost certain to get smaller. Smaller cars, besides their other less convenient features, are also less crush-proof in accidents. But a rise in traffic deaths need not be inevitable if the lighter cars embody improved safety features.</p>
        <p>The Bryan bill isn't the best way to make cars fuel-efficient. But it deserves the vote of every senator who dares not demand a higher tax on gasoline.</p>
