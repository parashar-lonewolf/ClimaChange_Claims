        <p>For more than a century, the Hamburg Presbyterian Church has stood just a few hundred yards from Eighteen Mile Creek, which gently wends its way through this town on the outskirts of Buffalo, providing nourishment, commerce, recreation and a habitat for rabbits, deer, waterfowl and spawning fish.</p>
        <p>But it was just a few months ago that the Hamburg congregation "adopted" the creek as a project, monitoring its waters for pollutants, documenting its wildlife and fighting further development along its shores.</p>
        <p>"We can't do much about global warming or the rain forests or the hole in the ozone layer," said Bob Friant, a church member who retired from a salt mining company a few years ago to grow saplings for local nurseries. "We can't do much more than we can reach. And we can reach the creek and we can reach the town board." Mr. Friant heads a church group called Stewards of the Creek. A 'Challenge to Faith'</p>
        <p>The work of the Hamburg congregation is part of a movement some are calling the "Greening of the Churches," an awakening to environmental issues in churches and synagogues across the country. Congregations that once took the lead on issues of poverty, homelessness, civil rights and peace are now composting, testing the pH of local waterways, serving meatless church suppers, conducting energy conservation surveys and praying for endangered species as well as people.</p>
        <p>Paul Gorman, a speech writer for Eugene McCarthy's 1968 race for President, is a convert to the new religious environmental ethic. "This is not just religious people finding yet another social issue," he said from his office at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in upper Manhattan, where he runs an interfaith environmental organization.</p>
        <p>The despoiling and exploitation of the earth is seen as "a violation of God's creation," Mr. Gorman added. "There is an very instinctive reaction out of a religious conscience."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorman is the executive director of a nonprofit group called the Joint Appeal by Religion and Science for the Environment. His group has brought together scientists and an array of religious organizations, from Roman Catholics and Evangelicals to Jews and mainstream Protestants.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the groups met May 10 in Washington, where they adopted a statement that declared the environment "an inescapably religious challenge."</p>
        <p>A few months ago Mr. Gorman's group opened a toll-free number so other congregations could share news of their environmental activities. After news reports about the number, (800) 826-9800, Mr. Gorman's group received more than 4,000 responses.</p>
        <p>The group recently issued a directory of projects by over 200 congregations, including the creek project at Hamburg Presbyterian. Among the others are these:</p>
        <p>*Christ the King Roman Catholic Church in Endwell, N.Y., established a church garden in memory of its former pastor where it grows plants for altar decorations. The plants are later added to a compost heap.</p>
        <p>*Fourth Universalist Society on Central Park West in Manhattan has held special services for animal rights where worshipers are encouraged to bring pets.</p>
        <p>*Like dozens of other churches, Desert Palm United Church of Christ in Tempe, Ariz., has replaced disposable dishes at church functions with lightweight china.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is enamored of the new religious focus on the environment. Some religious conservatives say it is a distraction from church-centered practices like liturgy and sacraments as well as from social programs that help the poor. They also warn that it runs the risk of becoming a sort of religion in itself.</p>
        <p>In a sermon on Earth Day two years ago, John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, said that he shared environmental concerns but warned that they should not overshadow the centrality of human beings in God's plan.</p>
        <p>"The earth exists for the human person and not vice versa," the Cardinal said from the pulpit of St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, some environmentalists are not enamored of religion. They say Judaism and Christianity have led to the exploitation of the earth, by giving man, in the words of Genesis 1:28, "dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</p>
        <p>Environmental theologians emphasize another verse from Genesis, 2:15, that talks about man's responsibility to "work and keep" the land, a concept known as "stewardship."</p>
        <p>During a walk along Eighteen Mile Creek, the church's Stewards of the Creek spoke about their relationship with the waterway and its growth in their religious and personal lives as an environmental concern.</p>
        <p>"This creek was my second home," said Douglas Nichols, an executive recruiter, who spent nearly all of his 53 years in Hamburg. He and the others recalled swimming, canoeing and fishing on the creek in the summer and skating, sledding and cross-country skiing on it in the winter.</p>
        <p>Church members recalled that over the years the church has been involved in everything from housing issues to peace. Ruth Miller, a retired child psychologist, said the environment was also a peace issue. "Most wars are about supply of natural resources, fights over water and land," she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Friant, the chairman of the steward's group, added: "Peacemaking means something different in the 90's than it did in the 60's."</p>
