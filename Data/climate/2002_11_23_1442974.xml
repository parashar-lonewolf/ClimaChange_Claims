        <p>When William Bilkovich died in a car accident on a country road near his home in Tallahassee, Fla., on Dec. 30, 1999, Mr. Bilkovich, a 56-year-old chemical pollution expert, was listed by the police as the only victim.</p>
        <p>But the accident also turned out to be a crushing blow to a novel environmental program at Dow Chemical, where he had worked as an independent consultant bringing Dow engineers and managers together with some of the company's harshest critics.</p>
        <p>Dow says it has preserved what it learned from the program and does not need such extensive engagement with critics to pursue pollution prevention. But environmentalists contend that the most important lessons have been ignored both inside and outside the company. And they say that the program's demise is one of many signs that industry is feeling less pressure to attack pollution, given the Bush administration's support for policies like yesterday's proposed relaxation of rules affecting power plants and refineries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bilkovich had earned the trust of both sides by helping Dow and the critics identify and pursue 17 toxic-waste reduction projects at Dow's manufacturing complex in Midland, Mich. Dow, based in Midland, found the projects saved it millions of dollars annually while cutting emissions of 26 chemicals by 35 percent. Mr. Bilkovich's death came as Dow and the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that persuaded Dow to work with local critics, were arranging to move him to Freeport, Tex., to set up a program at Dow's petrochemical complex there.</p>
        <p>''The loss of Bill Bilkovich was a huge setback for everyone concerned,'' said Jeffrey L. Feerer, manager of environmental, safety and health affairs at Midland until his retirement on Nov. 1. ''He took a lot of pollution prevention knowledge to the grave.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists agree, but argue that Dow used Mr. Bilkovich's death as an excuse to resume a less open relationship with outsiders. And they say that Dow's decision not to replicate the program -- which Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, had hailed as a model for all of industry -- is only part of the story.</p>
        <p>Some 30 chemical companies declined a request by the Natural Resources Defense Council to replicate the program, said Linda E. Greer, an environmental toxicologist at the council. ''This met the industry's definition of what it said it wanted instead of government regulation,'' she said, ''but when we offered it up on a silver platter, no one would do it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Greer thought she had found an exception in the privately held Huntsman Corporation, which called her after reading about the Dow program. Huntsman agreed in 2000 to pursue the Dow model at three factories in Texas. But Ms. Greer said the company ended up deferring action on so many elements of the program the council viewed as crucial -- like involvement of local critics -- that the council canceled the deal last year.</p>
        <p>For its part, Huntsman viewed the project as a success. The company said it spent over $1 million working with Charles Czarnecki, the consultant whom the council recommended to find pollution-reduction projects. It ended up with a number of initiatives that met its goal of paying for themselves in three to four years, said Peter Huntsman, the company's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>''We were in the process of agreeing on the outside committee when they lost interest,'' he said. ''We wouldn't have any trouble picking this up with them again.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say the broadest lesson in the Dow story is that voluntary pollution-control programs are most likely to arise when industry feels threatened by stronger regulation. Conversely, they say, such programs can stagnate or wither whenever government pressure weakens.</p>
        <p>''The people at the edges of the companies trying to be creative and act in enlightened self-interest melt away when you get an administration not interested in enforcement,'' said Eric Schaeffer, who resigned as head of enforcement at the E.P.A. in February.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schaeffer, backed by grants from the Rockefeller Family Fund and other foundations, has been organizing the Environmental Integrity Project to monitor ''upset emissions'' -- those released when chemicals burn during accidents -- in southeast Texas's chemical industry belt. Environmentalists are prodding regulators to clamp down on practices like classifying events that happen repeatedly as accidents.</p>
        <p>''If companies don't need anything from you, they won't torque their manufacturing for you,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''Being good is not their job.''</p>
        <p>Dow and other chemical companies argue that they are investing in practices that allow businesses to grow without harming the environment, and that stricter regulation impedes such steps. They cite the widespread adoption of environmental, health and safety standards under the Responsible Care program, which the industry founded in 1988.</p>
        <p>Responsible Care is viewed by environmentalists as having more to do with public relations than pollution cleanup. One study concluded that from 1987 to 1996, Responsible Care members did a poorer job of reducing emissions than companies that had not joined the group.</p>
        <p>The industry disputes that finding. The study, by Michael Lenox, an associate professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke, used data that did not accurately reflect performance, said Dell Perelman, a spokesman for the American Chemistry Council, a trade group whose members account for 90 percent of industrial chemical production. Responsible Care is moving to require members, starting in 2004, to publish independently audited data on toxic emissions in air and water, emissions contributing to global warming, and energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>Many companies, including Dow, say their environmental commitment extends well beyond support for Responsible Care's guidelines. Dow has a 10-year drive running through 2005 to cut total reportable emissions in half. Dow said last month that it completed 84 percent of the reduction by the end of 2001. Another 2005 goal -- reducing emissions of 29 toxic compounds by 75 percent -- has already been achieved, the company says. Dow said its investment in environmental, health and safety equipment has grown from about $205 million in 1999 to $288 million last year.</p>
        <p>''We are doing hundreds of projects similar to what we did under M.S.R.I.,'' said Neil Hawkins, Mr. Feerer's successor at Dow, referring to the Michigan Source Reduction Initiative, the program with Mr. Bilkovich. Most, however, are organized without advice from outsiders.</p>
        <p>Environmental veterans of the Midland program are not prepared to believe anything Dow says without more access to its data. Companies are required to report total output of hundreds of toxic chemicals, both overall and plant by plant. But the Midland program took data on which machinery and processes produced the end results, to harvest valuable suggestions for improvements the company itself had missed.</p>
        <p>Negotiations over what data accurately represented Midland's operations were a crucial feature of the original program. Moreover, the program energized Dow by requiring employees to present the data and their proposed improvements directly to the critics. ''People couldn't believe we sat down with these folks and were that transparent,'' said Jerry Martin, Dow's global director of environmental, health and safety regulatory affairs before he retired in 2000. ''It was a hard sell, because people hate to lose control.''</p>
        <p>It sometimes seems these days that the program never happened. Environmentalists and Dow are battling fiercely in the latest flare-up in a decades-old dispute over Dow's handling of dioxin, a toxic byproduct of chlorine-based herbicides and related chemicals. Dow is pushing hard to wrap up an agreement on soil contamination standards, which environmentalists describe as a ''sweetheart deal,'' with Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, and Russell Harding, director of the state's Department of Environmental Quality. Both are leaving office at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The proposed agreement interprets the regulations as allowing contamination levels more than nine times the level the state has deemed dangerous enough to require investigation. Dow is offering to pay for an independent study of the actual health impact of dioxin on Midland residents. Environmentalists have been further upset by the release early this year of state tests in 2000 suggesting that large areas of the Tittabawassee and Saginaw River basins downstream from Midland may also be polluted with dioxin.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, with the recent retirement of Mr. Feerer, every major Dow champion of the Michigan program has left the company or moved to a new position. ''I'm very disappointed,'' Ms. Greer said, ''that nothing is left of the cooperation.''</p>
