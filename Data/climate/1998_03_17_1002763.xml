        <p>IF there is a great guru among the relatively small group of scientists who try to fathom the present and future behavior of the earth's climate by studying how it has behaved in the past, it has to be 66-year-old Wallace S. Broecker: part crusty curmudgeon and blunt-spoken iconoclast, part imp and practical joker -- but all intellect.</p>
        <p>''I have a mind that leaps around a lot,'' says the perpetually youthful geochemist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, whose still-reddish hair sets off a leprechaun's twinkle. That leaping brain, he says, has led some people to accuse him of having a short attention span.  But many colleagues say nimbleness of mind has enabled Wally Broecker, more than any other person, to set the research agenda in the burningly relevant field of paleoclimatology.</p>
        <p>His influence, they say, stems from a prodigious knowledge acquired over four decades of how the sun, the oceans, the land, the atmosphere, ice and vegetation work together to shape the earth's climate; an ability to fashion that knowledge into a coherent picture and a quickness to discern how emerging bits of information and insight fit into or alter the picture.</p>
        <p>A good scientist, Dr. Broecker once said, ought to be working on 27 things at once, pushing each idea as far as it can go, dropping it when progress stalls, then coming back to it later. ''No scientist can do that,'' says Dr. Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University, regarded as no slouch in the field himself, ''but Wally can.''</p>
        <p>His office on the Lamont-Doherty campus just west of the Hudson River at Palisades, N.Y., is stuffed with bric-a-brac which suggest a mind that is not only nimble but also randomly playful and slightly off center.  Among the items are a Mickey Mouse hat, a dried piranha, a Dolly Parton poster and the brightly painted head of a Neanderthal man on a mannequin wearing a dress and a badge that says ''Scrooge Was Right.''</p>
        <p>''I like odd things like that,'' Dr. Broecker said.</p>
        <p>But there is no computer to be seen. A computer, he explained, ''short-circuits'' one's thinking about how the earth-ocean-atmosphere system really works. So, although he sometimes relies on other people's computer analyses of parts of a problem, he mostly puzzles out his ideas about once-and-future climates with a pencil, on plain white paper.</p>
        <p>The product of Dr. Broecker's thinking that has propelled him into public view of late is his statement that ''the climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks.'' The reference, of course, is to the present-day human impact on the climate system, chiefly through emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, a product of burning fossil fuels like coal and oil.</p>
        <p>Disturb the climate system enough, Dr. Broecker argues, and it may react with unpleasant surprises. ''The earth's climate is very volatile; it can do some weird things,'' he says. Among the weirdest are sharp, rapid warmings and coolings that can transform the global climate in a human lifetime or even within a decade.</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker was one of the earliest to advance the view that such changes can occur, in the mid-1980's, and he has been its foremost proponent ever since. Lately, chemical clues of past changes, extracted from ocean and lake sediment and ice sheets, have proliferated, bolstering his pioneering conclusions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker has linked these abrupt changes in past climates to the on-again, off-again action of vast, deep ocean currents, mightier than a hundred Amazon Rivers, that transport great amounts of heat around the planet, shaping the climate of much of the globe. This ''great conveyor belt,'' as he calls it, is perhaps the idea with which he is most closely associated.</p>
        <p>The genesis of his interest in the idea, back in 1984, was a colleague's revelation that ice age climates appeared to shift sharply back and forth between two stable states.  What could cause this? The next day, using his knowledge of the deep ocean current, he sat down and calculated that it delivered fully 30 percent as much heat to the North Atlantic as comes from the sun. ''Whoo-ee!'' he thought. Turn the conveyor off, and the impact on climate would be sudden and huge.</p>
        <p>Today, he makes no bones about his belief that if the world warms as much as computer models predict, just a few degrees, it could set off a chain of events that would abruptly slow or stop the conveyor, with disruptive results for much of the world. The most disruptive, he believes, would be brief but large ''flickers'' in global temperature as the climate readjusts itself not smoothly, but in fits and starts.</p>
        <p>In a paper he has been writing lately, he postulates the somewhat surprising idea that cutting off the conveyor late in the next century, as computer models suggest might happen, would make Europe somewhat cooler than it is now, while at the same time partly offsetting whatever global warming takes place in much of the rest of the world over the next century.</p>
        <p>The bad part ''would be the on-and-off flickers, because they'd be unpredictable,'' he says with a flat Chicago accent. In the past, he pointed out, such flickers have have produced drastic changes in temperature within periods as short as five years. If this happened in the future, he says, it could mean disaster for world agriculture at a time when the earth's human population might have doubled.</p>
        <p>He is quick to note that this grim possibility hinges on a lot of things, not least the accuracy of the computer models that predict both how warm the world will get in the decades ahead and how the warmth might affect the workings of the conveyor. How good are the models?  ''Who knows?'' he says.</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker ponders these problems starting in the morning at his home study in Closter, N.J., after the cats have been fed, the paper has been read and he has chatted a bit with his wife, Grace, with whom he has raised six children.</p>
        <p>Among his intellectual attributes, acquaintances say, are a skepticism that leads him to home in on exceptions to the rule, which jars him out of intellectual complacency and stimulates further thinking, and an extroverted personality as volatile as the climate system he studies. He is known for blunt honesty, a self-confessed volcanic temper and a reluctance to suffer sloppy thinkers gladly, balanced by a sense of fun that has made him an incorrigible practical joker.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, when cultural and scientific openings to China were relatively new for Americans, a top Chinese scientific official visited Dr. George Kukla, Dr. Broecker's close  friend and a colleague at Lamont-Doherty. As told by Dr. Kukla, the Chinese guest had asked especially to meet Dr. Broecker. Late that evening, Dr. Kukla got into his station wagon to drive the visitor back to his hotel. He stepped on the gas and the engine revved but the car did not move; it had been put up on blocks. From the bushes came muffled laughter. Out walked Dr. Broecker and another friend and colleague, Dr. Dorothy Peteet.</p>
        <p>''May I introduce you to Professor Broecker?'' Dr. Kukla snapped in an angry voice. Embarrassed, Dr. Broecker tried to recover by asking if they made jokes like that in China. ''Yes,'' said the visitor, ''but only children.'' Dr. Broecker still chuckles at the memory.</p>
        <p>''It was like that constantly,'' said Dr. James White, a geochemist at the University of Colorado, one of many former Broecker students who have fanned out into the paleoclimatology community over the years. At the same time, said Dr. White, Dr. Broecker ''could just go absolutely red in the face, livid, mad at me,'' adding, ''But 10 minutes later all is fine, and he never got mad on personal things; it was always on the science, if I was doing something dumb.'' The Broecker attitude was, ''You've got to respect the science.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker says: ''There's something sacred about science. I get my delight out of finding the truth but I also don't like to see it monkeyed with.''</p>
        <p>Once, confronted by a Federal bureacrat's demands that he be specific about what a particular piece of research would produce, he told the official that he produced ideas and that ideas could not be predicted in advance. Later he tried to have the man dismissed, and when a higher official vacillated, Dr. Broecker slammed down a copy of ''Profiles in Courage'' on the man's table and stalked out. ''Wally plays to win,'' says a colleague.</p>
        <p>Both Dr. Peteet and Dr. Broecker  grew up in fundamentalist Christian families, she in Georgia and he in Chicago, where his father ran a gas station and young Wally attended Wheaton College, a fundamentalist institution, before transferring to Columbia in 1952. (He now describes himself as areligious.) The two professors have often talked about the relationship between science and a fundamentalist upbringing. In Dr. Broecker's case, Dr. Peteet believes, the Christian insistence on honesty took firm root and infuses his scientific work. But his skepticism, she believes, is probably traceable to rebellion against the dogma and blind faith of fundamentalist Christianity.</p>
        <p>This may be, she says, why both she and Dr. Broecker tend to focus not on overall patterns of climatic functioning that constitute conventional wisdom, but rather on ''things that don't fit.'' For instance, she said, there was a time when scientists at Lamont believed that periodic changes in the earth's position relative to the sun, then a particularly hot idea, explained the ebb and flow of ice ages. But Dr. Broecker focused on a prominent exception to the rule:  a brief, sudden plunge into near-glacial conditions, called the Younger Dryas period, that occurred about 12,000 years ago, after the last ice age had already ended.</p>
        <p>Digging for answers to the unexplainable, said Dr. Peteet, ''that's what makes somebody good,'' adding, ''He gets excited about it.'' (The changes in the relative positions of the earth and sun still are considered the basic trigger for ice ages, but it turned out that the most likely explanation for the Younger Dryas was a cessation of the ocean heat conveyor.)</p>
        <p>The most productive thinking, says Dr. Broecker, happens when ''you realize that something you've held as a truth is wrong, and therefore everything that depends on it unravels, so then you're in confusion and you start to rethink the problem.'' He learned early, he says, never to ''consider any thought you've had as being sacred, because that's the worst thing you can get into.''</p>
        <p>While Dr. Broecker is viewed mainly as an idea man, he scarcely functions in a vacuum devoid of concrete data. He began his career as director of the radiocarbon dating laboratory at Lamont, and his textbook, ''Tracers in the Sea,'' is still standard reading for scientists who use chemical clues to investigate climate. The shells of foraminifera, tiny ocean animals whose bodies carry the chemical traces of past climatic change, are Dr. Broecker's stock in trade. A co-worker has framed some pieces of popcorn that uncannily resemble the tiny animals, and placed them on Dr. Broecker's wall with the label, ''Wally's Bugs.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker says he sees one of his functions as that of discerning and ''keeping track of bottom lines'' in the welter of new knowledge about virtually every aspect of the earth-atmosphere-ocean system. ''It's hard to find something he hasn't touched,'' says Dr. Alley. This is clearly reflected, Dr. Alley says, in indices that keep track of which scientists are most frequently cited by others: ''If you open up to the Broecker page, it's usually the Broecker pages; it's just phenomenal the impact he has.''</p>
        <p>He has taken a few of what some people might see as improbable fliers. For instance, he and a colleague once investigated the feasibility of neutralizing global warming by using airplanes to spread droplets of sulfur dioxide through the stratosphere. These would reflect the Sun's heat, cooling the planet. They calculated that it could be done by using 700 Boeing 747's to release the droplets around the clock, at a cost of about $40 billion a year. The general response, he says, was, ''Well, Wally, this is interesting, but the world is not ready for this kind of stuff.'' He believes, however, that the strategy is ''an intelligent insurance policy'' if the climate changes catastrophically and people someday get desperate.</p>
        <p>Will people deliberately manipulate the earth's climate on a large scale in the future? ''Much as I dislike it,'' he says, ''you can see that the temptation is going to be very high and the capability to do it will become very high, and so whether we'll resist, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker could retire, but he has no plans to do so and is not resting on his laurels. ''No one lives on their past successes,'' he says. ''It isn't very satisfying. You live on what you're doing this year, this month. My great joy in life comes in figuring something out. I figure something out about every six months or so, and I write about it and encourage research on it, and that's the joy of life.''</p>
