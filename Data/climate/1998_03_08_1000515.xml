        <p>Martha on Martha</p>
        <p>The real Martha Stewart will stand up and speak for herself on Thursday in Westport.

        <p>Martha on Martha</p>
        <p>The real Martha Stewart will stand up and speak for herself on Thursday in Westport. Presumably the hyperbole, rumors, putdowns and sendups generated by her journey to fame and fortune will be slipped into perspective when Ms. Stewart delivers a talk about ''The Evolution of One Woman's Career.'' Hers, of course.</p>
        <p>A noon luncheon, open to the public for $60 a person at the Inn at Longshore, has been arranged by the Westport Chamber of Commerce in celebration of Working Women's Week. Even her detractors admit that no one works harder than Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>In a nutshell preview: she was a model while attending Barnard College, then became a Wall Street stockbroker before establishing a catering business that led to, well -- unless you have been visiting cousins on Mars for too long, you know what.</p>
        <p>For reservations, the telephone number is (203) 227-9234, or fax (203) 454-4019.</p>
        <p>What the Ice Tells</p>
        <p>Last month, Myron Arms's book,  ''Riddle of the Ice,'' was published by Anchor-Doubleday, recounting his three-month 1994 sea voyage from Woods Hole, Mass., with five scientists aboard that may have provided clues to identifying the earth's global climate control center.</p>
        <p>This week, he will give two lectures on the subject, on Thursday at 8 P.M. at Staples High School in Westport, and on Friday at 7:30 P.M. at Central Middle School in Greenwich.</p>
        <p>In trying to explain a climatic anomaly that occurred on a similar voyage in 1991, when his 50-foot fiberglass cutter, Brendan's Isle, had to turn back because of impassable ice, he spent three years planning a return trip.</p>
        <p>''We had been stopped at the southern tip of the Labrador peninsula by ice that should not have been there, according to decades worth of record keeping,'' he said. His research indicated that it might be a signal that global warming allowed the ice to travel south.</p>
        <p>''Between 1,000 and 1,500 miles along the eastern coast of Canada and western coast of Greenland, temperatures are dropping,'' he said. ''In order to get back to where we were we had to go north into the high Arctic on a warm current and circle around to the cold side in summer, when the ice was melting. What goes on there may be the driving force for climatic events all over the world.''</p>
        <p>The Westport program is free and the number for more information is (203) 341-1209. A $5 donation is requested in Greenwich, where the number to call is (203) 625-7474.</p>
        <p>Laughing Heads</p>
        <p>When Carl Reiner, Flip Wilson, Henry Winkler and Florence Henderson get together in front of a live audience, as they will on Saturday at 8 P.M. at The Bushnell in Hartford, a good time is a given.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Forum has gathered these television icons for an evening dedicated to fond memories of the tube, assertion of bragging rights for awards and longevity, some what-have-you-done-lately jabs, and lots of laughter.</p>
        <p>Will Miller, author, spokesperson for ''Nick at Nite,'' and comedian, will be the moderator. Tickets at $25, $35, and $45 may be obtained by calling (860) 509-2090.</p>
        <p>Harpsichord Heaven</p>
        <p>The harpsichord capital of the world is . . . Stonington?</p>
        <p>Apparently. D. Jacques Way and Marc Ducornet produce more early keyboard instruments in their Stonington atelier than anyone anywhere else. Their instruments have been acquired by the New York Philharmonic, the Royal Academy of Music in London, and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, among others.</p>
        <p>A concert introducing their historically authentic Flemish harpsichords will be held on Saturday at 4 P.M. Tickets are $30, including refreshments. Proceeds will establish an endowment fund for the preservation of the Stonington Historical Society's Capt. Nathaniel B. Palmer House, where the concert will be performed. Edward Parmentier will perform. The number for reservations or more information is (860) 535-8445.</p>
        <p>London-New Haven</p>
        <p>Long Wharf has a counterpart in London, and the two theaters are exchanging productions. David Rabe's ''Question of Mercy'' will play the Bush Theater over there from April 22 through May 23, and Joe Penhall's ''Love and Understanding'' opens here on Friday through April 12.</p>
        <p>Established 25 years ago, the Bush is devoted, as Long Wharf is, to the development of new works for the stage. And like Long Wharf, which operates in a New Haven waterfront warehouse, it has been located for all of its 25 years in an off-beat spot, above the Bush Pub.</p>
        <p>Mutual admiration, based on dual histories of theatrical successes, innovations and launchings of many notable playwriting, directing, designing and acting careers, may herald more such events in future.</p>
        <p>The English play is about a young, upwardly mobile couple and a footloose friend who drops by unexpectedly and tears their orderly lives into psychological shreds. Funny, intense, and fast paced, it has been a hit in London, drawing praise for its  29-year-old author.</p>
        <p>Performances at Long Wharf's Stage II are on Tuesday at 7, Wednesday through Friday at 8, Saturday at 4 and 8:30, Sunday at 2 and 7. The number is (203) 787-4282 for tickets, priced from $15 to $39.</p>
        <p>Molding Stars</p>
        <p>Peter Rubino has sculpted portraits of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Wayne Gretsky, Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr, and his monument, ''Mother of All Life'' is in the Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel.</p>
        <p>Today at 2 P.M. Mr. Rubino will show how it's done at the Wilton Library. Within half an hour he will take raw clay and mold it into a recognizable head, with his audience invited to bid on the completed bust to take home.</p>
        <p>Currently a teacher at the National Academy of Fine Arts in Manhattan, he also conducts workshops at the Scottsdale Artist's School in Arizona and the Academy of Fine Arts in Colorado. His new book, ''The Portrait in Clay'' is a workshop course,  with step-by-step photographs.</p>
        <p>Admission the demonstration is free, but registration at the circulation desk is requested. The library is at137 Old Ridgefield Road and the number for more information is (203) 762-3950.</p>
        <p>Appraising Treasures</p>
        <p>Christie's will hold a lecture and appraisal event at the Keeler Tavern, 132 Main Street in Ridgefield on Tuesday, beginning at 10 A.M. During the morning, Christie's specialists in American furniture and decorative arts, Chinese porcelains and  jewelry and gemstones will lecture.</p>
        <p>After lunch the same three specialists -- Martha Willoughby, Becky MacGuire and Molly Burns -- will conduct the appraisals, limited to three objects per visitor. Only those attending the morning session will be eligible for appraisals. Photographs, dimensions, and small parts, such as drawers, are suitable substitutes for pieces too large to transport.</p>
        <p>Admission is $20, including appraisals. The number is (203) 438-5485 for reservations.</p>
