        <p>Senator Al Gore published a best-selling book seven months ago that is the most graphic analysis of the world's environmental condition and the most advanced plan for economic solutions that has ever been written by an American politician.</p>
        <p>Reviews at the time were favorable, commending the book's "thoughtfulness" and "style."</p>
        <p>But in the days since the Tennessee Democrat was nominated to be Gov. Bill Clinton's running mate, the book, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit" (Houghton Mifflin), has come under a new wave of scrutiny, not least from the Bush-Quayle campaign.</p>
        <p>Its call for new taxes, new government environmental programs and a new philosophy for how humanity regards the environment and the economy could make the book one of the political classics of its time. It could also become a valuable weapon for the Republicans. May Stir Wide Debate</p>
        <p>At the very least, the book seems likely to prompt the first full-throated debate at the Presidential level on whether trade-offs are necessary to balance the health of the economy and the environment. Enviromnentalists and many scientists are embracing the book as a breakthrough in fresh thinking; some economists and other scientists are attacking it as scientifically specious, economically dangerous and directly contradictory to the Democratic platform extolling jobs and economic growth.</p>
        <p>Torie Clarke, the spokeswoman for the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign, said today that the campaign saw the book's pointed recommendations for new taxes on coal and oil, more foreign aid and more governmental action to curb global environmental deterioration as weapons.</p>
        <p>"For starters," she said, "Gore should have spent less of the taxpayers' time and money on his own book and a little bit more time on legislation. We have taken a look at his legislative record as a Senator. We found two pieces of his legislation that have been approved. One is an Earth Day proclamation, and the other is a resolution of encouragement to Antarctic treaty negotiatiors." Fat Cats and Smokestacks</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore fired back today in a telephone interview. "They are in a state of extraordinary political panic," he said. "The American people are fed up with the Bush-Quayle approach of responding to only the wealthy privileged few, and that is especially true of the environment. They couldn't care less about the people who live downwind of pollution. They only care about the fat cat who owns the smokestack."</p>
        <p>In the coming weeks, the debate will be no less contentious, but it could become more substantive. The reason is that in "Earth in the Balance" the author describes being a "witness to humankind's assault on the earth" and offers solutions that are much more specific and trenchant than is usual in books from political leaders.</p>
        <p>The thesis of Mr. Gore's book is that a "global ecological crisis" spells a catastrophe for civilization unless prompt action is taken. He proposes three paths: new market incentives, new government programs and a new philosophy to define mankind's relationship with nature.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Gore proposes new taxes on oil, coal, minerals, wood and other "virgin materials" to curtail global warming, deforestation and misuse of land by mining. He proposes to offset the tax increases, and thus the probable rise in the price of energy and materials, by lowering income taxes. New Network of Incentives</p>
        <p>The result would be a new system of economic incentives. Taxes would be increased for environmentally destructive activities and reduced for economically constructive activities like work and saving.</p>
        <p>Where incentives did not work, government action would, he says. Mr. Gore calls for new global environmental regulations to protect resources, programs to stabilize population, new environmental treaties, new means for assessing technologies on the basis of their risk to health and the environment, phasing out internal-combustion engines within 25 years and a host of other government actions.</p>
        <p>The third path he proposes involves changing attitudes. The current view, that the environment is a marginal issue with economic needs taking precedence, must be radically altered, the book says. Instead, Mr. Gore says, the ecosystem must be seen as the foundation on which the economy will flourish or perish in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Such a notion turns traditional Western thinking on its head. For centuries, man's dominion over earth, and the exploitation of resources to develop ever more powerful and efficient technologies, has been seen as the engine that drives civilization. Mr. Gore urges the world to become "sufficiently aroused by a shared sense of urgent danger" to reverse this "logic of world civilization."</p>
        <p>"As long as civilization as a whole, with its vast technological power, continues to follow a pattern of thinking that encourages the domination and exploitation of the natural world for short-term gains, this juggernaut will continue to devastate the earth no matter what any of us does," he writes. "I have come to believe that we must take bold and unequivocal action: we must make the rescue of the environment the central organizing principle for civilization." Praise and Counterattack</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's views are "beyond anything we are hearing now in political dialogue," said Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, an environmental group in Washington, whose books on philosophy and nature have influenced Mr. Gore. "If we are to take this analysis and blueprint seriously, it portends a revolutionary change in political outlook in the 21st century. It's one I think the younger generation will flock to."</p>
        <p>But some scientists, economists and conservative political groups have begun a counterattack intended to prevent the book from moving from the edges of national politics to its center.</p>
        <p>Dr. S. Fred Singer, an atmospheric and space physicist who is a professor of environmental science at the University of Virginia, said Mr. Gore had "exaggerated" the threat from global climate change, and that "many" in the scientific community simply do not agree with his thesis that the earth is on the edge of calamity.</p>
        <p>"It's wrong on many counts, and he should know better because we have told him so," said Dr. Singer, who is one of the leaders of a group of American scientists who discount the threat from global climate change. "On global warming, as far as we can tell from surveys we have done, the scientific community is not in agreement with him. The majority feels that this is a problem that needs to be watched, but there is no immediate danger." Survey Shows Divisions</p>
        <p>A survey of climate scientists earlier this year by Greenpeace, the international environmental group, found those who responded about evenly divided. When asked whether current policies "run a serious risk of instigating a runaway greenhouse effect," 47 percent of 113 scientists answering said "probably not." Forty-five percent replied "probably" or "possibly."</p>
        <p>The survey did not reflect the considerable causes for concern outlined by a succession of international and national scientific panels over the last few years. In 1990, an international panel of scientists convened by the United Nations reported that the earth has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the last century as levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased by 25 percent.</p>
        <p>The panel said if carbon dioxide, methane and other "greenhouse gases" were not controlled, average global temperatures could increase 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the 21st century, causing flooding from the melting of polar ice, food production failures and other environmental havoc.</p>
        <p>The National Academy of Sciences in 1991 urged the Bush Administration to act promptly to reduce the threat of global warming, including raising automobile fuel efficiency standards and improving energy requirements for buildings and appliances.</p>
        <p>"Among the people I work with, we all think global warming is a threat," said Dr. Edward Dlugokencky, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado in Boulder. "Those who think it is not represent a minority view in the scientific community."</p>
        <p>Conservative public policy groups have also attacked Senator Gore's book. Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market policy group in Washington, said the book held a basic contradiction with the Clinton-Gore campaign message of new jobs, new technologies and change. "This book says that before we let new technology happen, we need to look at the risk," said Mr. Smith. "Doesn't that mean slower introductions of technology, slower job growth and economic stagnation?" Reaction From Gore</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore disagreed with this interpretation today. "I'm advocating the assessment of any technologies developed with public funds, but in no way am I calling for any government gatekeeper role for the private sector," he said.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Adler, a staff member of the institute, added that Mr. Gore "thinks that every environmental problem needs a program." Mr. Adler criticized the nation's record of management for big public environmental programs, especially the one most closely associated with Mr. Gore, the Superfund program for cleaning up worst toxic waste sites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore responded that he did not advocate "large centralized government programs that were the hallmark of government in the past." He added, "These initiatives are precise, carefully targeted and designed to stimulate a shift in approach an to provide new incentives."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said current policies "are costing the United State millions of jobs by pretending that our strategy should be to protect the old polluting, inefficient ways of the past."</p>
        <p>"This is coming at a time when Japan and now Germany are openly saying that the biggest new market in the history of world business is the market for new technologies and processes that foster economic progress without environmental destruction," Mr. Gore said, terming the Administration's view "a real head-in-the-sand approach."</p>
