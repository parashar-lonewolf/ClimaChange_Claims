        <p>LEAD: TWO designs, one featuring giant lobsters and one with canopies that float in the wind, were judged the best of 160 entered in a nationwide contest to design a gas station here, but it remains to be seen whether either will be built.</p>
        <p>TWO designs, one featuring giant lobsters and one with canopies that float in the wind, were judged the best of 160 entered in a nationwide contest to design a gas station here, but it remains to be seen whether either will be built.</p>
        <p>''I can't handle giant lobsters looking at me for the next 20 years,'' said Charles Sheehan, operations manager of C. N. Brown Company of South Paris, Me., which sponsored the competition. ''I prefer the other one, but I'm waiting to see what the people of Portland think of the other entries as well.''</p>
        <p>The company, which owns or services some 200 gas stations throughout New England, agreed to sponsor the competition after the Portland City Council balked at its design for renovating a Mobil station near a historic park and post office. The station is at an entrance to downtown in an area many local residents are working to revitalize.</p>
        <p>A jury of seven, including architects, a historian, an art school president and a city official, chose the two designs because the architects ''knew what to draw and how to draw it.''</p>
        <p>The lobster entry, by Willis Pember and Andrew Blanda of the Philadelphia firm of Otto Speer, has aroused the biggest response. It features a standard building with gas pumps in front, but also includes lobsters 25 feet high and 60 feet long atop circular canopies.</p>
        <p>''We were thinking about things that would grab people's attention,'' said Mr. Blanda. ''When we thought of Maine, we thought of lobsters and we screamed. What architecture needs right now is a little bit of levity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pember said that much roadside architecture suffers from excessive seriousness while ''we were seriously funny.''</p>
        <p>William Collett of Cambridge, Mass., who submitted the other winning entry, designed a station that he said would pay homage to fossil fuels. The floating canopies, he said, can look like pterosaur wings or drilling rigs. The building also sports a huge Pegasus, Mobil's trademark.</p>
        <p>The other entries varied from simple brick structures to a small-scale version of a Portland train station that was torn down. Oil pumps, lighthouses, boats and gulls were popular.</p>
        <p>C.N. Brown officials hope to begin the renovation this year and expect to spend $500,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheehan, adding that he did not rule out building other designs on other sites in the future. ''We saw a lot of good designs there and would hate to see those ideas just put on a shelf.''</p>
