        <p>Alexandra Krauter paid little attention as the digits on the gasoline pump flashed upward. Ms. Krauter, a 29-year-old woman who works in a Frankfurt restaurant, was not even sure how much she was paying (1.15 euros a liter, or the equivalent of $5.31 a gallon).</p>
        <p>''I don't think the price is appropriate, but I don't care that much about gas prices,'' Ms. Krauter, as she waited restlessly beside her pint-size Fiat. ''I've got other things to worry about.''</p>
        <p>Few Europeans are as nonchalant about the high cost of fuel as Ms. Krauter. But her attitude gets at a basic difference in the way Europeans and Americans view the current spike in the price of oil.</p>
        <p>While the arrival of $2 a gallon gasoline has rattled many Americans -- reviving memories of the oil shocks of the 1970's -- Europeans have reacted with relative equanimity. Gas is so heavily taxed in most European countries that a jump in the market price is less noticeable here. And the recent strength of the euro versus the dollar has insulated consumers.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Europe, after three decades of seeking alternatives to oil, is somewhat less vulnerable to the effects of higher crude prices. Oil and natural gas still lubricate Europe's economy, to be sure, and industrial countries like Germany remain among the world's largest importers.</p>
        <p>But for a variety of reasons -- ranging from smaller cars and shorter commutes to the windmills that dot the countryside from Denmark to Spain -- Europe does not view $40-a-barrel oil with the same alarm. Indeed, some here see it as a chance to redouble Europe's campaign to wean itself from fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>''We talked about high oil prices in the past, but it was hypothetical,'' said Peter Ahmels, the president of Germany's Federal Association on Wind Energy. ''Now people are asking, 'Could the oil supply run out?'''</p>
        <p>In 2000, a rise in the price of fuel was compounded by higher taxes, which ignited protests and blockades by truckers from Britain to Germany. This time, officials here hope, the high prices will rekindle an appreciation for windmills, solar panels and other alternative energy sources.</p>
        <p>Germany is the world's largest producer of wind energy, with 15,800 turbines generating 15,000 megawatts of electricity, or 6 percent of its total supply. But parts of the country, notably Bavaria, have been loath to build windmills because of complaints that they blight the landscape.</p>
        <p>Now, with higher oil prices, those objections may lose some force. ''It's one very strong point for us,'' Mr. Ahmels said.</p>
        <p>With a renewed commitment, he said he thinks Germany could nearly double its wind generation capacity by 2010. And the development of offshore windmill farms could eventually enable wind to account for 15 percent of Germany's electricity supply, despite the country's relatively meager coastline.</p>
        <p>Solar energy is also growing, with the production of solar cells almost doubling last year. The German solar power industry, which is subsidized by the government, will generate more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in revenue in 2004, according to an industry group.</p>
        <p>Europe's push for renewable energy began as a response to the 1970's oil shock, which was as traumatic here as in the United States. Over the years, however, the campaign for clean energy has been driven less by fears of dwindling oil than a desire to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>In Germany, the Green Party, far from being a lobbying group on the sidelines, is part of the government. Germans accept, as environmental imperative, things that Americans would find bizarre -- like sorting household garbage into four separate bins for recycling, or paying 70 cents of every euro at the pump in the form of taxes, to drive down fuel consumption.</p>
        <p>''It is a Green position to force an energy policy which reduces our dependency on oil,'' said Rezzo Schlauch, a Green Party member who is state secretary in the ministry of economics and labor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schlauch said that high oil prices are helpful insofar as they give new impetus to such policies. He noted that there would be a major conference on renewable energy in Bonn, starting on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>For all the talk of living with less oil, there is evidence that Europe could use a kick. The European Union set a target of producing 22 percent of its electricity, and 12 percent of all energy, through renewable sources by 2010. Now, though, Brussels admits that it will miss the target unless its member countries increase subsidies and other forms of aid for the industry.</p>
        <p>Without more support, the commission said, renewable energy will account for only 10 percent of total energy production by 2010. It currently accounts for 6 percent, compared to 40 percent for oil, 23 percent for natural gas, 16 percent for nuclear power, and 15 percent for solid fuels.</p>
        <p>While wind energy is growing in Germany and Denmark, it has been hobbled in France because the electric utility does not want other energy companies using its power grid. In Britain, until recently, builders of windmills could not obtain permits from local authorities to erect turbines.</p>
        <p>A long-term increase in oil prices could sweep aside many such objections, said advocates of renewable energy.</p>
        <p>''It affects these debates drastically,'' said Stephan Singer, director of climate and energy policy at the World Wide Fund for Nature in Brussels. ''The driver for a renewable energy policy so far has been the climate. Now, the debates are going to be about energy security and reducing dependency.''</p>
        <p>Europe, despite its progress in developing alternative energy, remains heavily dependent on imported oil. Moreover, close-at-hand fields in the North Sea and Norway are peaking in production, which means Europeans face a future of even greater reliance on oil from the OPEC countries.</p>
        <p>Political leaders here have been no less vocal than their American counterparts in calling on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise its output when it meets in Beirut this week. That could bring down prices, which peaked at $41.85 a barrel on May 17 and are now just below $40. With the weekend attack in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, prices are expected to rise when regular trading resumes Tuesday after Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>At the same time, officials have been trying to dampen fears that oil prices will derail Europe's fragile economic recovery. For the moment, oil has made itself felt mostly in the form of higher prices. Consumer prices rose 2.5 percent in May, the highest level in more than two years.</p>
        <p>That is higher than the 2 percent inflation target favored by the European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the 12 countries that use the euro. But few economists expect the bank to react sharply by, say, raising interest rates when it meets in Frankfurt on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''There is a point in leaders saying, 'There's no need to overreact,''' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''The effect of this is much less than in the 1970's.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mayer noted that in addition to the high fuel taxes, which proportionally make crude prices less palpable within the total cost of gas, Europe has been insulated by a strong euro, which has helped it in the dollar-denominated oil market.</p>
        <p>The question is how much a sustained price rise would hamper Europe's already anemic economic growth.</p>
        <p>The rule of thumb, Mr. Mayer said, is that an increase from $30 a barrel to $40 a barrel would trim 0.4 percentage point from annual growth. That is a significant bite, given that the European Commission has forecast growth of 1.7 percent in 2004.</p>
        <p>European companies, like the German chemical giant BASF, which are heavy consumers of petroleum, have warned that their profits will be dented. Airlines like British Airways and Lufthansa have added a surcharge on some flights to offset the higher cost of fuel.</p>
        <p>There is little relief in sight for European motorists.</p>
        <p>Taxi drivers in London have called on the city to raise cab fares to account for the higher cost of diesel. Fares were lifted by 3.4 percent last April, however, and officials said they were unlikely to raise them again so soon.</p>
        <p>Auto clubs in Germany are pushing for a cut in fuel taxes, which are among the highest in Europe.</p>
        <p>''The tax is not changing behavior by forcing people to buy smaller cars. It's just forcing people off the road,'' said Johannes Hübner, the director of communications for the Auto Club of Germany.</p>
        <p>European leaders resisted demands to lower taxes amid the protests of 2000, and they are likely to do the so again. Raising gas taxes is equally unlikely, given the uproar it caused four years ago.</p>
        <p>But officials realize they cannot stand still. ''Our sources of oil are in the Middle East, and the Middle East is very unstable,'' Mr. Schlauch of the Green Party said. ''We have to do things differently.''</p>
