        <p>LEAD: The hot, stagnant air that engulfed the New York region for most of the summer created unusual amounts of smog and the highest levels of ozone, its main component, in a decade.</p>
        <p>The hot, stagnant air that engulfed the New York region for most of the summer created unusual amounts of smog and the highest levels of ozone, its main component, in a decade.</p>
        <p>But the pollution was not due to any sudden, large increase in the man-made sources that must be present for its formation. Rather, it was due to a scarcity of the natural elements - wind, rain, clouds and coolness - that help prevent ozone's buildup, according to environmental officials and scientists.</p>
        <p>Because they see no signs of a quick decline in the human contributions to ozone pollution - from major sources like car and factory exhaust to small ones like some fingernail polishes - the experts say the main hope for relief in future summers will simply be a change in the weather, like occurred last week. If this summer's oppressive heat and stagnant air become common, the result will be a severe decline in air quality. Breathing Problems</p>
        <p>''It may be that this summer is just a unique red herring,'' said Dr. John Penek, a pulmonary specialist who is the medical director of the Breathing Center, a clinic in Morristown, N.J.</p>
        <p>''But if the quality of air we're seeing now is something that's going to repeat itself,'' he added, ''then it's easy to imagine the possibility of long-term consequences.'' These, he said, would include an increase in chronic breathing problems and disorders related to asthma.</p>
        <p>Ozone, formed when gas vapors and other hydrocarbons mix with heat and sunlight, creates breathing problems by damaging lungs. It also destroys plant tissue.</p>
        <p>New York has already exceeded Federal safety levels for the pollutant on 27 days this year, compared with 16 in all of last year and 7 the year before, said Casimir Czarkowski, the supervisor of the air monitoring division at the regional office of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The Hotter, the More Ozone</p>
        <p>No one, of course, can foretell precisely what the weather will be like in coming years, but many scientists believe that temperatures are gradually rising because of worldwide pollution that has created a ''greenhouse effect'' in the stratosphere, increasing heat that contributes to ozone production. If so, the higher temperatures will make the outlook for reducing ozone pollution bleak.</p>
        <p>''The global warming is the wild card in all this,'' said Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer who is the director of the urban environment program of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''If the weather grows hotter in the next couple of decades, then we will really be in for a host of environmental problems, one of which will be increasing ozone.''</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, while ozone near the earth's surface is a major health concern, the ozone at greater altitudes is beneficial because it helps block dangerous rays from the sun. But because of other pollution, ozone is being depleted in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In general, surface ozone levels have increased this summer in the many areas of the country that have had unusually hot and muggy weather without the clouds and rain that help to reduce ozone and also without the wind that helps to dissipate it. But the levels have not risen in areas where the weather has been less unusual, including the Los Angeles basin, which has the worst ozone readings in the nation. Heading for a Record</p>
        <p>The Federal health standard for ozone is 0.125 parts per million; any readings above that level indicate ''unhealthful conditions'' and will prompt authorities to warn people with respiratory problems to curtail physical exertion.</p>
        <p>Having already exceeded that level on 27 days this year, New York is considered well on its way to surpassing the previous high of 38 days in 1980. On a few days the readings have topped 0.200 parts per million, a benchmark of very unhealthful conditions and a level at which people with breathing difficulties are advised to stay indoors. Those readings have occurred at stations in Newark and Bayonne, N.J., as well as in New York City.</p>
        <p>High levels of ozone are normally not recorded until early July, but this year they began in late May, said Conrad Simon, director of the air and waste management division of the Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in New York City. A Pervasive Problem</p>
        <p>It has not been confined to the metropolitan region. Unlike other types of pollution, ozone can be blown to faraway areas by the gentlest of breezes. At a monitoring station in the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., a Dutchess County community more than 80 miles north of New York City, the Federal safety level has been exceeded on 18 days this year.</p>
        <p>The peak levels, generally reached after the onset of breezes out of the south, have been around 0.175 parts per million, said a meterologist at the institute, Tony E. Restaino.</p>
        <p>Like many other cities in the country, New York has missed at least three Federal deadlines in the last several years for eliminating the high ozone levels. But Congress and Federal environmental officials have yet to impose the tough economic sanctions called for by the delays and instead have delayed the deadline itself.</p>
        <p>Ozone is only one of many components of urban pollution, but it is generally the most seasonal and the one most affected by the weather. Cooler conditions and rain in the last week or so, for example, have kept ozone levels within acceptable health standards. Carbon Monoxide Problem</p>
        <p>The New York region still has serious problems with carbon monoxide -it exceeded Federal safety levels on an average of 86 days a year in recent years - but the levels have not been particularly affected y this summer's weather. Carbon monoxide impairs the blood's ability to carry oxygen and can cause headaches, dizziness and nausea.</p>
        <p>Significant improvements have been made in the last two decades in reducing other sources of pollution, like soot, sulfur dioxide and lead.</p>
        <p>Some strides in reducing ozone levels were made in the 1970's, primarily through the installation of catalytic converters on automobiles, but the prospects for further reductions are not promising, several officials and environmental advocates said.</p>
        <p>The main problem is still the widespread reliance on automobiles, which spew more than half the hydrocarbons in urban air. Exhaust and vapors from factories is another major source of ozone pollution. Cars 'the Big Problem'</p>
        <p>''We have to look at a change in the patterns of use in the automobile,'' said William J. Muszynski, the acting regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. ''We've talked about that for so many years, and I don't know how long we're going to keep talking about it, but that's the big problem.''</p>
        <p>Many studies have shown yearly increases in driving in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. According to the New York City Department of Transportation, the number of cars entering or leaving Manhattan on an average weekday is 1.77 million, up from 1.49 million 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>All kinds of proposals to cut traffic in the city have been offered over the years - including $10 tolls for cars to get into the lower half of Manhattan -but few have been adopted. Uncertainties About Other Fuels</p>
        <p>One possible solution is greater use of clean-burning fuels like methanol, but no one can be sure whether cars that could run on them will be built.</p>
        <p>A smaller contributor to the higher ozone levels is gasoline vapor, and there is reason to expect improvement. Faced with Federal regulations, states are requiring gasoline stations to install devices that trap the vapors and return them to the tanks. Practically all stations in New York and New Jersey should have the devices by July 1990, Mr. Muszynski said.</p>
        <p>Regulations are also being imposed or considered for a variety of other chemicals and solvents - including those used to make certain kinds of nail polish, paint and lacquers and even to bake some kinds of bread.</p>
        <p>Improvements in controlling certain types of air pollution in the last few decades and the expectation of breakthroughs in devising cleaner technologies may offer reason for optimism about air quality.</p>
        <p>But many environmental advocates said the pollution this summer should be taken as a warning of how much needs to be done.</p>
        <p>''At best we have been treading water,'' said Mr. Goldstein, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, ''and at worst we have failed to undertake the kind of long-range planning and measures that will be necessary to bail us out when certain environmental conditions - such as the weather we've had this summer - recur.''</p>
