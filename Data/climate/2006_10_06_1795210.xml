        <p>Donald G. McNeil Jr. answered select reader questions regarding his article about the Monarch butterfly migration from this week's Science Times, as well as his essay about Brooklyn's squirrels.</p>
        <p>Q. Many readers asked how they (and/or their students) could become butterfly taggers and where they could buy seeds to create Monarch Way Stations or just attract butterflies into their gardens.</p>
        <p>A: Kits for doing both are sold through the Monarch Watch Project at the University of Kansas. Its Web site is www.monarchwatch.org and its telephone number is 800-780-9986. Way Station kits contain seeds of six species of milkweed and six other flowering plants. There will be a California edition of the kit available. (Monarchs west of the Rockies take different routes.) Monarch Watch also sells nets that are less likely to hurt butterflies than toy store ones.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, since the peak migration weeks are roughly the same each year in any area, (though they can be held up by weather, especially along the coast) readers could ask local nurseries to suggest fall-flowering plants. The Monarch Watch website has a chart for calculating the likely peak dates in your area. www.monarchwatch.org/tagmig/peak.html</p>
        <p>Q. Is there a location in the East Coast, as in Pacific Grove, Calif., where one can see these magnificent butterflies in large numbers? - G. Giridhar</p>
        <p>A. The Pacific Grove monarchs are part of the migration west of the Rockies, and overwinter there for months. Since the migrants on this side of the Rockies overwinter in Mexico, there is no place to the north where they can reliably be found on any given day. You may get lucky and find large masses anywhere along the coast waiting for the wind and weather to turn favorable. Cape May, at the southern tip of New Jersey is one of the most likely places. Thousands funnel through, and residents and state parks have created many butterfly gardens to draw them in. The Monarch Monitoring Project (different from Monarch Watch) does its annual census of butterflies passing through and its own tagging operation there. This year is looking like a record year right now.</p>
        <p>Q. When I was a young girl I remember being told that you shouldn't touch butterfly wings because it rubs off some sort of important ... (dust maybe) I think I was told it affects the way they fly. Obviously butterflies are now being touched in order to tag them, so, do you know where that "fact" about not touching butterflies came from? S. Allen</p>
        <p>A: All butterflies and moths have dust-like "scales" that can be knocked off or fall off with age. But monarch wings are remarkably tough and the scales stay on pretty well -- as you'd imagine, since they must flap for 2,000 miles. If you hold one, you'll feel that their wings are thicker and hardier than you might imagine, and their bodies are actually quite rubbery. (But you do need to be careful of their spindly legs.)</p>
        <p>Q. Has any correlation been made between the survival and trauma inflicted by enthusiastic taggers? It is a fun activity repeated in countless nature centers each fall. Could we get an accurate count without the stress and interruption of migration? -- B. Johnson</p>
        <p>A: Without tagging, it's pretty nigh impossible to figure out where a monarch migrated from. Thousands of tags from all over the United States are collected months later in Mexico, so it clearly doesn't impede many monarchs from making it. The process is over in 30 seconds or so, so as long as the tagger is careful, I don't see why it would be so traumatic.</p>
        <p>According to the Monarch Watch Project, you can even keep monarchs in a refrigerator for a couple of days without harming them (see the Web Site, monarchwatch.org, for details)</p>
        <p>I realize that many butterfly watchers and insect-rights activists oppose chloroforming and pinning butterflies and some oppose even catching them temporarily for tagging. As an omnivore wearing leather shoes right now, I'm in no position to pretend to be utterly neutral on animal rights. But the effort to save the Mexican wintering grounds is heavily funded by Americans who love seeing the monarchs come through each year. Without tagging, it would have been impossible to gather the data proving that the populations were connected.</p>
        <p>Q. My family has enjoyed watching the annual monarch migration since first noticing it when we lived in northwestern Arkansas and were able to time a four-second interval between butterflies. We now live on five acres of hardwood forest that is part of the Cedar Creek Purchase Area of the Mark Twain National Forest in Central Missouri. Several years ago we were lucky enough one evening to notice that the oak trees in our front yard had become an overnight stop for hundreds - if not thousands - of monarchs. They were hanging from the oak leaves and each other in numbers that I have never heard described outside of their wintering ground in Mexico, and were gone before we were the next morning. How much is know about how they seemingly travel together almost as though they are in a flock of butterflies? - V. Hall</p>
        <p>A: It's known that they do travel in flocks and roost together -- the flocks get larger as they travel south, of course. I guess finding each other is as inevitable as Yankee fans finding each other as they migrate toward the Bronx and Yankee Stadium: as more and more squeeze into ever-narrower channels, they are bound to form crowds. But whether and how they signal each other while doing that is not known. (The butterflies, I mean. Yankee fans, of course, have the Bronx cheer.)</p>
        <p>Q. Last week on Fire Island I saw these fellas meandering in a generally southwestern course about about 2-3 miles per hour....and we are not talking about 'as the crow flies'...so 6,000 miles at max speed of 3mph suggests that flying 'non stop' we are talking 2000 hours or 80+ cold, rainy, maybe snowy days....they arrive just in time for Christmas? S. McNeil</p>
        <p>A: They arrive in late October and early November (I was told that their arrival is taken by some as a sign of the return of lost souls for All Souls Day, celebrated in Mexico as the Day of the Dead, usually Nov. 2) It's actually about 2,000 miles. Without winds, monarchs fly about 12 miles an hour (though they are capable of brief sprints.) With the wind, the sky's the limit. On average, the migration advances about 50 miles a day. So you were watching some very laid-back fellas. But, hey -- it was Fire Island. (But, unlike Fire Island fellas, butterflies don't keep going all night, so you have to subtract night time from flight time.)</p>
        <p>Q. I have been enjoying the Monarch migration very much here in my oceanside neighborhood in Magnolia, Mass. On a recent sunny day at the coast I could count a dozen Monarchs on every goldenrod plant. The next day, in the rain, there were no butterflies to be seen. Where do the butterflies go when it rains? Is their migration affected by rainy weather? L. MacPhail</p>
        <p>A. When it rains or when the wind is blowing hard in the wrong direction, they hunker down in trees and bushes and wait till the weather improves.</p>
        <p>Q. Read your article with great interest and realized that perhaps the butterflies I've recently seen flitting by my window here at 27th and Park -- I'm on the 11th floor -- are monarchs. I'd always thought it unusual to see butterflies at these heights but then again, I've never seen a monarch at or near ground level. (Moths perhaps.) Is it possible that they are indeed wending their way through Manhattan? - S. Dinsay</p>
        <p>A: Absolutely possible. They have been spotted by gliders at 5,000 feet, but that is presumably when they are caught in thermals. When the weather is just right, large swarms have been seen moving at altitudes as high as 1,200 feet. And perhaps along Park Avenue, they are spotting penthouse gardens to stop in.</p>
        <p>Q. For years I have had many monarch butterflies in the milk-weed garden in my front yard here in Miami, Florida. Are they part of the migration or have they "dead-ended" here? I was always wondering about this. Thank you! S. Tabas</p>
        <p>A: Not all orange and black butterflies are monarchs, and -- more importantly -- not all monarchs migrate. I probably should have mentioned that in the article, but one runs out of space quickly. Florida does have monarchs that live and breed there year-round. In the Panhandle, many migratory monarchs can be seen heading for Texas and Mexico in the fall. Some confused or blown-off-course migrants, presumably, end up dead-ending in the Florida Keys. And some have been found many miles out at sea, clinging to oil platforms. It's not known if they are actually trying to migrate over the Gulf of Mexico (unlikely, because they don't normally fly at night) or if they were caught by off-shore winds. Some scientists have counted butterflies coming in from the sea and butterflies going out to sea and believe that they do realize they're in trouble and fight the breeze to get back on shore -- but it's hard to know what any given butterfly is thinking.</p>
        <p>Q. Although the article speaks to the need for more milkweed plants at the caterpillar stage, is there a problem of the adult migrating butterflies finding enough food to sustain them prior to reaching Texas? Currently our field here in Pa. has a lot of adult monarchs feeding but is this type of habitat being lost a problem as well? R. Waldman</p>
        <p>A. Yes, sometimes. While butterflies can sip nectar from a wide range of flowers (and their long tongues let them get into flowers that other insects can't) drought in areas in the path of the migration can kill millions. That's what scientists fear is happening to this year's migration. From April to July, it was looking like a great year. Then the drought in the "butterfly breadbasket" (the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Minnesota and nearby Canada) cut down the numbers leaving, while drought in Texas is making it tough on those crossing it now.</p>
        <p>Q. What happened to the multitude of monarchs that used to inhabit New Jersey? We miss them. - B. Kirsch</p>
        <p>A. So do a lot of other people. This is a good year along the Atlantic Coast migratory route, but butterfly experts told me that the migrations of the old days, when millions would turn whole landscapes orange, aren't nearly as big any more. It's hard to know whom to blame -- butterflies do get epidemics of parasites some years when they are clumping together in Mexico, and large numbers there are eaten by a few predators. But because they produce 100 eggs or more in several generations per year, they can bounce back after a bad year or two. So it may be something more permanent, such as global warming changing drought patterns or flower-blooming patterns, such as the loss of much of the Mexican mountain forest and/or such as the decline in milkweed because of crop-spraying for weeds and the mowing of wildflowers along roadsides. Butterfly enthusiasts have many campaigns to save them -- the Michoacan Reforestation Fund, the Monarch Waystation Project, lobbying of local and state governments to stop mowing roadsides in summer, lobbying farmers to stop spraying for milkweed (there are disputes over whether cows are smart enough to simply ignore it, for example.)</p>
        <p>Q. What are the monarch's predators in their migration, if any?</p>
        <p>A. They don't have many predators during the migration, though many are hit by cars, especially when they are flying low in the early morning cold. In the Mexican roosts, many are eaten by the black-eared mouse, the black-backed oriole and the black-headed grosbeak. The toxic cardenolides they pick up from milkweed are concentrated in their cuticles (skins). The orioles are able to slit open their abdomens and eat the insides, while the grosbeaks and mice are able to tolerate the poison.</p>
        <p>Q. "In winter, he goes to the Transvolcanic Mountains in Mexico and spreads the word that he will pay $5 for each one found. That amount, about half a day's pay for a laborer, is enough to make families spend hours sifting piles of dead butterflies beneath the fir trees where the monarchs roost."</p>
        <p>This sounds like a terrible idea. It's only a matter of time before some bright collector realizes he could make even more money by fogging the fir trees with insecticide and killing the whole flock to search through for tags. K. Matton</p>
        <p>A. Well, yes, that would be a disaster. And I imagine that any incident like that would end the operation. But there are a few angles that make it less likely: Many roosts are pretty far up in big fir trees. Without electricity and, short of a gasoline engine, getting a fogging machine going would be tough. One person coming in with hundreds of tags would certainly raise suspicions, and much of the land ownership is shared, so the locals would perhaps stop each other from something as short-sighted as killing off the roosts. Also, Dr. Taylor has a limited amount of money. During the big freeze of 2002, which piled up millions of dead butterflies beneath the trees, he was offered so many tags it nearly bankrupted him.</p>
        <p>Q. We live in New Orleans and have provided milkweed for the Monarch caterpillars for many years. About 2 years ago, some beetle with black orange coloring and a shield shaped body appeared on the milkweeds and stripped them bare within a day. I picked them off and crushed them each morning but they kept on multiplying it seems. Is there some other way to control them or prevent new generations?</p>
        <p>I have a second question. Is it common in the insect world that caterpillars can only feed on one type of plant? It seems that's not a great evolutionary characteristic as far as chances of survival are concerned. I. Choi</p>
        <p>A: I asked Prof. Orley R (Chip) Taylor of the University of Kansas for help with this. He said they are milkweed leaf beetles, and not much can be done other than what you are doing. If they keep coming, it may be from someone else's milkweed patch. More information is available here: http://bugguide.net/node/view/2970.</p>
        <p>About specialization, he said: "Ah, but it is. Specialists are more common than generalists in the insect world. The relationship of milkweed to all the milkweed insects - a relatively small guild of orange and black insects that advertise the fact by their coloration that they feed on a noxious plant that makes them unpalatable - is know as co-evolution. Through the pressure of herbivory plants are selected to become more toxic by so doing they leave behind some of the herbivores (in evolutionary time) but not others. Those herbivores not left behind are those that are capable of overcoming the plant defenses and in some cases, such as the milkweed feeders, are able to incorporate the plant defenses as part of their own defense against predators."</p>
        <p>Q: I was able to get the grounds keepers at the University of the Virgin Islands to stop chopping down the wild Giant Milkweed around the campus on St. Thomas for the past 2 years in hopes of re-establishing a food source for Monarchs. Monarchs are fairly common on St. Croix (40 miles south) and Puerto Rico (30 miles west) but have not been confirmed on St. Thomas for several years. Do you have any information about the population status of Caribbean Monarchs? Has anyone done any studies to monitor the population or enhance the habitat for them? J. Corven</p>
        <p>A: From Chip Taylor, again: "We have two Monarch Waystations in the Caribbean (one on Grand Bahama and one in Christiansted, V.I.) and we would love to have more (we have Monarch Waystations in all but 5 western states). To the best of my knowledge monarchs can be found on most of the Caribbean Islands. As to the size of the populations, I can't say. These are non-migratory populations and the wing shape is a bit different, since they don't have to migrate, and the monarchs tend to be somewhat smaller. Those from Puerto Rico are quite distinctive.</p>
        <p>"The islands sometimes gain or lose butterfly species with storms and hurricanes. This is especially true in the Bahamas where influxes of monarchs have been reported in the past. There is no reason why St Thomas shouldn't have monarchs unless the food plants are scarce. The giant milkweed to which he refers is Calotropis procera -- neat plant."</p>
        <p>Q. Where are the males in all of this? C. Zweifach</p>
        <p>A. They're right there flying along with the females. (Otherwise, there would be no mating and no fertilized eggs laid.) Perhaps the confusion was created by my choice of phrases like "Come autumn, how does she find her way back to the same grove in Mexico that sheltered her great-grandmother?" I could say I was avoiding being sexist, but the truth is, since the description of that one butterfly's trek included laying eggs, it wouldn't have worked if I'd said "his great-grandfather."</p>
        <p>Monarch mating, by the way, involves so little courtship behavior or pheromone use and is so violent on the part of the males that some biologists actually describe it as rape. But that's another story.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there some kind of evolutionary advantage gained by the monarchs by taking such a long, arduous trek? Are there any similar examples of such long distance migrations? Isn't there a sea turtle that does the long-distance trek thing? I'm trying to figure out how such activities enhance their chances for survival. Or, was there a geo-physical restructuring of the landscape that made a short trip into a long one? - R. Freeman</p>
        <p>A. Lots of creatures migrate long distances, including sea turtles, rufous hummingbirds, whooping cranes, gray whales, ducks, geese, wildebeest and my grandfather, who moved from New Jersey to Florida and back each year. Many have very specialized breeding, nesting or spawning grounds that are far from their usual feeding grounds. Some are just trying to stay warm (including my ancestral snowbird, who had finished his spawning behavior by the time he sold his Brooklyn boiler factory and moved to New Jersey.) The big, obvious evolutionary advantage to the monarchs is that they are now adapted to a huge range of environments. Some subspecies of butterflies are so finely adapted to literally only a few hillsides in the world that, if those hillsides are burned or built upon, the subspecies ceases to exist. In the monarchs' case, they need to stay cool but since they are not warm-blooded, have to stay above freezing (hence the winter in the Transvolcanic Mountains, which are foggy but rarely freeze). As soon as they heat up for about five days, they start mating and reproducing, and that immediately shortens their lifespan from six to nine months to two to six weeks. As noted above, some monarchs do not migrate, but just keep reproducing all year in limited ranges. About changes in the landscape: Since important features of North America like the Rockies were formed 50 to 100 million years ago but much of the continent was covered by ice as recently as 16,000 years ago, my guess is that migration patterns adapted to the shifting weather rather than the shifting landscape.</p>

        <p>A number of readers also wrote in regards to my essay about squirrels in my Brooklyn neighborhood. Those questions appear below.</p>
        <p>Q. Does Mr. McNeil know that he likely violated a provision of the NYC Administrative code by possessing a pellet gun within the City? The code makes it a crime. It is believed that part of the reason for the enactment of the law was to protect the inflated figures in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade from depressuring events.</p>
        <p>A: They outlawed pellet guns to protect the Macy's Parade? Man, I'd never thought of that. Frankly, I think those spectator-threatening mini-Hindenburgs are one of the best arguments I've ever heard for making pellet guns mandatory in New York City. (Parade Balloon Hits Light Pole, Injuring Two) But maybe I'm letting my bah-humbug attitude toward the holidays get the best of me here</p>
        <p>My guess -- or my hope, anyway -- is that they were outlawed to protect the human denizens of this fair city, not the rodents or the inflated ones.</p>
        <p>And, to answer your question: uh, no I was not aware when I bought the thing that they are illegal in the city and, no, the nice man at the gun store did not mention it. And he did know that I wanted one for use in Brooklyn and even had an opinion on how our mutual senator, Hillary Clinton, would feel about it. (Now I know why she spends so much time campaigning upstate.) But then, he might well not have known that the downstate counties have a different law. In that part of the Catskills, a pellet gun is something you give your kids to play with until they get big enough to handle the real thing.</p>
        <p>However, during the editing process, one of my colleagues did say he suspected I was risking arrest. I couldn't help thinking that the Bush administration -- which has recently been pressing the idea that Times reporters ought to be arrested more often -- would be gratified to hear that there is at least one gun-totin,' Hillary-foe-quotin' nut on the staff. But counting on that to protect me seemed, frankly, dumb. So a week ago, I took the thing back upstate. Thank you for your concern.</p>
        <p>Q. Oh, by the way, Mr. McNeil, your story about the squirrels was funny. You are obviously new at this. You got it right, but failed to pull the trigger. First of all, it's called a 4-10 in gun lingo (don't call it a .410 bore shotgun). I use the pellet gun similar to the one you bought. Just pull the trigger. I shoot my squirrels in the winter, let them freeze overnight, and toss them in the garbage the next morning. If you have too many tree-hugging neighbors, then catch them in your Havahart trap and shoot them at night in the trap. I do this as well. Over the years, and yes, it takes years, you'll slowly drain the immediate neighborhood of the squirrels. I've been at it for 5 years and I've seen a huge difference. Sure, new squirrels will move in, but you'll actually be able to grow stuff. Keep at it and don't let up or they will be back. I'd suggest mounting a scope on your pellet gun which you can do quite cheaply and get good at hitting targets. Use the pointy hunting pellets, not the ones that look like a little garbage can. When you kill, you want to kill quickly and humanely. You don't want the squirrel scampering off and falling dead on your neighbors' picnic table who writes for the Wall Street Journal. So get good at hitting the mid-shoulder area and stop writing about it! J. Hackett</p>
        <p>A. Wow. I am speechless. I can just see my neighbors' nonchalant reactions as I poke my barrel-mounted scope out my bedroom window. I think it's obvious that the best course for me here is to leave the trap, the dead squirrel and the gun, wiped clean of fingerprints, on the Journal reporter's picnic table. But I will have to check with our legal department.</p>
        <p>Q. If Mr. McNeil had seen the movie, "Never Cry Wolf", he may have remembered how Charles M. Smith solved his problem with mouse infestation. He caught a mouse, cooked it, and ate it with exaggerated gusto while the other mice were observing. Not even one mouse ever returned. Now that is really understanding the law of the jungle. -- H. Williams</p>
        <p>A. No thanks. Squirrels are suspected of harboring prion diseases. But did hear back from Legal. They recommend eating Journal reporters with exaggerated gusto.</p>
