        <p>Following similar moves by New York and federal officials, Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said yesterday that he intends to sue 16 coal-burning power plants in five states to force them to reduce pollution believed to cause smog and acid rain in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The announcement is the latest in a flurry of recent legal actions by state and federal law enforcement officials to reduce air pollution from smokestacks in the Midwest that, according to federal studies, is carried by wind currents into the highly polluted New York region and on to New England.

        <p>Following similar moves by New York and federal officials, Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said yesterday that he intends to sue 16 coal-burning power plants in five states to force them to reduce pollution believed to cause smog and acid rain in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>The announcement is the latest in a flurry of recent legal actions by state and federal law enforcement officials to reduce air pollution from smokestacks in the Midwest that, according to federal studies, is carried by wind currents into the highly polluted New York region and on to New England. Two months ago, New York's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, sent letters to the same coal-burning power plants that Connecticut has focused on -- in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia -- notifying them of his intent to sue them in federal court for violating emissions standards stipulated in the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 3, in what federal officials called one of the largest enforcement actions in the nation's history, the Justice Department announced legal and administrative proceedings against 32 coal-fired power plants in 10 states in the Midwest and the South. The legal actions are intended to force power companies to abide by provisions of the Clean Air Act that require upgrades of older coal-fired plants to include pollution controls that reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, compounds that cause smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>Like the other suits brought or pending against the power plants, Connecticut's claims the power plants have failed to accompany the upgrades of their turbines and boilers with the expensive new pollution-cutting equipment required by law, Mr. Blumenthal said. The largest plants he intends to sue have increased their coal consumption by 50 percent to 75 percent in the last two or three years, he said.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Blumenthal said his office would work closely with Mr. Spitzer's to mount a case against the power companies. ''We'll be using a lot of the same documentation and research,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''My hope is that there will be other states that will join us.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut's suits will be filed in federal courts in the five states where the plants operate, he said.</p>
        <p>David Wooley, counsel to the Clean Air Task Force, said the attorneys general will need to demonstrate how the plants' upgrades caused an increase in pollutants not attributable to other, routine maintenance.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the coal-fired plants yesterday accused Connecticut of ''piling on'' to the Midwest plants' legal battles instead of focusing on reducing its home-grown pollution. ''We have an awfully hard time trying to understand where Connecticut is coming from with this kind of litigation,'' said David M. Flannery, a lawyer for the Midwest Ozone Group, a coalition of 30 coal and power companies stretching from Virginia to Missouri. ''If Connecticut wants its air quality to be improved, it's going to have to deal with local sources.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal, who linked the eastward-drifting air pollution  from the plants to water quality problems in the Long Island Sound and to asthma rates in Connecticut, said his suit was necessary to protect the state's citizens and resources.</p>
