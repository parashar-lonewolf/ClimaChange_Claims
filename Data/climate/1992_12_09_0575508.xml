        <p>As Bill Clinton prepares for inauguration, his Presidency already seems haunted by the great issue he pointedly avoided in the campaign -- national security and foreign policy. History will judge the Bush Administration's missed opportunities and neglect of a revolutionary world as an almost epic blunder, leaving a legacy of contradiction and hazard.</p>
        <p>Unless the new Administration develops a coherent view of a transformed world and of America's new international interest, role and purpose, there will be no more than a marginal, politically arbitrary reapportionment of huge national security budgets, which are now largely wasted on cold war vestiges yet are essential to finance domestic revival and deficit reduction. The same capricious politics are likely to raid non-military international spending or exploit trade tensions for short-run advantage, all with insidious effect.</p>
        <p>Without a new foreign policy for a new era, Bill Clinton will forfeit command over budgets, bureaucracies and ultimately his own Presidency.</p>
        <p>When he enters the Oval Office, he will find waiting a radically altered world. As old industrial and imperial orders collapse, America's power remains pre-eminent, though its leadership must be earned. Amid kaleidoscopic change and turmoil, the world is free of Great Power rivalries and has unprecedented opportunity for cooperation and peace, yet faces unparalleled challenges in the spread of weapons, ecological damage, festering poverty, vast migrations and separatist violence.</p>
        <p>Much as George Bush failed to grasp that changing world, it has overtaken as well the conventional foreign policy aspirants to whom whom Mr. Clinton might have resorted and whose national security nostrums and habits of mind are now anachronistic.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton must marshal a new democratic foreign policy, one as bold and relevant as Harry S. Truman's 1947 summons to a peacetime America to contain Soviet expansion. Like Truman, Mr. Clinton is "present at the creation" of a new epoch in world affairs -- and the next half-century hangs in the balance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's equivalent to deterring the Soviets is to seize the fleeting chance for post-cold-war demilitarization while also checking the plague of weapons proliferation and sectarian chaos that threatens any comity of nations. Since the U.S. cannot -- should not -- dominate in that effort, national security dictates a sustained commitment to a genuinely cooperative, collective international security system.</p>
        <p>The foundation of that policy would be a peacekeeping force, drawn proportionately from U.N. member states and more than twice the size of the Desert Storm coalition, with the strength to stop any aggression or genocide. Europe, Japan and Russia would play and pay their fair shares. Contributing only its own portion, America, no more the primary world policeman, might safely, and within Mr. Clinton's term, see the return and reduction of its overseas forces to mainly territorial defense; it will also see the reconversion of its economy to a long-earned peace and nonmilitary prosperity.</p>
        <p>The following steps toward collective security should be as compelling as those taken to deter the Soviets:</p>
        <p>When the principal threat to peace is nationalist aggression or national disintegration, where a new global compact depends on common action in defense of the weakest, tragedies such as Bosnia and Somalia are the real Munichs, the ominous dominoes, of our era.</p>
        <p>Seeing the new pragmatism of principle, the U.S. should immediately work to forge a system of collective action to redress such outrages -- action far more shared and purposeful than President Bush's 11th-hour U.S.-dominated expedition in the Somali famine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton should recognize the complexity of such intervention, external culpability in tragedies such as Somalia and the dangers of neo-imperial aggrandizement. Much of the new turmoil requires sustained peacekeeping, just as the cold war required U.S. staying power.</p>
        <p>But he should understand, too, the Holocaust's enduring lesson -- that sovereignty in a seamless new world no longer allows a regime to destroy its own citizens with impunity or indifference, and that a truly peaceful planet must outlaw aggression within borders as well as across them.</p>
        <p>Practically, as well as morally, the larger stake of collective security -- and the insidious precedent of impotence and appeasement -- would clearly justify the world's prudent military commitment after the most serious diplomacy failed.</p>
        <p>Because the stability and participation of Russia are essential to that collective security, the U.S. should urgently mount all the aid necessary to bridge economic hardship and save post-Soviet democracy.</p>
        <p>No Presidential policy would have more urgency -- or more riding on it -- than the necessity to prevent another Russian tragedy. Washington should take the initiative to forge ahead of the Russians in nuclear disarmament (already stalled in fresh suspicions), beginning with a long-term test ban, the renunciation of some $30 billion in needless new weapons in the wake of the George Bush-Boris Yeltsin arms agreement in June and eventual reduction of U.S. strategic weapons to an adequate minimum of 250 to 500 warheads.</p>
        <p>In his first year, Mr. Clinton should place nonproliferation and disarmament on top of the international agenda; bring a prompt, exemplary end to our own $36 billion-a-year trade in conventional weapons (with reconversion provision for affected industries); begin an all-out collective effort to demilitarize worldwide by agreements with poorer nations to forgive debt in return for substantial conversion of military sectors to peaceful development along with strict inspection of arms reductions, and use all means to bring about a nuclear-free, demilitarized Middle East with renewed Arab-Israeli peace talks.</p>
        <p>Where foreign policy merges most visibly with the domestic agenda, Mr. Clinton should seize a similar chance for needed change in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico. His policy should be to renegotiate, as necessary, America's international economic future, reversing George Bush's readiness to allow supranational trade agreements to erode U.S. labor and environmental standards. We should not avoid a trade war, Mr. Clinton should announce, only to inflict a class war on American and foreign workers, fought with high-tech sweatshops and symbolized by gruesomely polluted border towns.</p>
        <p>Soon Mr. Clinton should meet with major trading partners, including Japan, the Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin America, to advance a straightforward new policy: America will settle for neither belligerent blocs nor politely masked inequity but rather will seek an equitable, politically sustainable world commerce of shared sacrifice, responsibility and opportunity for capital and labor. Since no nation is more important in the new U.S. policy than Japan, a mutually sensitive and systematic reduction of the $100 billion U.S. trade deficit would be the primary goal and crucible of U.S.-Japanese relations.</p>
        <p>Not least, Mr. Clinton should convene a conference of rich and poor nations to strike a new bargain of ideals and self-interest in international development. Just as he visited a struggling neighborhood in Washington, showing he would be a concerned citizen of the capital, he should be the first U.S. chief executive in a generation to demonstrate an authentic sensibility toward the struggling nations.</p>
        <p>No one's future is secure, he should explain, when four or five billion people in the world are left in smoking slums on the outskirts of hope. America cannot simply deal with domestic needs and then later turn to the world's anguish; either we begin anew to heal both or it may well not matter for our grandchildren if we make ourselves prosperous.</p>
        <p>As another principle of new policy, the U.S. should become a leader -- and no longer a scofflaw or laggard -- in international environmental action, including energy conservation, meaningful reduction of carbon dioxide, stricter emission controls, hazardous-waste clean-up, responsible population policy, resource replenishment and myriad other measures to meet the danger of ecological disaster.</p>
        <p>Washington should foster a new representative world organization to oversee and plan, decades ahead, common environmental policy and management of resources, just as GATT has been charged with orchestrating trade. For details, President Clinton should look to Vice President Al Gore, whose book "Earth in the Balance: Healing the Global Environment" is a blueprint for environmental security.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Clinton should come to grips with the most formidable challenge of all: ignoring the stale foreign policy Establishment and circumventing the permanent regime of bureaucrats, whose civil service ranks are deeply penetrated by Reagan-Bush loyalists.</p>
        <p>Just as Truman's postwar internationalism could not be conducted by the old isolationists of a bygone era, the post-cold-war Clinton policy will survive only with new ways and new people, beyond old establishments and ex-officials. A centerpiece of the new diplomacy could be sophisticated conflict resolution, with assisted negotiation and mediation of the kind so successful under private auspices with the World Bank, among Nicaraguan factions and in Middle East water issues.</p>
        <p>Preventing conflicts rather than reacting to crisis, creating forums for dialogue and joint problem-solving, acknowledging the legitimacy of all interests, understanding historical and psychological dynamics at work, building long-term relationships of collaboration -- these new techniques would apply to many international flash points.</p>
        <p>For such innovation -- much less his emphasis on collective peacekeeping, humane international economics and environmentalism -- Mr. Clinton will find neither skill nor commitment among the cold-war veterans jockeying for jobs.</p>
        <p>He must reach for a fresh generation of thinkers and doers -- for a new-world visionary, manager and practiced negotiator as Secretary of State; a Secretary of Defense versed in economic reconversion and internationalized security; a U.N. ambassador of stature to match the post's unparalleled new importance; policy-makers on international economics and the environment of ministerial rank and worldwide distinction for their mastery of the issues; a new Director of Central Intelligence with the mettle to turn a rogue relic into a relevant public servant, and a national security adviser of original intellect and old-fashioned humility, embodying America's new creativity yet modesty about its place on the planet.</p>
        <p>In the end, the most important change should be in the President. He should believe in his own newcomer's genius, knowing that the new foreign policy is not sorcery, that he need not apprentice to the past. He should trust his own decency and intelligence in world affairs and a new democratization of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>The President would have to choose decisively between conventionality, with its all too predictable outcome, and a new community of nations, joined by America and led by its example as never before. We can only hope that for Bill Clinton this would be no choice at all.  BILL'S LIST Roger Morris, who served on the National Security Council staff under Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, is writing a book on the early days of the Clinton Presidency.</p>
