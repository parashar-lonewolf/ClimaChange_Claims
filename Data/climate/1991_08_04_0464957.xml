        <p>LOUISE COLEMAN'S work is at times sub rosa she is a financial planner -- but her hobby is rosy indeed. Mrs. Coleman grows roses, so many and so well that she has won national acclaim. In spring, traffic clogs the street she lives on here as drivers stop to admire her 400 rosebushes of every hue but blue.</p>
        <p>Why there is no such thing as a blue rose, why flowers of such fabled beauty have thorns that tear and scar, are not questions that concern Mrs. Coleman. Spare her the metaphysical musings, the forays into symbolism and metaphor. Just let her show you a roundly petaled flower with a high centered bloom, a rose of perfect symmetry that sits straight upon its stem, and share for a moment the beauty that moves her.</p>
        <p>"It's an obsession," Mrs. Coleman said. To prove it she pulled out a resume listing her 23 years of activities with the American Rose Society. She has been a member of its board for the last 12 years, has won more than 50 awards -- including 28 "queens of show," the highest prize -- in local, district and national shows of the society. She has also held numerous positions in which she has lectured, taught or written about roses. Challenged by Nature</p>
        <p>Her quest is a beautiful face, the unique face of a new flower.</p>
        <p>Producing such blooms each season, protecting her bushes from ice and acid rain and petal-munching Japanese beetles, is what preoccupies Mrs. Coleman. "You're constantly being challenged by nature," she said one recent midsummer morning. "I like challenges."</p>
        <p>Although past their peak, many of Mrs. Coleman's bushes were still flowering. But she could relax and squash the Japanese beetles instead of spraying them -- sparing the birds and worms a poisonous meal -- because there were no immediate shows coming up, she said. The next exhibition she will participate in will be held by the state district of the American Rose Society in Corning, N.Y., on Sept. 8 and 9. Mrs. Coleman said she would cut back all her bushes so new blooms would be ready for the show.</p>
        <p>She and her husband, Thomas, an Eastchester police lieutenant, spend much of their time preparing for and traveling to rose shows. There they mingle with "a circle of rose friends from all over the country" who don't even know what each other does for a living, she said, because they only "talk roses."</p>
        <p>Although rose growing was at first her hobby only, Mrs. Coleman said her husband "was hooked" after they won a trophy at an exhibition 20 years ago. Now Mr. Coleman brings his own ingenuity to his wife's motherly touch. While she nurtures the seedlings she calls "my babies" in the greenhouse of their home, he finds the equipment that makes their pasttime easier. One recent purchase was the six-foot tall florist's refrigerator that has replaced five ordinary refrigerators in the couple's garage.</p>
        <p>Roses love warmth on the stem and the cold when cut, Mrs. Coleman said. While they need at least six hours of direct sun each day to grow, refrigeration can preserve their lives. Cut, soak the stems in warm water and refrigerate overnight: recut stems and soak in warm water again to keep blooms fresh for several days, the rosarian advises.  On Ice to California</p>
        <p>This method has allowed the Colemans to grow roses in Eastchester and win prizes for them in California. They transport the flowers in a van in the styrofoam box lined with ice packs that Mr. Coleman built.</p>
        <p>The competition is friendly at American Rose Society exhibitions, Mrs. Coleman said. The challenge in showing is "not so much beating someone else but growing a rose well enough to get it in the Court of Honor." The Court of Honor is a display of the prize-winning blooms in each show.</p>
        <p>Roses are evaluated for form, color, substance or freshness and the balance of stem, leaf and flower, said Mrs. Coleman, who often judges when she doesn't show.</p>
        <p>And what of fragrance, promoted by poets and parents guiding small noses? "Exhibitors very seldom smell the roses," Mrs. Coleman conceded. "We're so busy focusing on the blooms."</p>
        <p>She added that amateurs who exhibit usually leave hybridizing -- or creating new rose varieties -- to commercial growers. Hybridizers must put plants under stress to get seeds, she explained, while those who grow for show do just the opposite, feeding and watering their plants carefully.</p>
        <p>When a new rose variety is introduced, its name is registered and its creator receives royalties on all future sales. Rose varieties, like race horses, have peppy names like "Just for You," "Two Timer" and "High Spirits."</p>
        <p>But as surely as roses have thorns, growing a thing of beauty has its dark side. Yes, rosarians including herself use fungicides and insecticides, Mrs. Coleman said, although "we try to be environmentally conscious."</p>
        <p>Alternatives to toxins are baking soda, which can help prevent mildew, and glass cleaner with ammonia, which can kill Japanese beetles, she noted. A spray made with lime sulfur, a mixture effective against fungus, is also now commercially available, she added.</p>
        <p>Strolling through her backyard "production garden" -- distinguished from a "landscape garden" by rows arranged for easy working -- Mrs. Coleman smiled at the bees buzzing about the blossoms. "The bees are a good sign," she said. "So are spider webs. It means I haven't killed everything in nature" with toxic sprays. Advice on the Basics</p>
        <p>The rosarian offered some basic advice to those who want to try growing roses. "Start with well draining soil or throw gypsum in," she said. "Mix a lot of organic material into the hole and add lime to increase the soil acidity." The soil in most of Westchester, she explained, has a low ph or acidity.</p>
        <p>"Plant, but don't add rose food until the first bloom," Mrs. Coleman continued. "Give tons of water and don't prune until spring. In the winter, hill up the base of the plant with soil or compost, and then leave it."</p>
        <p>The reward for the effort comes in the spring, "when those first roses bloom and you just go out there and absorb the beauty," she said. "It's work, but a game of tennis is work, too."</p>
        <p>While studying the rose's place in history for one of her articles, Mrs. Coleman came across a Chinese proverb that she likes to quote: "The fragrance of the rose lingers on the hands of those who give it."</p>
