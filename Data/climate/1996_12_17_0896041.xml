      <abstract>
        <p>Columbia University geologists Dr B F Ryan and Dr Walter C Pittman 3d have reconstructed the history of catastrophic flooding of the Black Sea and surrounding river valleys that gave the body of water its modern configuration; using data gathered by a Russian research ship in 1993, the scientists put the time of the event at about 5500 BC and speculate that the flood created a diaspora of early agriculturists who spread farming to Europe and other surrounding areas; speculate further that the event could be source of both the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh and the Noah sotry in the Book of Genesis; map; photos (M)</p>

        <p>LONG before the splendid palaces and minarets of Istanbul lined its shore, the Bosporus was little more than a narrow spillway where fresh water from the ancient Black Sea flowed out to the Aegean Sea and on to the Mediterranean. Then rising sea levels worldwide brought about a cataclysmic reversal. Suddenly, sea water cascaded through the Bosporus with a force 400 times mightier than that of Niagara Falls, the terrifying sound of the roar carrying for at least 60 miles.</p>
        <p>In perhaps less than a year, the Black Sea turned brackish and rose several hundred feet, inundating former shores and river valleys deep into the interior. The relentless waters encroached on the land at a rate of half a mile to a mile a day. More than 60,000 square miles of land were soon submerged, a 30 percent expansion in the Black Sea's size, which essentially gave the body of water its modern configuration.</p>
        <p>An international team of geologists and oceanographers has reconstructed the history of this catastrophic flood from data gathered by a Russian research ship in 1993. Seismic soundings and sediment cores revealed traces of the sea's former shorelines, showing an abrupt 500-foot rise in water levels. Radiocarbon dating of the transition from freshwater to marine organisms in the cores put the time of the event about 7,500 years ago, or 5500 B.C.</p>
        <p>The team leaders, Dr. William B. F. Ryan and Dr. Walter C. Pittman 3d, both of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., described the results of their research in interviews last week. A full scientific report is to be published next spring.</p>
        <p>Other geologists familiar with the work seem to have no quarrel with the basic reconstruction or the timing. But Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman have taken their interpretation of the flood's possible consequences a tentative but bold step further, two geologists treading on the turf of archeologists. The rumblings of controversy, like the beginnings of the Bosporus cascade, can already be heard.</p>
        <p>Could it be, Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman speculate, that the people driven from their land by the flood were, in part, responsible for the spread of farming into Europe and advances in agriculture and irrigation to the south, in Anatolia and Mesopotamia? These cultural changes occurred around the same time as the rise of the Black Sea.</p>
        <p>Could it also be, they ask, that the Black Sea deluge left such enduring memories that this inspired the later story of a great flood described in the Babylonian epic of Gilgamesh? In the epic, the heroic warrior Gilgamesh makes a dangerous journey to meet the survivor of a great world flood and learn from him the secret of everlasting youth.</p>
        <p>If a memory of the Black Sea flood indeed influenced the Gilgamesh story, then it could also be a source of the Noah story in the Book of Genesis. Scholars have long noted striking similarities between the Gilgamesh and Genesis flood accounts and suspected that the Israelites derived their version from the Gilgamesh epic or independently from a common tradition that might have stemmed from a real catastrophe long before.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman concede that a link between the Black Sea flood and Gilgamesh and Noah may be a bit of a stretch. In a scientific report, they stick mainly to their geological findings. But in informal lectures and a BBC television documentary, broadcast yesterday in Britain, they elaborate on the possible implications for early agriculture and mythology, hoping, they say, to promote a dialogue with other scientists and scholars.</p>
        <p>''All we really see is some correlations in time,'' Dr. Ryan said in an interview. ''It doesn't necessarily mean there's a cause and effect. It may be only a coincidence, but it's too much of a coincidence not to be further investigated.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pittman said, ''It's something the archeologists are going to have to deal with one way or another.''</p>
        <p>In the BBC program, Dr. John Dewey, a geologist at Oxford University, said: ''The geology is very clear. The real question is, does it explain the biblical flood or some other phenomenon.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephanie Dalley, an authority on Gilgamesh at Oxford, said she doubted there was any connection between the Black Sea event and the mythological flood, noting the wide separation of the two in geography and time. The Gilgamesh who may have inspired the epic was possibly a ruler of the Sumerian city of Uruk around 2600 B.C., two-and-a-half millenniums after the Black Sea deluge, and the earliest known written versions of the heroic legend are on clay tablets from about a millennium after his rule.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman may be on firmer ground suggesting a link between the abrupt rise of the Black Sea and cultural changes in Europe and elsewhere. They point to the sea's pre-flood history in making their case.</p>
        <p>Beginning 12,000 years ago, just as the world had recovered from the last ice age, Europe and parts of Asia underwent a 1,000-year interval of especially arid conditions. The level of the Black Sea plummeted, but still its fertile shore must have been an inviting oasis. People who already lived there or flocked there, responding to the environmental crisis all around, could have developed an early farming culture. No one is sure, of course, because any traces of their settlements are now under water.</p>
        <p>Soon after the arid period ended, extensive farming appeared nearby in Anatolia, now part of Turkey, and northern Greece. The two geologists suggest that with an ample supply of fresh water at hand, the Black Sea people could have been successful farmers, too.</p>
        <p>Fleeing the sudden flood 7,500 years ago, these people must have taken their skills somewhere else. Archeologists have established that within the next 200 years, farming settlements began to appear for the first time in the river valleys and plains of Central Europe. The displacement of people in that direction could be explained because the greatest loss of dry land to the flood occurred on the western and northern coasts of the Black Sea.</p>
        <p>Such population movements, Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman concluded in a report of their findings, ''could have been induced by the permanent expulsion of inhabitants who had adapted to the natural resources of the formerly emerged Black Sea periphery.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Douglass Bailey, an archeologist of the University of Wales in Cardiff who specializes in Bulgarian excavations, said he was wary of such speculations at first, but now thought Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman ''might have stumbled on something extremely important.'' The migration of the Black Sea people, he suggested, could have been ''the starting point for a drastic period of change that culminated in the Copper Age,'' a time of increased cultivation of food, permanent settlements and new metal technology that began about 7,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The two Lamont-Doherty geologists began their research when they were invited by the Russian Academy of Sciences to join an expedition three years ago. They had just learned from Dr. Petko Dimitrov of the Bulgarian Institute of Oceanology in Varna that he had detected some former beaches of the Black Sea, when its water level seemed to be more than 400 feet lower.</p>
        <p>Earlier research had established that the Mediterranean once virtually dried up and was replenished after the ice age and that the Black Sea once was a fresh-water basin. But it was thought that the connection between the two seas occurred gradually.</p>
        <p>Working with the Russians, Dr. Ryan and Dr. Pittman made seismic profiles of the sea floor off Romania, Ukraine and Russia. These showed successive shorelines and stretches of once dry land now submerged at different depths far out into the sea. Their sediment samples were rich with crushed fresh-water shells, bleached by the sun when they had covered the original beaches. In higher layers, all the remains were of saltwater life.</p>
        <p>''If there was a flood,'' Dr. Pittman said, ''all the ages for these former and post-flood shores should be virtually the same.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Glenn A. Jones of the Texas A &amp; M Institute of Oceanography in Galveston dated the core organisms and found that to be the case. And to everyone's surprise, the date was more recent than expected -- 7,540 years ago, with a slight margin for error.</p>
        <p>Doing some quick calculations, Dr. Pittman figured that the sea's surface must have risen a foot a day for perhaps 100 days at the height of the flood. For that to occur, torrents of water must have been pouring through the Bosporus into the Black Sea at a rate some 400 times that of Niagara Falls. Deep grooves in the Bosporus today seem to testify to the force of the roaring influx that changed the Black Sea and might or might not have changed early European culture and enriched literature.</p>
