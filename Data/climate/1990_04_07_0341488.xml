        <p>LEAD: If good intentions could do the job, ''Our Future at Risk: The Education Crisis'' would be exemplary television; but, then, if good intentions could do the job, there would be no crisis.

        <p>If good intentions could do the job, ''Our Future at Risk: The Education Crisis'' would be exemplary television; but, then, if good intentions could do the job, there would be no crisis. The nine educators and corporation executives gathered Monday night at 8 o'clock on Channel 9 concentrate on the failure of America's schools to teach young people to read, spell, add and speak English well enough to staff America's businesses. They agree that cooperation between workplace and schoolplace is essential. ''A'' for good intentions.</p>
        <p>The hour, sponsored by I.B.M. and moderated by Hodding Carter. It begins with a familiarly depressing 10-minute report on the inability of millions of youngsters who have made their way through the school system to do any sort of job more demanding than handing out hamburgers at McDonald's.</p>
        <p>Although the panelists tend to talk in sound bites, what they say is realistic. All recognize that the schools are staggering under an assault of social and economic problems, from single-parent households to the decline of jobs for the unskilled, that cannot be remedied in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Seasoned observers like Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, Dr. Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and Dr. Joseph A. Fernandez, New York's Schools Chancellor, emphasize the dimensions of the problems. ''Is the school to become a social agency?'' asks Dr. Boyer. A teacher on the panel reminds viewers of the many elementary school children who graduate not into intermediate school but ''into motherhood or prison.''</p>
        <p>The solutions offered are less compelling. Chancellor Fernandez calls for a Marshall Plan for the schools but does not tell how the money would be spent. Mr. Shanker calls for ''a new kind of school,'' but is given little opportunity to elaborate. The businessmen are agreed that corporations have to provide more in the way of day care, time off for workers to study and on-the-job training, and Peter McWalters, the superintendent of schools in Rochester, tells, in the jargon of his trade, of cooperation between businesses and schools in his jurisdiction. But in sum, the positives seem overwhelmed by the negatives. (From the applause for every proposal to raise teachers' pay, you may deduce that the profession was well represented in the audience at Pace University, where the program was taped in March during a Business Week symposium. There is something odd in having teachers applaud the news that for years the brightest graduates haven't been going into teaching.) It is a dutiful hour rather than a stimulating one. The best that can be said for ''Our Future at Risk'' (one of those all-purpose titles available for everything from acid rain to the brain drain) is that it drives home the inability of the schools as traditionally financed and operated to address the problems that have been imposed on them. Not a new message, but a necessary one that, alas, demands repeating. There's that much to be said for good intentions. (Details of the cooperative effort in Rochester can be found in ''Crisis: Urban Education,'' a four-part series that will be shown on Channel 13 at 11 P.M. from April 16 through 19. The series also reports on a troubled high school in Trenton, a well-reputed high school in East Harlem and three inner city youths with different attitudes toward education.)</p>
        <p>Trying to Solve The Unsolvable</p>

        <p>WITH: Dr. Joseph Fernandez, Albert Shanker, Dr. Ernest Boyer, Sanford I. Weill, Dr. Bernard Gifford, Jack MacAllister, Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, Peter McWalters, James E. Dezell Jr. and Barbara Ellis.</p>
