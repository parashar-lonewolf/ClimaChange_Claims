        <p>LEAD: Conflict-of-interest cases usually involve accusations that a Government official has used the powers of office improperly for financial self-interest. But, an ethics charge concerning policy on ozone with no question of financial gain involved?</p>
        <p>Conflict-of-interest cases usually involve accusations that a Government official has used the powers of office improperly for financial self-interest. But, an ethics charge concerning policy on ozone with no question of financial gain involved?</p>
        <p>Such a dispute has arisen in the Reagan Administration concerning the role of Richard E. Benedick, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, in international negotiations aimed at concluding a treaty to limit the production of cholorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, the chemicals that are widely believed to be destroying the ozone in the earth's stratosphere. The ozone layer protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation from the sun that can cause skin cancer, damage crops and cause a variety of other health and environmental problems.</p>
        <p>The dispute arises from Mr. Benedick's temporary posting by the State Department, starting later this year, as a resident scholar with the Conservation Foundation, an environmentalist organization.</p>
        <p>According to Administration sources, officials in the Commerce Department have asked that Mr. Benedick be required to file with the State Department's ethics office a statement that his appointment to the environmental group does not conflict with his official duties in the ozone negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has supported the State Department in the position adopted by the American delegation at meetings in Geneva and Vienna for cutbacks in the production of chlorofluorocarbons. But the Commerce Department, Interior Department and other agencies oppose it.</p>
        <p>Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel said his department had not asked for a conflict-of-interest review of Mr. Benedick. But, he said: ''What would you write if our chief negotiator were leaving to take a position with a CFC-producing company? It is a self-answering question.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Benedick himself said the State Department's ethics office had looked into the issue and would soon issue a statement that there was no conflict of interest in his being assigned to temporary duty with the Conservation Foundation. He said the environmental group was not an advocacy group but a ''think tank'' that does no lobbying on policy issues and had not sought to influence the ozone negotiations in any way.</p>
        <p>''It is like a Defense Department official being detailed to the Rand Corporation for a year to do some thinking about defense issues,'' he said, adding that the temporary assignment was a normal rotation for a Foreign Service officer and had been planned long before the ozone negotiations were ''in the works.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the conservative publication Human Events published an article last week contending that the United States, led by Mr. Benedick, had pursued ''a radical negotiating program for international controls on CFC's.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, who are pushing for the strongest possible treaty to limit the chemicals depleting the ozone layer, seemed bemused at the charges that Mr. Benedick was pursuing a radical program.</p>
        <p>''He is a very cautious guy,'' said David D. Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Mr. Doniger, who has been an observer at several of the negotiating sessions in Europe, said Mr. Benedick had pushed for the official United States position but had taken a ''conservative'' approach to the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benedick said he had ''tried in the conduct of negotiations and in the conduct of discussions with the outside industrial and environmental communities to steer a reasonable middle course and to avoid any exaggeration or overstatement of the case.''</p>
        <p>Largely because of United States leadership, countries producing CFC's tentatively agreed earlier this year to freeze production and then start rolling it back so as to halt the deterioration of the ozone layer. The tentative pact calls for an initial 20 percent rollback and then an additional 30 percent within five years.</p>
        <p>Administration opponents of the official United States position on the ozone layer took their case to President Reagan last week. The President has not yet announced whether he will seek a change in that position.</p>
        <p>Supporters of a strong pact, such as Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, believe that trade restrictions on countries that refuse to join an anti-CFC protocol would be a sufficient deterrent. He and other environmentalists are convinced that opposition to the proposed protocol within the Administration springs from a visceral antipathy to any governmental interference in the marketplace.</p>
