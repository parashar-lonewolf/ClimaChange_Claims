        <p>LEAD: Tiny bubbles trapped in amber for 80 million years have given scientists their first direct look at the earth's atmosphere in the time of the dinosaurs, a mix of gases that appears dramatically different from the air we breathe today.</p>
        <p>Tiny bubbles trapped in amber for 80 million years have given scientists their first direct look at the earth's atmosphere in the time of the dinosaurs, a mix of gases that appears dramatically different from the air we breathe today.</p>
        <p>A preliminary analysis suggests that the ancient atmosphere may have been 50 percent richer in the oxygen that sustains the animal life of the planet. That finding, to be presented here Thursday at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, is sure to astonish experts on global climate and the evolution of life. They had assumed that the air then differed little from today's.</p>
        <p>Until now, the oldest known samples of air were far younger, the product of a 160,000-year-old core of polar ice that was painstakingly drawn over the last five years from its resting place a mile below the Antarctic surface. But by crushing bits of amber and analyzing the faint breath of gas that escapes, researchers appear to have opened an unexpected new window onto the history of the atmosphere and the creatures it nourished. Seeking Detailed Picture</p>
        <p>As the technique is refined, the researchers, Robert A. Berner of Yale University and Gary P. Landis of the United States Geological Survey in Denver, hope through the study of other amber samples to assemble a detailed picture going back even farther. Microscopic air bubbles are not unusual in amber, the resin from pine trees that has hardened into yellowish translucent lumps. Some amber has been preserved for 200 million to 300 million years.</p>
        <p>''It's very exciting,'' said James C. G. Walker of the University of Michigan, an authority on the development of the earth's atmosphere and oceans. ''I think it's a tremendously promising technique.''</p>
        <p>The researchers emphasize that their analysis is still tentative, particularly the surprising discovery of excess oxygen. But they believe that they have ruled out every possible alternative and that the amber bubbles reflect the composition of ancient air, folded into resin that oozed from the coniferous trees of the Cretaceous era.</p>
        <p>Oxygen now makes up 21 percent of the atmosphere; the rest is mainly nitrogen, with a fraction of a percent of carbon dioxide and traces of many other gases. The Cretaceous amber, found in northern Manitoba, suggests an oxygen content as high as 32 percent. The rest is mainly nitrogen, as in the atmosphere today. Changing Thought on Extinctions</p>
        <p>If confirmed, the discovery of an oxygen-rich atmosphere in the planet's past would intrude on the debate over a wide range of problems, from the history of climate change to the rise and extinction of species.</p>
        <p>''No one's ever thought about the possibility that oxygen could change so dramatically,'' Dr. Berner said. ''Some people won't be happy about that high a number.''</p>
        <p>Extra oxygen would have been a great boon to animals trying to develop more efficient versions of the energy-generating chemistry of life. A given species might have been able to get by with smaller lungs, for example, and similar economies might have benefited organisms in many other ways.</p>
        <p>A decline in oxygen content, on the other hand, would surely have affected species accustomed to a richer atmosphere. Some scientists speculated today that paleontologists studying the history of evolution may be tempted to look to the new research as a possible influence on the mass extinctions, including that of the dinosaur, that closed the Cretaceous era.</p>
        <p>The primordial earth, before the origin of life, had an atmosphere with no oxygen at all. It took billions of years for early organisms to free the oxygen that was bound to iron oxide and other minerals in the planet's surface.</p>
        <p>That increase in oxygen over eons has been the only such trend that scientists have known. A higher oxygen content than today's has seemed unlikely, and some scientists have even argued that a level as high as 30 percent would have set off a global conflagration, vast forest fires burning in the enriched air.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe we're living that close to the edge,'' Dr. Walker said. ''If you get too much oxygen in the air, the world would become highly flammable, but I think the threshold is probably higher.'' Oxygen's Complex Cycle</p>
        <p>Oxygen continuously enters and leaves the atmosphere and oceans through a host of chemical and biological processes. Scientists have only recently begun to appreciate the complexity of this cycle of enrichment and depletion, and the role of living creatures in helping to regulate the atmosphere's content.</p>
        <p>Ocean temperature plays an important role in this cycle, and Dr. Walker said that the warm oceans known to have existed 80 million years ago would have provided a natural explanation for high levels of oxygen in the air. Cooler oceans, he said, could then have reduced those levels over a period of a few million years.</p>
        <p>Geologists have had to deduce the composition of the atmosphere from chemical clues buried in the earth, like layers of decayed organic material. Dr. Berner, acting on a suggestion by Edwin Roedder of the United States Geological Survey, decided to test amber, known mainly as a preserver of intact insects.</p>
        <p>Bubbles in amber range from the size of a pinhead to a diameter of 10 microns, far too small to see with the naked eye. A 10-micron bubble contains barely a billion molecules of gas. ''That sounds like a lot, but it's very little in the scheme of things,'' said Dr. Landis, who is conducting the analysis in Denver.</p>
        <p>Such research had to wait upon the highly sensitive technique of quadrupole mass spectroscopy, which uses an electrical charge to separate even a few heavier molecules from lighter ones. Dr. Landis places his amber samples in an extreme vacuum, which draws away remnants of modern air. Then he crushes them between two powerful pistons, his ''microcruncher.'' Amber From Later Ages</p>
        <p>Besides the amber from Canada, the researchers have analyzed 25-million-year-old Dominican amber and 40-million-year-old Baltic amber. As a check on their technique, they have also tested modern resin from New Zealand. Unlike the oldest samples, the Dominican and Baltic ambers appear to match the composition of the modern atmosphere, although those results, too, are preliminary.</p>
        <p>Many of the samples, both modern and ancient, share a peculiarity, a huge excess of carbon dioxide. Dr. Berner believes that some process of breathing, either plant or animal, replaces molecules of oxygen one for one by molecules of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The result is that the actual levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide vary unpredictably from sample to sample, but the total of the two gases remains constant.</p>
        <p>The researchers have also had to deal with impurities, including some contamination by gases from the amber itself. Their colleagues said they believed such problems would be worked out, leaving a discovery that other geologists will envy.</p>
        <p>''That's the role of clever people,'' Dr. Walker said. ''Most of us took it for granted that you wouldn't see anything in there but amber juice.''</p>
