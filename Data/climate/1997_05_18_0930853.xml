        <p>With a flash and a boom that sent the back half of a jumbo jet leaping into the air on this old air base about 90 miles north of London, British and American military experts set off four bombs inside the front and rear cargo holds of an old Boeing 747. The experts were testing new hardening techniques that American security officials say are the best hope for protecting planes against bombs.</p>
        <p>On wide-body jets, all luggage is stored in containers, and the test today involved one bomb in each of four containers. Huge damage had been predicted because one of the four luggage containers, each of which is 5 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet, was not supplemented with protective hardening so damage in reinforced and unprotected areas could be compared. The results were startling, as a section behind the wings of the retired Air France plane separated as if sliced by a guillotine.</p>

        <p>With a flash and a boom that sent the back half of a jumbo jet leaping into the air on this old air base about 90 miles north of London, British and American military experts set off four bombs inside the front and rear cargo holds of an old Boeing 747. The experts were testing new hardening techniques that American security officials say are the best hope for protecting planes against bombs.</p>
        <p>On wide-body jets, all luggage is stored in containers, and the test today involved one bomb in each of four containers. Huge damage had been predicted because one of the four luggage containers, each of which is 5 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet, was not supplemented with protective hardening so damage in reinforced and unprotected areas could be compared. The results were startling, as a section behind the wings of the retired Air France plane separated as if sliced by a guillotine.</p>
        <p>Video and film cameras, pressure meters, microphones and other sensors captured the event in what engineers hope is excruciating detail. Some cameras were probably destroyed in the explosions.</p>
        <p>It will take technicians months to analyze the results and weeks just to develop the film, shot at thousands of frames a second. A major part of the analysis will be to determine which bomb created which effects. Exterior sections of the plane outside the forward cargo hold appeared to have survived intact.</p>
        <p>The object of the tests is to develop baggage containers or liners for the cargo area that will allow a plane to survive a bombing without a break in its skin. In flight, such a break can tear a plane apart. Plans for the exercise began shortly after the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. Security experts were confident that the tests would teach them a great deal, regardless of the level of damage.</p>
        <p>Paul A. Polksi, the director of the Office of Aviation Security Research and Development at the Federal Aviation Administration, said before the test that it would be successful whatever the outcome. On Sunday, Mr. Polski said, engineers will begin tracing stress cracks and understanding the dynamics of the explosion.</p>
        <p>The plane used in the test today was built in 1971.Brought to this airfield in 1994, the 747 was stripped of its engines and most other valuable parts and was missing part of its tail, but the cabin still held pressure well, test officials said. A few seats were in place -- two had crash dummies belted in with a video camera trained on them for the test. Sixty channels of data flowed from monitoring equipment on board through cables to remote computers.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. tried out a baggage container hardened with a substance that resembles Kevlar, the material in bulletproof vests. British officials tried putting a liner hardened with a similar material between the container and the fuselage. The British also tried a simpler method of protection: lining a container with rigid foam eight inches thick. The foam was not intended to absorb the force of the explosion, but was supposed to keep the bomb farther from the container's edge and the fuselage.</p>
        <p>The American containers were filled with luggage lost on American airlines and never claimed. The British used rags soaked in a nonflammable solution. Fire hoses were laid inside the plane before the test, along with hoses for carbon dioxide, to minimize the chance of a post-explosion fire that could destroy data or damage monitoring equipment.</p>
        <p>A major question is whether enough is left of the plane for another American agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, to perform extensive testing on its center wing fuel tank. The safety board wants to do the tests as part of its investigation into the crash of another 747, T.W.A. Flight 800 last July.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A.'s hopes are highest for the hardened container made of Spectra, a Kevlar-like material that forms an extremely strong fabric. Mixed with a resin, it becomes rigid and feels like hard plastic. It is made by the Jaycor Corporation, a San Diego company that uses Spectra and other composites to make structural components for military planes.</p>
        <p>In the Lockerbie crash, the British Air Accident Investigation Branch determined that shock waves from the bomb had rippled across the plane and recombined far from the site of the explosion, causing more damage in distant spots. After the test today, engineers will determine whether the containers translated the bomb blasts into shocks to the floor beams and, if so, whether they caused damage.</p>
        <p>Hardening the walls of luggage containers would be part of an overlapping net of precautions that would include machines that scan bags, dogs that detect explosives and other steps. British officials say planes often survive on-board explosions, especially ones in the passenger cabin. But Pan Am Flight 103, which blew up over Lockerbie in December 1988, was brought down by 12 to 14 ounces of explosive, according to unclassified documents.</p>
        <p>Today's old Air France 747 was by far the closest to a civilian model in flying condition. The test required precise simultaneous timing because of the threat of puncturing the skin and decompressing the plane. If the blasts had been done sequentially and the first had popped the balloon, the last three would have been much less valuable.</p>
        <p>The test, on a runway used by the Royal Air Force during World War II, is the culmination of years of planning. Developing hardened baggage containers was one of the major recommendations of British safety officials in their 1990 report on the Lockerbie crash, but progress has been slow. In the next few months, though, the Federal Aviation Administration hopes to provide the airlines with 10 to 50 containers for them to test, to see how they stand up to everyday use.</p>
        <p>But even if the container portion of today's test is judged successful from a technical standpoint, other considerations remain. The container that the F.A.A. is leaning toward, the all-composite model, costs about $20,000. The standard aluminum model is one-tenth that price. A 747 carries as many as 32 such containers, and the airlines are not eager to spend more for them.</p>
