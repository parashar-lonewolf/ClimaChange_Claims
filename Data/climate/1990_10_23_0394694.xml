        <p>Ozone Shield Current Law</p>
        <p>No specific provision. The destruction of the ozone shield was not widely recognized as a problem when the original law New Provisions</p>
        <p>Would halt production of these chemicals destroying the ozone shield that protects earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation:</p>
        <p>* Chlorofluorocarbons and carbon tetrachloride - phased out through the 1990's, outlawed by Jan. 1, 2000;</p>
        <p>* Methyl chloroform - outlawed by Jan. 1, 2002.</p>
        <p>* Small amounts would still be allowed in medical devices, fire extinguishers, and on airlines.</p>
        <p>* Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, new compounds that have replaced chlorofluorocarbons in some usesm, outlawed for aerosol cans and insulating material by Jan. 1, 1994; production to be ended in 2030.</p>
        <p>* Recycling and disposal -- stricter controls covering ozone-depleting chemcials recovered from air conditioners, refrigerators and other equiment. Motor Vehicles: Current Law</p>
        <p>Maximum tallpipe emission standars are 1.0 grams per mile for nitrogen oxide and 0.41 grams per mile for hydrocarbons New Provisions</p>
        <p>* Tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides to be reduced by 35 percent and 60 percent respectively in nearly half of all new cars starting with 1994 model year and 100 percent of new cars by 1996.</p>
        <p>* Starting in 1998, all cars sold are required to have pollution control equipment that meets new emission standards and is sturdy enough to last 10 years or 100,000 miles.</p>
        <p>* Manufacturers of cars sold in this country would have to produce and experimental fleet to be sold in Southern California market that use new technology to meet even stricter standards: 150,000 cars annually by 1996, 300,000 cars by 1998.</p>
        <p>* Oil companies would be required to offer new kinds of gasoline that burn more cleanly; beginning in 1992, cleaner fuels to be sold in cities with worst carbon monoxide pollution problems.</p>
        <p>* By 1996, 40 percent of all new cars must be equipped to trap volatile organic chemicals that escape in refueling; all new cars would need filters by 1999. Urban Smog: Current Law</p>
        <p>Requires areas to meet health standards for six pollutants, including ground-level ozone, a main ingredient of urban smog. New Provisions</p>
        <p>* Would establishes 5 categories of ozone non-attainment areas (marginal, moderate, serious, severe, extreme); sets deadlines of 3, 6, 9, 15 and 20 years respectively for attaining standards. (Only one city, Los Angeles, is in the extreme category.)</p>
        <p>* All except marginal areas must achieve 15 percent reductions within 6 years; serious, severe, and extreme (generally) must achieve 3 percent per year thereafter.</p>
        <p>* Would control sources emitting 100 tons per year (tpy) in marginal and moderate areas; 50 tpy in serious areas; 25 tpy in severe areas; and 10 tpy in extreme area. Acid Rain Current Law</p>
        <p>No specific provisions. Acid rain was not widely recognized as a problem when the original law was passed. New Provisions</p>
        <p>The amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide that can be poured from smokestacks into the atmosphere would be cut in half.</p>
        <p>* Sulfur dioxide emissions would be cut by 10 million tons annually by the 2000; half of the reduction would occur by Jan. 1, 1995, when the 111 largest sulfur-emitting electric utility plants in 22 states would be required to meet stricter standards.</p>
        <p>* Nitrogen oxide emissions would be cut by 2 million to 4 million tons annually by requiring utilities to meet the first specific limits on the pollutant ever approved by Congress; first limits would go into effect 18 months after bill is approved with additional limits to be established in 1997. Toxic Air Pollutants Current Law</p>
        <p>E.P.A. required to protect public health from toxic chemicals in the air with "an ample margin of safety." Seven chemicals were regulated since 1970. New Provisions</p>
        <p>* Would list 189 toxic pollutants and require E.P.A. to establish a list of about 250 categories of hazardous pollutants (chemical plants, oil refineries, steel plants, etc.) for purpose of promulgating stadards.</p>
        <p>* Largest number of polluters would be required to install the best pollution control equipment available between 1995 and 2003. Regulations are intended to reduce the emissions of toxic air pollutants by as much as 90 percent by 2003.</p>
        <p>* E.P.A. would then set new standards for each chemical to provide an ample margin of safety for nearby residents. Ample margin is a 1-in-10,000 cancer risk to the most exposed person.</p>
        <p>* Coke ovens would get an extension until 2020 if they meet certain interim standards.</p>
        <p>* Would establish an independent agency, the Chemical Safety Board, to investigate chemical accidents to determine their causes; would require industrial plants to prepare formal safety reviews which would be available to the public; would authorize E.P.A to set new safety standards at plants where bulk of toxic chemicals are used. Worker Compensation Current Law</p>
        <p>There is no such provision in the current law. New Provisions</p>
        <p>Would establish a program to provide compensation for workers displaced by new law. Over the next five years, it is estimated to cost $250 million.</p>
