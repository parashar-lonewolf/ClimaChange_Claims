        <p>Much of Europe baked in the sixth week of a heat wave today, with the temperature expected to go as high as 100 degrees in eastern Germany and Poland later this week and no relief forecast until Sunday.</p>
        <p>Last month was the hottest and sunniest on record in most places from the Netherlands to Hungary and Poland. Hamburg and Stockholm, normally cool and breezy even in the summer, registered the highest average temperature for July ever, 71 degrees.</p>
        <p>Millions of Germans and Scandinavians pay thousands of dollars to fly or drive to Italy and Spain to spend their vacations in hot weather just like this, but most do not have air-conditioning in their homes, offices or cars and do not like it when the heat comes to them instead.</p>
        <p>Except for brief respites produced by severe thunderstorms, the heat has been unabated across most of Europe since the end of June.  Many Drown in Poland</p>
        <p>In the Czech Republic, it got so hot that railroad tracks bent out of line, and the state railways ordered a speed limit of 38 miles per hour between noon and 8 P.M. In Poland, a record 545 people drowned last month seeking respite in lakes, rivers and swimming pools.</p>
        <p>The Baltic Sea, normally a frigid place where bathers need bodysuits even in August, has warmed up to 73 degrees off the German coast, producing a bloom of red and blue algae that caused some swimmers to break out in a rash.</p>
        <p>Now brownouts caused by shortages of electricity loom in Arnheim, the Netherlands, and Hanover, but not because power plants are overwhelmed by demand from home air-conditioners. The water in the Rhine and the Weser rivers that the plants use to cool their turbines had become so warm -- nearly 79 degrees -- that they would have to shut down if it rose any further, officials said.</p>
        <p>Salmon and sea bass, which have barely managed to re-establish themselves in the Rhine after years of human antipollution efforts, would go belly-up if the water temperature reached 86, according to Paul Hagel, deputy director of the Netherlands Fisheries Institute. The normal temperature is 68.</p>
        <p>In Germany, Environment Minister Klaus Topfer told a newspaper over the weekend that he was afraid the unusual warm weather signaled a possible climate change from the much-predicted "greenhouse effect" caused by the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities.</p>
        <p>Too early to tell, retorted Hans Jurgen Swantes of the German Weather Service in Offenbach. Just because no July as hot as this year's had been recorded in the Netherlands since record-keeping began in 1706 or in Germany in the last 100 years did not mean that the climate had changed irreversibly. The Weather Explained</p>
        <p>This summer's warm weather in Europe, they say, has been produced by a series of high pressure areas moving in from the Atlantic and the North Sea, and then pumping up warm, humid air from the Mediterranean and blocking cooler air.</p>
        <p>Skeptics say things are out of whack on a global scale. They point to a heat wave in Japan, where the average temperature in Tokyo was a record 83 degrees. Blistering, prolonged heat well over 100 degrees killed thousands of people in India in June, and forest fires have ravaged Spain and the western United States.</p>
        <p>Ski resorts in the European Alps have been complaining about warm winters and lower-than-normal snowfall for the last decade, and the glaciers on higher elevations have been gradually receding in recent years.  Ecologists are warning that disaster lies ahead if human behavior does not change.</p>
        <p>In the heavily industrialized German state of Hesse, the $3.72-a-gallon price of gasoline does not deter motorists from roaring down the speed-limit-free superhighways at 100 miles an hour and more, but warnings that concentrations of ozone were rising dangerously in the heat got 80 percent of them to keep below 56 m.p.h. last week, the police said.</p>
