        <p>Scientists may have overestimated by about 25 percent in calculating worldwide emissions of a gas that promotes global warming, a study says.</p>
        <p>That means efforts to reduce atmospheric buildup of methane by attacking such sources as natural gas leaks may have more effect than previously thought, said A. R. Ravishankara, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., and co-author of an article published in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>The estimate of worldwide methane emission is calculated from measurements of atmospheric concentrations of methane and its rate of removal from the atmosphere, the scientists said.</p>
        <p>The new laboratory study suggests that the rate of removal has been overestimated, which means estimates of global emissions must be reduced to fit the observed concentrations, they said.</p>
        <p>Methane contributes to global warming because it helps the atmosphere trap energy radiating from earth. Its atmospheric concentration is increasing by about 1 percent a year because of such sources as burning of plant matter and emissions from wetlands, rice fields, landfills, coal mines, oil and gas wells and leaks in natural gas distribution systems.</p>
        <p>The main process that removes methane from the atmosphere is a reaction with a chemical entity called hydroxyl radicals. The study found that the rate of that removal process was overestimated by about 25 percent. (AP)  SCIENCE WATCH</p>
