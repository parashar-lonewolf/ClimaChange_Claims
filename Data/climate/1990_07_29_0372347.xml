        <p>LEAD: As the nation's cities grapple with air pollution from automobile exhaust, natural gas - best known for heating homes and cooking dinners - is drawing increasing attention as a clean-burning alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel.

        <p>As the nation's cities grapple with air pollution from automobile exhaust, natural gas - best known for heating homes and cooking dinners - is drawing increasing attention as a clean-burning alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel. The General Motors Corporation said last week it would sell a minimum of 1,000 pickup trucks powered by natural gas starting next year, and United Parcel Service said recently it would adapt up to half its 100,000 delivery trucks to operate on compressed gas.</p>
        <p>For all the promise of natural gas to reduce noxious emissions, however, there are problems to overcome before many motorists will pull up to a natural gas pump and say, ''Fill it up.'' Vehicles will have to be adapted to accommodate the heavy tanks needed to contain the pressurized gas, engines must be modified to prevent problems with burned valves and a nationwide network of refueling stations must be established.</p>
        <p>And, as engineers are fond of pointing out, no fuel is perfect. Because it is a gas at all but very low temperatures, natural gas packs a lot less power than comparable amounts of liquid fuels. Gasoline, for example, has an energy density of about 114,000 British thermal units per gallon, compared with just under 20,000 for a gallon of natural gas stored at a pressure of 2,400 pounds per square inch.</p>
        <p>That means more fuel is needed to travel the same distance between refills. On some trucks the space is available for additional tanks, but there are few inches to spare on compact and subcompact cars, so operating range can be a serious problem. One way around it is to have dual-fuel capacity. If the natural gas runs out, a driver can switch back to gasoline or diesel. Indeed, virtually all the estimated 30,000 vehicles adapted to use natural gas in this country - cars, trucks and delivery vans - have dual-fuel capacity.</p>
        <p>This means, however, that the gas is being used in an engine designed to produce peak performance using gasoline - most commonly unleaded regular with an octane rating of 89. Natural gas has an octane rating of 120, but this property has little value in a low-compression engine. Instead, as the low energy density gas displaces some of the air entering the cylinder, the engine's power declines by up to 20 percent. U.P.S. officials acknowledge there is a performance drop with natural gas, but say it is not a problem. ''We do not operate at high speeds,'' said Don Parkinson, an automotive engineering manager. ''The loss is not noticeable in the urban environments we operate in.''</p>
        <p>Natural gas is composed largely of methane, the simplest of the hydrocarbons. As such it is free of the toxic components of gasoline, like benzene. And since it is stored under high pressure in a sealed system, there are none of the problems of evaporation common to gasoline-powered vehicles in refueling and operation.</p>
        <p>Unburned hydrocarbons, lost to the atmosphere through evaporation, are considered among the important contributors to the formation of low-level ozone in urban air.</p>
        <p>Inside a car engine, natural gas burns more cleanly than gasoline, emitting fewer hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. And because it has a higher hydrogen-carbon ratio than more complex hydrocarbons, natural gas emits less carbon dioxide, which is believed to increase global warming.</p>
        <p>Because emissions regulations are being tightened at Federal and state levels and because restrictions on travel are being considered in such highly polluted areas as the Los Angeles basin, natural gas engines are being developed for trucks heavier than 8,500 pounds, as well as for light-duty vehicles like the U.P.S. vans and automobiles. New buses bought by municipalities will have to meet the standards next year; big trucks that travel between cities, by 1994.</p>
        <p>Not only is there less energy in a given amount of natural gas, but it burns differently. ''The flame speed is slower with methane than gasoline,'' said David Hilder, an engineer at the General Motors Research Laboratories in Warren, Mich. ''So that means you should advance the spark timing a few degrees.'' If you don't, he said, the engine will not deliver as much power at full throttle.''</p>
        <p>But many of the compromises inherent in gasoline engines converted to use natural gas can be avoided if they are designed to optimize the alternate fuel. And those dedicated engines seem to be on the way. An official of PAS Inc., which will modify the 1,000 G.M. trucks, said they will have modified valves and piston rings. Later versions may have altered compression ratios and combustion chambers as engineers gain experience with the fuel, he said.</p>
        <p>Big diesel engines may undergo even more change. Faced with stiff new emissions limits for heavy trucks in 1994, most heavy-duty engine companies are working on adapting diesels to alternate fuels.</p>
        <p>Engineers say one important change for a gasoline engine would be to take advantage of natural gas's high octane by increasing the compression ratio, or the amount the fuel-air mixture is squeezed by the rising piston. Typical gasoline engines have ratios of between 8.5 to 1 and 9 to 1. With natural gas, that could be increased to 12 or 13 to 1, thus increasing the density of the charge and restoring the lost power.</p>
        <p>''You can get most of the power back by increasing the compression,'' Mr. Hilder said. ''Or you can keep the old ratio and use a turbocharger,'' which increases the amount of air crammed into a cylinder. But too aggressive an approach can cause pollution problems, warns Kelly M. Brown, an engineer with the Ford Motor Company. Regardless of the fuel used, most of the content of the cylinder is air, which is about 20 percent oxygen and 80 percent nitrogen.</p>
        <p>At normal temperatures, the oxygen and nitrogen do not interact. But in an engine, they can combine to form various oxides of nitrogen, which are pollutants whose emissions are subject to government regulations. ''Natural gas is low on hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, but it is not necessarily as good on oxides of nitrogen,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>In a recent report on the effects of light vehicles powered by natural gas, the Environmental Protection Agency said that keeping oxides of nitrogen emissions down ''will be the most difficult technical area and is clearly one in which more research, development and demonstration is necessary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said new catalysts will have to be developed to break down these oxides in the oxygen-rich environment natural gas engines will most likely operate. Current catalysts have been developed for a mixture that has just the right amount of the reactants.</p>
        <p>Another problem with engines running on natural gas is burned valves. Some Ford Rangers designed to use natural gas had specially hardened valve seats because a totally gaseous fuel does not have the lubrication properties of a liquid. Even so, some pitting and scarring was evident when the engines were torn down after use.</p>
        <p>In heavy-duty engines, the modifications needed to operate on natural gas are so extensive that it will be hard to refer to them as diesels. Diesel engines operate by compressing the air-fuel charge until it becomes hot enough to self-ignite. This requires compression ratios on the order of 19 to 1. Even with its good anti-knock properties, gas would probably ignite prematurely with this much compression, so ratios in gas-powered engines will probably not be above 15 to 1, according to the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>But it is also difficult to make natural gas auto-ignite predictably, the way diesel fuel will. So engines powered by natural gas will probably need a spark ignition system, like an automobile.</p>
        <p>''Some people call them 'giesels,' '' said Jeffrey Seisler, director of the Natural Gas Vehicle Association. ''Steady state diesel engines have been running on natural gas for years.'' Steady-state engines power equipment that runs at one speed.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers of heavy duty engines are preparing natural gas modification kits for existing diesel engines to help them meet upcoming pollution standards intended to eliminate their characteristic black smoke. New engines are also being developed exclusively for natural gas use.</p>
        <p>On larger vehicles, the storage requirement for natural gas are likely to be less of a burden than with automobiles. ''Heavy duty vehicles generally have sufficient space available'' to store gas cylinders, an E.P.A. report notes, and ''are not greatly affected by the added weight of the fuel cylinders.''</p>
