        <p>LEAD: First there was smog; now comes vog.</p>
        <p>First there was smog; now comes vog.</p>
        <p>Vog, for volcanic fog, sweeps around this beautiful Big Island of Hawaii daily, bringing residents a dose of the kind of bad air that many came here from the urban mainland to escape, as well as possible health hazards.</p>
        <p>After more than seven years of eruption and fiery venting of lava and noxious gases, the Kilauea volcano here has brought both blessings and curses.</p>
        <p>The spectacular show of the planet's most powerful natural forces has drawn a steadily increasing flow of money-laden tourists to the island, geologically the youngest spot on earth. But for many others the price has been high. Lava flows have destroyed the coastal town of Kalapana, burning 130 houses. Less dramatic but perhaps potentially even more destructive is the vog.</p>
        <p>Soupy Haze Over Island</p>
        <p>Every day 1,500 to 2,200 metric tons of volcanic gases pour into the Hawaiian air. On many days, a soupy haze hangs over the island, particularly on the fast-growing western coast near Kona, thick with tourists, where thousands of mainlanders have migrated in recent years in search of clean air. Sometimes the vog spreads northwest across the island chain as far as Honolulu, 150 miles away.</p>
        <p>The gases also produce acid rain nearly as concentrated as that in the industrial East Coast of the mainland, and doctors fear that the elderly and the young among the 120,000 island residents are suffering respiratory problems. People with asthma, allergies, sinus problems and related conditions report that their troubles have been aggravated by the vog.</p>
        <p>Renee Bromley, who lives in Honaunau, 16 miles south of Kona, believes the vog has caused respiratory problems for her and her two teen-age daughters, Cecilia, 17 years old, and Sonja, 15. ''Sometimes I feel I have to catch my breath,'' she said. She recently had to resume taking allergy medicines.</p>
        <p>Precautions Are Urged</p>
        <p>Ms. Bromley, who sells jewelry, has lived on the island for 20 years and recalls the days of crystal clear skies. ''Now most days are hazy, even if it's sunny,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While the health consequences have not yet been proved, the Hawaii Thoracic Society has urged residents to take precautions during heavy vog episodes, like wearing surgical masks and staying indoors with air conditioning.</p>
        <p>In January, the Hawaii County Council formed the Hawaii County Vog Authority, a panel of medical and volanic experts and political leaders.</p>
        <p>Kilauea shows no sign of letting up from the eruption that began Jan. 3, 1983, said Barry Stokes of the United States Geological Survey's volcano observatory in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, The vog continues to vent at three major sites: at the summit of the 4,090-foot cratered peak and at two lower vents, Pu'u 'O'o and Kupaianaha. Lava from the last vent destroyed Kalapana.</p>
        <p>The emissions are mainly sulfur dioxide, which produces an odor of rotten eggs in the immediate area. When the gas rises into the air, it is further oxidized into sulfates, which in turn combine with hydrogen to form tiny droplets of sulfuric acid. When incorporated into clouds, this results in rain that is highly acidic.</p>
        <p>The prevailing trade winds usually carry the vog toward the southwest, or around the mountains to the western coast of the island, the Kona Coast, where it becomes trapped under clouds in an inversion similar to the smog of Los Angeles. On some days, the winds change and the vog hangs over this lush city on the rain-sodden northeast coast, but preliminary tests show vog concentrations on the Kona coast are five times those here in Hilo.</p>
        <p>Water Supply Endangered</p>
        <p>A particular concen is that the acid rain is causing poisonous lead to leach out of the nails and solder in the metal catchment systems in which residents collect drinking water. In 1988, tests found that water in 24 percent of the catchment systems had levels of lead above the maximum proposed by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Another worry, though a local one, is what will happen in the next few days as the Kalapana lava flow enters the ocean. The heat converts magnesium chloride salts in sea water into hydrogen chloride, a highly corrosive acidic gas. Civil Defense authorities are planning to measure the levels and evacuate nearby residents if the acidic gas reaches dangerous levels.</p>
        <p>Though seven years have passed since the eruptions began, there has been little systematic study either of the vog or its effect on health. Local political and health officials have been pressuring state officials without success for money to study to problem.</p>
        <p>Only last year did the American Lung Association of Hawaii, with a $100,000 grant from the Leahi Trust in Honolulu, began a study. A main question is just what vog consists of, said James W. Morrow, director of environmental health for the lung association. He has placed two sets of instruments to analyze vog, one in Hilo and the other at Captain Cook on the Kona Coast.</p>
        <p>But the money runs out in a few months, and local experts are trying to persuade the state government in Honolulu to continue monitoring. ''The way we'll get the state to pay attention is when vog hits Honolulu,'' said Mr. Stokes of the volcano observatory.</p>
        <p>Lava Stalls on Way to Sea</p>
        <p>KALAPANA, Hawaii, May 6 (AP) -An arm of the lava flow that is encircling this coastal town stalled today as molten rock settled in a low spot just short of its expected plunge to the sea.</p>
        <p>The flow pooled at the base of sand dunes near Harry K. Brown State Park, said Bruce Butts, deputy administrator for the Hawaii County Civil Defense. It was just a matter of time until enough lava amassed to spill over the sand and ooze into the ocean, he said.</p>
