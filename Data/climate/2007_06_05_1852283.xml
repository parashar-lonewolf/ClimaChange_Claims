        <p>In his first formal encounter with foreign journalists since assuming office last month, President Nicolas Sarkozy worked hard to be informal.</p>
        <p>France's new head of state arrived in shirtsleeves for the interview Monday in the Élysée Palace's Salon Napoléon III. He spoke about his anticipated global diplomatic debut at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Germany later this week while simultaneously eating several thin slices of charcuterie.</p>
        <p>He shifted repeatedly in a gilded armchair covered in green brocade, casually leaning back and propping up one of his legs from time to time. At one point, he downed a large white pill -- without water.</p>
        <p>But he drew the line when it came to recording devices. Before the hourlong conversation started, he ordered the seven print reporters -- each from a different G-8 country -- to turn them off.</p>
        <p>''We'll do 'off the record' and then we'll say what's 'on the record,' okay?'' Mr. Sarkozy said while the recorders were still running. ''That doesn't bother you? Excuse me.'' He added that seeing so many tape recorders before him, ''I take three steps back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy is in only his third week as president, but he is already exuding confidence, even cockiness, in dealing with some of the more arcane areas of foreign policy, and exercising control in dealing with the news media.</p>
        <p>Even as he expressed admiration for the United States, he criticized the Bush administration for its position on global warming, signaling that there could be substantive differences with the United States in a Sarkozy administration.</p>
        <p>''You cannot be the first and strongest in the world and say to the rest of the world on such a subject that, 'We are not interested in this and we will use technology to solve the problem,' '' he said, adding, ''It is not possible. It is not even in the interest of the United States. I don't say this in an aggressive way, but because I believe it profoundly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy was referring to Mr. Bush's unexpected proposal last week suggesting a nonbinding parallel process to that of the United Nations on climate change. The proposal includes investment in energy-efficient technologies, while maintaining American opposition to set targets for a long-term global cut in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>The proposal was sharply criticized in a number of European capitals as a meaningless initiative intended to mute criticism of the United States at the G-8 summit meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy called it ''encouraging'' that Mr. Bush now recognized that there was a global warming problem, but said, ''In my eyes, it is not sufficient.''</p>
        <p>The purpose of a bilateral meeting he is scheduled to have with Mr. Bush on Friday is, he said, ''to underline my willingness to be an ally of the United States,'' but not ''a vassal.''</p>
        <p>On Afghanistan, where the Bush administration wants France and other troop-contributing countries to do more, not less, Mr. Sarkozy reiterated his campaign pledge that French troops would not remain there indefinitely, adding that he intended to raise the issue when he met with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''We do not have the mission to stay there forever, but to leave now would show a lack of unity with our allies,'' Mr. Sarkozy said. He said it was essential to find a solution ''between the two extremes,'' and most important, to carry out the ''gigantic job'' of training the Afghan Army.</p>
        <p>In dealing with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Sarkozy called for a ''strategic partnership and very friendly relations,'' rather than confrontation.</p>
        <p>Citing the importance of personal contact to resolve diplomatic problems, he said he wanted to know ''what worries'' Mr. Putin, ''what mobilizes him'' and ''what are his red lines.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy did not pass judgment on the American plan to build a ballistic missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland, and urged dialogue as the only way to resolve the diplomatic impasse. But he noted that the system would not be able to stop an attack by Russian missiles.</p>
        <p>''We must talk to them,'' Mr. Sarkozy said of the Russians, but stressed that the issue should be discussed at NATO rather than at the G-8 meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has threatened to revert to a cold war stance of aiming missiles at Europe if the United States goes forward with its missile defense plan.</p>
        <p>As for Iraq, Mr. Sarkozy reiterated that his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, made a ''good decision'' in keeping French troops out of the conflict. But Mr. Sarkozy also refused to discuss a possible exit strategy for American troops, saying, ''I do not think that a country without troops in the country is the best place to answer these questions.''</p>
        <p>After the interview, Mr. Sarkozy's aides agreed to put most of his remarks on the record, but said they had not recorded the interview. The quotations attributed to Mr. Sarkozy were verified with reporters present from the Financial Times and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.</p>
