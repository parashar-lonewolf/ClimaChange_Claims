        <p>The walls and roof are almost finished on a huge new General Motors diesel engine factory in southwestern Ohio. Several thousand engineers in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois are still developing new diesel engines for future cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>But the industry's broad plans to start putting diesels into millions of vehicles early in the next century have suddenly been thrown into confusion. California environmental regulators voted earlier this month to eliminate the more lenient pollution standards that have long prevailed for diesel-powered vehicles. Instead, diesel engines will have to meet the same pollution standards as gasoline-powered vehicles.</p>
        <p>These gasoline engine standards are being tightened, so regulators say that it will be almost impossible to design diesel engines to meet the new rules, despite considerable progress over the last decade in the design of cleaner diesels. The result is a virtual ban on diesel engines in California, which accounts for a tenth of the nation's auto sales, once the new rules are phased in between 2004 and 2007.</p>
        <p>Auto industry executives are furious. They had been counting on diesel engines as part of the answer to environmentalists' concerns about global warming and poor fuel economy, particularly the low gas mileage of full-size sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>The latest diesel engines use as much as 33 percent less fuel per mile as their gasoline counterparts, according to auto industry engineers. And while even the cleanest diesels still produce slightly more soot and smog-causing gases than gasoline engines, diesels emit up to 20 percent less carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>G.M. in particular had been counting on diesels to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases that may contribute to global warming, and the company is particularly upset by the latest setback. ''It's a major concern coming out of the California regulations,'' said John F. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of the General Motors Corporation. ''It goes to the fundamentals of what is our long-term strategy for dealing with emissions and so forth.''</p>
        <p>Engine manufacturers are even angrier. They contend that if they build gasoline engines, they will be criticized for contributing to global warming, and if they build diesel engines, they will be accused of contributing to smog and soot.</p>
        <p>''Which environmentalist group is going to be in power tomorrow, so I know whether diesels are going to be the greatest thing or the worst thing?'' asked Timothy D. Leuliette, the vice chairman of Detroit Diesel, a unit of the Penske Corporation.</p>
        <p>California regulators say that reducing emissions of greenhouse gases is not their problem, and should be handled by the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. ''Our clear, unmistakable authority to enact regulations is to reduce urban smog,'' said Allan S. Hirsch, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. ''Global warming is an international issue and the U.S. E.P.A. ought to be the agency taking the lead.''</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. is drafting its own new- vehicle pollution standards, to be released early next year, and declined to discuss what they would include. The agency has a tradition of adopting regulations slightly less strict than California's. The California Air Resources Board's own technical staff recommended a more lenient standard covering diesels, but the board rejected this idea after strong pleas from environmentalists during the hours before the board's final vote on Nov. 5.</p>
        <p>Many American environmentalists are dubious about diesels. They point to research indicating that tiny soot particles can cause cancer, and warn that diesels will always create somewhat more soot than gasoline engines.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists also warn that converting to diesels will limit opportunities to tighten pollution rules even further someday. And they contend that diesel engines are not the only way to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases -- alternatives include building smaller vehicles, developing advanced technologies like fuel cells or even taking such simple steps as installing multivalve gasoline engines, said Daniel Becker, an energy efficiency expert at the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker said that in installing diesel engines, auto makers were not really interested in addressing global warming. Instead, he said, they want to keep building ever-bigger sport utility vehicles, which earn the highest profit margins, and must install diesels to continue meeting Federal fuel-economy rules. The light-truck operations of G.M., the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. are all struggling to comply with these rules.</p>
        <p>Auto makers are beginning to install relatively fuel-efficient multi-valve engines in some of their large sport utility vehicles, but are reluctant to do so on a wide scale because this hurts the vehicles' towing capacity. And the American public shows little interest in buying small fuel-efficient cars, said Robert J. Eaton, a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>Auto makers, particularly G.M., last tried to sell diesel engines during the oil crisis of the early 1980's, when high gasoline prices made some buyers interested in diesels' greater fuel economy. But the diesel engines marketed then were comparatively smoky, noisy and smelly. They have virtually disappeared from the light-vehicle market in the United States.</p>
        <p>Yet since the early 1980's, enormous progress has been made in building better diesels. The latest diesels coming out of the laboratories emit no visible smoke, produce up to 90 percent less soot and generate up to 75 percent less noise than the vehicles of the early 1980's, industry engineers say. Even the smell has faded.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers have spent heavily on diesel development mainly because of these engines' popularity in Europe. Fuel prices are four times as high per gallon in Europe as in the United States, and there has been considerable public interest there in global warming. Diesels are now installed in 22 percent of new family vehicles in Europe, compared with less than 2 percent here. Engine factories have been unable to keep up with demand in Europe, and diesels are expected to reach 30 percent of the European market, once the factories catch up.</p>
        <p>The auto industry has a history of saying that further pollution reductions are impossible, only to find ways to comply with new regulations. Patrick E. Charbonneau, the vice president for engine engineering at the Navistar International Corporation, which is designing diesel engine prototypes for the next generation of Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator full-size sport utility vehicles, said that research on diesel emissions was not as advanced as research on gasoline engine emissions. Further spending might lead to breakthroughs, he said.</p>
        <p>But making diesel engines as clean as gasoline engines is particularly difficult because current regulations, particularly in California, allow diesel fuel to be much dirtier than gasoline. California regulations require oil companies to remove almost all of the sulfur from gasoline, for example, because sulfur clogs catalytic converters and allows a vehicle's emissions to soar. But California's rules allow diesel to have nearly 17 times the sulfur of gasoline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirsch said that the state's environmental regulators had not focused on sulfur levels in diesel until now, but would try to work with the Environmental Protection Agency on the issue next year.</p>
