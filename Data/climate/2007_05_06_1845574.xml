        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your April 29 editorial ''Storm Warnings'' refers to my August 1988 article about Westchester's waterways. I called for a ''watchman of the waterways'' to represent the needs of our county's rivers and streams. We still need such a position, with the power to be effective. Flooding and pollution are even worse problems now. And we're seeing the impact of global warming on climate change.</p>
        <p>Open space is being destroyed one parcel at a time. The destruction of trees and excavation in the Mamaroneck River watershed along Route 287 in White Plains is the most recent example.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your April 29 editorial ''Storm Warnings'' refers to my August 1988 article about Westchester's waterways. I called for a ''watchman of the waterways'' to represent the needs of our county's rivers and streams. We still need such a position, with the power to be effective. Flooding and pollution are even worse problems now. And we're seeing the impact of global warming on climate change.</p>
        <p>Open space is being destroyed one parcel at a time. The destruction of trees and excavation in the Mamaroneck River watershed along Route 287 in White Plains is the most recent example.</p>
        <p>Office park projects are touted for being ''green'' when their very existence in formerly undeveloped settings creates increased environmental stress. The county's master plan promotes putting new buildings in places that can be supported by the existing infrastructure, including public transportation. Instead, we get remote Ridge Hill in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Your editorial refers to the inevitable outbreak of studies and ''summit meetings'' that will surely follow the recent flooding, and I have to admit that I'm involved in planning one such meeting. It's easy to be cynical. But, as I concluded in 1988, we have to keep trying, for ''how can we save the earth if we can't save the Mamaroneck River?''</p>
