        <p>Prompted by reports that airlines are trying to save money by using less fresh air in airplane cabins, a House panel this week will start an investigation of air quality on planes.</p>
        <p>"We intend to make a full and complete inquiry," Representative Tim Valentine, the North Carolina Democrat who heads the Technology, Environment and Aviation subcommittee of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, said Friday in an interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valentine said the investigation was prompted by a report in The New York Times saying that airlines, in a move to save money, were circulating less fresh air into the cabins of many airplanes. Flight attendants, as well as some passengers, complain that the practice causes headaches, nausea and other health problems, especially after long flights.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also begun inquiries into the effects of a reduction of fresh air, which occurs on newer planes. Aircraft built before the mid-80's provided cabins with 100 percent fresh air that was circulated every three minutes. Looking at Contaminates</p>
        <p>But the newer models provide half fresh air and half recirculated air that is freshened every six or seven minutes. The recirculation system saves fuel and money. Air that is brought in from outside comes through the engines and is heated to very high temperatures; it has to be cooled before it enters the cabin. Recirculation saves an average $60,000 a plane annually.</p>
        <p>More than half the seats on the seven million domestic flights last year were on aircraft with the new systems, experts said. Dr. Andrew Horne, a medical officer with the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Medicine, said: "I think it's more desirable to have outside air, but it's a trade-off. If you want to spend more money for fuel, then you get more outside air."</p>
        <p>The disease centers are investigating whether airplane ventilation systems contribute to the spread of contagious diseases, including tuberculosis. "We have been very much concerned with the transmission of respiratory diseases in airlines," said Dr. Walter R. Dowdle, deputy director of the centers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valentine said the panel's investigation would also focus on contaminants in cabin air.</p>
        <p>A Transportation Department report, issued in December 1989, on how smoking affected the air on planes found high levels of carbon monoxide and ozone on some aircraft.</p>
        <p>"While the issue of tobacco smoke on airplanes focused attention on this problem, we can now see what the other villains are, if any," Mr. Valentine said. "It's my understanding that a general conclusion of the report was that there were many other contaminants that should be of concern, including high concentrations of carbon dioxide, ozone and microbiological aerosols and viruses."</p>
        <p>The witnesses at Thursday's hearing are expected to include John Burt, the Federal Aviation Administration's executive director for system development, officials of the disease centers, and representatives of the Association of Flight Attendants, which has complained about the quality of air in airline cabins.</p>
