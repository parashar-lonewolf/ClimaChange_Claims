        <p>OPERA is the granddaddy of the Broadway musical, but the family has become somewhat estranged over the years.</p>
        <p>These days, both generations are looking a little peaked, and so Peter Gelb, the new general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, aims to effect a rapprochement.</p>
        <p>The most notable aspect of his wide-ranging game plan for reconnecting the Met to the larger culture accentuates the importance of opera as an essentially theatrical art, not just classical music in fancy dress. Mr. Gelb has tapped a handful of major theater directors to make their Met debuts, and has inaugurated an alliance with the Met's neighbor, Lincoln Center Theater, to commission a host of works to be developed jointly and produced at the Met or next door.</p>
        <p>Radical as Mr. Gelb's initiatives might seem to Met-goers who prefer tradition to innovation and opera-as-vocal-display to opera-as-musical-drama, Mr. Gelb's bold new vision is in fact a version of a bolder old one, as he acknowledges. Mr. Gelb made reference, in the news conference announcing his plans and in a separate interview, to Rudolf Bing, the Met's legendary general manager from 1950 to 1972. His ambition to focus resources on creating wholly viable theatrical productions echoes one of Sir Rudolf's top priorities when he took over as general manager at the old Met.</p>
        <p>Pre-Bing, opera at the Met was an entrenched society event and a respectable musical one, but something of a washout as a dramatic art. Mostly, the world's top singers performed in front of flats, with little rehearsal, and were largely left to their own devices. Many of them preferred it that way, and bridled when Sir Rudolf expected them to hang around for extensive rehearsals.</p>
        <p>In his first seasons Sir Rudolf raised the standard of production, drawing on Broadway talent with an eye toward improving the theatrical effectiveness of opera at the Met. A new production of ''Die Fledermaus,'' in English, was expressly programmed during his first season for this purpose, and the Broadway figure Garson Kanin was hired to direct it. Alfred Lunt's production of ''Così Fan Tutte,'' also sung in English, was a critical and box office smash that helped re-establish the fortunes of that Mozart masterpiece in the United States. Other stage directors Sir Rudolf introduced to the Met included Tyrone Guthrie and Peter Brook.</p>
        <p>If one eye was on art, the other was on the box office. In his autobiography, ''5,000 Nights at the Opera,'' Sir Rudolf wrote that with ''Fledermaus'' he was ''hoping to draw to the Metropolitan a new audience that usually went to the theaters a few blocks away rather than to the opera house.'' Today the Met finds itself with plenty of empty seats. If musical-theater devotees ill served by Broadway in recent years can be enticed to test the Met's wares by Mr. Gelb's theatrical exploring, so much the better.</p>
        <p>The specter of Regietheater establishing a beachhead on the Met stage could send certain first-nighters into apoplexy. (The German term translates as ''directors' theater'' if you're welcoming, ''Eurotrash'' if you're hostile.) But the debutants Mr. Gelb is bringing in from the theater world are not exactly flame-throwing German rebels.</p>
        <p>Jack O'Brien, whose Broadway expertise ranges from Shakespeare to ''Hairspray,'' will stage Puccini's ''Trittico.'' Bartlett Sher, who directed Adam Guettel's ''Light in the Piazza,'' tries his hand at Rossini's frothy ''Barbiere di Siviglia.'' Mary Zimmerman, as skilled at storytelling as she is at trimming her productions in elegant detail, has been tapped to direct Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' and Rossini's ''Armida.'' Matthew Bourne and Richard Eyre will collaborate on a new ''Carmen.''</p>
        <p>Only the notion of Robert Lepage, the brainy French-Canadian darling of the international festival circuit, getting his hands on Wagner's mighty ''Ring'' has the potential to cause serious consternation. Goodbye, spears and breastplates and viking helmets! Hello, thoughtful ruminations on how ''global warming and climate change make us more conscious than ever of the fragility of this lonely planet.'' Or so Mr. Lepage wrote in a brief note on his ''Ring'' included among the press materials describing Mr. Gelb's plans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lepage is precisely the kind of thoughtful, meticulous director who Wagner might wholly approve of. Wagner proselytized for opera as an art in which all the elements -- music, libretto, scenic design, staging -- contributed to the whole, and Mr. Lepage's productions are elaborately conceived and choreographed down to the last shaft of light. I'd also argue that literal-minded productions of the ''Ring,'' like the Met's current version, do a disservice to Wagner: it can be hard to hear the majesty of the music through the crust of visual clichés that have accrued like barnacles to this celebrated artwork during its century-plus on the stage.</p>
        <p>It's not only Wagner operas that sometimes seem to slide onto the Met stage with a whiff of mothballs. As a regular Met-goer for the last several years, I can certainly testify that there is ample room for improvement on the dramatic front. Mr. Gelb cited Jonathan Miller's direction of ''Pelléas et Mélisande'' and ''Katya Kabanova'' as being ideal for their intelligent integration of musical and dramatic values. The company has plenty of others in its repertory: Robert Carsen's ''Eugene Onegin,'' which returns next season, or Jürgen Flimm's splashily updated ''Salome,'' which seemed an ideal vehicle for the fabulous luridities of that Richard Strauss opera. Robert Wilson's minimalist production of ''Lohengrin,'' predictably booed by first-night fanatics, enthralled me when I caught it the next season, with Karita Mattila.</p>
        <p>But the Met's repertory is also rich in overstuffed, clunky or ill-conceived productions. Critics have been bemoaning Franco Zeffirelli's interior-decorating approach to opera staging for years, but he still owns a big handful of the Met's war horses. Nor is Mr. Zeffirelli the only director unable to resist the temptation to fill the huge Met stage with pointless embroidery. Andrei Serban's recent productions of ''Faust'' and ''Benvenuto Cellini'' were confused traffic jams of conflicting ideas.</p>
        <p>There's no guarantee that hiring theater directors will guarantee a good night at the opera house. If it did, Broadway wouldn't be the dicey proposition it too often is. But Mr. Gelb's decision to add popular theater directors to the roster suggests he is determined to refashion opera at the Met as an enterprise capable of broadening its appeal to reach bigger audiences.</p>
        <p>The Lincoln Center Theater alliance can also be seen as a populist move, and a riskier one. As has been reported, the Met and Lincoln Center Theater have commissioned works from the musical-theater composers Michael John LaChiusa, Jeanine Tesori and Mr. Guettel, in addition to some well-known classical composers.</p>
        <p>There have been numerous instances of boundary-blurring over the decades, and debates are revived periodically over defining the differences between opera and musical theater. Sure, Marc Blitzstein's ''Regina'' opened on Broadway, but has moved firmly into the opera repertory. And several of Stephen Sondheim's shows have followed the same route. But the Met has avoided trafficking in crossover territory (the Gershwins' ''Porgy and Bess'' being the notable exception), and Mr. Gelb says that he isn't planning to change that, at least when it comes to existing repertory. Mr. Sondheim's most operatic work, ''Sweeney Todd,'' has been seen at such top-tier houses as Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Royal Opera in London , but the demon barber won't be terrorizing Met audiences any time soon.</p>
        <p>If Sondheim can't work at the Met, it's not clear that Mr. LaChiusa or Ms. Tesori, composers whose work has divided critics and not found spectacular favor with theater audiences, will be able to either. And in any case, the new program implicitly acknowledges that the commissions are a gamble, at least for the Met; it has been cannily structured to accommodate a wide range of outcomes. It will give some of these theater composers a chance to dream on a grander scale than the usual realities of theater economics permit. But it also allows for the possibility that some -- or all -- will not be able to compose a work of musical theater with enough breadth and substance to hold the Met stage, or the attention of its audiences.</p>
        <p>In which case, back to Broadway, kids!</p>
        <p>That is, if Broadway will have you. The new project also demonstrates that the commercial theater no longer knows what to do with musical-theater composers of serious ambition, and indeed that nonprofit companies like Lincoln Center Theater are finding it hard to single-handedly support the work of emerging composers.</p>
        <p>The popularity of Mr. Guettel's ''Light in the Piazza'' (produced by Lincoln Center Theater) has been a heartening surprise, suggesting that audiences are indeed hungry for music-theater works that are not just marketing nostalgia or satire or camp. But commercial producers have all but abandoned the search for ambitious new musical voices, and the amount of money required to encourage their development is more than most nonprofit theaters can sustain from year to year.</p>
        <p>It leaves us to wonder what would befall a new Stephen Sondheim if he (or she) were to arrive today, not a half-century ago, when the Broadway theater was more robust. An innovative project like the Met-Lincoln Center Theater alliance might be his last, his best, his only hope.</p>
