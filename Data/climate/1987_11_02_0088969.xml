        <p>LEAD: Five candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination gathered here today to talk about environmental protection. They all were strongly for it.</p>
        <p>Five candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination gathered here today to talk about environmental protection. They all were strongly for it.</p>
        <p>They also charged that the Republicans, at least during the Reagan era, did not care much about the environment.</p>
        <p>The candidates, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, assailed what they said was the absence of leadership on enviromental protection by the Reagan Administration, and pledged to provide that leadership if elected.</p>
        <p>They also said that the fact that no Republican took part in this forum although all Presidential candidates had been invited was a sign of Republicans' indifference to environmental concerns. The Republican candidates cited scheduling conflicts. Agreement Among Democrats</p>
        <p>One Republican Presidential aspirant, Alexander M. Haig Jr., stopped by briefly to talk to reporters before the meeting opened and said a previous commitment kept him from taking part in the discussion. He said he hoped the absence of Republicans did not lead to the conclusion that ''the environment is of concern simply to the Democratic Party.'' He also said the environment should not become a ''partisan issue.''</p>
        <p>Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, who declined the invitation to the environmental forum, attended a campaign dinner nearby.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the sixth Democratic candidate, did not come here because he had a family commitment, according to the event's sponsors, Vote Envirnoment, a coalition of New England environmental groups.</p>
        <p>There was little disagreement among the Democrats about the importance of environmental issues and what to do about them. Among the themes that emerged were a need to limit pollution before it entered the environment, a need to integrate environmental and economic policy and a growing need to deal with environmental issues on an international scale. Questions on Incineration</p>
        <p>The only suggestion of a debate took place when the candidates were asked their views on the growing movement toward using huge incinerators to burn municipal garbage as landfill sites are being used up.</p>
        <p>Governor Dukakis said that as administrator of a state that needed a solution to its garbage problem, he had no choice but to support incineration as an option while alternatives such as recycling and reducing the volume of garbage were being developed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jackson said that because of health risks associated with burning garbage and disposing of the ash, ''leadership'' must be exercised now to develop alternatives.</p>
        <p>Senator Gore called in his opening remarks for new legislation that would ''cut across'' all current laws and jurisdictions dealing with the pollution of the environment by toxic substances. In addition, he said, laws regulating toxic substances should be enforced, which, he contended, was not being done by President Reagan's Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis said that for seven years, the Reagan Administration had done nothing about reducing acid rain, which is blamed for rendering lakes throughout New England sterile. '' I regret to say,'' he added, ''Congress has done nothing either.'' 'New Pan-American Alliance'</p>
        <p>Noting that pollution problems like acid rain do not respect national boundaries, Mr. Dukakis said that as President he would call for a ''summit meeting on the environment.''</p>
        <p>Senator Simon said that the Reagan Administration has no energy policy and said he would create such a policy that stressed conservation measures like solar heating, moving away from dependence on foreign sources of fuel, strong fuel efficiency standards for autos and the use of corn-based ethanol for automotive fuel, preserving natural beauty in the face of demands to dig strip mines and offshore oil wells for energy, and having a Nuclear Regulatory Commission ''that protects the public, not the nuclear industry.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson called for the formation of a ''new pan-American alliance'' that would focus simultaneously on economic, energy and environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt, noting that the nation's underground water supplies were increasingly being polluted by pesticides and other toxic substances, said he would demand new groundwater protection legislation that would permit no discharges of poisons into the water and no degradation of water quality. The ''ultimate issue'' for protecting water supplies and the rest of the environment, he said is reducing the sources of pollution instead of cleaning up after the damage has been done. Harsh Words for '7 Dwarfs'</p>
        <p>All the Democratic candidates here voiced support for a $1 billion-a-year program to protect open spaces that was proposed by President Reagan's National Commission on Americans Outdoors but not endorsed by the Administration.</p>
        <p>David Baker of Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, said the absence of Mr. Gephardt and the six Republican candidates shows that they are ''seven dwarfs'' who do not care about the environment.</p>
        <p>Daniel Weiss of the Sierra Club, another environmental organization, said that this meeting shows that the difference between the Democratic candidates on environmental issues ''can be measured in micrometers while the difference between Democrats and Republicans can be measured in canyons.''</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls have almost uniformly shown that Americans place a very high value on the protection of the environment. So far, however, this concern has not been reflected to any appreciable degree in the way Americans vote in national elections.</p>
