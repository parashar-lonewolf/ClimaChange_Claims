        <p>With the national economy booming, lawmakers have begun to focus on one of the few places in the country where times are bad: the Northern Plains, where wheat and livestock prices have plunged and many farmers are desperate.</p>
        <p>''This is an especially bad year in terms of wheat prices,'' said Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is chairman of the Agriculture Committee and who helped rush through the Senate on Thursday a bill to allow farmers to sell wheat to Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said the situation on the farms in his state, South Dakota, was the direst in 15 years and was becoming worse. ''We've got to take action now,'' he said. ''It must be done this summer.''</p>
        <p>But while Republicans and Democrats have weighed in with proposals to meet what both sides describe as a crisis involving an important election-year constituency, they are addressing the situation from entirely different angles.</p>
        <p>Republicans like Senator Lugar favor a free-market agriculture policy and believe the Government can best help farmers by staying out of their hair and promoting export markets for their products.</p>
        <p>That was the basis of the legislation approved by the Senate on Thursday to exempt food exports from the sanctions the United States imposed on India and Pakistan after those countries conducted nuclear tests in May. The House Republican leadership has promised to follow suit in time for American farmers to bid on Wednesday on a large Pakistani order for wheat.</p>
        <p>Democrats like Senator Daschle believe that it is more important for the Government to restore some Government farm subsidies that were developed in the New Deal and repealed by the Republican Congress in the 1996 farm bill. Democratic lawmakers promised this week to press for more Government assistance for farmers.</p>
        <p>President Clinton plans to meet on the situation early next week with Democratic senators. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in an interview that the Administration would announce its response to the farm problem in the next week or two.</p>
        <p>The matter could come to a head next week, if the Senate takes up the agriculture appropriations bill. The outcome could affect the Congressional elections this fall.</p>
        <p>Few other issues so vividly illustrate the fundamental split between the parties on the proper role of Government in the society.</p>
        <p>Generally, politicians from the same state but different parties vote alike on questions that are of primarily local concern. In New York, for instance, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, walk in tandem on such issues as mass transit and acid rain.</p>
        <p>But in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska and Washington -- states with mounting trouble on the farms and with one Republican and one Democratic senator each -- the senators are walking the party lines and taking opposing positions on farm policy.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, described the division this way: ''They have great confidence in Washington bureaucrats. We have confidence in Iowa farmers to manage their own destiny.''</p>
        <p>But Iowa's Democratic Senator, Tom Harkin, has a completely different view.</p>
        <p>''For Republicans, the 1996 farm bill is like holy scripture, and any change would show they were wrong,'' he said. ''I simply do not believe you can trade your way out of a farm disaster. I think the Government has got to step in.''</p>
        <p>Nationwide, the farm picture is not entirely bleak. Corn farmers in Indiana, Ohio and Illinois are anticipating a good year when their crop comes in this fall. Cotton producers in Arkansas and Mississippi are doing well. Rice growers in the South are prospering.</p>
        <p>But so many farmers lost money in North Dakota last year that net farm income was down 98 percent from 1996, and the situation has deteriorated this year. Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said that in his state, auctioneers had to be called out of retirement to handle all the farmers who were selling out.</p>
        <p>The problem is also severe in South Dakota, western Minnesota and the other states along the Canadian border to the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said her constituents were facing ''the worst crisis ever seen in the Pacific Northwest.''</p>
        <p>The farmers' troubles stem from several unrelated events: farm exports are way down, mainly because of the staggering economies in Asia; wheat production is strong because of warm weather worldwide, driving down prices; many farmers in the Northern Plains have not recovered from last year's floods; a disease called scab has affected much of the wheat in the Middle West.</p>
        <p>''Prices today for wheat and corn and soybeans and barley are at a level equal to what they were when I was born, 50 years ago,'' said Senator Daschle. Farmers, he continued, are expected ''to live on salaries and income that was generated right after World War II, and you can't do that.''</p>
        <p>Democrats hold that the plight of farmers has been worsened by the Republican legislation Congress approved two years ago called the Freedom to Farm Act. The law reduces crop subsidies in increments until they no longer exist, after 2002, and gives farmers freedom to switch crops in response to market demand.  Most Democrats voted against the measure. President Clinton signed it with serious reservations, he said at the time, because he feared the bill would not ''provide an adequate safety net for family farmers.''</p>
        <p>Now, Democrats want to roll back that legislation by raising the ceiling on Government-guaranteed loans to farmers and by introducing a new emergency-relief program that would help farmers affected by floods, drought and other natural disasters.</p>
        <p>Their prospects for success do not appear to be strong. Senator Lugar said he and his fellow Republicans would fight hard to preserve the 1996 law. Farmers, he said, ''should rely on a market approach, not a political fix.''</p>
        <p>In the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich promised last month that he would promote legislation to stimulate farm exports. He said he would press to renew the President's fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements, an authority that Congress failed to re-enact last year. He said he would also seek financing for the International Monetary Fund and continuation of normal trade relations with China, both of which would presumably help farm exports.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are sure to turn this conflict into an election issue in a year when they need a swing of only 11 seats to regain control of the House. In Montana, for instance, Robert Deschamps, the Democrat challenging the state's only Congressman, Rick Hill, a Republican in his first term, is making changes in the 1996 farm law a major part of his platform.</p>
        <p>According to the Congressional Quarterly, Republicans hold nearly two-thirds of the 57 Congressional seats representing districts in which at least 60 percent of the population lives outside metropolitan areas. A clear majority of these districts favored President Clinton in 1996.</p>
        <p>But John Morgan, a Republican political consultant, said he did not think his party needed to worry on this score. ''There aren't that many seats left that turn on farm issues,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Russell Ross, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Iowa and a specialist in rural politics, agreed with Mr. Morgan's assessment that farm issues would not cause many Congressional seats to change hands. ''The cities and the small towns,'' he said, ''that's where the votes are.''</p>
