        <p>'American Icon'</p>
        <p>While most artists evolve, moving from one style or concept to another, Will Barnet's journey through social realism, abstraction and figurative works produced works so different from each other that they could have been done by several artists, all of them displaying consummate skill and a gift for engaging one's undivided attention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnet, 91, has won numerous awards in the United States and abroad and has been a teacher and mentor to generations of students at the Art Students League, Yale, Cornell and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.</p>

        <p>'American Icon'</p>
        <p>While most artists evolve, moving from one style or concept to another, Will Barnet's journey through social realism, abstraction and figurative works produced works so different from each other that they could have been done by several artists, all of them displaying consummate skill and a gift for engaging one's undivided attention.</p>

        <p>Global Warming</p>
        <p>Bill McKibben, a visiting scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College in Vermont, has written numerous books on environmental subjects. He is best known for ''The End of Nature,'' a book about global warming that has been translated into 20 languages and is in a 10th anniversary printing.</p>

        <p>'Pleasures of Collecting'</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum in Greenwich has scheduled several programs in conjunction with its ''Pleasures of Collecting'' exhibition.</p>
        <p>Today from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. a panel discussion by a group of art dealers will shed light on collecting art in the current volatile market. They include Richard L. Feigen of Richard L. Feigen &amp; Company, Philippe Alexandre of Alexandre Gallery and Polly Sartori of Sotheby's 19th-century European paintings department.</p>

        <p>Art and Justice</p>
        <p>The murder trial and execution some 75 years ago of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, avowed anarchists, generated explosive political protests around the world and inspired a flood of art in every discipline. One example was Ben Shahn's series of paintings and prints on the subject, which is on view in an exhibition called ''Justice on Trial: Ben Shahn's Case for Sacco and Vanzetti'' at the Yale Art Gallery through Dec. 29.</p>
        <p>Several related programs were organized in connection with the exhibition, including Thursday at 4 p.m. when a conversation about Sacco and Vanzetti and the Italian-American Community will be led by Patricia Klindienst, a writer and Neil Thomas Proto, lawyer and adjunct professor at Georgetown University's School of Public Policy.</p>
        <p>A guided tour of the exhibition and screening of ''In Search of History: The True Story of Sacco and Vanzetti,'' produced by the History Channel and A &amp; E television will follow the discussion. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>Information: (203) 432-0600.</p>
        <p>Facelift for Warner Theater</p>
        <p>In 1931, the Warner Theater in Torrington was opened as an 1,800-seat Art Deco movie palace by the Warner Brothers Studio, described as ''Connecticut's most beautiful theater.'' The theater was badly damaged when the Naugatuck River overflowed in 1955. The studio repaired and reopened it but federal mandates at the time required that the studios divest themselves of their theaters and it was sold. The nonprofit Northwest Connecticut Association for the Arts raised $132,000 to buy it in 1980 and reopen it as a performing arts center in 1983.</p>
        <p>An extensive face-lift has been in progress since last summer, and on Saturday at 6:30 p.m the ribbon will be cut for yet another reopening with Linda Eder, a Broadway star, as the headliner at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>Information: (860) 489-7180.</p>
        <p>Larson's Farm Lives</p>
        <p>A farm built in 1825 once thrived for generations where New Milford High School now stands on Route 7. The farm inspired Lorraine Ryan to create ''Larson's Farm Trilogy,'' three paintings reproduced in limited edition prints as a record of life in Connecticut as it used to be.</p>
        <p>Components of the trilogy: ''Larson's Farm Market,'' ''Chores Done on Larson's Farm'' and ''The Larson's Farmhouse'' will be part of a three-day show called ''Connecticut Artists at Woodbury's Old Town Hall,'' containing the work of nearly three dozen award-winning artists and craftsmen. Organized by Fine Line Gallery in Woodbury, the show's hours are Friday from noon to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Information: (203) 266-0110.</p>
        <p>Open House for Artists</p>
        <p>Today is the last day of the Stamford Loft Artists Association's open house.</p>
        <p>From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., the public is invited to tour the studios, talk to the painters, sculptors, ceramicists, photographers, printmakers and collagists, among others. The building, which once housed the Yale and Towne Lock company, is at 737 Canal Street, one block south of Exit 8 of I-95. Information: (203) 323-4153.</p>
