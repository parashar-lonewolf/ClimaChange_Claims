        <p>Like Albert Einstein, like Isaac Newton, like Thomas Edison, Mark Noonan had an idea.</p>
        <p>Actually, like them, he had lots of ideas, though most of them never got past his sketchbooks. But one of them might, in its own small way, make history. So before the snow melts away, while we bid winter adieu here on the first full day of spring, let us praise Mr. Noonan. A throwback to the glory days of American ingenuity, a swimmer against the tide, he's the inventor of the Wovel, the iPod of snow shovels.</p>
        <p>The Wovel (rhymes with shovel), looks like one of those high-wheeled 19th-century bicycles incongruously transported to that pile of snow in the driveway. It relies on two simple principles of physics, the wheel and the lever, to revolutionize the humble art of shoveling snow -- at least the part that hasn't been revolutionized out of existence by the plow guy who does it for you.</p>
        <p>For those of us who actually take pride in getting rid of snow ourselves, the Wovel really is something new. It acts as a lever using as its fulcrum the axis of a wheel three feet in diameter. A shovel blade 26 inches wide and 18 inches deep and a handle extend in opposite directions from the wheel's hub.</p>
        <p>Rather than bending down and using your back to lift and throw 30 pounds of snow, you simply push the snow along, as if pushing a baby carriage, and then push the handle down, throwing the snow wherever you like. Think of pushing down on a seesaw with snow on the other end.</p>
        <p>A study at the University of Massachusetts found back strain from the Wovel is roughly akin to walking, reducing the risk of lower-back injury from shoveling snow by 85 percent. This is not insignificant in that the Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that nearly 76,000 people a year are treated for injuries from shoveling and blowing snow, not to mention the deaths from heart attacks. And it's a way to get rid of snow without burning fossil fuel. (It's available at the Web site Wovel.com and online from retailers like Hammacher Schlemmer and Home Depot.)</p>
        <p>''It's the most amazing machine,'' said Richard Lechner, 53, a dentist in New Britain, Conn., who spent much of the winter cursing the blue sky and wishing for snow so he could use his new Wovel. ''The most astonishing thing is that someone didn't come up with this 50 years ago. All it is is a wheel, a handle and a snow shovel, but it makes shoveling snow at least 10 times easier.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Noonan's march to Woveldom began with a bad back. A tinkerer as a kid, he was a physics major in college who then switched to economics in search of something more ''practical.'' But even after going to work on Wall Street, he continued to come up with ideas for tangible products.</p>
        <p>In 2000, while nursing a bad back, pushing his shovel with his knee rather than lifting, he began thinking of the physics of snow shoveling. How could you create leverage, he thought. After contemplating and abandoning a two-wheeled approach, he built a one-wheel prototype out of sheet metal, sheet metal screws and (what else?) duct tape. He took it to the backyard and was stunned how well it worked.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Noonan's notion was just to have something to clear the skating rink he built in his backyard, but soon he began to think of the Wovel as a commercial product. A serious bout of cancer a year later put that off, and partly because of that, he eventually figured, why not act on this one?</p>
        <p>In 2003, he quit his job on Wall Street churning out abstruse financial products and decided to see if he could churn out real ones instead. Will the Wovel change the world? Who knows? It looks weird, it requires people to try something new and it must be assembled.</p>
        <p>For some -- not all -- users it takes a little of practice, like learning to ride a bicycle. At about $120 it's a lot less than a snow blower, but a lot more than the average shovel.</p>
        <p>Still, Time magazine named it one of its best inventions of 2006, it's been praised by Popular Mechanics and was named one of the Top 10 picks at the International Hardware Show in 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noonan has sold about 15,000 so far, a number that surely would have been higher had there been more snow the past two winters. He just needs to hope climate change doesn't put him out of business.</p>
