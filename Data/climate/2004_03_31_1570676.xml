        <p>NOBODY loves natural history museums more than pests. Bones, paper, fur, feathers -- so many of insects' favorite foods.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carla J. Dove, a research scientist in the bird division at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, called pests the biggest threat to the survival of collections, other than budget cuts.</p>
        <p>But curators are increasingly being forced to make do without chemical weapons of mass destruction because of concerns for the safety of scientists and their wards. Museum specialists now know that spraying natural treasures with persistent toxins might damage their DNA, an increasing area of study.</p>
        <p>For centuries, pest management meant painting specimens with arsenic and mercuric chloride. The chemicals kill pests, fungus and mold, and prevent recurrences. But they are not safe for repeated handling and have begun to damage collections.</p>
        <p>At the Smithsonian's botany division, the paper backing of 50,000 specimens from the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838 to 1842, all prepared with mercuric chloride, are turning black as the chemical oxidizes, said Rusty Russell, a collections manager. The mercury gas is also harming other specimens, he said, so the division is putting the expedition samples in containment folders.</p>
        <p>As chemical preparation dissipated, museums turned to fumigation -- until most of the chemicals were labeled carcinogenic by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>''We would fumigate the collections with no respirators and no protection,'' said Dr. Dove, adding that often they would gas on Saturday and be back at work in the same place on Monday. But the chemicals persisted for weeks and the Smithsonian ended widespread spraying.</p>
        <p>The decision may have been for the employees' benefit, but workers were not entirely happy, Dr. Dove said. ''We were all devastated because we thought, 'Oh my god, the bugs are going to come in here and get our collections.' ''</p>
        <p>In the new approach, prevention comes first. ''You think like a pest,'' said Sally Y. Shelton, the Smithsonian's assistant collections manager, which means eliminating food sources, shelter and dark spaces. It's not easy at the Smithsonian, which has 125 million specimens spread over 550,000 square feet at its Mall museum in Washington and a support center in Maryland.</p>
        <p>A rogues' gallery of beetles -- the dermestid, the cigarette, the carpet, the odd and the grease and their accomplices, moths and silverfish, can munch through fur, feathers and even bones. The psocid bug eats glue and paper, a threat to labels that may be a century old and contain irreplaceable data.</p>
        <p>Dermestid beetles are so prolific that they are used to clean carcasses down to bones. The Smithsonian's beetles work off-site in their own building, Ms. Shelton said, to ensure that none escape their day job to moonlight in the collections.</p>
        <p>At the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, the beetles work on the roof, said Dr. Jack Dumbacher, curator and chairman of ornithology and mammalogy. The beetles are killed by putting the clean specimen in a minus-80-degree centigrade freezer.</p>
        <p>Most museums use the same method for debugging, but not all insects are killed with frost and not every specimen can handle the cold or fit into a freezer. ''When we get an elephant skull,'' Dr. Dumbacher said, ''it's just too big to put in the freezer.''</p>
        <p>Museum workers monitor pests by inspecting cases and by putting out cards that trap insects in glue. In the Smithsonian's bird division, that means examining 2,400 cases, Dr. Dove said, a time consuming but necessary task.</p>
        <p>Bar-coded labels are affixed to cabinets with pest activity and read with hand-held digital devices that are used to update information on that location. It all goes into an online database that gives a complete picture of the building's bug activity, Ms. Shelton said.</p>
        <p>The California Academy also uses glue traps, which recently indicated an influx of grease beetles. As the academy moves its 18 million specimens from its Golden Gate Park home, which is being renovated, to a space downtown, it will make rare use of pesticides, Dr. Dumbacher said, packing the crates with chemical strips.</p>
        <p>Museums have adopted a food industry technique called anoxic environments -- airtight rubber decontamination tents that are pumped full of nitrogen, argon or carbon dioxide for 5 to 10 days. Bugs perish in the low-oxygen environment. Jeremy F. Jacobs, a museum specialist in the Smithsonian's mammals division, said the Smithsonian had a tent in a cramped storage room on the sixth floor of its Mall building, and a large tent at its support center that had been used to debug Inuit canoes and big mammals.</p>
        <p>While the shift from chemicals has added labor and technology costs, it is being welcomed as the best thing for the collection, as well as workers. ''The less you do to a specimen, the longer it will last,'' Mr. Jacobs said.</p>
