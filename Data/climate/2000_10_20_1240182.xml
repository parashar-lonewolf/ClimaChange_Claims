        <p>Sometimes, a critic wonders if a movie seen at a festival, where audiences are so eager to be moved by anything, will maintain its magic outside such a forgiving setting. ''Calle 54,'' Fernando Trueba's wonderful documentary tribute to Latin jazz, is even better on a second viewing because the film is such a pure expression of the director's love for the music, a love so infectious it should leave you elated.</p>
        <p>The picture, which opens today at Lincoln Plaza, is bound to draw comparisons to ''The Buena Vista Social Club,'' if only for the subject matter. But this film, set in a variety of locales from New York to Europe, is a completely different take, not the work of archivists falling in love with a crumbling city and musicians with the grace of natural stars waiting to be rediscovered. ''Calle 54'' is closer in spirit to ''The Last Waltz'' in that it mounts a respectful staging of the songs by its performers with an ease and classiness not lavished on jazz since the black-and-white jazz shorts of the 1930's and 40's. That was probably the last time jazz musicians have been treated as well by the medium.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, a critic wonders if a movie seen at a festival, where audiences are so eager to be moved by anything, will maintain its magic outside such a forgiving setting. ''Calle 54,'' Fernando Trueba's wonderful documentary tribute to Latin jazz, is even better on a second viewing because the film is such a pure expression of the director's love for the music, a love so infectious it should leave you elated.</p>
        <p>The picture, which opens today at Lincoln Plaza, is bound to draw comparisons to ''The Buena Vista Social Club,'' if only for the subject matter. But this film, set in a variety of locales from New York to Europe, is a completely different take, not the work of archivists falling in love with a crumbling city and musicians with the grace of natural stars waiting to be rediscovered. ''Calle 54'' is closer in spirit to ''The Last Waltz'' in that it mounts a respectful staging of the songs by its performers with an ease and classiness not lavished on jazz since the black-and-white jazz shorts of the 1930's and 40's. That was probably the last time jazz musicians have been treated as well by the medium.</p>
        <p>From on-the-run black-and-white hand-held camera work during which each musician offers a little bit of his history, ''Calle 54'' goes to extravagant color stage sets in which each performer does a number. If you have any knowledge of jazz, you're likely to squeal with happiness as you recognize the sidemen, who include Hilton Ruiz and Dave Valentin, backing the leaders. (They're all identified over the end credits.) If not, then you may just be swept away by the powerful talents and the unity of spirit. The pianist and composer Michel Camilo is seen preparing charts for some of his warm, fluid orchestral compositions; then he and his combo race through a gorgeous tune that should leave you slack-jawed.</p>
        <p>If the soundtrack is not on sale in the lobby of every theater showing the film, then someone is suffering from fatal shortsightedness. Mr. Camilo will probably see a run on his entire catalog.</p>
        <p>''I wrote this piece to be like a movie,'' says the saxophonist Gato Barbieri before he begins to play. One of the best-known performers in the film and renowned in the United States for the weary machismo of his forlorn wails on the ''Last Tango in Paris'' soundtrack, he still wears his big-brimmed slouch hat and, wrapped in dramatic shawls, resembles a South American widow from an Isabel Allende novel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barbieri mentions the names of filmmakers with whom he felt a kinship -- Jean-Luc Godard, Luchino Visconti and the director of ''Last Tango,'' Bernardo Bertolucci -- men who represent wildly different styles but who embraced danger and passion, as Mr. Barbieri does. He talks about dropping out of recording for an extended period, alluding to his unhappiness with the albums he released on A&amp;M in the late 1970's. But this grand old tiger can still blow a hole in the ozone layer. His magnificence remains unabated.</p>
        <p>So does that of the pianist Bebo Valdes, who plays duets with his son, Chucho. (Bebo is tickled by his son's avoirdupois, and Chucho's large hands span the keyboard like those of another Atlas of the keyboards, the Canadian giant Oscar Peterson, although Chucho plays with a much livelier attack.) Father and son reach into themselves for a performance that's fiery and heart-rending.</p>
        <p>Tito Puente, who died this year, plays against a white background, sadly apropos, as if he were in rehearsals to play one of the lounges in heaven.</p>
        <p>Puente flashes a mouthful of teeth that are the same dazzling white as the set as he grins and pounds his congas. In a brief interview he pays tribute to his inspiration, Dizzy Gillespie, whose work probably influenced many of the musicians seen and heard in ''Calle 54.'' Among them is the New York trumpeter Jerry Gonzalez, seen in sunglasses and leaning in a 47-degree-angle posture that suggest Miles Davis in one of his coolest Young Man With a Horn poses. His Fort Apache band shakes the house.</p>
        <p>The film also introduces Eliane Elias, whose sound is flavored by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Lalo Schifrin, as well as the masterly Paquito D'Rivera and Cachao. At the Toronto Film Festival, the roster of ''Calle 54'' brought the audience to its feet after each number. (The delicacy of the sound recording is a marvel.) No doubt it'll send shivers of joy through crowds here, too.</p>
        <p>CALLE 54  Directed by Fernando Trueba; director of photography, Jose Luis Lopez-Linares; edited by Carmen Frias; produced by Cristina Huete and Fabienne Servan Schreiber; released by Miramax Films. At the Lincoln Plaza, Broadway at 62d Street. Running time: 105 minutes. This film is rated G.</p>
        <p>WITH: Paquito D'Rivera, Eliane Elias, Chano Dominguez, Jerry Gonzalez and the Fort Apache Band, Michel Camilo, Gato Barbieri, Tito Puente, Hilton Ruiz, Bebo Valdes, Chucho Valdes, Dave Valentin and Chico O'Farrill.</p>
