        <p>8 P.M. (Showtime) AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH (2006). This newly anointed Academy Award winner for best documentary, directed by Davis Guggenheim, follows former Vice President Al Gore (above) as he lectures on the dangers of global warming and calls for immediate action to curb what he calls a dire situation -- one that can no longer be seen merely as a political issue. Says Mr. Gore, ''It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly, quickly and wisely.''</p>
        <p>4 P.M. (Fox) NEXTEL CUP: UAWDAIMLER CHRYSLER 400 -- Jimmie Johnson tries to hold onto his title for the third year running in this Nascar race at the 1.5-mile Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where the banking in the turns was recently increased from 12 to 20 degrees. At 8 p.m. on Speed, ''Nascar Victory Lane'' gives a race recap.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) EXTREME MAKEOVER: HOME EDITION -- The tears just keep flowing: Ty Pennington and his team build a new home for Faith Tipton-Smith, a single mother of two daughters who lost her Georgia home to a fire and her son to an automobile accident in a three-month period in 2005. Mr. Pennington even arranges for Ms. Tipton-Smith to meet the 19-year-old girl who received her son's donated heart.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Lifetime) BLOOD TIES -- Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox), an ex-cop turned private investigator, may be fearless, but discovering that your sexy new partner is a 450-year-old vampire could turn anyone's blood cold, at least momentarily. In this new romantic-thriller series, Vicki finds that life has changed after she witnesses a bizarre murder and is plunged into a supernatural world. Kyle Schmid (above) plays Henry, her fine fanged friend. The series is adapted from the ''Blood Books'' novels by Tanya Huff.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) GORDON RAMSAY'S F WORD -- The tyrannical chef is joined in his kitchen by four amateur cooks, Oxford students all, who think they have what it takes to survive the heat. Think again.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Discovery) KOPPEL: OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN'S WAR -- Some refer to it as the War on Terror. General John P. Abizaid, the outgoing commander of the United States Central Command, calls it the Long War -- a battle against terrorism that could last for generations as Al Qaeda looks as far as 100 years into the future and forces our country's military to do the same. In this documentary, Ted Koppel (above left, with cadets at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.) travels to Afghanistan, Djibouti, Ethiopia and North Carolina to explore the challenges presented by this prolonged struggle and what the American military is doing to adapt.</p>
