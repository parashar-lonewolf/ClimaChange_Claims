        <p>The energy bill that the Senate plans to take up next week would require Federal expenditures of more than $9 billion from 1992 through 1996, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But the office said there would be offsetting receipts of $1.6 billion for the sale of oil leases in Alaska and possible royalty revenue of $83 million if oil is found there.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office analysis is in a July report to Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and the co-sponsor of the bill with Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming. The report was distributed Wednesday in Washington by opponents of the bill.</p>

        <p>The energy bill that the Senate plans to take up next week would require Federal expenditures of more than $9 billion from 1992 through 1996, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

        <p>The Congressional Budget Office analysis is in a July report to Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and the co-sponsor of the bill with Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming. The report was distributed Wednesday in Washington by opponents of the bill.</p>
        <p>The bill would open the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in northeastern Alaska, to oil drilling, a goal long pursued by the oil industry. Mr. Johnston argued in hearings this spring that the royalties from oil produced there could be used to finance the development of alternative energy sources.</p>
        <p>In fact, according to the budget analysis, the bill would provide $217 million over five years to promote the development and use of renewable energy.</p>
