        <p>IN great secrecy, the Pentagon is studying whether to build a new generation of missiles powered by nuclear engines that would hurl offensive warheads toward distant targets far more efficiently than existing chemical-fueled rockets.</p>
        <p>A Defense Department official said the study was a responsible way to explore how to modernize the nation's land-based missiles, many of which will be retired early next century. Moreover, some private experts said the merit of investigating new kinds of armaments had been driven home by the sudden ouster of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his replacement by Communist hard-liners.</p>
        <p>But the study has also alarmed critics, who contend that nuclear rockets would be dangerous to human health and the environment during testing and that the Pentagon is trying to undermine the fragile successes of East-West cooperation.</p>
        <p>Nuclear rockets could have a significant impact on arms control by expanding the options available to military planners and possibly by making missiles more threatening.</p>
        <p>The study, by the Offensive and Space Systems directorate of the Pentagon's office of Defense Research and Engineering, asserts that nuclear missiles could be cost-effective and safe and that they could be designed to pose no threat to the environment. It contained no estimate of their cost.</p>
        <p>The nuclear-missile study was disclosed by the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington that opposes the use of orbiting reactors. The existence of the effort was confirmed by internal Government documents, including the study itself.</p>
        <p>The repercussions of nuclear rockets for East-West stability would depend on their specific design. Highly efficient nuclear engines could power small missiles meant to better survive an enemy attack, lowering the temptation to "use 'em or lose 'em." But they also could power large rockets that loft many more warheads than missiles usually do today, and this is one reason some groups oppose them.</p>
        <p>"It's bizarre and contrary to good sense," said Steven Aftergood, a senior analyst with the science group. "We're trying to place limits on the number of warheads and our capacity to threaten each other with mutual annihilation. This is basically talking about threat enhancement."</p>
        <p>Other experts, told of the study, disagreed, saying it was a valuable exercise.</p>
        <p>"Peace isn't breaking out," said Dr. Hans Mark, chancellor of the University of Texas and former Secretary of the Air Force. "We just fought a war. If anything, the ability to retaliate quickly and accurately anywhere in the world is more important now than in the past as weapons of mass destruction proliferate."</p>
        <p>The ouster of Mr. Gorbachev, he added, "reinforces the fact that you can't let down your guard."</p>
        <p>Possible improvements in the nation's arsenal, Dr. Mark said, "have to be looked at by our best people and then an intelligent assessment made of the threat" and the usefulness of new types of offensive arms.</p>
        <p>The missiles under study would have compact nuclear reactors that heat ammonia to very high temperatures and blast it out engine nozzles with a roar. In theory, nuclear engines can be two to 10 times asefficient as chemical ones. The extra push would allow military missiles to carry heavier payloads or to be smaller while lofting payloads similar in size to current ones. It could also add speed. For an enemy scanning the skies with radars and satellites, fast missiles would mean less advance warning and greater difficulty in trying to shoot them down.</p>
        <p>A nuclear engine, if successfully built, would be fundamentally different from reactors on earth or in space that generate electricity. In these, intense heat from the fission of heavy atoms is generally used to expand a fluid that drives a turbine for electrical generation. The system is closed. The heated fluid is cooled and reused over and over.</p>
        <p>In contrast, a nuclear engine would heat and eject its working fluid, which would become exhaust. One safety objection to nuclear engines stems from the fact that reactor leaks could contaminate a rocket's exhaust.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon study, completed in July and now being quietly circulated among Federal agencies and contractors for comment, is based on the assumption that a large part of the nation's land-based arsenal, made up of Minuteman and MX missiles, will be retired early in the next century. An undisclosed number of these 1,000 missiles are to be taken out of service under the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, signed late last month in Moscow by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. Its fate, however, has been thrown into doubt by the Soviet coup.</p>
        <p>Rather than envisioning a large nuclear missile, the Pentagon study explores four possible small ones, known generically as Light Strategic Missiles or LSM's. The largest LSM would be 47 feet tall, or 13 feet shorter than the Minuteman 3, now the nation's main land-based missile. The study says the LSM's could be mobile or based in Minuteman silos, where extra room could be used for equipment to isolate them from shock caused by the explosion of nearby enemy warheads.</p>
        <p>Their small relative size, the study said, "provides cost and handling advantages." For instance, the expense and difficulty of fielding a mobile missile "are directly related to the physical size of the system," the study said.</p>
        <p>The nuclear engine of the LSM would be fairly efficient, though less than possible. The standard yardstick of rocket performance is known as specific impulse, which measures how much thrust a given amount of propellant will produce. The higher the specific impulse, the more dazzling the engine. Some nuclear engines are envisioned as having a specific impulse of 900 seconds. That of the LSM would be 475 seconds. The chemical motors of solid-fuel rockets have a specific impulse of around 280 seconds.  Engine Would Be Destroyed</p>
        <p>The LSM's would use a conventional chemical rocket to start the flight, with the nuclear engine kicking in once the missile was relatively high in the atmosphere. After boosting a warhead into space, the nuclear engine would be destroyed, the Pentagon study said, "by simply withdrawing the reactor control elements completely while shutting off propellant flow." The reactor would then explode.</p>
        <p>The radioactive byproducts of this fission reaction, which present the greatest health risk, "should not reach the ground," the study asserted. The radioactive debris, it said, will not persist in the earth's atmosphere "for very long" because of their short half-lives.</p>
        <p>The study said an engine failure that would result in a "significant release" of fission products was "very unlikely." It added that a testing program, including experimental flights, could meet all Federal safety and environmental requirements.</p>
        <p>In an unusual twist, the study asserted that nuclear rockets would cause less environmental damage than standard solid-fueled military rockets, whose exhausts have been implicated in the destruction of the earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists said the whole exercise was a dangerous pipe dream. During flight tests, used reactors would disintegrate in the atmosphere and spread dangerous radiation, he said. "You do not release radioactivity into the environment if you can avoid it," Mr. Aftergood said.</p>
        <p>Many Federal agencies, such as the Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, have shied away from the idea of lofting operating reactors into the atmosphere because of safety risks and the likelihood of public protest, Mr. Aftergood said.</p>
        <p>"The idea of hundreds of reactor-powered missiles deployed throughout the country is wildly unrealistic," he added.</p>
        <p>The science group is to describe the Pentagon study this week in Secrecy &amp; Government Bulletin, a newsletter it publishes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mark of the University of Texas argued that responsible Federal officials had an obligation to explore all possible technologies that could play a role in national defense. He noted that in June NASA was encouraged to press ahead with a technical evaluation of nuclear engines by a 27-member panel of experts headed by a former astronaut, Thomas Stafford. The technology of nuclear engines is clearly becoming more attractive, he said, and will have to be evaluated for possible use by the American military.</p>
        <p>"Military strength is important," Dr. Mark said. "We have to have it if we're going to be a major influence in the world."  Taking a Different Tack</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Federation of American Scientists disclosed that the Pentagon is developing a nuclear-powered rocket for hauling giant weapons and other military payloads into space as part of the "Star Wars" anti-missile program.</p>
