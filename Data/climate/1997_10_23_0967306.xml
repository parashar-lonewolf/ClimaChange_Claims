        <p>President Clinton today outlined a moderate program to fight global warming, saying that it would be painless and even economically beneficial but that it must be carried out quickly to be effective.</p>
        <p>The plan would rely on tax credits and research subsidies to encourage the conservation of energy in the next few years. It would also give American companies extra credit for moving more quickly than required to cut their emissions of atmospheric pollutants that trap the sun's heat and threaten to alter the planet's climate. But it would not reduce emissions to the 1990 benchmark until some time between 2008 and 2012. Further, unspecified reductions would follow.</p>
        <p>''We have a clear responsibility and a golden opportunity to conquer one of the most important challenges of the 21st century, the challenge of climate change, with an environmentally sound and economically strong strategy,'' Mr. Clinton said in a speech at the National Geographic Society here. ''If we do not change our course now, the consequences, sooner or later, will be destructive for America and for the world.''</p>
        <p>But the plan was quickly denounced by many of the other nations that are trying to negotiate a new climate treaty. At a negotiating session in Bonn, they said that as the largest single emitter of heat-trapping, or greenhouse, gases, the United States should be doing more and doing it sooner. [Page A20].</p>
        <p>In the negotiations, parties to the 1992 treaty on climate change that was signed by 160 nations in Rio de Janeiro are seeking to strengthen its terms. The treaty called on industrial nations to cut their emissions to 1990's levels by the year 2000. Most industrial nations, including the United States, are falling short of that target, and Mr. Clinton's plan defers it for many years.</p>
        <p>Under the Clinton Administration's plan for meeting the new targets of a binding treaty, the United States Government would wait until 2008 before fully establishing fixed caps on industrial sources of greenhouse gases, mainly the carbon dioxide that comes from burning fossil fuels. And only then, consequently, would energy prices have to increase to reflect the costs of mandatory emission reductions.</p>
        <p>The Administration, in effect, is laying a heavy bet that innovation and the free market, driven by a few billion dollars of tax incentives and subsidies, will drive down fuel use in the next few years without causing any serious economic disruption. This approach would therefore demonstrate the feasibility of deeper reductions that would come later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who since his first campaign for the Presidency has pledged aggressive action to fight global warming and who criticized President George Bush for not supporting the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, found himself the target of the same kind of criticism today, but from other countries.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that the United States proposal is even less'' than what was originally in the treaty, said Dr. Mark Mwandosya of Tanzania, the chairman of the developing-countries' caucus in the talks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton described his strategy as ''realistic and effective.''</p>
        <p>''This plan is sensible and sound,'' he said, acknowledging the criticisms that erupted even before he began to speak. ''Since it's a long-term problem requiring a long-term solution, it will be phased in over time. But we want to get moving now.''</p>
        <p>The President emphasized his optimism about technology as he stood framed by the National Geographic Society's logo, as an explorer might be pictured on the cover of the National Geographic magazine, and not a President defending a position attacked by environmental groups.</p>
        <p>His plan, he promised, would ''create a wealth of new opportunities for entrepreneurs at home, uphold our leadership abroad, and harness the power of free markets to free our planet from an unacceptable risk.''</p>
        <p>He said that even before a new treaty was negotiated and ratified, the United States would take new steps to put itself on an energy diet with a prescription that in the next few years would emphasize incentives, subsidies, Federal procurement policies and rewards for those who move the fastest to adopt promising new technologies.</p>
        <p>The proposal is less ambitious than the approaches sought by Japan, Europe or many developing countries to control the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They all want the industrial nations to agree to deeper and earlier cuts in a new treaty that is supposed to be concluded in Kyoto, Japan, in December.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also declared that the United States would not accept binding commitments negotiated in Kyoto unless important developing countries also agreed to join the worldwide effort to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Most environmental organizations denounced the Clinton plan as too weak, although some praised the President's call for early actions. Most big industry groups rejected the plan as too costly, although some said they liked the incentives it promoted.</p>
        <p>''The United States is the only country dragging its feet,'' said Phil Clapp, the executive director of the Environmental Information Center, an advocacy group. ''Unless he is willing to take a stronger position in Kyoto, the Clinton-Gore Administration will be responsible for the collapse of the talks.''</p>
        <p>But Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, said: ''For the first time there is a good chance for a constructive outcome at Kyoto. One of the major defects in the plan is that it is not aggressive enough in the longer term. But the early reductions are extremely important, because they could get U.S. emissions under control. Emissions are basically exploding at this point.''</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said his business federation would oppose the proposed emission-trading scheme that is at the heart of the Administration's plan.</p>
        <p>''Capping emissions amounts to energy rationing, which drives up consumer costs as effectively as higher energy taxes,'' Mr. Donohue said.</p>
        <p>But Michael Marvin, the executive director of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, said, ''It is what we have advocated from the beginning: clear, modest steps to get us back to 1990.''</p>
        <p>''Mr. Marvin, whose group represents companies including appliance manufacturers and purveyors of clean fuels, renewable energy, and conservation technologies, added: ''It is an important step. In an ideal world, we would have argued for an earlier timetable earlier. But this puts the U.S. in the ball park and is a defensible, negotiable position.''</p>
        <p>Like the targets and timetables that Mr. Clinton proposed, the package of incentives is relatively modest. The $5 billion in tax cuts and research subsidies over five years would amount to a bit more than a penny per hundred dollars of economic activity -- $1 billion annually in a $7 trillion economy. Looked at another way, it would be enough to give every citizen an annual rebate covering one-fourth of the cost of a high-efficiency light bulb.</p>
        <p>Any treaty would require approval from two-thirds of the Senate, and some elements of Mr. Clinton's plan would have to be written into law by Congress, where there is considerable resistance to his approach.</p>
