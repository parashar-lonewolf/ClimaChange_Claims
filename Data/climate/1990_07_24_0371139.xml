        <p>LEAD: Americans lecture Brazil on the shameless destruction of its tropical forests. They would sound less sanctimonious if the United States took better care of its own tropical forests, in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>Americans lecture Brazil on the shameless destruction of its tropical forests. They would sound less sanctimonious if the United States took better care of its own tropical forests, in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>Less than a quarter of Hawaii's original forests remain. At lower levels, almost all its native plant communities have been destroyed by land-clearing. The loss of habitat has driven 40 percent of Hawaii's native bird species into extinction and threatens three-quarters of those that remain.</p>
        <p>Predation by introduced species is another source of destruction. Imported vines and grasses suffocate the plants that evolved without competition. Rats prey on birds' nests. Mongooses were introduced in 1883 to control the rats, but instead have joined them in eating the birds' eggs. The extinction of bird species on Hawaii is a particular loss; they are a textbook example of evolution. The island's 47 species of honeycreeper all evolved from a single ancestor.</p>
        <p>Hawaii has eight national wildlife refuges and four national parks. These include much of the habitat needed to conserve its plants and animals. But neither the Fish and Wildlife Service nor the National Park Service has the necessary resources to do so. Their combined budget of $2 million needs to be $12 million, the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates in a new report. Puerto Rico is also a story of lost opportunity. Most of the tropical forest seen by Columbus in 1493 has been cleared for farming and housing. But a large national forest and 14 forests managed by Puerto Rico still preserve 3,000 plant species and 232 species of birds. These forests constitute only 4 percent of the island's area but are gradually expanding as agriculture diminishes.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government has only a trivial budget for preserving the many threatened species, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has neglected the chance to buy up critical habitat, despite a $2 million fund created for the purpose.</p>
        <p>The world's ancient patrimony of tropical forests is now eroding at the rate of 40 to 50 million acres a year, according to an inventory recently published by the World Resources Institute. This is nearly 50 percent faster than earlier estimates.</p>
        <p>Loss of the forests, a biological tragedy in itself, also spurs the danger of global warming as the burned trees shed their carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Because of the torching of its forests, Brazil is the world's third-largest creator of greenhouse gases, after the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>To preach respect for nature to Brazil, Americans need to practice it more assiduously in their own forests.</p>
