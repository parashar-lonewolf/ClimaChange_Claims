        <p>President Bush got more than he asked for. Environmentalists got less than they hoped for. George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, got as much as he bargained for. Nobody in Washington is entirely happy with the compromise clean air bill worked out last week in the Senate. But it may well mark the end of a decade of legislative paralysis, and in that case there's one sure winner: the breathing public.</p>
        <p>The battle is far from over. There will be strengthening amendments offered on the Senate floor, and Mr. Mitchell will be hard put to hold his coalition together. A companion measure in the House is stalled in committee. Even so, overhaul of the antiquated Clean Air Act of 1970 seems well within reach. Common sense can take it the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>Last August, in the first big down payment on his pledge to be America's ''environment President,'' Mr. Bush proposed to tackle three big problems. One is ozone, the main component of the urban smog that afflicts millions. The second is acid rain, a killer of streams, lakes and forests that's produced mainly by coal-burning utilities. The third is an array of airborne toxic chemicals.</p>
        <p>The Senate proposal on acid rain is virtually identical to Mr. Bush's. It would cut harmful sulfur dioxide emissions 10 million tons by the year 2000 and cap emissions thereafter. That's a victory for Mr. Bush, who beat back pro-industry forces inside his Administration. And it's a huge victory for Mr. Mitchell, who worked out a timetable that pacified producers of high-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>The toxic gases proposal, stronger than Mr. Bush's, is also unlikely to cause serious controversy on the Senate floor. The real legislative battle will involve urban pollution.</p>
        <p>Half the ingredients that contribute to smog come from stationary sources, ranging from backyard barbecues to petrochemical plants. The rest are caused by the hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides that spew out of America's 100 million tailpipes. Since it's cheaper to attack smog by controlling emissions from cars and trucks, environmentalists have urged the strictest possible emission standards on auto makers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's original proposals on tailpipe emissions were tougher than the 1970 law, and the Senate bill makes them tougher still. Yet clean air advocates in high-pollution states, like Thomas Jorling, New York's Commissioner of Environmental Preservation, argue that emissions could be cut further and faster without serious hardship on the automobile companies or consumers.</p>
        <p>These advocates have similar complaints about the Senate compromise on alternative fuels like methanol and compressed natural gas. Mr. Bush originally asked the auto makers to produce a million non-gasoline cars annually by 1997. In the Senate negotiations, however, the whole idea of alternative fuels disappeared. His pride at stake, Mr. Bush forced an alternative fuels provision back into the bill. But it's vague, and there is little assurance that it will compel industry to develop non-gasoline substitutes.</p>
        <p>Other elements of the compromise deserve equally skeptical attention. For example, it would no longer require the Federal Government to step in when states and cities fail to meet pollution targets. That could weaken state and local leverage over major polluters.</p>
        <p>The Administration argues that any effort by environmentalists to strengthen Mr. Mitchell's careful compromise will destroy the bill. That argument insults the legislative process. But those who would strengthen the bill need to move carefully, mindful that they can't win every point on an issue that has been so divisive for so long. There can, in short, be progress without perfection. The Senate compromise is a good place to begin.</p>
