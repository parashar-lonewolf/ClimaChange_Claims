        <p>LEAD: National environmental groups, despondent when Ronald Reagan was elected President eight years ago because of his proclaimed hostility to environmental regulations, are expressing optimism about their prospects in a Bush administration.</p>
        <p>National environmental groups, despondent when Ronald Reagan was elected President eight years ago because of his proclaimed hostility to environmental regulations, are expressing optimism about their prospects in a Bush administration.</p>
        <p>Although for the most part they backed Vice President Bush's Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, and held Mr. Bush accountable for what they viewed as the Reagan Administration's dismal record on pollution and conservation issues, environmental groups have been saying since the election last week that they expect strong support for their issues from a Bush administration and the 101st Congress.</p>
        <p>In statements since the election, the groups contend that Mr. Bush's promises to improve the environment, the composition of the new Congress and the interest in environmental issues demonstrated in the campaign by candidates and voters bode well for their causes in the next few years.</p>
        <p>Their positive statements about Mr. Bush were not based on a belief that he had suddenly become an ardent advocate of environmental regulation. The statements were intended to remind the public of Mr. Bush's environmental promises in the campaign and to serve notice that they intend to hold him to those promises. Theodore Roosevelt Comparison</p>
        <p>''Judging by his campaign rhetoric, George Bush should show himself to be the best environmental President since Teddy Roosevelt,'' said Rick Hind, a lobbyist for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a Washington-based policy and advocacy organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hind emphasized that he was comparing the two men based on Mr. Bush's campaign promises, not on his performance as Vice President. In the Reagan Administration, he said, Mr. Bush had either been silent on issues like the President's veto of amendments to the Clean Water Act or had played an active role in seeking to relax such regulatory programs like the one that would remove lead from gasoline.</p>
        <p>The Vice President and his aides have said he helped strengthen, not relax, the lead rule.</p>
        <p>Unlike, Mr. Reagan, who came to the Presidency promising to ease regulatory burdens on industry and remove obstacles to the development of resources on public lands, Mr. Bush said in this year's campaign that he was an environmentalist. Campaign Promises Cited</p>
        <p>He also made a number of promises to take specific environmental actions. They include dealing with global warming caused by industrial gases on a priority basis, cutting ''millions of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions'' to reduce acid rain and setting a national goal of ''no net loss of wetlands.''</p>
        <p>David Baker, political director of Friends of the Earth, a conservation group, said his organization had ''made a list of George Bush's campaign promises on the environment'' and was ''committed to working with the President and Congress, and working on the President and Congress, to make sure those promises are kept.''</p>
        <p>C. Boyden Gray, the Vice President's counselor, said that Mr. Bush intended ''to take seriously'' the enviromental promises he made in the campaign.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview Mr. Gray said that, contrary to those who say a Bush administration has no electoral mandate, ''we do have a mandate to do a number of things, including to protect the environment.''</p>
        <p>While he said it was too early to be specific, Mr. Gray contended that Mr. Bush would seek to use ''market incentives,'' such as fees and pollution trading rights, to achieve a cleaner and healthier environment. 'A Republican Priority'</p>
        <p>At a luncheon of the National Press Club today Governor Kean of New Jersey, a Republican, said Mr. Bush ''will make the environment a Republican priority - a national priority.''</p>
        <p>But another Republican, Henry L. Diamond, a former Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said he believed that ''there will be a fight for Bush's environmental soul.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diamond, a partner in the law firm of Beveridge &amp; Diamond, said last week that the President-elect ''owes debts to the conservatives who dislike many of the environmental programs.'' He also said the budget deficit would limit Mr. Bush's ability to spend money on the environment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Diamond said Mr. Bush has ''a basic orientation to the outdoors,'' and added: ''He will be under scrutiny from a Democratic Congress to continue environmental programs and will be under pressure from other nations to cooperate internationally. Most importantly, a renewed, environmentally aware public will be vigilent.'' A 'Veto-Proof' Senate</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists are convinced that the new Congress will be even more active on environmental issues than the 100th Congress because of the election of such new members as Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat who won the Senate race in Connecticut, and Frank Pallone, a Democrat who won a House seat in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Jim Maddy, executive director of the League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of the environmental movement, said the new Senate would be ''veto-proof'' on environmental issues and that the House had slightly improved from an environmental perspective.</p>
        <p>Richard Cellarius, president of the Sierra Club, said the campaign and public opinion polls showed that environmental protection ''is one of the few clear mandates that the new President and the new Congress enjoy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker of Friends of the Earth said, ''The public will know very quickly whether George Bush is serious about protecting the environment.''</p>
