        <p>Maple Galls</p>
      </block>

        <p>Maple Galls</p>
        <p>Q. Every year, my sugar maples have horrible growths on top of their leaves. They start out green but end up red, and look like little icicles sticking straight up. Some years there are only a few, but in other years there are a lot of them. I am very curious about what these are and whether or not they are  a threat to the trees.</p>
        <p>A. These growths are not a disease or harmful. They are maple spindle galls, the equivalent of a condo with a restaurant on the ground floor. Several species of  microscopic four-legged creatures called eriophyid mites feed on the leaf tissue. At the same time they inject into the leaf a growth-regulating substance. This chemical causes the leaf to grow the galls, making a home for the mite. Spindle galls may be as much as a half-inch long, very thin, like misshapen pencil leads. They stand straight and turn from green to red to black  over the season.</p>
        <p>Other shapes of galls, such as beadlike swellings or flat, felty patches, are caused by other species of gall mites on other kinds of maples, like silver, red or Norway.</p>
        <p>Mites that entomologists call special females begin the process. After the mite spends the winter under bark scales on the trunk or branch, it settles down on a nearby leaf and begins to feed. Once the gall is complete, the mite stays inside and may produce several generations over the summer.</p>
        <p>By late summer, with the young mites refusing to move out and the summer's mess piling up, a new generation of special females leaves through an opening on the lower surface and looks for some peace and quiet under a bark scale. Once the rest of the mites discover that there's no one to cook and clean, they desert the galls and die. The galls become dark brown or black, looking like a summer rental on Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Window Boxes</p>
        <p>Q. I am a window-box gardener. Last summer I attempted to grow pansies, but they grew too tall and fell over. How might I successfully grow pansies in a window box?</p>
        <p>A. When summer hits, some plants thrive, and others dive. It is a good rule of thumb that annuals that grow well in cooler weather and look great in spring react to heat by growing lanky, reducing flower size and numbers, and looking bedraggled.</p>
        <p>A few other annuals won't look good in high summer either, like Martha Washington geranium, felicia, nemesia, osteospermum, stock and sweet william.</p>
        <p>Try redecorating when the early bloomers have had it. Substitute plants like  the great new heat- and humidity-loving petunias (especially for those who think they hate petunias). These summer-lovers for window boxes in full sun are called Supertunias or Surfinias and the smaller-flowered millifloras. Don't forget Homestead Purple verbena.</p>
        <p>The many striking cultivars of coleus are a good choice for partly shaded boxes. Don't keep thinking of the same old stuff -- many small house plants can  be used in interesting foliage combinations. Remember not to mix plants with different light and moisture requirements.</p>
        <p>Plants in the Sick Room</p>
        <p>Q. Since plants use oxygen, isn't it a good idea to keep them out of a sick person's hospital room? This is a source of constant debate in our house, and I  hope you can settle it.</p>
        <p>A. If awards were given for longevity, this myth would be right up there. Since  the 18th century, when it was discovered that plants use and produce both carbon dioxide and oxygen, two favorite conclusions that people have jumped to are that plants can dangerously deplete a room's supply of oxygen at night and that they should not be kept in the bedroom. As in many myths, the small nuggets of truth are exaggerated while the larger body of facts is ignored.</p>
        <p>Yes, plants do use oxygen at night in a series of complicated chemical reactions that are part of making and using food. But remember that plants give  off 10 times as much oxygen during the day as they use at night. Over a very long time, green plants have been responsible for changing the composition of our atmosphere, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide and increasing the amount  of oxygen.</p>
        <p>But strong myths sometimes need a scientific stake driven through their hearts. In an hour, a pound of plant leaves (think of a big head of lettuce) uses about 0.1 liter of oxygen. By comparison, a 150-pound person resting quietly uses more than 71 liters of oxygen each hour. Thanks to Dr. Andre Jagendorf, professor of plant biology at Cornell University, who provided the respiration figures for the plants, and the reference department of the New York Public Library, which provided the figures for humans, maybe we can all sleep a  little easier.</p>
