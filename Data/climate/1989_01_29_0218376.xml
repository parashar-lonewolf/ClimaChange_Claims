        <p>It will not cost ''millions'' of dollars to clean up Long Island Sound, as Elex Ingersoll says in an appeal for public support for the task  [ Opinion, ''Resolutions: For 1989, Clean Up Long Island Sound,'' Jan. 15 ] .  According to Congressman George J. Hochbrueckner, the total cost, including upgrading old sewage plants and building new ones on both sides of the Sound, will be 10 to 15 billion dollars. The cost will keep rising with inflation and the worsening condition of the Sound, which is why marine biology scientists told Congress early in 1988 that the work needs to start as soon as possible. If it doesn't, the cost could become prohibitive and the Sound as well as all the other rich fish and shellfish waters along the coast will die in 20 years.</p>
        <p>Congress swept this crisis and many others under the carpet because of a deal made with President Reagan in late 1987 not to leave a major confrontation on national priorities in the Federal budget in the election year. It was a shameful deal.</p>
        <p>The only way to clean up our coastal waters and the Hudson, which is loaded with PCB's; reduce acid rain and begin to control the greenhouse effect (which is raising sea level and slowly submerging our beaches), is to reduce military spending or raise taxes. The states cannot do the job.  FREDERICK S. LIGHTFOOT</p>
