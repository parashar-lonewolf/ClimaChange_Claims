        <p>OVER the past four years, with the help of attractive incentives from New York State and the Long Island Power Authority, several hundred families on Long Island have been turning to the sun to help power their homes.</p>
        <p>Using solar electric panels on their rooftops, these homeowners are adding systems that are connected to the electric company's grids and that enable them to decrease their electric bills.</p>
        <p>''We get good sun from sunrise to about 2:30 p.m., and seeing that meter run backward is a wonderful thing,'' said Charles Barrett, a Nesconset resident who installed a solar electric system on his two-bedroom ranch house this year and has since cut his monthly electric bill nearly in half. The Barretts paid $15,000 for the system after receiving a LIPA rebate of $27,900.</p>
        <p>Since 2000, when LIPA first offered rebates of $6,000 per kilowatt for solar electric systems with capacities of up to 10 kilowatts, 450 Long Island homeowners have installed systems and there are 79 more applications pending, said Gordian Raacke, executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, a Bridgehampton-based nonprofit organization promoting clean and sustainable energy use. Currently, the rebate is $4,500 a kilowatt, and the size of the rebate is scheduled to decline as more people join the program, he said.</p>
        <p>Some homeowners are also eligible for a New York State income tax credit of 25 percent of the cost of the system after the LIPA rebate.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Raacke, solar electric technology has been around for many years but until recently has been too expensive for the conventional household.</p>
        <p>''In the 1970's the buzzword was 'going off the grid' when people began putting in solar panels that fed electricity into storage batteries for nighttime use,'' Mr. Raacke said. ''The major breakthrough came in the mid-1990's when states began adopting net metering laws that allowed homeowners and businesses to connect to the electric company grids,'' he said. This brings the price of the system down by eliminating the need for the expensive battery storage systems, he explained.</p>
        <p>In a solar electric system -- also called a photovoltaic system -- solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity, which is adapted for home use through a special inverter. A LIPA electric meter typically spins forward; but when the solar electric system generates more power than the home is consuming, the meter spins backward and the excess energy is fed back to LIPA. Whenever the power in the system is not sufficient -- at night or during a rainstorm, for instance -- LIPA power automatically kicks in, Mr. Raacke said.</p>
        <p>A solar system employs 2-by-5-foot silicon panels, which are usually installed on a shade-free area of the sunniest part of a roof and typically require a total of 200 to 1,000 square feet of space. A system with a capacity of three kilowatts would have 24 panels covering 240 square feet. It would cost about $25,000 to install, with a net cost of less than $10,000 for the homeowner after LIPA and state rebates.</p>
        <p>The monthly electric bill is for net consumption -- the amount of electricity consumed less the amount of electricity produced.</p>
        <p>If a family produces more electricity than it uses, LIPA tallies the excess in a customer's energy credit bank at the end of the year. The company pays about four cents a kilowatt hour and issues a check for the total, Mr. Raacke said.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what the 12-year-old sons of Sari Smith have been counting on since a 40-panel 6.6 kilowatt system was installed this year on the roof of their two-story home in East Islip on the South Shore. Solar energy now runs all the electricity in the house, including the central air-conditioning and the aboveground pool's water current.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Smith, who spent $14,800 on the system after a $29,700 LIPA rebate, much of the responsibility to save money falls on her twins, Trevor and Ethan.</p>
        <p>''We have to make sure there is no extra electricity on to waste,'' Trevor said.</p>
        <p>Ethan added, ''Then at the end of the year, we get to split whatever money we get back from the electric company.''</p>
        <p>Since April, when the system was installed, Ms. Smith -- who works away from home during the day -- has not had to pay an electric bill, which previously amounted to $150 to $180 a month.</p>
        <p>Farther north in Nesconset, three trees were removed around the south side of Mr. Barrett's home to provide adequate sunlight on the roof for the 40 panels of their five-kilowatt system.</p>
        <p>The panels were installed five months ago because the Barretts wanted to control their electric bills, which averaged $255 a month. The new system has cut the bill by about $150 a month, said Mr. Barrett, a graphic artist who has worked from home for the past 10 years, since founding Netstuff.com, an Internet retail business.</p>
        <p>Marc Redgate, the owner of National Photovoltaics Inc. in Holbrook, who set up the Barrett and Smith systems, has installed or is installing a total of 18 solar electric systems since he began his business two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redgate said most homeowners could expect to break even in about six years after installing a system. The lifetime of a system is expected to be 40 years, but most are warranteed by the manufacturer for 25, he said.</p>
        <p>Physical construction takes about three days, but the entire process takes about two months because of roof and electrical evaluations and the paperwork involved for the rebates and permits, all of which is handled by his company. Once the LIPA rebate is received, the check is turned over to the system's supplier and deducted from the overall installation cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Redgate is also the consultant for a team of students at New York Institute of Technology who are building a completely solar powered house at the college as part of the Solar Decathlon, an international ''solar village'' competition. Nineteen colleges are taking part in the competition, which is being sponsored by the Department of Energy in partnership with Home Depot and the American Institute of Architects.</p>
