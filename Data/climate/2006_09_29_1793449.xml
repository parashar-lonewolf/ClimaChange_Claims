        <p>ON Wednesday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California signed a bold bill pledging the state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2020. It was refreshing to hear a politician of national stature explain, with an air of true conviction, why global warming is an urgent problem. ''It creeps up on you,'' he told ABC News, the day he said he would sign the bill. ''And then all of a sudden, it is too late to do something about it.  We don't want to go there.''</p>
        <p>Just so. For the last nine years, since the United States refused to join in the Kyoto program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the country has acted in stubborn defiance of the obvious facts. Thus California is setting the country an admirable example. But there are a couple of worrisome aspects to the initiative: one is a possible reaction against greenhouse reductions elsewhere in America should California fail to meet its goals; the second is the question of whether this approach, even if successful, has much relevance for the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>The new bill gives the California Air Resources Board, the state's air-quality watchdog, sweeping powers to create and put in place a plan to slash the state's greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels. Although that still falls short of what the Kyoto Protocol asked of the United States -- a cut to 7 percent below 1990 levels --the bill's objectives are formidable enough.</p>
        <p>Working with other state agencies and building on a wide variety of regulations already in place, the board is in effect authorized to set rules for everything from making plastics to toasting English muffins. No doubt the plan will include stricter energy standards for residential and commercial construction, emissions caps for major industries like electric power and petrochemicals, and new practices for farmers. Inevitably, stricter limits on motor vehicles, which account for about 40 percent of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, will be a big part of the program.</p>
        <p>Those involved in formulating the new law express confidence that its strategy is workable, based as it is on proved technologies identified by a climate panel that reported to Mr. Schwarzenegger this year.</p>
        <p>But, paradoxically, the plan is threatened by California's previous success on the issue. The state is a world leader in green technologies, and the progress it has already made in constraining its emissions will make it harder in some ways to achieve even greater advances. Its per capita consumption of electricity and gasoline already are much lower than the national average -- its annual per capita electricity use is less than 8,000 kilowatt/hours, while the country's is greater than 12,000. It is one of the nation's leading wind energy producers, and has the country's most ambitious solar roofs program.</p>
        <p>The United States as a whole gets about half its electricity from coal, the most carbon-intense of fuels, and coal generation accounts for more than a third of its greenhouse gas emissions. So if the United States decided to get with the Kyoto program, it could comply just by replacing half its coal-fired plants with proven low-carbon sources like wind, natural gas and nuclear energy. A simple tax on carbon emissions or a national cap-and-trade system could get the job done.</p>
        <p>In California, however, most electricity already comes from relatively low-carbon sources -- there are no coal-fired plants in the state -- so the burden of cutting the state's greenhouse gases necessarily falls on widely dispersed activities: cars, manufacturing, buildings, appliances.</p>
        <p>That means that the air board will have to issue a huge number of very complicated regulations, which will set the stage for industrial interests and free-market advocates to mount a sustained counterattack on the whole idea of the bill. The argument that the bill puts California at a disadvantage economically will be a powerful weapon in their hands.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the plan like Devra Wang, the director of energy research at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, feel that political motivation can be sustained. She points out that the greenhouse bill had strong support from the leaders of both parties, and that the air board has a record of making good decisions based on science.</p>
        <p>But the air board's record of trying to force the adoption of zero-emission cars in California does not inspire much confidence. Its efforts to make automakers provide lower-carbon vehicles, which began with a 2002 law, are tied up in federal court.</p>
        <p>Even if California's program overcomes these obstacles and cuts emissions radically, its approach to doing the job is not likely to be a model for other states. What is more, there's a danger that failure could be taken incorrectly as proof that the job of radically cutting emissions cannot be done at all. Its goals may well be too ambitious for the state to meet, and be based on a flawed premise that greenhouse gas control can be done ad hoc and state by state.</p>
        <p>No matter what happens, the end message will surely be that there's no real substitute for concerted national action. Simply put, though California deserves praise for attacking the climate problem head on, it may be trying to do too much on its own.</p>
