        <p>JUST when you thought it was safe to procreate, the population bomb is back. Two decades ago, mainstream economists brushed aside the vision of a future chronically short of food and fuel. Now some are having second thoughts, prompted by new concerns about possible global warming and other strains imposed by population and economic growth on the planet's ecology.</p>
        <p>Most economists remain confident that the conventional analysis of the population problem is substantially correct: a steady flow of new technology that uses resources ever more efficiently will offset any scarcity of minerals and arable land, at the very least dampening the tendency for commodity prices to rise.</p>
        <p>But few ever bought into the more-the-merrier approach to population growth that became fashionable during the Reagan years. And a general unease with the academics' defense of laissez-faire population policies is now coalescing around new fears that the environment will not easily support a larger population at a decent living standard.</p>
        <p>"Simply allowing every Chinese family to have a refrigerator and a television will swamp painful efforts in the West to limit global warming," argues Paul Portney, a researcher at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.</p>
        <p>The gloom-and-doom school of population theory, founded two centuries ago by the Rev. Thomas Malthus, held that continuing population growth virtually guaranteed falling living standards as more mouths tried to feed off increasingly marginal land. Economists came to understand that Malthus had underestimated the capacity of technology to enhance productivity. But biologists and others were not so well persuaded.</p>
        <p>The Malthusian dilemma reached a high-water mark of popular acceptance in the early 1970's. Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University biologist who wrote "The Population Bomb," raised the prospect of mass starvation by the end of the century as too many people tried to subsist on too little land. "The Limits to Growth," a 1973 report from the Club of Rome, a group of business leaders and academics, forecast a more general hard landing as the world ran out of resources.</p>
        <p>But neither history nor contemporary events confirmed the neo-Malthusians' predictions. Scarcity of resources has always been overcome in the past by the discovery of ways to wring more output from a declining resource base. Coal, for example, was substituted for charcoal in iron smelting when 19th century industrialists ran out of accessible forest. And as both the "green revolution" in agriculture and the broader decline in commodity prices in the 1970's suggested, technology was having no trouble staying ahead.</p>
        <p>Even the exception -- the massive runup in energy prices after the Arab oil embargo in 1974 -- seemed to prove the technological optimists' rule. The energy shock stimulated a combination of new oil production and energy-saving investment that drove the real cost of fuel back to pre-crisis levels by the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that the critics of the unreconstructed Malthusian view were entirely sanguine about population growth. The dominant view of the relationship between population and economic welfare remained as simple as it is intuitive: more people meant less land and less capital per person, which in turn meant lower living standards than would otherwise be possible.</p>
        <p>And David Bloom, a Columbia University economist, points out, population-driven poverty can be self-perpetuating. The more mouths to feed, the less families can set aside for savings; the more babies in need of education and medical care, the lower the proportion of savings available for productivity-enhancing investment.</p>
        <p>But this drag-on-productivity model was forcefully challenged in the 1980's by Julian Simon, an economist at the University of Maryland. Drawing on the ideas of economists like Simon Kuznets and Esther Boserup, he noted that population growth could also stimulate productivity. More people, he speculated, would mean more heads to invent good ideas for improving technology -- how many Nobel Prize winners have been born in Andorra? And higher population density would allow scale efficiencies in production.</p>
        <p>More intensive farming, for example, would make it economical to extend roads and rail to rural areas. And a large population of consumers would generate a natural internal market for mass produced industrial goods. "Does anyone seriously doubt," Mr. Simon asks, "that Europe is more prosperous with a population of hundreds of millions than it would be with a population of hundreds of thousands?"  Theory Wins Converts</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon's revisionism had no difficulty drawing converts. Many economists, notes Dan Dudek at the Environmental Defense Fund, were attracted by its libertarian implications: if population growth did not interfere with development, there would be no need to interfere with the procreative choices of consenting adults. And while it stopped short of endorsement, a prestigous panel of experts assembled in 1986 by the National Academy of Sciences gave population revisionism a respectful review.</p>
        <p>Traditional conservatives also liked the idea. If population growth is not a social ill, governments need not spend money in support of family planning or abortion -- and there would certainly be no rationale for Chinese-style coercion. At the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City the Reagan Administration broke ranks with other affluent countries, abandoning Washington's long-held position that economic development would hardly be possible in the third world unless population growth was contained.</p>
        <p>The revisionist message also meshed neatly with the cause of more open immigration policies: if more people would not retard prosperity in Africa or Asia, it certainly would not harm the American economy. Even the political left liked what it heard. Marxists have never had much truck with population worries; Friedrich Engels explicitly dismissed the Malthusian dilemma as an artifact of capitalism.  A Shift in Views</p>
        <p>The worm is now turning. David Bloom, writing with Richard Freeman, a Harvard economist, found no statistical relationship between population growth and changes in output per person -- a conclusion that would not surprise Julian Simon. But Mr. Bloom believes that generalizations from past experience are dangerous.</p>
        <p>He noted, for example, that Kenya managed to achieve a reasonable 2 percent annual improvement in living standards during the last quarter century even while it was experiencing the highest rate of population growth (4 percent) in sub-Saharan Africa. But that happy coincidence was probably only possible, Mr. Bloom argued, because the country had plenty of good land on which to extend agriculture. Future population growth, he suggested, will be far more problematic.</p>
        <p>Kenya's predicament may apply elsewhere, and with a vengeance. In the last 20 years, Mr. Bloom points out, some 1.3 billion people have been added to the third world -- more than the entire population of the developed countries.</p>
        <p>By the same token, Mr. Bloom rejects Julian Simon's broad-brush claims for economies of scale in poor countries. There may be circumstances in which high population density makes it easier to develop local markets for industry or to support an efficient transportation system. "But wouldn't Bangladesh be better off with five million fewer people," he asks? "The answer is certainly yes."</p>
        <p>Once population has raced past some reasonable level of density in poor countries, rapid population growth is surely a drag on living standards.  Need to Face Reality</p>
        <p>That is music to the ears of George Zeidenstein, the head of the Population Council in New York, who is frustrated that less than 1 percent of all development aid now goes to family planning. Even as American intellectuals backed away from population control, he notes, poor countries have been pushed toward it by the accumulating weight of health and education obligations. "They have been convinced," Mr. Zeidenstein said, "by their own realities."  Fears of Climate Change</p>
        <p>But the decisive tilt in the intellectual debate is coming from a newer source: fear of global ecological instability. Emissions of so-called "greenhouse effect" gases -- primarily carbon dioxide, methane and refrigeration chemicals -- are widely believed to be warming the earth's atmosphere. The higher temperatures that computer models project would raise ocean levels and flood low-lying areas. Weather patterns would also be likely to change, disrupting agriculture and creating new deserts.</p>
        <p>Rapid population growth, notes Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at Michigan State, may bear little relation to the pace of global warming. Greenhouse emissions are more closely related to the level of economic activity than the numbers of emitters. The average American generates 19 times as much carbon dioxide as the average Indian. And it is entirely possible that, say, an economically vibrant Brazil with slow population growth would burn down its tropical forests more rapidly than an impoverished Brazil with rapid population growth.  A Daunting Problem</p>
        <p>The problem of preventing atmospheric warming without consigning a substantial fraction of the world to permanent poverty is daunting enough. It could be immensely complicated by excessive population growth. By United Nations estimates, the population of poor countries will rise by almost three billion in the next 30 years. Even if carbon dioxide emissions from third world economies can be held to the current per capita rate, an unlikely prospect if they are to become more prosperous, global emissions would rise by 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Julian Simon is not perturbed by such arithmetic. People used to worry about running out of copper, he notes; now they worry about running out of atmospheric resources. It is already technically possible to beat the greenhouse effect with a mix of conservation and power generation from non-fossil fuels like solar and nuclear energy, he says. The real question, then, is how costly the fix will be. And if history is any indicator, he asserts, it will be far cheaper than now expected.</p>
        <p>Many economists, however, are no longer prepared to put all their chips on the assumption that technology will again come to the rescue, offsetting the effects of projected doubling of world population in the next century. "In the absence of certainty," argues David Bloom, "the responsible position is to act conservatively." Hardly anyone is laughing at Malthus anymore.</p>
