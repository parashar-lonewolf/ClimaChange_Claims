        <p>THE RAT  By Gunter Grass. Translated by Ralph Manheim. 371 pp. San Diego: A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/ Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $17.95.</p>
        <p>IMAGINE the following: You find yourself trapped in some small space with a group of punk teen-agers (replete with their dangerous green hair and their pet rats) who appear to be high, spaced-out, manic. You must all watch the same television set, and the punks have the remote control button in their hands. Their eyes are unnaturally bright and their attention span is short. They cannot tolerate a split second of inactivity. They are watching six programs at once, flick flick flick from channel to channel, so quickly that your head is spinning.</p>
        <p>You beg them to stop, you try to leave, but then -rather to your own astonishment, and in spite of a queasy middle-aged distaste for strobe lights and special effects and avant-garde intellectual tricks - you become hooked on all six story lines. Your mind, as it were, turns high-tech, your eyes adjust to the frames that go riffling by with their multiple programs.</p>
        <p>There's the news of the world (dramatic and ghastly); there are solemn experts discussing mutual deterrence and limited strikes and the neutron ''conservation'' bomb (the ''art-loving bomb'' that will leave designated cultural monuments as unharmed as Aztec ruins); there's a documentary on the dying forests and another on the dying oceans; there seem to be movie versions of several earlier Gunter Grass novels, all of which are encroaching on one another, looping plot lines, doubling back on themselves. (There's Oskar, for example, though he doesn't have his tin drum and he seems to be discussing Solidarity and postfeminist male-female relations with the Flounder.) There is a whole festival of Disney versions of the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm, interspersed with interviews with the brothers themselves (now Ministers of the Environment and called the Grimm Brothers) and with a voice-over by scholars and commentators of various stripes. Your scrambled mind picks up fragments of an absorbing literary-sociological-theological explication of the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin and the plague of rats and the lost generation of Hamelin's youth. You see Hansel and Gretel running away through the forest (which is blighted, of course, by acid rain), and Gretel looks remarkably like . . . is it Patty Hearst? or the daughter of some European politician? or your neighbor's child who is reputed to be adrift somewhere in the Himalayas these days, if she's not part of that animal rights group that has quite gone over the edge.</p>
        <p>There's also a garish science fiction video in there somewhere, one more version of ''the day after,'' with hordes of hominoid rats and a kind of superrat, a nonstop GunterGrassian talker, who occasionally looks and sounds eerily like Isaiah or Jeremiah or one of those Old Testament visionary doomsayers, were they to return in a feminist and simian incarnation.</p>
        <p>And then, dizzily, you notice yourself - your own glazed and bug-eyed face - blip in and out of this fandango of channel changing. (There must be a video monitor somewhere in the room.) You are watching yourself watching the multiple shows. You watch a fuse blow somewhere, kaboom, you watch your own involuntary alarm (there's a blinding white light and a fallout of ash), but the screens keep flickering and you watch yourself watching the video of your anxiety and you gasp: ''Neat trick! How is it done?''</p>
        <p>And the voice-over - a slightly sibilant sound that makes you think of rat gibber - the voice tells you: ''This is the nth rerun of the news of last June when the big bang . . .'' and now you really want to get out, it's not funny anymore, and the room has gone totally dark and you sense with a sudden panic that you are all alone except for the flickering screens, and you cry out with the lonely astronaut from the science fiction track: Earth! Earth! Answer me, Earth! Let me out! But there is no out, something's stuck, and the reruns keep rerunning rerunning rerunning rerunning. . . .</p>
        <p>What you are watching is the film of the film of the film, brought to you by an old acquaintance, Oskar Matzerath, whose body got stuck long ago at the age of 3, and who once bore witness to the world's insanity on a tin drum. At 60, however, balding and with prostate trouble, en route to the celebration of the 107th birthday of his grandmother Anna Koljaiczek (she of the memorable and capacious four skirts), Oskar makes silent movies about the silent forests and brings you nostalgic backward glances at where your future is (was) headed through his wildly successful Post Futurum Films. For him, there's nothing new about the end. We've seen it all before: ''The future belongs to the rats,'' he muses, ''and of course to our video cassettes.''</p>
        <p>This exhilarating, exhausting, maddening, brilliant, funny and profoundly disturbing novel is about the end of mankind, the end of plot, the end of syntax, the end of language. Words about the end of language? This has always been the central philosophical and artistic dilemma for Gunter Grass; how can the truth be told when language is as worthless as the postwar Deutsche mark? What shape can the novel have when ''words stumble into their hole'' and writers, according to Franz Josef Strauss (leader of the opposition in the German elections of 1980), are ''mere rats and blowflies''?</p>
        <p>Mr. Grass has given us a gallery of famous side-steppers of the language impasse: a dwarf with a tin drum, a talking fish and now an impassioned and visionary She-rat. In the age of logorrhea, his novels (mutating in form and syntax along with his hominoid protagonists, writhing like indomitable victims of some linguistic Chernobyl) are passionate attempts ''to put off the end with words'' even as words themselves must be scraped free of the counterfeiter's muck.</p>
        <p>In ''Headbirths,'' that exquisite little novel-travelogue-philosophical tract of 1982, the author was explicit about the problem: ''In 1945, Germany was not only militarily defeated. . . . National Socialist ideology had robbed the German language of its meaning, had corrupted it and laid waste whole fields of words. In this mutilated language, writers, handicapped by its injuries, began to stammer more than write . . . only stammering could assert itself.''</p>
        <p>The stammerer of this novel, gracefully captured by Mr. Grass's longtime translator, Ralph Manheim, is a pet Christmas rat in a cage beneath the tree. Like the protagonist in ''The Flounder,'' who was ''only contemporary for the time being,'' the Christmas rat is all rats: from the ones left off the ark by Noah, to the Pied Piper's rats, to the lab rats of modern science, to the apocalyptic She-rat of the sci-fi video track, to the hominoid rat of the posthuman era. The rats know how to survive. It's the Bikini reflex - the one that got the vermin back onto that atoll in next to no time - so that when rats abandon the sinking ship, it is truly doomed.</p>
        <p>And in the middle of the festivities for her 107th birthday, Anna Koljaiczek whispers to Oskar in terror: ''There used to be rats here behind the house. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Now they're all gone.''</p>
        <p>There's comfort, of a sort, from the She-rat: ''Free at last from humans, the earth is reviving, filling again with creatures that creep and fly. The seas are breathing again. The air seems rejuvenated. And everywhere time is on hand, an inexhaustible supply of time.''</p>
        <p>Only time and the rats and the reruns - and the lone observer in the sci-fi track. ''Someone . . . is dreaming us in installments,'' he weeps (with a nod to Borges). ''In His flashbacks, thanks to the divine lust for publicity, we survive'' - and in the leftover fairy tales and the gibber of writers, those ''rats and blowflies,'' who - in video flashback - ''talk the human present into existence.''</p>
        <p>''I thank you, ladies and gentlemen,'' says the narrator addressing the empty Bundestag of the ghost city of Danzig-Gdansk (spared by the art-loving neutron bomb), ''for your eloquent absence.''</p>
        <p>All flesh is Grass, and this is the year of ''The Rat.''  HOW THE JELYFISH SING</p>
        <p>It's early afternoon. Not raining at the moment. None of the women feels like talking. There's nothing more to be got out of the stone throwing. Has their shore leave been a disappointment? The women seem to be bound by an oath of silence and - if nothing unforeseen happens - won't be released from it until they're over the submerged city.</p>
        <p>But when, in the bright northern evening, they pass Hoburg Banks, a shallows south of Gotland, and enter a large field of jellyfish that cuts down their speed and seems to follow them even when they try to avoid it by veering to starboard, the silent women - and I, too, who am keeping them silent - seem to hear a rising and falling sound over the waters, a wordless singing without beginning or end, as though millions of medusae - who else? - had suddenly found their voice in the shallows or been miraculously set to singing by a higher will. . . . The Old Woman leaves her spaghetti in the galley, breaks the oath of silence imposed by me, and cries out, ''Man, they're really singing!'' After that all five women, last of all the oceanographer, believe what they hear in high and low register.</p>
        <p>Aurelia aurita, she of the graceful design, she whose flabby middle part is stigmatized by a bluish-violet four-leaf clover, can sing. These astral, transparent medusae, which breathe with the sea . . . are singing despite their flabby velar flanges: a swelling sound, trembling on the high notes, resounding organlike on the low ones, narrows the workroom of the former freight barge. Never before, unless perhaps in the Biblical fiery furnace, has there been such fervid singing.  From ''The Rat.''</p>
