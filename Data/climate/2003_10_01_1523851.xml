        <p>The Chicago Climate Exchange, a start-up venture hoping to create a market for member companies and governments to trade rights to emit gases associated with global warming, got off to an ambiguous start yesterday with an auction that laid the groundwork for trading to begin Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>The prices paid by companies like Ford Motor, DuPont and American Electric Power for carbon dioxide emissions averaged less than $1 a metric ton. That was one-tenth the price of over-the-counter trades of carbon dioxide emissions allowances in Europe.</p>
        <p>Experts had several possible explanations for the pricing, saying that it will take many months to know if the low prices reflected the traditionally cautious view that traders take toward new financial products, or a justifiably optimistic disagreement with Europe over the cost of reducing emissions, or flaws in the concept of the exchange.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gas trading is patterned in part on successful markets for trading other air pollutants, most notably sulfur dioxide. In such markets, polluters that have trouble meeting regulatory limits on emissions buy allowances from other companies that can reduce pollution, thus helping to find the cheapest way to reduce overall emissions.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gas emissions are not limited by any regulations in the United States and there are doubts that a market based on voluntary caps like those adopted by the Chicago Climate Exchange can succeed.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be at best a fantasy baseball sort of exercise unless real emissions caps are in place,'' said Jon Coifman, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that has supported emissions trading for other pollutants.</p>
        <p>The 21 members of the exchange are committed to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions annually by 1 percent, but there is no threat of government prosecution or fines if they fail.</p>
        <p>The auction yesterday was intended to help members estimate prices and establish trading strategies for trading, scheduled to begin Oct. 31. ''It's going to take five or six years to really mature,'' said Dr. Richard Sandor, chairman and chief executive of the exchange.</p>
        <p>The exchange's voluntary approach has attracted support from the Bush administration, which is opposing proposed legislation in Congress calling for mandatory caps.</p>
        <p>Environmental consultants said that although it was a good sign that the exchange sold all 125,000 metric tons of allowances it put up for auction, the low prices raised questions about whether the market could serve its function of encouraging efficient investment in cutting greenhouse emissions.</p>
        <p>''At a dollar a ton it's not really a price suggesting it's worth it to invest in abatement,'' Benedikt von Butler, chief greenhouse gas broker for Evolution Markets, said.</p>
