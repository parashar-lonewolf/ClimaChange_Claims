        <p>SEARCHING</p>
        <p>FOR CRUSOE</p>
        <p>A Journey Among</p>
        <p>the Last Real Islands.</p>
        <p>By Thurston Clarke.</p>

        <p>The password for Thurston Clarke's A.T.M. account is -- or at least was -- the name of the Greek island of Patmos, where he spent part of his honeymoon. He has ancestors buried on Nantucket. And the first thing he reveals in his new book is that his home in upstate New York overlooks a tiny archipelago in Lake Champlain. The book itself suggests that he has spent a lifetime seeking out, or retreating to, one island or another.</p>
        <p>''Searching for Crusoe'' visits more than a dozen islands from the South Pacific to the Hebrides and refers to dozens more. Its subtitle, which may well be the clumsiest line in a decidedly unclumsy book, calls this ''A Journey Among the Last Real Islands,'' but the point is not simply to describe some picturesque (and now frequently ruined) backwaters. The point is to examine what it is about islands that fascinates people so.</p>
        <p>Clarke's chapters are peppered with interim summations. Islands are ''natural attics'' and ''natural monasteries.'' Islands ''play tricks with time.'' An island's ''temptations are more fabulous than those of a continent and its dangers more terrifying, but . . . even a frightening island can be seductive.'' This last notion, Clarke observes, is as old as the ''Odyssey,'' but the book that defines the lure of islands (in the Western world, at least) is ''Robinson Crusoe,'' whose hero's shadow, Clarke writes, ''falls over every island.'' After Crusoe, deserted islands would be thought of not only as fearful places but as possible utopias, sites of rebirth and reform.</p>
        <p>The logical stepping-off point for Clarke's island progress, then, is the spot of land 400 miles off the coast of Chile where Alexander Selkirk -- the Scottish prototype borrowed by Daniel Defoe -- lived as a castaway between 1704 and 1709. Other stops include the Maldives, which will drown if global warming becomes a reality; a privately owned Hawaiian fief; and an Arctic island shared by a sullenly hard-drinking Russian mining camp and a gleefully hard-drinking Norwegian college town. Clarke also takes us to Patmos and to Eigg, off the coast of Scotland, which the tenants bought from the laird.</p>
        <p>Clarke's other destinations include Esp√≠ritu Santo, where he tracks down some of the people and places in James Michener's ''Tales of the South Pacific,'' and a little island off the coast of Honduras where a local eccentric makes a momentarily convincing argument that it is the ''real'' home of Robinson Crusoe. There's also a former Vietnamese prison island that may have ''the best island beach and restaurant on earth.''</p>
        <p>Clarke's usual approach is to suggest the physical appearance of the island (without sounding like a travel brochure) and then engage both residents and visitors in conversation to find out what they make of the place, but he isn't wedded to this format. So a chapter on Campobello, Franklin Roosevelt's Canadian retreat, begins as an occasion for some pleasantly Cheeveresque memories of Clarke's own summers on Fishers Island in Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>WHILE Defoe may have established the notion of what an island should be, the author Clarke quotes most frequently on what islands are becoming is George Orwell, who wrote ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' in a farmhouse on Jura, in the Inner Hebrides. In an essay called ''Pleasure Spots,'' Orwell predicts that when visiting the vacation areas of the future one would never be alone, never be within sight of wild vegetation and never be ''out of the sound of artificial music.'' This is the fate Clarke sees overtaking many of the islands of the world.</p>
        <p>Although ''Searching for Crusoe'' has maps of most of the featured islands, it has no photographs. This was surely a deliberate omission, for what Clarke demonstrates so well is that while islands from Nantucket to Oahu may in fact be despoiled or endangered, they live on in memory and imagination -- in dreams far more vivid and seductive than photography.</p>
        <p>David Willis McCullough's most recent book is an anthology, ''Wars of the Irish Kings.''</p>
