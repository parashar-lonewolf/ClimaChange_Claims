        <p>ALIEN-EARTHLING RELATIONS JUST AREN'T what they used to be. Will Smith establishes that in "Independence Day," when, as Capt. Steven Hiller, he announces his eagerness to "get up there" and "whup" E. T..</p>
        <p>What? Beat up on a diminutive alien so cute he can hide among the stuffed animals in a child's closet and so innocent that he's lured into a house by a trail of candy? An alien who learned English by watching "Sesame Street" and went trick or treating dressed as a ghost?</p>
        <p>These days, visitors from other planets are nothing like E. T. or other good-willed creatures of the Spielbergian New Age. Even in the 1950's, when alien invasions may have symbolized cold-war fears, extraterrestrials sometimes  had good reasons for dropping in -- advising Earth people on intergalactic law,  for example.</p>
        <p>Their latest incarnations don't. Here's what aliens have been up to in several films over the decades (excluding the 60's, when things were strange enough on Earth without them). ANITA GATES</p>
        <p>(1) THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951) (2) IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (1953) (3) THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953) (4) CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) (5) E.T.: THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL (1982) (6) SPECIES (1995) (7) THE ARRIVAL (1996) (8) INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) SIGNS THE ALIENS MIGHT BE BAD (1) A robot starts vaporizing people, not just rifles and tanks.</p>
        <p>(2) They take over the bodies of two telephone linemen and a schoolteacher, who promptly puts on a strapless black cocktail dress.</p>
        <p>(3) They vaporize three mild-mannered men who approach the ship carrying a white flag.</p>
        <p>(4) An ominous storm cloud kidnaps a little boy.</p>
        <p>(5) E. T. scares Drew Barrymore, age 7.</p>
        <p>(6) She grows tentacles and murders the train conductor.</p>
        <p>(7) Hotel rooms are visited by scorpions and flying bathtubs.</p>
        <p>(8) As the "welcome wagon" helicopter approaches the ship, it's shot down.</p>
        <p>SIGNS THE ALIENS MIGHT BE GOOD</p>
        <p>(1) The alien picks up a small object the Army has just destroyed and says, "It was a gift for your President."</p>
        <p>(2) The aliens say so: "We have souls and minds, and we are good."</p>
        <p>(3) A Martian looks frightened, covering his three-lensed eye with his spindly hands.</p>
        <p>(4) They're musical and as gentle as Gandhi. Even Francois Truffaut is reduced to childlike wonder.</p>
        <p>(5) When Henry cuts his finger, E. T. heals it with his glowing golden fingertip.</p>
        <p>(6) She looks awfully good in a demibra and leggings.</p>
        <p>(7) None.</p>
        <p>(8) For a while, they just hover.</p>
        <p>AND THE ALIENS ARE:</p>
        <p>(1) Good, but strict.</p>
        <p>(2) Good.</p>
        <p>(3) Very bad.</p>
        <p>(4) Good.</p>
        <p>(5) Good.</p>
        <p>(6) Bad.</p>
        <p>(7) Bad.</p>
        <p>(8) Really bad.</p>
        <p>WHO JUST DOESN'T GET IT</p>
        <p>(1) Radio announcers ("The monster must be destroyed") and everyone at the boardinghouse.</p>
        <p>(2) Newspaper headline writers ("Star Gazer Sees Martians").</p>
        <p>(3) A priest who insists that aliens must be "nearer the Creator" and reads them the 23d Psalm. They vaporize him.</p>
        <p>(4) The hero's wife, who thinks anyone who builds a model of Devils Tower out of mashed potatoes cannot be a well man.</p>
        <p>(5) Poor Mom, who has an alien in her house but is more worried about her estranged husband's trip to Mexico.</p>
        <p>(6) The nice guy who takes her to the hospital after she's hit by a car, admires her "Baywatch" body and ends up dead.</p>
        <p>(7) The hero's girlfriend, who thinks he's just too wrapped up in his work.</p>
        <p>(8) The happy revelers atop a skyscraper, who are holding up signs of welcome when the ship opens to reveal a blue-green light that kills them all.</p>
        <p>FLASHIEST TRICK</p>
        <p>(1) Staging a 30-minute worldwide electrical blackout.</p>
        <p>(2) Zapping people with their laser fingers.</p>
        <p>(3) Destroying cities, one building at a time.</p>
        <p>(4) The mother ship playing musical tick-tack-toe with earthlings.</p>
        <p>(5) Making bicycles fly.</p>
        <p>(6) Growing from child to adult during a Utah-to-California train trip.</p>
        <p>(7) Bending their knees backward and jumping very high.</p>
        <p>(8) Blowing up the White House.</p>
        <p>WHY THEY'RE REALLY HERE</p>
        <p>(1) To warn humans to keep their violence to themselves or Earth will be "reduced to a burned-out cinder."</p>
        <p>(2) They crash-landed here and just needed human bodies so they could go into town and buy electrical supplies.</p>
        <p>(3) To take over the planet, which they say is dying anyway.</p>
        <p>(4) Just to touch base and to return a few of our pilots (missing since World War II).</p>
        <p>(5) He was accidentally left behind when his fellow aliens, on a peaceful exploratory mission, were frightened away.</p>
        <p>(6) To mate with humans, reproduce and take over the planet.</p>
        <p>(7) To speed up global warming, so they'll be more comfortable when they take over the planet.</p>
        <p>(8) To kill everyone and take over the planet.</p>
