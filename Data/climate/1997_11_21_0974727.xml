        <p>The average New Jersey family could cut its gasoline costs in half if Congress enacted the tougher fuel efficiency standards recommended by a Presidential advisory committee, two nonprofit groups said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In 1995, the committee urged lawmakers to increase mileage standards to 45 miles per gallon from 27 for cars and 34 miles per gallon from 20.7 for light trucks by 2008.</p>
        <p>The stricter standards would shave $540 off the average New Jersey family's annual gas bill of $1,039, according to a report released yesterday by the Environmental Working Group and the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a group that promotes spending on transportation projects. Raising the standards would reduce the state's carbon dioxide emissions by 15 million tons a year, the report said.</p>
        <p>But the costs of meeting those standards would raise the average price of a new car by $2,500, said Ron DeFore of the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, which represents the three largest United States auto makers.</p>
