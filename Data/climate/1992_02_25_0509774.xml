        <p>As a member of Congress, Paul E.

        <p>As a member of Congress, Paul E. Tsongas described the Federal budget deficit as the nation's "No. 1 economic problem," criticized labor unions as an obstacle to increased industrial productivity and led efforts to help the guerrillas who were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>He consistently sided with liberals when they sought to protect the environment and the civil rights of women and homosexuals. But he often sided with moderates and conservatives when they moved to curb the growth of Federal spending.</p>
        <p>In other words, as a member of the House of Representatives from 1975 through 1978 and as a Senator from 1979 through 1984, Mr. Tsongas displayed the same unorthodox mix of ideas that he espouses as a Presidential candidate.  An Atari Democrat</p>
        <p>He described himself in those years as an Atari Democrat, a member of the young generation of politicians and economists who looked to high technology as a source of jobs and economic growth.</p>
        <p>He was a decade ahead of most lawmakers in identifying Japan as both an economic threat and a model for cooperation between government and private industry. In the early 1980's, he introduced several bills that would have authorized the Government to subsidize certain new technologies.</p>
        <p>At a time when many Democrats and labor leaders were lambasting President Ronald Reagan's fiscal policies as an assault on poor people, Mr. Tsongas complained instead that the Reagan Administration was not investing enough in science, research and technology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas's voting record indicates that he was among the most liberal members of the House. As a Senator, he continued to vote with liberal Democrats. But in 1979 and 1980 he re-examined his political assumptions and began to suggest that to help create jobs the Government should adopt tax and economic policies to assist businesses.</p>
        <p>As a Senator, Mr. Tsongas was more effective than most other freshman members. He played a major role in shaping two laws of lasting significance. One protects more than 100 million acres of pristine land in Alaska from commercial development. The other authorized a $3.5 billion aid package for the Chrysler Corporation. Peace Corps Volunteeer</p>
        <p>Having served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia and the West Indies in the 1960's, Mr. Tsongas often complained about the "foolishness" of American policy toward third-world nations. By spurning their pleas for economic aid, he said, the United States drove such nations toward Moscow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas urged Presidents Jimmy Carter and Reagan to establish diplomatic relations with the Marxist Government of Angola. He supported legislation to cut off military aid to El Salvador and deplored that country's human rights record.</p>
        <p>Through all this, Mr. Tsongas had a touch of whimsy rarely found in the Senate. Mocking politicians and oil executives who sought maximum oil production, he suggested breeding dinosaurs in the hope they would increase future supplies of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>As a Senator, Mr. Tsongas served on the committees on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Foreign Relations and Energy and Natural Resources. In an interview, James A. McClure, a conservative Idaho Republican who was chairman of the Energy Committee from 1981 through 1986, said: "Paul Tsongas was intelligent, listened well and contributed to our discussions in a thoughtful way. There was no knee-jerk reaction from him that told you his mind was committed before he got into a subject."</p>
        <p>What follows is a survey of Mr. Tsongas's record in Congress, as reflected in his remarks, votes and actions. Energy</p>
        <p>Energy was the topic of Mr. Tsongas's first speech in the Senate, in 1979. He described the energy crisis of fuel shortages and high oil prices as "the greatest threat to America's future." Calling for a new definition of national security, he said: "Any rational strategic military planner would have to conclude that our major vulnerability today is not, as many would argue, a first strike by the Soviet Union on our I.C.B.M. installations, or a Warsaw Pact attack upon NATO, but rather our vulnerability to the crude oil supply" from the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas was a tireless advocate of energy conservation, which he called "the best weapon we have" against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He supported greater use of solar energy, windmills and synthetic fuels. He boasted that he voted for increases in the Federal excise tax on gasoline whenever they were proposed.</p>
        <p>But unlike many liberals, Mr. Tsongas refrained from attacks on the oil companies, saying such criticism, while emotionally satisfying, did nothing to reduce the excessive consumption of oil. "If Mother Teresa were put at the head of Exxon, the energy crisis would not go away," he said in 1981. The Environment</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas made his mark in the Senate as a champion of environmentalists in the fight to restrict development of Federal land in Alaska. The state "represents the greatest conservation challenge of the 20th century," he said.</p>
        <p>Donald J. Barry, who worked on the bill as an Interior Department lawyer, said last week: "A lot of people like to claim credit for the Alaska Lands Act. Senator Tsongas is one of the few members of Congress who truly deserve it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas was more willing than most liberals to accept nuclear power. "No nuclear power means one certain result: large-scale reliance on coal," he said in 1980.  Chrysler and the Economy</p>
        <p>Though initially skeptical about loan guarantees for Chrysler, Mr. Tsongas supported them after labor unions agreed to wage reductions. He helped develop what he described as a Federal bailout for the auto maker in 1979. He worked closely with a Republican, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, and was sometimes criticized by the unions.</p>
        <p>Howard G. Paster, chief lobbyist for the United Automobile Workers at the time, said last week: "Senator Tsongas initially demanded wage givebacks that were out of the question. In the end, he was clearly committed to saving Chrysler. But he could not be taken for granted by organized labor. The Chrysler loan guarantee showed his willingness to think unconventional thoughts and his impatience with the ritual dance of the legislative process."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas got high ratings from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. During his 10 years in Congress, his scores averaged 89 on a scale of 100. He presents himself now as aggressively pro-business. But his ratings from the Chamber of Commerce of the United States averaged only 23, also on a scale of 100.</p>
        <p>As a member of the House in 1978, Mr. Tsongas voted against a proposal to lower the capital gains tax, but a few years later he said he had made a mistake because that bill "did more for the economy of my state than anything I did as a Congressman."</p>
        <p>In 1982, Mr. Tsongas warned that Japan was outstripping the United States in world trade. If the United States is to compete with Japan, he said, "business and government must adopt a new cooperative spirit."  Civil Rights</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas repeatedly introduced bills to prohibit employers from discriminating against homosexual workers. "The use of an irrelevant factor, such as sexual orientation, in evaluating an applicant or employee is a blatant invasion of that person's privacy," he said.</p>
        <p>He was also a leading supporter of a proposed constitutional amendment to guarantee equal rights for women.</p>
        <p>In 1979, Mr. Tsongas said, "I personally support busing as a constitutionally acceptable remedy of last resort to achieve desegregation." But to strike a compromise with lawmakers opposed to busing, Mr. Tsongas supported restrictions on its use. He was an early supporter of legislation to strengthen the Voting Rights Act..  Foreign Affairs</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas supported President Carter's decision to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 by embargoing shipments of grain and high technology products to Moscow.</p>
        <p>In 1982, he introduced a resolution calling on the Reagan Administration to step up the supply of "material assistance," including weapons, to Afghan guerrillas trying to expel Soviet forces.</p>
        <p>Through his years in Congress, Mr. Tsongas often highlighted human rights abuses, from East Timor in Indonesia to South Africa to El Salvador. As early as 1979 he was urging colleges to show their opposition to apartheid by selling their stock in companies doing business in South Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas consistently supported military and economic aid for Israel. But in 1982, he criticized Israel for carrying its war in Lebanon all the way to Beirut. He voiced concern at "the magnitude of human suffering and physical destruction in Lebanon."</p>
        <p>After a trip to Lebanon and Israel in that year, he said Prime Minister Menachem Begin's approach to the Palestinian question was "nothing more than a charade."</p>
