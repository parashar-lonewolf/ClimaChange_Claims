        <p>Satellite images show that heavy pollution from Kuwait's burning oil wells is extending for hundreds of miles to the north and east of the sabotaged fields, and scientists say they have found traces of the soot throughout the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>The enormous volume of gases and soot particles shooting into the air from hundreds of fires has caused acid rain in a region stretching from Bulgaria to Afghanistan and Pakistan, European weather specialists say.</p>
        <p>But after watching the smoke and dirty clouds for three weeks, specialists have concluded that the pollution will inflict most of its damage in a 500-mile range, mostly above Iran and Iraq. Despite warnings of worldwide consequences, atmospheric specialists said the pollution was not likely to have a serious impact on the global climate.</p>
        <p>In recent days, experts from the United States, Britain and Germany have tracked the pollution more closely. Some are flying through the plumes in a specially equipped British Government plane to collect samples. Others are tracking the black clouds through satellite pictures and weather charts. Visible for 700 Miles</p>
        <p>"We can see the smoke as it travels up to a distance of 700 miles," said Dr. Keith Browning at the British Meteorological Office in Bracknell, England. "After that it becomes too diffuse to be detected by the satellite, though it still exists."</p>
        <p>The worst part of the smog blanket, he said, hovers over Kuwait, Iraq and Iran and then spreads north, south or west, depending on the winds. Yet even if the satellite sees the plume as faint, he said, there is enough pollution in the clouds to cause acid rain up to 1,200 miles away. Of deep concern, specialists say, is finding out how much smog people in the region are breathing.</p>
        <p>"This is the dirtiest burn you can imagine," said Dr. Klaus Hasselmann, director of the Max Planck Institute of Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, where a team has studied the effects of the soot in the atmosphere. "There is very little oxygen and we reckon that some 10 percent of the total emissions are being converted into soot.  Acid-Bearing Clouds</p>
        <p>The latest weather charts of the British Meteorological Office showed that soot- and acid-bearing clouds had rained on Turkey and reached the western shore of the Black Sea, touching Bulgaria, Rumania and the southern Soviet Union. Dr. Browning said there were patches over Saudi Arabia. But he said that most of the polluted clouds had been wafted over parts of Iraq and all of Iran and that they were becoming more prevalent over Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Specialists said they worried most about the black rain falling in the region beyond Kuwait and the deserts, where forests and fields begin. If millions of tons of oil and gas burn for one to two years in Kuwait, as feared, they said, the fallout and the rise in acidity can affect forests and food crops.</p>
        <p>"These emissions coming off Kuwait are unlike anything we have ever seen," said Paul Crutzen, a Dutch meteorologist who drew attention to the impact of tropical forest fires on the atmosphere and on the greenhouse effect. "I think so far we have too little information, but we know enough to know that there is cause for concern."</p>
