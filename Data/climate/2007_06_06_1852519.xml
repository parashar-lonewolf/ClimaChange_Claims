        <p>President Bush delivered a two-pronged message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday, two days before their scheduled meeting in Germany, chiding Mr. Putin for derailing democratic reforms while assuring the Russian leader that he had nothing to fear from a missile defense system in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush issued the human rights rebuke on the first day of an eight-day swing through Europe, in a venue laden with symbolism: a conference on democracy co-led by the former Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky. Democracy advocates and dissidents from 17 countries had gathered in Czernin Palace, in the very room where the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was dissolved, to hear Mr. Bush speak.</p>
        <p>After a lengthy discourse on freedom as a ''moral imperative,'' in which he chronicled human rights abuses around the globe, from Myanmar to North Korea to Sudan, Mr. Bush turned his attention to Russia and China, linking them as countries whose relationships with the United States, he said, were strong, but also complex.</p>
        <p>''China's leaders believe that they can continue to open the nation's economy without opening its political system; we disagree,'' Mr. Bush said. ''In Russia, reforms that were once promised to empower citizens have been derailed, with troubling implications for democratic development.''</p>
        <p>It was a more negative assessment than Mr. Bush has made in the past, and in likening Russia to China Mr. Bush risked arousing Mr. Putin's ire.</p>
        <p>The comparison to China was ''a pretty significant step at the rhetorical level for the Bush administration,'' said Andrew Kuchins, the director of the Russia Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>
        <p>That was especially the case because the criticism came out of the mouth of Mr. Bush, rather than another member of his administration. Last year, when Mr. Bush met with critics of the Kremlin, he told them that he had concerns about the state of democracy in Russia but would not lecture Mr. Putin about them publicly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin is already up in arms over the president's plan to build a network of radar and missile defenses in Poland and here in the Czech Republic, though Mr. Bush said Tuesday that Mr. Putin need not view the proposal as a threat.</p>
        <p>''My message will be, Vladimir -- I call him Vladimir -- that you shouldn't fear a missile defense system,'' Mr. Bush said during a morning appearance with the leaders of the Czech Republic at Prague Castle, high on a hill overlooking the city. ''As a matter of fact, why don't you cooperate with us on a missile defense system? Why don't you participate with the United States?''</p>
        <p>Reaction from the Kremlin was muted. Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Putin ''has always appreciated the openness of President Bush,'' though he added, ''Of course, we cannot agree with some of the things that were said.''</p>
        <p>The back-to-back speeches were orchestrated by the White House with the intent of sending a measured, but firm, message to Mr. Putin when American-Russian relations are at their lowest point in years. Mr. Bush has often spoken of the need to promote democracy, and by sounding that theme before an especially receptive crowd, the speech also offered the president a rare escape from criticism over his policies in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''The most powerful weapon in the struggle against extremism is not bullets or bombs -- it is the universal appeal of freedom,'' Mr. Bush said, speaking to an audience that included Vaclav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, and Cheol Hwan-kang, the author of ''The Aquariums of Pyongyang,'' an account of 10 years he had spent as a child in a North Korean concentration camp.</p>
        <p>''Freedom is the design of our maker, and the longing of every soul,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''Freedom is the best way to unleash the creativity and economic potential of a nation. Freedom is the only ordering of a society that leads to justice. And human freedom is the only way to achieve human rights.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, the speeches may have also been part of the White House strategy to have Mr. Bush clear the air with Mr. Putin in advance of Thursday's meeting between the two leaders at the gathering of the Group of 8 industrialized nations, in the Baltic seaside resort town of Heiligendamm, Germany.</p>
        <p>The two leaders are expected to confront disagreements over Kosovo, as well as human rights and missile defense, although they may find common ground over curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Mr. Bush has also invited Mr. Putin to the Bush family compound in Maine early next month -- an unusual effort by the White House to mend fences with the Russian leader. Kennebunkport is the home of Mr. Bush's parents, and no foreign leader has received an invitation to visit since Mr. Bush's father was in office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's approach, however, drew criticism from two Russian opposition leaders: Andrei Illarianov, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington and Mr. Putin's former economics adviser; and Garry Kasparov, the onetime chess champion who heads the United Civil Front, a political party devoted to promoting democratic freedoms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Illarianov warned that the West ''does not have a widely accepted and effective strategy'' for dealing with Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasparov, who is widely regarded as a potential presidential candidate in Russia, warned ''If Bush hopes to gain anything by having private discussions with Putin, he's wrong. Putin thrives in an atmosphere of secrecy. He's a K.G.B. spy -- anything behind closed doors gives him an advantage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasparov said that he wished Mr. Bush would echo the much sharper criticism of Russia put forth by David Kramer, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Asian affairs, who delivered a blistering assessment of the Kremlin's human rights record in a speech last week in Baltimore. ''These are the things that must be pronounced by George W. Bush,'' Mr. Kasparov said.</p>
        <p>But the White House has said it wants to tamp down the vocal sparring between the nations. Mr. Putin has been jabbing at the Bush administration for weeks; he made a veiled comparison of the United States to the Third Reich, complained of ''diktat and imperialism,'' and warned he would have no choice but to point Russia's own missiles at Europe if the United States followed through with the missile defense system.</p>
        <p>The remarks, in an interview published Monday, instantly evoked memories of the cold war, and Mr. Putin did little to discourage that comparison, saying, ''We are, of course, returning to those times.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush, standing alongside President Vaclav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic, pointedly dismissed any talk of a return to those hair-trigger days. The Czech leaders both support the missile plan, and a vote in Parliament is expected this year.</p>
        <p>''The cold war is over,'' the president declared. ''It ended. The people of the Czech Republic don't have to choose between being a friend of the United States and a friend of Russia. You can be both.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush left Prague on Tuesday evening for Heiligendamm, where he is to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Wednesday to discuss the major agenda topic of the Group of 8 meeting: climate change. After the meeting, Mr. Bush plans a side trip to Poland -- a move that will effectively bookend Thursday's Bush-Putin meeting with presidential trips to both nations that figure into the missile defense plan.</p>
