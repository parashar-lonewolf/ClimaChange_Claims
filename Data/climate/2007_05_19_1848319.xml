        <p>Consider the pros and cons for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton:</p>
        <p>Former President Bill Clinton is speaking today in the presidential swing state of New Hampshire, but he is not speaking on her behalf; he is speaking with a Republican. And not just any Republican: Former President George Bush, the father of the man whom Mrs. Clinton routinely criticizes on the campaign trail as an incompetent and disastrous leader.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the first President Bush, both Clintons appear to have a soft spot, and the feeling seems mutual. Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton have come to consider each other to be practically family, people close to them say, spending time together golfing, boating and kibitzing about foreign policy. And Mr. Bush is fond of Mrs. Clinton, his friends say: Not only does he like strong women, but he enjoys her sarcastic sense of humor, her quick way with a zinger and her shared interest in the nitty-gritty of international affairs.</p>
        <p>Now that Mrs. Clinton is running for the White House, those ties are being tested as she stands to benefit politically from her husband's friendship with Mr. Bush. Will they wink at the presidential race when the two men appear today at a commencement in New Hampshire, home of the nation's first primary? After the two speak at the Billy Graham Library later this month, will the Clinton brand seem a tad less liberal?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton would not mind sprinkling some of that uniter-not-divider fairy dust on her candidacy, especially as she runs for the Democratic presidential nomination against Senator Barack Obama, who is presenting himself as unity personified. And the association with Mr. Bush only feeds Mr. Clinton's aura as a fellow elder statesman, a role that fits into the Clinton campaign's construct of him as a potential first spouse who would have a narrow portfolio of foreign policy troubleshooting.</p>
        <p>And yet: Some Democrats scowl at the scenario of unbroken Bush-Clinton-Bush-Clinton administrations. Does the duo's friendship further intertwine these two dynastic families in a way that could hurt Mrs. Clinton, who is already viewed by some Democrats as too friendly with Republicans?</p>
        <p>And if Mr. Bush, even inadvertently, helps inoculate his friend (and his friend's wife) from political attacks, what will that do to his standing among Republicans -- including his own son, whose legacy might fall into the hands of a Clinton?</p>
        <p>One thing is reasonably clear, people close to the two former presidents say: Both men want the relationship to continue as is, despite the complications of an intensifying campaign. And at this point, political analysts say, it seems likely that the friendship will help Mrs. Clinton more than hurt her because it mostly burnishes the family name. (Indeed, one Clinton adviser said the two former presidents appearing together in independent-minded New Hampshire was ''political gold'' for Mrs. Clinton.)</p>
        <p>''Many people feel the current President Bush and the Democrats haven't done a good job reaching out and working together,'' said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. ''The Bush-Clinton friendship is like a fresh wind blowing in on her campaign.''</p>
        <p>Democrats close to the Clintons say the relationship would become a headache for Mrs. Clinton only if it started looking political -- such as if the two men cooled it off because the Clintons, or Mr. Bush, decided it was somehow problematic for the two men to be so friendly in an election year.</p>
        <p>Republicans close to Mr. Bush say it would not be his style to tamp down a friendship because of political calculation, noting that he is far too loyal a man than that. Yet any downside to the friendship is somewhat more conceivable on the Republican end. Beyond possibly helping Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Bush could be seen as cleansing Mr. Clinton's reputation as a partisan and enhancing his legacy -- and, perhaps unhelpfully, prompting some Americans to contrast that legacy with Mr. Bush's own son's.</p>
        <p>Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential historian, who has talked with Mr. Bush about the friendship before, said he would not fuss about its political connotations. Ms. Goodwin said Mr. Bush told her he liked Mr. Clinton's ''energy, his vitality, his humor.''</p>
        <p>''You get the sense that he thinks of President Clinton as family,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I think that's all positive for Hillary, but the question is, Do Republicans feel the friendship takes away some of the animus they want to project toward Clinton and the memory of Clinton?'' Ms. Goodwin said. ''And you have to wonder, if Mrs. Clinton had been running against the current President Bush, or if Jeb Bush were running for president, where would this friendship be?''</p>
        <p>Jay Carson, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said he expected that any dynasty image problem would be a nonissue for most Democrats in the primaries.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, for his part, said in a brief interview last week that his relationship with Bush pÃ¨re was ''doing great,'' and he seemed unfazed by the enduring friendship even as he concentrated increasingly on advising his wife.</p>
        <p>''I hope I'm going to get to go back to Maine and play golf with him this summer,'' Mr. Clinton said in an interview that was mostly devoted to his foundation's efforts to combat climate change.</p>
        <p>''We do quite a few things together,'' he said. ''We were down in Florida together not very long ago at a big ol' high-tech conference. They were making fun of me because Bush is 20 years older than I am and likes all that. He uses a BlackBerry more than I do.''</p>
        <p>Jean Becker, the chief of staff to former President Bush, agreed that the two men continued to enjoy their friendship, noting that they recently traveled to Moscow together as the American delegation for Boris Yeltsin's funeral. As for whether Mrs. Clinton's political needs would somehow upend the friendship, Ms. Becker seemed unconcerned.</p>
        <p>''I'll let the pundocracy figure that out,'' she said. ''But President Bush and President Clinton's relationship transcends politics. After all, President Clinton is the one who defeated President Bush in 1992, so it transcended politics.''</p>
        <p>By all accounts the friendship between 41 and 42, as the men are called based on the order of their presidencies, is nothing other than warm and casual.</p>
        <p>President Clinton sometimes tells a story about when President Bush, finding himself in New York, dropped by Mr. Clinton's offices in Harlem to say hello. Finding Mr. Clinton away, Mr. Bush swept into Mr. Clinton's office and admired the majestic views of Central Park. Then Mr. Bush called Mr. Clinton and said, ''Bill? It's George. Nice view!''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Clinton signaled, they have joked about health and age, be it Mr. Clinton's heart surgery or Mr. Bush's penchant for sky-diving. Mr. Clinton often travels overseas for his charitable foundation, and people close to both men say that Mr. Bush loves picking up the latest chatter on global affairs from his friend, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Indeed, their conversations as former presidents are sometimes richer and more detailed than Mr. Bush's banter with the current President Bush, these confidants say, because the president is cautious about sharing information with those outside his White House inner circle.</p>
        <p>Presidential historians find few forerunners to the Bush-Clinton coupling. Several historians said the only real -- if imperfect -- comparison is with John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, onetime allies who fell out after Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800; Adams withdrew, bitter and shocked, but the men reconciled years later and began a celebrated correspondence.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that anyone expects a Bush to say too many nice things about a Clinton during the presidential race. Mr. Bush's wife, Barbara, for instance, had notably little to say about Mrs. Clinton in her autobiography.</p>
        <p>Yet some political observers say that the warm ties could help Mrs. Clinton blunt Mr. Obama's message denouncing partisanship. And it might soften her image a bit, too.</p>
        <p>''The knock on Hillary is that she is combative and divisive, that she is not as unifying a force as Obama,'' said Robert Dallek, a presidential historian. ''Unity is Obama's theme. Hillary needs all the help she can get in that regard.''</p>
