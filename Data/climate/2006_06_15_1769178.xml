        <p>Investors worried about the possible financial fallout from greenhouse gas emissions have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to require that companies disclose their financial vulnerability to changes in climate.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a group of 27 investors who collectively manage more than $1 trillion in assets sent a letter to the S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, asking that financial risks linked to climate change issues be included as part of routine corporate financial reports.</p>
        <p>The letter, whose signers included several state officials, including the New York Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, defines risk broadly.</p>
        <p>''Investors have a right to know if a company's buildings are in the path of hurricanes that might be exacerbated by climate change, or if it will face high costs when greenhouse gas emissions are regulated,'' said James Coburn, a policy adviser at Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental groups that sent the letter. ''They need that information to reduce their portfolio risk.''</p>
        <p>Just as important, Mr. Coburn said, companies that are forced to quantify and disclose their vulnerabilities are far more likely to address them. ''What is measured is managed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coburn said Ceres faxed the letter to Mr. Cox, and sent e-mail copies to several staff members. It has also mailed copies to the chairman and commissioners.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the S.E.C., John Heine, said the agency had no comment at this time.</p>
