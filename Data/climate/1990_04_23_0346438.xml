        <p>LEAD: Rising public concern about the environment looms like smog across the Republican Party's political horizon.</p>
        <p>Rising public concern about the environment looms like smog across the Republican Party's political horizon.</p>
        <p>The Earth Day celebration was a case in point. Democrats treated it as if it were their own organizing rally, while Republicans, showing how worried they are by the issue, worked to insulate themselves from a public perception that they are less environmentally committed.</p>
        <p>Vice President Dan Quayle, who was here on Friday for a party gathering, accused the Democrats of trying to politicize the environment, which is what a politician says when he knows it would be bad for his side if the other side succeeded in making an issue out of something.</p>
        <p>Having to Work Harder</p>
        <p>The Democrats sought to profit over the weekend from what many poll takers say is a general belief that their party handles environmental issues better than Republicans. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran television commercials around the country proclaiming the party an aggressive protector of the environment and saying that on issues like the handling of nuclear waste and the Exxon Valdez oil spill ''the Republicans waited.''</p>
        <p>Some Republicans are still able to position themselves favorably on environmental issues. But even the most environmentally conscious Republicans acknowledge that they must work harder than Democrats to establish environmental credentials, just as Democrats must work harder to establish credentials as being tough on crime or spending.</p>
        <p>For most of the last two decades Republicans have benefited from an agenda of public concerns on which they were better positioned than Democrats, either by basic ideological leaning or through faster footwork. These central concerns included crime, military strength and taxes.</p>
        <p>But now everything in America, from fashion to politics (which often follow the same drummer anyway) is going green. There has been an impression that every politician is embracing the environment and that therefore it will be neutralized as a partisan issue.</p>
        <p>Conceding the Advantage</p>
        <p>But that is not what many political insiders think. Democrats are convinced that this heightened environmental concern will work substantially to their advantage in the 1990's, and some prominent Republican analysts agree.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. environmental tide is dividing rather than bolstering the Republican political coalition,'' said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political expert, who was among the first to recognize the Republican Presidential majority that was emerging out of the schisms of the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips's thesis is that environmental concerns drive a wedge between Republican supporters. The issue could divide corporate leaders, who are concerned that tighter environmental regulation will damage their businesses, from voters in middle-class suburbs, who have been a mainstay of Republican victories and are now among the people most concerned about environmental threats.</p>
        <p>While voters are generally skeptical about politicians' doing anything to improve the environment, they also make it clear they have greater faith that the Democrats will do something.</p>
        <p>Asked to choose between Republicans and Democrats for doing a better job of protecting the environment, 55 percent picked the Democrats and 36 percent chose the Republicans, according to a Harris poll in February.</p>
        <p>By contrast, 64 percent said Republicans would do better negotiating with the Russians, and 54 percent picked Republicans to keep the economy prosperous. The margin of sampling error in the telephone poll of 1,250 people was plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The heart of the problem for Republicans is that the environment is not just another issue. It has become ''a modern secular religion,'' said Martin Levin, a political scientist at Brandeis University.</p>
        <p>A Changing Cultural Tide</p>
        <p>Democrats are hoping, and Republicans are fearing, that rising environmental concern is a central part of a larger shift in the political playing field that will make crucial middle-class voters feel more comfortable again with Democrats.</p>
        <p>Politics in America is often driven as much by cultural differences as by more obvious battles. And nothing so clearly indicates the nation's cultural change in the last two decades as Earth Day.</p>
        <p>In 1970, the first Earth Day was a liberal exercise. Former Senator Gaylord Nelson, Democrat of Wisconsin, an organizer of the first event, said he got the idea from the teach-ins against the Vietnam War. The point is that Earth Day then was clearly on one side of the cultural schism that divided the country.</p>
        <p>But Earth Day 1990 was a mainstream event. ''We love it,'' said Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic Party. ''On this one, the more you know, the better off we are.''</p>
        <p>Bush Makes an Effort</p>
        <p>Many Republicans, in particular the poll taker Robert Teeter, have been warning the party for several years that it needs to shed its image as an enemy of the environment.</p>
        <p>President Bush began that effort in his 1988 Presidential campaign. In office, he has negotiated with Congress for the first revision of the Clean Air Act in a decade.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats hope they can politicize the environmental issue to their advantage,'' Mr. Quayle told a meeting of state Republican leaders here. ''They've seen all the other issues slip away. They've lost the peace issue. They've lost the education issue. They never had the tax issue. Drugs and crime has always been our issue. So they're grasping onto the environmental issue. But they're not going to get very far on that for one very fundamental reason.''</p>
        <p>That reason, Mr. Quayle said, is that President Bush has been pushing clean air legislation and will be the one to sign it.</p>
        <p>That is true. But the political stress Mr. Phillips warned about was apparent several days ago as Mr. Bush, at an international conference he had convened on global warming, was forced to explain that his Administration's desire for more scientific research was not meant as an alternative to action.</p>
        <p>Facing Skepticism</p>
        <p>Of course environmental concerns do not guarantee a Democrat victory. Voters select candidates, not parties, and individual Republicans will succeed in defining themselves as pro-environment.</p>
        <p>Here in Southern California, Republicans have a candidate they hope can be a prototype for their future. Senator Pete Wilson, running for governor, is using a television commercial in which he claims to have been concerned about growth and offshore drilling even before there was an environmental movement.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wilson must contend with a skepticism toward Republicans that was illustrated by a front-page headline in The San Diego Tribune on Saturday: ''Bush Delaying on Oil Drilling to Aid Wilson?'' The article quoted environmentalists and local political leaders as suggesting that the President was helping Mr. Wilson by delaying a decision to lease ocean tracts off California for oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Other issues continue to matter, of course. While Americans tell poll takers that they are willing to make economic sacrifices for a better environment, Mr. Quayle said they still placed a higher priority on jobs.</p>
        <p>Republicans seeking to play down the importance of the environment as a voting issue note that Gov. George Deukmejian was re-elected in 1986 even though he supported offshore drilling and opposed a ballot proposition on the dumping of toxic wastes.</p>
        <p>But another Republican on the California ballot that year without the benefit of incumbency, Ed Zschau, lost because he opposed the proposition on toxic dumping, said Mervin Field, California's most prominent poll taker. Mr. Zschau challenged Senator Alan Cranston, a leading advocate of the initative, which set new limits on the release of toxic chemicals in farming or manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zschau, a moderate, opposed the resolution, saying it was well-intentioned but would cost jobs. The proposition won overwhelmingly, while Mr. Cranston won narrowly over Mr. Zschau. Mr. Field said he was convinced Mr. Zschau would have beaten Mr. Cranston if he had supported the initiative.</p>
