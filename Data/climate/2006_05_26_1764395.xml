        <p>Making good on a vow that New York would act on its own if the federal government did not get tough on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday proposed one of the most stringent mercury standards in the nation.</p>
        <p>Under the draft proposal, New York would cut the level of mercury from electricity-generating stations in half by 2010. By 2015, the new state mercury standard would be toughened further, requiring a 90 percent reduction from current levels.</p>
        <p>The state rule would be significantly more restrictive than a federal mercury standard set last year by the Bush administration. Under the federal rule, power plants must decrease mercury emissions 70 percent by 2018. Another major difference is that the federal plan allows generators to trade pollution credits, while New York's does not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has repeatedly disagreed with the Bush administration's environmental policies, and although he has said he would oppose regulations that could harm business in the state, he has been willing to push through tough environmental rules that have sometimes angered business interests.</p>
        <p>If the state's new mercury rule is carried out, it would complete a far-ranging and comprehensive set of controls over the four most damaging air pollutants from power plants. A 2003 state program curtails nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, which cause acid rain. Late last year, seeing the federal inaction on global warming, New York and six other northeastern states joined together to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the heat-trapping gases that contribute to climate change.</p>
        <p>''By adopting these new standards, all coal-fired power plants in the state would be required to use pollution-control technologies to significantly reduce their mercury emissions,'' Mr. Pataki said in a statement released by his office yesterday.</p>
        <p>But forcing eight of the state's coal-burning power plants -- many of them in the western part of the state -- to install effective pollution control technologies will push up the already high cost of energy in New York. (Four other coal-fired plants currently have some of these technologies.) Mr. Pataki's office estimates that installing the scrubbers, particle filters and other equipment necessary for the plants to meet the new standards would add less than a dollar a month to an average residential electricity bill.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the power industry in the state said, however, that those calculations are inaccurate and the true cost to residential and industrial consumers is likely to be far higher than a dollar a month, though they did not give their own estimate.</p>
        <p>Gavin J. Donohue, president and chief executive of the Independent Power Producers of New York said the draft mercury rules could drive energy prices up so high that New York's efforts to attract and retain industry would be hampered.</p>
        <p>He criticized the governor's proposal for not allowing the trading of pollution credits, and he said the schedule for reductions is so aggressive that it could force power companies to simply shut down a coal-fired plant rather than pay to upgrade it.</p>
        <p>''If you just go ahead and close a plant, what does this do to the grid from a reliability standpoint?'' Mr. Donohue said.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, even those who had criticized Mr. Pataki for his reluctance to include mercury controls in a package of power plant rules adopted in 2003, welcomed yesterday's announcement.</p>
        <p>''This is the proper mechanism to regulate a neurotoxin such as mercury,'' said Jason K. Babbie, an environmental analyst with the New York Public Interest Research Group. He supports the proposed rules, but said the timetable for reductions should be accelerated and brought more in line with other states.</p>
        <p>Katherine Kennedy, director of the Northeast Energy Project for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that eight other states -- including Connecticut and New Jersey -- have already moved to adopt mercury controls, and several of them cut deeper and move more quickly than the rules proposed by New York. But she said attempts to control mercury emissions by even a single state are important because mercury, unlike other air pollutants, tends to settle fairly quickly, and can be most dangerous in areas not far from the power plants that release them.</p>
        <p>Mercury is contained naturally in coal, and is released into the atmosphere when the coal is burned. Some forms of mercury then fall from the sky relatively quickly and settle on water and land. Microrganisms in the water convert it to a toxin called methylmercury that is harmful to humans.</p>
        <p>Once in the water, the mercury is absorbed by small organisms and worms. It builds up as the worms are eaten by small fish, which are then eaten by larger fish, in a process known as bio-magnification. Because fish from polluted lakes can contain harmful levels of mercury, restrictions have been imposed on eating fish from most New York lakes.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the national plan for trading pollution credits believe it is an effective but less costly approach than outright limits. But Ms. Kennedy said such an approach can create hot spots that pose a grave danger to local residents.</p>
