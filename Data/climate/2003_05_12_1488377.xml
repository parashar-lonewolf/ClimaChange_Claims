        <p>Editorial says bill now awaiting action on Senate floor shows no more enlightenment on subject of energy than House measure; says except for $30 billion subsidy for nuclear power, bill would do next to nothing to address problem of global warming; says bill does provide $7.2 billion in various tax incentives for renewable fuels like wind and solar power, but that without significant change, this bill is not worth passing</p>

        <p>The Senate is showing no more enlightenment on the subject of energy than the House. Except for a few modest incentives for energy efficiency, a bill now awaiting action on the Senate floor would do next to nothing to ease America's dependence on foreign oil. Apart from making an expensive and chancy bet on nuclear power, it would do next to nothing to address the problem of global warming. All in all, this bill represents a serious failure of Congressional leadership, aided and abetted by an administration that had asked for little in the way of imaginative ideas and is getting even less.</p>
        <p>The energy bill is in fact two measures, a subsidy bill and a tax relief bill, which will be joined on the Senate floor and can thus be treated as one. Like a House version approved last month, the bill is essentially a compendium of tired ideas favoring the coal, oil and and gas industries, including one or two ideas the House hadn't thought of -- notably a provision that would authorize oil and gas exploration in coastal waters that have been faithfully protected since the first Bush administration.</p>

        <p>The Senate is showing no more enlightenment on the subject of energy than the House. Except for a few modest incentives for energy efficiency, a bill now awaiting action on the Senate floor would do next to nothing to ease America's dependence on foreign oil. Apart from making an expensive and chancy bet on nuclear power, it would do next to nothing to address the problem of global warming. All in all, this bill represents a serious failure of Congressional leadership, aided and abetted by an administration that had asked for little in the way of imaginative ideas and is getting even less.</p>
        <p>The energy bill is in fact two measures, a subsidy bill and a tax relief bill, which will be joined on the Senate floor and can thus be treated as one. Like a House version approved last month, the bill is essentially a compendium of tired ideas favoring the coal, oil and and gas industries, including one or two ideas the House hadn't thought of -- notably a provision that would authorize oil and gas exploration in coastal waters that have been faithfully protected since the first Bush administration.</p>
        <p>The biggest addition to this dreary lineup is a huge $30 billion subsidy for nuclear power, a favorite of the new chairman of the Senate energy committee, Pete Domenici of New Mexico. For many reasons, not least the fact that nuclear energy is economically uncompetitive with most other forms of power, the nuclear industry has not licensed and built a new plant for nearly 30 years. Mr. Domenici seeks to jump-start a new generation of plants with federal guarantees that even his pro-nuclear allies regard as excessively generous.</p>
        <p>On the plus side, the bill provides $7.2 billion in various tax incentives for energy efficiency, for renewable fuels like wind and solar power and for research into President Bush's proposed hydrogen-powered fuel-cell car. But these are baby steps, which will do little to diversify the nation's energy base and are dwarfed by the bill's failure to require improvements in automobile fuel economy -- the quickest and surest way to ease America's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>This failure is all the more glaring in view of a new report from the Environmental Protection Agency showing that the average fuel economy of the nation's cars and trucks dropped in 2002 to its lowest level in 22 years, largely because of increasing sales of sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans. The automakers continue to argue that consumers want the bigger vehicles, and that the companies' economic survival depends on them. But it seems to us that neither the American manufacturers nor, for that matter, the Japanese are making much of an effort to market more efficient vehicles. The engineering leaps of the last two decades have produced much in the way of power and acceleration, little in terms of better mileage.</p>
        <p>Various senators will try to improve this bill on the floor. John McCain and Joseph Lieberman will offer their bold plan to limit emissions of global warming gases and to establish a market-based system for helping industry reduce these emissions at the lowest possible cost. Max Baucus will try to protect parts of the Northern Rockies from the administration's headlong efforts to open up fragile wilderness to oil and gas exploration. James Jeffords will push for much more investment in renewable energy sources. One can only wish them well. Without significant change, this bill is not worth passing.</p>
