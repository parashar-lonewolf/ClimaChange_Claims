        <p>DuPont, Shell, Alcan Aluminium and four other large companies yesterday joined a growing list of businesses committing themselves to substantial voluntary reductions in releases of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The companies said they would seek the cuts in a partnership with Environmental Defense, a private environmental group, which would give technical advice and publish audited inventories of the companies' emissions of the gases, which scientists say appear to be contributing to a potentially harmful global warming trend.</p>
        <p>If the cuts are achieved, by 2010 the companies' annual emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would be 15 percent below levels measured in 1990. The total amount would be 90 million tons a year, said Fred Krupp, the executive director of Environmental Defense.</p>
        <p>''These are companies, unlike others, that are committing to hard caps on their total emissions all over the world,'' Mr. Krupp said yesterday. ''They don't have to, yet they're making a commitment to slim down and keep the weight off.''</p>
        <p>The moves, company representatives and environmentalists said, represent a spreading awareness in industry that emissions of greenhouse gases are eventually going to be restricted under an international climate treaty or by regulations in individual countries, with Europe, particularly, already moving toward requiring reductions in the gases.</p>
        <p>The other companies that pledged to cuts under agreements with Environmental Defense were BP, formerly known as BP Amoco, which had already been actively cutting its emissions; Suncor Energy, a Canadian company; Pechiney, a French aluminum manufacturer; and Ontario Power Generation.</p>
        <p>Some environmental groups not involved in the effort pointed out that not all the companies' motives were purely focused on staving off climate change. Some of the cuts were being made in any case, the groups said, as companies focused on increasing profits by cutting wasteful use of energy and releases of chemicals.</p>
        <p>Even so, the commitment to cut represents a significant shift, said Philip E. Clapp, the president of the National Environmental Trust, a private Washington group that has been lobbying for an international climate treaty.</p>
        <p>''In reality,'' he said, ''what they're doing is making the appropriate management decision that it makes sense to start incorporating these reductions into their costs now rather than having to do them suddenly when there's a treaty in force and a law in place.''</p>
        <p>The companies are hoping that they will be able to get credit for the reductions under planned trading arrangements allowing businesses that cut emissions beyond targets to sell credits to others that cannot make similar cuts as cheaply.</p>
        <p>The program constitutes a small-scale version of such a trading system, participants said. Besides setting goals for the seven companies, the agreement allows them to buy and sell credits gained for making cuts beyond their targets.</p>
        <p>Next month, delegates from more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet at The Hague to try to negotiate the final details of the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty that was signed in 1997 by more than 100 countries but has not yet been ratified by any large industrial country. The treaty would commit industrial countries between 2008 and 2012 to cut their combined greenhouse gas emissions to 5 percent below 1990 levels.</p>
        <p>Even if the treaty takes years to go into effect, the momentum toward controlling heat-trapping gases is clear, representatives of many of the participating companies said.</p>
        <p>''It's clear that the governments of the world have voiced their concern over climate change and their intent to intervene,'' said Thomas Jacob, the manager of international and industry affairs for DuPont, which has already cut greenhouse emissions 50 percent below 1990 levels and pledged yesterday to reach 65 percent below that level by 2010.</p>
        <p>Companies that act now will tend to have advantages over those that wait by getting a head start on devising ways to cut energy use -- and thus carbon dioxide emissions -- or to change manufacturing methods to eliminate releases of other greenhouse gases, Mr. Jacob said.</p>
        <p>For example, DuPont has found ways to end emissions of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, that once flowed from its process for making adipic acid, an ingredient in nylon.</p>
        <p>The aluminum companies in the group are focusing not only on energy savings, but also on eliminating another powerful greenhouse gas, perfluorocarbons, by changing the smelting process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacob added that companies that want to be perceived as environmentally responsible have to take climate change seriously. ''The growing weight of scientific evidence indicates that there is cause for concern and our bias should be in the direction of prudent action,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Under an unrelated agreement with a pair of private environmental groups, Polaroid announced last week that by 2010 it would cut its emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, by 25 percent below the amount it released in 1994.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Johnson &amp; Johnson and I.B.M. entered similar commitments with the groups, the World Wildlife Fund and the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions, a private group trying to promote energy efficiency. These commitments would bring the companies' emissions a decade from now well below levels they were at a decade ago.</p>
        <p>The voluntary move to cut greenhouse-gas emissions is particularly noteworthy, some environmental experts said, because it comes even though the companies have no guarantee that they will get credit for cuts they make now under future regulations or in future systems set up to allow trading of credits given to companies that reduce their output of gases below required levels.</p>
        <p>Last year, Congress considered several bills that would have granted early credit for cuts in greenhouse gases, but the legislation lost support from both industry and environmental groups and faded away.</p>
        <p>In essence, DuPont, Alcan and the others are taking a gamble, with the understanding that they may be better able to influence any impending regulations by helping devise some of the techniques for achieving cuts in the gases.</p>
        <p>''Many companies figured out in the 1990's that when an environmental issue reaches a certain level of public consciousness and seriousness, it's better to be proactive than reactive,'' said Joseph J. Romm, who once headed the Department of Energy's energy efficiency and renewable energy program and is now executive director of the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions.</p>
