        <p>Environmentalists in New York State and Quebec are trying to block renewal of a contract in which Consolidated Edison buys hydroelectricity from Quebec every summer, saying the deal helps finance dams that are destroying how Indians around James Bay live.</p>
        <p>The environmentalists have proposed that instead of renewing the 15-year-old contract, New York should help Quebec use its electricity more efficiently. By doing so, they argue, New York would be able to buy the power saved and Hydro-Quebec, the utility owned by the Quebec government, would not have to build more dams.</p>
        <p>But Hydro-Quebec, which is selling the power to New York, disputes the idea that the sales contracts have much relevance to its plans to build the dams in the sub-Arctic, hundreds of miles north of Montreal.</p>
        <p>At the same time, company officials insist that the utility is already doing all it can to improve efficiency and is expected to spend $3 billion (Canadian) for energy efficiency programs over this decade.</p>
        <p>"It's kind of cynical for someone consuming more energy to say there's something wrong here," Jacques Guevremont, a Hydro-Quebec official who has negotiated several purchase and sale contracts, said of environmentalists in New York. Lawsuit Is Filed</p>
        <p>In another effort to block the sale of the power, a suit was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in New York City, challenging the legality of the New York Power Authority's agreement with Quebec. The suit was filed by two New York Congressmen, the Grand Council of the Cree Indians, individual citizens of New York and Vermont and several citizens' groups. The Congressmen, Maurice D. Hinchey, Democrat of upstate New York, and Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan, argue that the contract violates Article 1 of the Constitution, which forbids agreements between states and foreign governments unless authorized by Congress.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the dispute are the lands that the Inuits and the Cree Indians have hunted and fished for thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say that the hunting land in the James Bay area would eventually be flooded after new dams are built while fish would be tainted by mercury bleeding into the area from rocks in the area of the dam.</p>
        <p>They also say that the wholesale price of electricity has fallen and demand has dropped, creating less of a need for the new dams. The environmentalists won a battle last year when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo rejected a deal that would have allowed New York to buy 1,000 megawatts of new electricity year-round from Hydro-Quebec. 'No Time for the Land to Heal'</p>
        <p>Matthew Coon-Come, Grand Chief of the Cree, pleaded his case last week at a news conference at the Natural Resources Defense Council headquarters in New York. "We have no time to adapt, we have no time for the land to heal," he said. "There's no way they'd be allowed to build a project of this magnitude down south."</p>
        <p>Ashokh Guptah, an energy expert on the resources council, said New York could better help Quebec by encouraging greater efficiency there, which would allow for a "conservation transfer."</p>
        <p>Energy efficiency programs are in place in many states, including New York, to cut the need for new construction, but the money is generally spent in that state.</p>
        <p>Because electricity costs three times as much in New York as in Montreal, Mr. Guptah said, New York can afford to spend far more on conservation. New York could then buy the saved energy from Hydro-Quebec, which would not have to build the dams and risk damaging the environment. Environmental Studies Begun</p>
        <p>But officials at Hydro-Quebec said the dams will not cause substantial damage. The utility, which has offered various benefits to the Indians including cash, public works programs and some jobs, has begun a variety of environmental studies.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the New York Power Authority, which would buy 800 megawatts and sell 20 to Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, with the rest going to Con Edison, has asserted that the contract was economical and would cut air pollution in this country by reducing the need to burn fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Stephen Shoenholz, a spokesman for the authority, said that the price to Con Ed could fall to 4.3 cents a kilowatt-hour. Con Ed's other sources of power range substantially in price. It sells electricity to homeowners for nearly 14 cents a kilowatt-hour in summer.</p>
        <p>The existing 15-year-old contract expires in 1998, and the renewal would pick up the next year and run through 2018. While the terms of the renewal have already been negotiated, the contract has an escape clause that allows either side to cancel between November of this year and November of 1994 if all the necessary regulatory approvals cannot be obtained.</p>
