        <p>It has been so hot and dry this summer that even the weeds are dying. Buckhorn plantain, a bane to lawn-lovers, is shriveling up in the straw-colored grass at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>"It's so dry the leaves crumple in your hand," said Wayne Cahilly, the manager of the arboretum and grounds there. "Japanese knotweed is in a dead wilt."</p>
        <p>In the forest at the botanical garden, even the leaves of native plants like wild black cherry and spicebush, which have evolved to suit conditions in the New York area, are drying up. The white wood aster, which should be blooming now, is completely wilted. And I saw milkweed drooping!</p>
        <p>"I'm seeing things dry up right now that we never had to water," Mr. Cahilly said, "like our magnolia collection and the katsura tree. We've had our sprinklers going on the azaleas for the last two days."</p>
        <p>Surface-rooted woody plants like azaleas and rhododendrons are more vulnerable than deep-rooted trees.</p>
        <p>"They're understory plants," he said, referring to the kind of shrubs and plants that grows beneath tall trees in a forest, "so usually the shade helps. But when the trees start stressing out, their root systems are capable of capturing large areas. So the upper surface of the soil begins to dry out and the shrubs will go into wilt."</p>
        <p>At the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the story is much the same. It looks like an early, faded fall, as stressed leaves turn pale yellow or dirty brown before dropping to the ground.</p>
        <p>"My favorite sycamore near the Japanese pond looks horrible," said Judy Zuk, the president of the Brooklyn garden. "It's almost as if someone took a blowtorch to the leaves."</p>
        <p>What's a gardener to do? Water restrictions can vary from fairly liberal rules for watering in New York City to a total ban on watering in Essex Fells, N.J.</p>
        <p>Well, some people let the lawn go, because grass, which evolved on the prairie and savannah, knows how to go dormant -- and green up again when it rains.</p>
        <p>Gardeners smart enough to have switched over to drought-tolerant grasses (or better yet, ground covers and shrubs) are probably a little happier right now than those diehards who are still clinging to their Kentucky bluegrass. That wimp may look like green velvet during a rainy, cool summer, but without water it's highly likely to be overtaken by crabgrass and insects sensing a weakened plant.</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't say don't water the lawn," said Donna Moramarco, a Cornell Cooperative Extension agent in Plainview, on Long Island (which is lawn country). "Give it an inch to an inch and a half a week, and mow high -- two-and-a-half-plus inches."</p>
        <p>It's up to you. I say if water restrictions force you to choose, let the Kentucky bluegrass fry and replant with drought-tolerant stuff in the spring.</p>
        <p>The most important thing is to "prioritize your plants," Ms. Moramarco said.</p>
        <p>"Things growing in containers and even the vegetable garden are somewhat expendable," she said. "In another six weeks, give or take, annuals are going to be coming up anyway. So look at where money has been spent, which is trees and shrubs."</p>
        <p>If water gets really tight, give your favorite plants -- tomatoes! -- a drink with the cooled water that you used to cook your broccoli or pasta the night before. And in the morning, when you're waiting for the shower to get hot, don't let all that water run down the drain. Plug up the tub and take the water out to the garden in buckets or big plastic jugs (it's good upper-body building) or take it to that desperate street tree outside the front door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cahilly's crew turns sprinklers on the most valuable trees, especially those planted over the last two years, to cool off the leaves and wet down the ground.</p>
        <p>In general, plants need an inch of water a week, and in times of extreme heat, even two inches. If you don't know how long it takes your sprinkler to put down that much water, set cans around the ground and time how long it takes to build up an inch.</p>
        <p>A big tree can use several hundred gallons of water a day.</p>
        <p>"And a lot of them are losing more water than they can take up," Ms. Moramarco said. Which is why your maple trees may be dropping their leaves. Or your Bradford pear may be turning an October bronzy-red. Some dogwood trees already have red berries.</p>
        <p>"It's all because of the tremendous drought stress," Ms. Moramarco said, "so people need to keep watering" as long as they are permitted to.</p>
        <p>She added: "We don't want them to waste it, but they need to consider the long term. One year is not going to kill an established tree, but several years of stress -- from severe winters to dry summers -- will weaken its defenses. And if a major tree dies, it's impossible to replace."</p>
        <p>To cut down on moisture loss during dry periods, plants close the stomata, or tiny openings in their leaves. But that means they're also cutting down on food production, because those openings are no longer letting in the carbon dioxide that plants use during photosynthesis.</p>
        <p>"It's like the tree has taken a day or a month off, without pay," Mr. Cahilly said. "Its food production winds down to next to nothing, and it's not putting anything away for next year, so it'll start out next spring with a deficit."</p>
        <p>Extreme drought and high temperatures also kill off small roots, he said, which then can't take up moisture even when it rains. And come spring, assuming the tree or shrub makes it through the winter, it will have to send precious energy rebuilding its root system, before it can launch into making leaves. Which is how a plant, just like a person, can wind down.</p>
        <p>To water important trees, Mr. Cahilly recommends a Ross Root Feeder, a 30-inch tube with holes. It connects to a hose and can be shoved into the ground.</p>
        <p>Another good method is to use a hose turned down to a trickle and just lay it by a favorite tree for hours, even overnight.</p>
        <p>But if there is runoff -- and there may be, because the soil is so hard and parched -- move the hose to another area, and keep moving it about to favorite plants. Letting water run off the soil is almost a criminal act during a drought.</p>
        <p>Never, never fertilize when it's hot and dry. You don't want to push growth at a time when plants are going dormant just to stay alive. Adding compost is O.K., because it decomposes slowly and acts like a mulch.</p>
        <p>Speaking of mulch, pile it on, because it will cool the soil and cut down on evaporation. "But never use peat moss for mulch," Ms. Moramarco said. "It will wick up all the moisture from the plants."</p>
        <p>Never water during the heat of the day, when precious moisture will be lost to evaporation.</p>
        <p>Drip-lines or soaker hoses are best at conserving water, because they let it seep into the soil with no runoff (unless they're on too long).</p>
        <p>"And people should not be too quick to put their hoses away," she said. "If we go into a dry fall, the last thing we want to do is go into the winter dry. So continue to water -- evergreens especially, because they continue losing water through their leaves. And deciduous trees have set their buds, so you don't want them to dry out."</p>
        <p>Keep watering until the ground freezes, which in some cases can be in January. And think about drought-tolerant plants for next year.  CUTTINGS</p>
