        <p>PERCHANCE TO DREAM Robert B. Parker's Sequel to Raymond Chandler's "The Big Sleep." By Robert B. Parker. 271 pp. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. $19.95.</p>
        <p>If Raymond Chandler had written like Robert B. Parker, he wouldn't have been Raymond Chandler. He would have been Robert B. Parker, a rather less exalted presence. The posthumous pseudo-sequel never amounts to more than a nostalgic curiosity, and it is no great surprise that "Perchance to Dream" isn't much good. The great surprise (for this reviewer) is that "The Big Sleep" isn't that good either; it seems to have aged dramatically since I last looked at it. Still, "The Big Sleep" has its qualities, and they include originality and a tremendous title -- two departments in which "Perchance to Dream" is conspicuously shaky. Would "Maybe to Dream" have been any better? Or "To Dream (Maybe)"? Or how about "The Bigger Sleep"? Or "Sleep Bigger"? Come to think of it, this exploratory, drawing-board stage might have been the right point to abandon the project. But Mr. Parker didn't abandon it until it was finished. And here it is.</p>
        <p>(1) "The sunshine was as empty as a headwaiter's smile."</p>
        <p>(2) "His grin had all the warmth of a pawnbroker examining your mother's diamond."</p>
        <p>(3) "She approached me with enough sex appeal to stampede a business men's lunch."</p>
        <p>(4) "The room was as charming as a heap of coffee grounds."</p>
        <p>Quotes 1 and 3 are Chandler; 2 and 4 are Mr. Parker. True, these are among Mr. Parker's best shots, while the Chandlerisms are no more than routine; but I see no yawning gulf in class. I remembered Chandler's prose as being hypnotic and frictionless, without false quantities. It isn't like that; it is full of stubbed toes and barked shins. In this area Mr. Parker can match and easily outstrip his mentor. Hardly any of Chandler's sentences, after all, are outright catastrophes, as Mr. Parker's often are: "I looked at the lock and tried a key that looked like it would match from the key ring I'd taken from the Mex," for instance, or "She was in . . . a bell-sleeved silk top with a plunging neckline and wide floppy silk pants that hid the great legs but hinted to you that if you got a look they would indeed be great."</p>
        <p>Sexually, Chandler is constrained and ambiguous, whereas Mr. Parker is candidly puerile: "She leaned forward toward me, showing me a white lace bra and a good deal of breast as well." Chandler's Marlowe may be a snoop, but he's no peeper (and he would never say "bra"). Then again, Mr. Parker's Philip Marlowe has much rounder heels than the original, who, although irresistible to all women ("My God, you big dark handsome brute!"), is an old hand at just saying no. Indeed, degraded female sexuality is "The Big Sleep" 's heart of darkness: drugs, dirty pictures ("indescribable filth"), drooling nymphomaniacs. It sounds both tame and creepy to the modern ear, as do the persistent -- and related -- snarls about homosexuality ("A pansy has no iron in his bones," and so on). Revisiting the scenes of the first murder, Marlowe senses "a stealthy nastiness, like a fag party." Well, "a fag party" no longer sends shivers up the spine. But it's less laughable, I suppose, than "Perchance to Dream" 's climactic depravity, where the sicko billionaire and the zonked heiress are surprised in the act: "She stood over Simpson, giggling her giggle and spanking him with a gold-inlaid ivory hairbrush." Which is certainly no average hairbrush. Sin, it would seem, has come a long way since 1939.</p>
        <p>So has profanity, and the general style of crime. The underworld advances more quickly, and dates faster, than the overworld. As a result, Chandler's heavies just aren't heavy; his mean streets are clean streets -- they are positively Arcadian. Thus, in "The Big Sleep," he substitutes a dash when the sneering murderer tells Marlowe what he can go do to himself, and the hissing, frothing murderess is reduced to calling him "a filthy name." Verbally, Chandler is as chaste as The New York Times. Mr. Parker has plainly made an effort to transport himself to this more innocent era. But he remains a child of his times. He lets Marlowe swear, and can't resist allotting him a (highly unsuitable)</p>
        <p>amourette,</p>
        <p>and stands by while he fraternizes with a known pimp, which "The Big Sleep" 's Marlowe, with his pipe and his "six-mover" chess problems, is far too literary for. One definite gain is the restoration of "Okay" in place of the ridiculous and distracting "Okey." (Reading "The Big Sleep," you keep stressing "Okey" on the first syllable, and then helplessly picture a resident of rural Oklahoma.) Apart from a telltale mention of "abusive treatment," meaning cruel rather than insulting, Mr. Parker avoids specific anachronisms. He manages to get through the novel without having Marlowe fasten his seat belt or lose sleep over global warming.</p>
        <p>One might expect Mr. Parker to make up some ground on the plot, because Chandler is far too glazed and existential for efficient genre storytelling. "The Big Sleep" 's premise (the dying General, the two wild daughters, the vanished son-in-law) is elegant, but the murder-trail stuff is repetitive, implausible and hard to follow. Every few pages, it seems, there's a knock on the door and another new gun barrel for the reader to peer into. Mr. Parker starts strongly, and for a while "Perchance to Dream" trundles along with more uncomplicated thrust than Chandler ever cared to generate. Marlowe is furnished with an impregnable adversary and long odds against. But the denouement is a chaos of tawdry short cuts. The impregnable villain confesses instantly, and his main sidekick disappears "in the scuffle," paving the way, perhaps, for "Ay, There's the Rub," the pseudo-pseudo-sequel of a thriller writer yet unborn.</p>
        <p>Most seriously, the character of Marlowe collapses. Raymond Chandler created a figure who hovered somewhere between cult and myth: he is both hot and cool, both virile and sterile. He pays a price for his freedom from venality; he is untouchable in all senses; he cannot be corrupted, not by women, not by money, not by America. The "big dark handsome brute" makes an interesting contrast with the photo on the back of my green Penguin edition: spectacles, receding hairline, lips so thin they seem to be licked away. Finding the rich nympho in his bed ("You're cute"), "Sleep" 's Marlowe tells her to leave before he throws her out "by force. Just the way you are, naked." When she goes, having called him that filthy name, Marlowe airs the room, drinks his drink and stares down at the imprint of her "small corrupt body" on the sheets. "I put my empty glass down," the chapter ends, "and tore the bed to pieces savagely."</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker's Marlowe, more modernly, would have given her a soft drink and a long talk about her substance problem. He has no turbulent soul, no inner complication to keep in check. Mr. Parker neither understands nor respects Marlowe's inhibitions; he fritters them away, unconsciously questing for some contemporary ideal of gruff likability. By the end of the book, Marlowe has become an affable goon. This guy grins and preens and jollies things along. This guy talks too much. MARLOWE OFFERS A TOAST</p>
        <p>The door opened and in came Vivian Sternwood in a polka-dot dress, big blue dots on a white background. Her hat and gloves were white and her big purse was the color of her dots.</p>
        <p>"Care for a drink?" I said. "I was just toasting that great healer, Claude Bonsentir."</p>
        <p>"You're drunk," she said.</p>
        <p>"Probably not," I said. "But it's not to say I won't be."</p>
        <p>I got up and went to the sink in the corner and got the other water glass I kept for company. I rinsed it, brought it back and poured a finger of rye into each glass.</p>
        <p>I handed a glass to Vivian and while we stood I raised mine.</p>
        <p>"I give you the Hippocrates of the quick needle, Dr. Bonsentir."</p>
        <p>Vivian's eyes were bright with anger, but she drank a little rye.</p>
        <p>"Are you going to ask me to sit down, Marlowe?"</p>
        <p>"Certainly," I said. "Have a chair. Maybe we can have another toast, seated is okay, to the elusive Carmen Sternwood, whom no one seems able to find but everybody says isn't missing."</p>
        <p>"I know my sister is missing, Mr. Marlowe. I don't need some piece of drunken sarcasm from the likes of you."</p>
        <p>"Who do you need it from," I said, "if not from me?" -- From "Perchance to Dream."</p>
