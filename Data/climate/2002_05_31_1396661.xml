        <p>Solemn Ceremony Ends Grim Task at Ground Zero  At 10:29 a.m., after the tolling of bells and in the presence of thousands, silence took its proper place at the World Trade Center site. A corner of the city became still, as a stretcher bearing the weight of no body was carried out of the swept-clean pit where the twin towers once stood, followed by a truck carting a 58-ton steel column -- the last symbolic remnant of what was, before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. ''It seems like yesterday,'' said Alan Reiss, a stretcher bearer who was the Port Authority's operations liaison at the trade center. ''And here we are, and it's the end of May.''</p>

        <p>Bringing Joyce Back Home  The National Library of Ireland has bought 700 pages of manuscripts by James Joyce, including 16 drafts from ''Ulysses'' and and proofs of ''Finnegans Wake.'' Discovered two years ago, they were kept secret until the announcement of the sale, which is a sort of homecoming for Ireland's most famous exile. The acquisition, for $11.7 million through Sotheby's in London, is the largest artistic purchase ever made by the Irish state.</p>

        <p>Global Crossing Fallout  The collapse of an agreement for two Asian companies to make a bid for Global Crossing is being tied to actions by J.P. Morgan Chase that may have soured the transaction, people close to Global Crossing said. J.P. Morgan is the leader of a group of banks facing losses on more than $2 billion in loans to Global Crossing, the communications company that filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
