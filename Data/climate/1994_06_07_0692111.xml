        <p>AFTER two million years of a most celebrated existence in the Caspian Sea, the sturgeon -- and caviar, its revered offspring -- have been pushed by pollution, corruption and greed to the edge of extinction.</p>
        <p>More than 90 percent of sturgeon and 95 percent of all black caviar come from the Caspian, which despite its name is the world's largest lake. A full-grown beluga, the largest member of the sturgeon family, can weigh a ton and carry more than two million eggs, although its relatives, the sevruga and osetra, are more common and not nearly as big.</p>
        <p>Sturgeon were once so plentiful here and on the southern coast of Russia that fishermen still remember a time when it was difficult for boats to sail between them. This year, however, the catch of 5,000 tons will not approach 1 percent of what it was 50 years ago. In fact, some of the rarest species of sturgeon are already considered extinct.</p>
        <p>"After millions of years of quiet and beauty, this sea and everything in it has rapidly started to die," said Arif E. Mansurov, the Azeri Minister of Ecology. "Three generations of evil, ignorant people have been able to wipe away millions of years of nature's work. Unless something changes soon, we will be the last generation to taste this caviar. I cannot say honestly that we alone are in a position to do a thing about it."</p>
        <p>The Caspian suffers from many maladies, and they have come together in a particularly destructive way to imperil the fish that inhabit it. Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, about 100 miles north of here, was the world's greatest oil town at the turn of the century. Thousands of derricks cover this once majestic coastline and a thin, permanent film of oil, about one-quarter inch thick, has formed on the top of the water. In one of history's most brazen displays of disregard for nature, Stalin dammed the Volga, draining millions of gallons for reservoirs and huge electrical plants. This has altered the flow of water into the Caspian and added tens of thousands of tons of heavy metals, chemicals, raw waste and other pollutants to it each year.</p>
        <p>It has also made it impossible for sturgeon to swim hundreds of miles up the Volga and Kura Rivers, as they did for centuries, to spawn. In addition, for more than a decade the sea has been rising, and various theories suggest that this may have to do with the oil itself, which may prevent evaporation, or with global warming or with some kind of natural global cycle. As a result, huge silt barriers have grown up at the mouth of the rivers, particularly the Kura, which enters the Caspian here.</p>
        <p>That means that when the fish do leave the sea to spawn they rarely make it back alive. Scientists predict the sea will rise at least seven more feet by the end of the decade, which would be beneficial for the fish but would also wipe out dams and hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland in three countries, and threaten communication towers, railroads and thousands of homes. The few fish farms created here and in Russia in the last 25 years to help replenish the diminishing stock have already been destroyed by the high waters.</p>
        <p>The environmental disasters that have befallen this region pale, however, when compared with the political realities that have accelerated the slaughter of sturgeon.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, two nations bordered the Caspian: Iran and the Soviet Union. The sea, though polluted and mismanaged, was not overfished, because the Soviet authorities punished poachers severely. Today there are five countries on the rim of the sea: Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Kazakhstan. Iran is by far the most stable and the least threatening to the fish population.</p>
        <p>The others, agree scientists, politicians and fishermen, are governed by chaos -- when they are governed at all. Poachers now take as much as 10 to 20 percent of the annual catch from Russia and Azerbaijan, as a quick trip to any black market in this nation, or in southern Russia near the caviar capital of Astrakhan, will demonstrate. Medium-quality caviar that costs $6 an ounce in Moscow and five times that in New York sells for $5 a pound in the markets of Baku.</p>
        <p>[ A New York retailer, Ira Goller of Murray's Sturgeon Shop, said the price of the best quality caviar, bought from reputable importers, has not changed, though the number of new importers offering cheap caviar has increased in the last few years. ] 'Criminal Industry'</p>
        <p>Without the former Soviet Union to enforce its brutal prohibition against poachers, the bounty of the sea is treated like a ready source of hard-currency exchange by crooks, peddlers and desperately poor governments like that of Azerbaijan.</p>
        <p>"It is hard to imagine the environmental and economic damage from poaching in the Caspian Sea," said Alexander Frolov, a Russian Interior Ministry expert on organized crime who runs the ministry's department of special operations. He has established a new squad, complete with assault weapons, rapid-reaction units and night-vision goggles, to arrest the poachers. "This has become a huge criminal industry," he said in May after the highly publicized closing of an illegal caviar factory in Astrakhan. "There is a lot of money to be made."</p>
        <p>As a general rule, 10 percent of the weight of a female sturgeon consists of eggs (although pollution-related diseases have helped lower the figure in the Caspian.) If a 700-pound fish delivers 70 pounds of exquisite caviar -- the type that can sell for as much as $100 an ounce in restaurants in New York or Paris -- then that fish would be worth more than $100,000 to high-price retailers (using the kind of admittedly imprecise math on which illegal drug sales are usually based). Each female fish brings thousands of dollars on the open market. In Neftechala, where the average monthly income for a worker in the single state factory is $10, that kind of money is impossible to ignore.</p>
        <p>The giant beluga takes nearly 20 years to reach maturity, and can live a century or longer. For these reasons, it has been the most severely affected of the sturgeon by the environmental and economic anarchy that has taken over the Caspian. Poaching has become so widespread that the wholesale price of caviar on the world market has begun to fall. And beluga, the most prized catch of all, is disappearing faster than the rest.</p>
        <p>"It's crazy what is happening here, just heartbreaking," said Abdul G. Kasimov, head of the department of hydrobiology at the Caspian Sea Research Center in Baku. "We need a complete ban on fishing for sturgeon in the sea. We agree to stop it and so does Russia. But our government is not capable of doing a thing against pirates. And we can't undo the pollution that has made so many of the fish sick. We are just too poor to do what we need to do."</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan has had five governments in five years. It has been locked in a brutal war with Armenia for nearly seven years, the cost of which draws off 70 percent of the national budget. Ignoring the Rules</p>
        <p>"The problem with sturgeon is critical, I agree," said Paulo Lembo, the chief representative of the United Nations Development Program in Baku. "But when we have a million refugees in the country and a water supply system that is not even capable of delivering basic drinking water, it is difficult to raise money to save caviar."</p>
        <p>There are rules to protect the vital cash crop, but they are rarely observed. In order to keep a level population, fishermen should take fewer than 50 percent of the fish as they leave the sea to spawn; these days, the take is close to 90 percent. And fish that are not harvested often die of natural causes or in their attempts to return to the sea.</p>
        <p>In the end, it is the pain inflicted on the environment that has hurt the fish the most and caused the gravest concern for the future, Mr. Kasimov said. Increasingly, fishermen here say they have to throw sturgeon back because they are clearly infected with a serious virus or suffer from myopathy disease, which causes a process of degradation of the muscular and sexual tissues, preventing reproduction.</p>
        <p>The rising waters, which have already wiped out 6 percent of the territory of western Kazakhstan and nearly as much of coastal Azerbaijan, would normally be a good thing for the fish. More water would bring more types of food and a richer diversity to the sea. And in the past, the sea has fluctuated greatly. It fell consistently from the late 1920's into the 1970's. By 1977 it had dropped almost 100 feet below sea level, its lowest point in hundreds of years. After World War II, however, both Iran and the Soviet Union began to carpet the newly dried sea bed with factories, villages and power lines.</p>
        <p>Now the sea is taking it all back again. The extreme level of chemical and oil pollution in the water -- and the threat of more if the waters destroy oil platforms -- have made the rise deadly to life within the sea.</p>
        <p>"Nature has certain laws and the farmers and fishermen here always respected them," said Urkhan K. Alekperov, vice president of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences and an expert on the life of the sea. "For thousands of years our villagers knew not to build on the sea's edge, not to live there. They know that one day the sea would come back. But in this century nobody listened to the past. We are just starting to suffer the consequences."</p>
