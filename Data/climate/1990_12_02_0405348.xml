        <p>After a decade-long struggle against pollution and overfishing in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, environmentalists and government officials say they are seeing the first signs of progress. But they warn that unless new steps are taken, including far-reaching controls on development and the pollution it produces, the fight could be lost.</p>
        <p>The progress is scattered -- a clear stream here, a new bed of clams there, a sewage pipe through which nothing now flows. Like canaries in a mineshaft, "the fish and the shellfish and the bottom grasses are sending out a few good signals," said Ann P. Swanson, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, a multistate panel that monitors the effort to save the 200-mile-long estuary.</p>
        <p>"But we're still a long way from winning the battle," she went on, "and we could still lose it if we don't do even more, especially in controlling and guiding future growth." Action in Maryland</p>
        <p>Once one of the world's richest sources of seafood, and still a playground for the mid-Atlantic region, Chesapeake Bay is deeply scarred by decades of pollution. Though environmental laws have blocked many sources of pollution, experts say unchecked growth could undo much of that progress. The populations in many metropolitan regions in the bay have increased by as much as 50 percent over the last quarter century.</p>
        <p>One crucial state, Maryland, is pressing to control growth. It has established a 1,000-foot zone along its bay shore in which development, particularly housing subdivisions, is severely restricted. And this week, a state study commission recommended that the Legislature pass laws restricting growth around the bay mainly to areas already built up.</p>
        <p>The commission said too many farms and forests had been bulldozed to create sprawling subdivisions, with the uncovered raw soil often eroding into nearby streams that lead to the bay. The commission said such erosion had produced much of the silt that is choking parts of the bay, and added that runoff from new roads and the newly fertilized lawns of subdivisions had further polluted the bay.</p>
        <p>The commission's proposal to stop suburban sprawl set off a debate among planners, developers and Marylanders who still cling to the American dream of a home on a spacious lot. But commission members said land use was growing twice as fast as population. "Everyone is going to have to modify, to some extent, their style of living," said Walter A. Frey 3d, a business executive on the panel.</p>
        <p>The progress up to now has been accomplished mainly through widespread construction of modern sewage plants and the regulation of waste flowing into the 150 rivers and streams that feed the bay. There has been a major reduction of fertilizer runoff from the farms in the bay watershed, especially those concentrated along the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. And restrictions have been placed on seafood that can be taken from the bay, on the amount of wetlands that can be destroyed or disturbed and on the use of pesticides.</p>
        <p>The move to control growth represents a new direction in the effort to save the bay. It could involve people who live miles away from the shores of the estuary whose immense drainage basin stretches from Cooperstown, N.Y., to Lynchburg, Va.</p>
        <p>"It's the next logical step, but it's also a tricky approach because you have to find some way to protect the economic interests of those in rural areas whose land can no longer be developed," said W. Tayloe Murphy Jr., a Virginia lawmaker who serves on the Chesapeake Bay Commission.  Life on the Bottom Again</p>
        <p>One of the most striking signs of progress in the fight to save the Chesapeake can be found on the bay's bottom. Some sections that pollution had denuded of almost all life are now lush with underwater grass, a critical part of the bay's life chain that provides food for some of the bays creatures and also helps cleanse and rejuvenate its waters.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, signs of progress include summer swimmers in the Potomac River, a major tributary that was dangerously toxic before the imposition of strict pollution controls, including the construction of some of the most modern sewage treatment plants anywhere.</p>
        <p>On the bottom of Baltimore harbor, once considered dead because of all the industrial pollution that had been poured into it over the years, there are newfound beds of clams and the stirrings of mud worms.</p>
        <p>All across the bay's watershed, the amount of phosphorus flowing into streams and the bay has been sharply reduced in the last decade, as much as 50 percent, by new sewage treatment methods, the elimination of phosphates from household detergents and the imposition of erosion controls. Phosphorus is one of the nutrients on which choking rafts of algae feed, keeping sunlight from reaching the bay's life-giving grasses and depleting life-supporting oxygen.</p>
        <p>Striped bass, shad, ospreys, peregrine falcons and bald eagles are beginning to make a comeback, as is the Chesapeake oyster, once the bay's greatest seafood resource, along with the blue crab.</p>
        <p>Among these varied creatures of land and sea, only the crab has been able, year in and year out, to hold its own against pollution, pesticides, disease, waterside condominiums, overfishing and serendipitous Mother Nature. But this year enough striped bass, called rockfish by many residents of the bay area, showed up to permit a fishing season, the first in the better part of a decade.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists credit newly clean spawning areas and closed seasons for the resurgence of the fish. Still, after just a few days, the 1990 season had to be ended, so intense was the angling.</p>
        <p>"That was a sign of just how fragile our progress is in cleaning up the Chesapeake," said William C. Baker, the president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a citizens' group that monitors the bay's quality and promotes its conservation.</p>
        <p>"We're still a long way from the days when we could pull in millions of pounds of rock and shad," he said. "In fact, we may never get back to that or to the kind of bay that Captain John Smith found in the early 1600's when he said there were so many fish he could catch them with the frying pan. Our realistic hope is that we can return to a bay in which species aren't endangered and pollution and human pressure are managable."</p>
        <p>The continued fragility of the bay is especially evident in the amount of bottom grasses. While new grasses are beginning to spring up in some places, three-fourths of the areas where grass was once plentiful remain bare. Few Simple Answers</p>
        <p>While oysters appear to be making a comeback this year after several exceptionally barren years, the catch is drastically down from the past -- only a tenth of what it was at the turn of the century. That sharp reduction is attributed not just to pollution and over-harvesting but largely to naturally occurring, cyclical diseases.</p>
        <p>"In figuring out what is happening in the bay and who and what is to blame, there are seldom many simple answers," Mr. Baker said. "For instance, while pollution causes serious oxygen depletion in the bay's waters, we also know that such depletion occurs naturally."</p>
        <p>He also pointed out that just when pollution experts thought they had figured out how to handle the problem of phosphorous and nitrogen entering the bay from waste and fertilizer runoff they discovered that acid rain was also bringing nitrogen in the bay. That discovery helped lead to the new growth approach for saving the bay.</p>
        <p>"In this fight," Mr. Baker said, "knowledge is often progress."</p>
