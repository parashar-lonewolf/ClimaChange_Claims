        <p>LEAD: As concern grows that manmade chemicals are destroying the ozone layer in the atmosphere, 80 nations indicated today that they would favor banning production of certain harmful substances by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>As concern grows that manmade chemicals are destroying the ozone layer in the atmosphere, 80 nations indicated today that they would favor banning production of certain harmful substances by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>The consensus goes far beyond a treaty, known as the Montreal Protocol, that was reached in 1987 and called for production of the chemicals to be cut in half by 1998.</p>
        <p>Effectively, the nations have acknowledged that the protocol, which went into force only four months ago, is already out of date. Indeed, the United States and the European Community countries independently decided at the beginning of March to eliminate production and use of chloroflurocarbons, the most harmful category of chemicals covered by the 1987 protocol, by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>The declaration was adopted by consensus. All 36 countries that have ratified the Montreal Protocol, including the Soviet Union, joined in the declaration. Delegations from others that have not yet ratified it, including India and China, are also participating in the meeting. In Upper Atmosphere</p>
        <p>Over the last several months at various meetings around the world, scientists have presented mounting evidence about the extent and irreversibility of the damage that chlorofluorocabons and other chemicals are doing to the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the upper atmosphere keeps harmful solar radiation from reaching animals and plants on the surface of the earth. As the chemicals produced on earth rise through the atmosphere, they interact with the help of sunlight to deplete the layer. And as the public grows more aware, politicians are growing bolder.</p>
        <p>''In September 1987, by the skin of its teeth, the Montreal Protocol was an acceptable document,'' said Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, which oversees the accord.</p>
        <p>''In light of everything that has happened since, and the projection of what will happen, its provisions are now unacceptable,'' he told the meeting. To Tighten Timetable</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, they agreed with him, adopting a declaration that agrees ''to phase out the production and the consumption of chlorofluorocarbons controlled by the Montreal Protocol as soon as possible, but not later than 2000,'' and to tighten the timetable agreed upon in the protocol.</p>
        <p>The consensus is essentially a declaration of intent. The meeting, sponsored by the United Nations, was called to review the protocol, but delegates cannot change its terms. The nations that signed the protocol are to meet in the spring or summer of 1990 to discuss amendments, and the declaration indicates that they would favor changes. In fact, delegates here said that by then, there could be agreement for an even tighter timetable.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, the United States also pressed for a commitment to phase out production and use of halon gases, which are used as fire extinguishing agents, said Eileen Claussen, Deputy Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. President Bush announced a ban in the United States in March. But today's declaration only pledges the participants to phase them out ''as soon as feasible.''</p>
        <p>Chlorofluorocarbons are widely used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, as solvents in the manufacture of electronic components like silicon chips, and as foaming agents to create plastic insulation. In Europe, though but not any longer in the United States, they are used as aerosol propellants, though companies are scrambling to replace them. Lawyer From Washington</p>
        <p>David D. Doniger, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, who is attending as an observer, said, ''Most of the discussion has been probing around about ways to help the developing world comply with stricter limitations, but there's only an indirect reference in the declaration today to other harmful chemicals not covered in the treaty.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the declaration has only a fleeting reference to the contribution that ozone-depleting substances make to the global warming effect, which is also becoming a preoccupation of Europe's political leaders. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain had half her cabinet attend an all-day seminar last week on the greenhouse effect, as the warming effect of industrial gases is called.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, the West German delegate, Klaus Topfer, Minister for the Environment, proposed a worldwide convention on the protection of the global climate, with specific limits on production of carbon dioxide and methane, the major contributors to the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>The Dutch delegation here also proposed limiting the substitute chemicals now being developed to replace the chlorofluorocarbons and halons that cause the most harm to the ozone layer. That suggestion will be discussed later this week, as the parties that signed the protocol and the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer continue to meet.</p>
        <p>Sergei L. Stepanov, executive secretary of the Soviet interagency ozone committee, also proposed a global ban on methyl chloroform, which along with carbon tetrachloride is not covered by the Montreal Protocol. Both are believed to contribute significantly to the damage to the ozone layer.</p>
