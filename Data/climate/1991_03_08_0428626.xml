        <p>The New York Flower Show has enough good-smelling greenery to shame a black-thumb gardener whose horticultural aspirations always seem to wither in the original pot on the way home from the neighborhood 5-and-10-cent store. With two acres of blossoms and blooms and trompe l'oeil gardens running the length of a huge pier on the Hudson River, the flower show is the kind of inspiration a luckless amateur needs to pick up a trowel and try again.</p>
        <p>After all, every blade of grass at the flower show came in through the door. The weeping pine trees were hauled in from Oregon, the sod from Maryland, the bridal wreaths from Rikers Island. The conversation piece at the Garden Club of America exhibit is the conversation piece azalea. Josyane Colwell, who helped coordinate the display, said she put 3,000 miles on her car finding it, tracking down the right stone for the wall and locating the perfect mulch.</p>

        <p>The New York Flower Show has enough good-smelling greenery to shame a black-thumb gardener whose horticultural aspirations always seem to wither in the original pot on the way home from the neighborhood 5-and-10-cent store. With two acres of blossoms and blooms and trompe l'oeil gardens running the length of a huge pier on the Hudson River, the flower show is the kind of inspiration a luckless amateur needs to pick up a trowel and try again.</p>
        <p>After all, every blade of grass at the flower show came in through the door. The weeping pine trees were hauled in from Oregon, the sod from Maryland, the bridal wreaths from Rikers Island. The conversation piece at the Garden Club of America exhibit is the conversation piece azalea. Josyane Colwell, who helped coordinate the display, said she put 3,000 miles on her car finding it, tracking down the right stone for the wall and locating the perfect mulch.</p>
        <p>After planting and trimming and sculpturing, the exhibitors have hosed the mud off the floor and stowed away the hand trucks on which they wheeled in all the shrubs and flowers. The logistics were so complicated that one nursery in Rockland County in New York tried to deliver what it needed on a barge.</p>
        <p>People attending the show, at Pier 92, can come by land.  Where the Bears Are</p>
        <p>The sponsor is the New York Horticultural Society, which is raising money for its community-service projects like Greenworks, which keeps a greenhouse on Rikers Island well stocked and well tended by inmates.</p>
        <p>Each day will bring a celebration of a different theme. Japan Day, City Gardener Day and Daffodil Day are all on the schedule, with three lectures each day.</p>
        <p>And each day will give visitors a peek at unseen props of the city. The Parks Department raided its warehouses and came up with items that no longer grace parks and monuments: an urn designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White, a forest of elegant old-fashioned lampposts and a family of cast-iron bears that had been in a storage room under the Triborough Bridge. Not to worry. They are not as massive or menacing as their grizzly cousins in Alaska.</p>
        <p>To someone befuddled by mere begonias, the fantasy world created by the 50 nurseries, florists, plant societies and garden clubs is nothing less than mind boggling.</p>
        <p>"People seem to think that you freeze-dry the materials and haul them out of the closet once a year and fluff off the tulips," said Michael Riley of the Horticulture Society.</p>
        <p>If only it were that simple. Spring begins in less than two weeks, but in the make-believe world of flower shows, it has to come early. So gardeners simulate spring in hothouses -- they call it forcing the blooms and blossoms -- to produce all those brilliant azaleas, rhododendrons, tulips and daffodils. Never mind global warming and ozone depletion. This is the greenhouse effect.  Dorothy's Green Slippers</p>
        <p>Flower shows cut across the social and economic strata of society, offering something for everyone, no matter how elaborate the displays, Mr. Riley said. Someone with a box and a sunny window can come away with planting tips. And someone with a big house and a big budget may borrow ideas from the elegant-looking town house gardens done by interior designers.</p>
        <p>One is Cumulus IX, which is Cloud 9 to those who can never remember the names of the fuzzy white shapes in the sky or Roman numerals. It looks like a playful rendering of a Manhattan town house. The equally playful garden comes with mosaic stars and topiary shoes, a green greenhouse. Where and When</p>
        <p>The New York Flower Show is to run through March 17 at Pier 92, 51st Street and the Hudson River in Manhattan. Weekend hours are 10 A.M to 8 P.M. today and 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday. Tickets are $8 today and $10 tomorrow and Sunday. Information: (212) 757-0915. The Long Island Rail Road is offering a free shuttle bus to the show from Penn Station and reduced admission to the show with a round-trip ticket. Information: (718) 217-5477 or (516) 822-5477.</p>
