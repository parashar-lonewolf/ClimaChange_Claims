        <p>''WHICH way do you want to go?'' the taxi driver asked me after I told him my destination.</p>
        <p>This is the perennial question for Manhattan residents as we weave our way home from Kennedy International Airport or La Guardia Airport, zipping -- or crawling -- across the expressways of Queens and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>I get the same query when I am heading to the airports. What the cabby meant, of course, was, did I want to take the Midtown Tunnel or the Williamsburg Bridge, since my address was about equidistant from the two?</p>
        <p>''Williamsburg Bridge,'' I answered, as I did whenever I was traveling on business.</p>
        <p>Good thing I wasn't running late, since going via the Williamsburg Bridge actually took a little longer, with the cabby looping all the way down from La Guardia to Brooklyn on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in order to cross the bridge.</p>
        <p>It wasn't for any nostalgic purpose or because of claustrophobia that I chose bridge over tunnel. It was because the price of the tunnel toll -- currently $4 -- is not included on my cab receipt. By contrast, the Williamsburg Bridge is free (thus far, at least). I would rather pay a little more in the price of the cab fare itself, since I submit that receipt for reimbursement.</p>
        <p>If we take the tunnel, however, speeding through the E-ZPass lane as cabbies are wont to do (and we harried passengers generally also appreciate the haste), then I am $4 out of luck, since I enter or leave Queens receipt-less.</p>
        <p>A more efficient system would entail including the price of tolls on the receipt by pressing a button on the meter, as they do in Boston, for example, or as they do even here in New York City for other extras, like the rush-hour or late-night service charges. Or better yet -- that is, if we don't completely trust our cabbies -- why don't we synchronize taxi E-ZPass accounts with the meter, so that going through the tollgate puts the extra $4 on the meter.</p>
        <p>Yes, O.K., I could write the extra $4 by hand on the faded blue printout. And yes, I could (and do) just pay it out of pocket. But what about tourists? Don't you think that they may get just a little bit nervous when told that the tolls aren't included in the fare, and that, given no written record, they are going to just have to take the cabby's word for it (unless they are quick enough to read the signs at the tunnel entrance)?</p>
        <p>Certainly, there are more pressing social problems than business travelers getting properly reimbursed for tolls and creating a sense of trust among tourists as they first cross the East River to enter the great island of Manhattan. On the other hand, creating the right incentives matters -- especially when it is relatively costless. All things being equal, I would take the most efficient route to and from the airport, thereby saving on fossil fuels, providing the city with needed revenue and perhaps contributing to more efficiently balanced traffic flows.</p>
        <p>Of course, in any policy change, there are losers: the organizations that reimburse us toll payers will have to start paying. A cost may also be borne by the current crop of cabbies who are benefiting from my willingness to save $4. But then again, if business passengers are getting paid back on tolls, they may feel a bit more generous when it comes to the tipping part of the deal. (Even better would be to allow us to indicate the tip on the printed receipt as well.)</p>
        <p>Until then -- if I want to avoid my usual internal debate -- there's always Newark Liberty Airport.</p>
