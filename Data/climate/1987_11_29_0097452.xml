        <p>THE thermometer acts like a yo-yo at this time of year. Its up-and-down readings should remind gardeners that more of the same lies ahead. To help plants survive, here are some reminders to get the garden ready.</p>
        <p>Water: Thus far, the season has lacked adequate rainfall. Dry soil is devastating to evergreens, particularly. Damage will not show up until next summer when leaf edges may be brown or leaves may show dead blotches. The cause is wind and winter sun, which evaporate moisture. If the ground and roots are dry or frozen, this moisture cannot be replaced. The result: damage, and in severe cases, dead plants.</p>
        <p>Now, before outside water faucets are shut off for winter, get out the hoses and deeply soak evergreens, new shrubs and young trees. This is a far more practical (and economical) measure for plant survival than the use of commercial anti-desiccant products sold in hand-pump or aerosol containers. The products do some good by coating leaves with an invisible protectant to prevent sunscald, but the protectant sloughs off and must be reapplied after the first of the year.</p>
        <p>Lawns: The grass should be short. If the lawn mower has not been cleaned and stored, and the grass is more than three inches long, mow once again and set the mower to cut about one and a half inches. Rake up or bag the clippings along with any leftover leaves and other debris. The grass blades should be short and the lawn clear for the weather ahead. This will not only discourage spring diseases, but short grass blades make new growth (the spring greening) simpler.</p>
        <p>If the lawn has not been fertilized, by all means do it. A late application, just after the last mowing, will strengthen grass roots, which are still active and hold nutrients in reserve. If lime has not been applied for several years, it should be. Use a calibrated spreader for these two dry ingredients; both can be applied the same day. Drain the power mower, clean and cover it. In fact, the power mower can trade storage space with snow removal equipment.</p>
        <p>Herbaceous Perennials: Cut stalks of perennials to the ground and pull or cut off withered leaves of frosted perennials such as hostas. Pull up any weeds that may still be around plants, but wait until the middle of next month to apply mulch when the ground is frozen. The mulch will help to keep it that way and protect plant roots and prevent them from being exposed when the ground opens, thaws and refreezes. Many gardeners wait until after the holidays to apply mulch and use boughs cut from Christmas trees and trimmings.</p>
        <p>Hardy Bulbs: Finish planting. At this late date, bulbs should be in the ground. Water them in well and apply a leafy mulch to keep the ground warm. These two recommendations, if followed, will encourage much-needed root growth that must occur before the bulbs' blossoms push up in spring.</p>
        <p>Plant Wrapping: Never. Evergreens, especially, should never be wrapped with plastic. Contrary to popular belief that this deed protects plants from winter weather, it cooks them by causing a greenhouse effect. Temperature builds up under the plastic. Ropes can be tied around columnar plants to prevent snow or ice from falling in between the branches and breaking them. Or, barriers made of burlap or lath can be set up to protect plants from prevailing winds. Roof structures can be set over plants subject to heavy snows, which break them.</p>
        <p>If hardy species are planted, plants will survive best on their own. If there is any doubt about winter sun and wind desiccation, spray antitranspirant materials sold in hand-pump bottles or aerosol cans.</p>
        <p>Winter Mulch: If mulch of leaves or pine needles is piled around the bases of woody plants, particularly young shrubs, broad-leaved evergreens and dwarf conifers, pull them away from the main trunk. This will allow wood to harden before winter. Put the mulch back in place late next month after the ground is frozen. This practice will also discourage mice, moles and rabbits from tunneling near plants and feeding on bark.</p>
        <p>Fruit Trees: Place a cylinder of wire-mesh screen around the bases of trunks and secure it just below ground level. The screen will discourage rodents from nibbling bark. Wrap trunks of young trees with tree wrap, a paper product available in well-stocked garden centers, to prevent sunscald and frost cracks.</p>
        <p>Pesticides and Chemicals: The ideal is to buy in spring the amount that will be used in one season; then there will be none left over to worry about storing. If precalculated buying has not been accomplished, then leftover chemicals should be stored, preferably in a locked cabinet. The materials should not be left out in an unheated shed where they are subject to cold-weather damage, whether in dry or liquid form.</p>
        <p>Tools: Clean off all tools. Wipe tines and blades with a clean cloth and apply rustproofing. Store hand tools on shelves and hang long-handled tools from secure hooks.</p>
        <p>Leaves: Rake any remaining leaves off lawns and away from corners, but do not clean them out from under shrubs since this natural mulch protects shallow roots.</p>
        <p>Roses: There is no need to prune plants. Unwieldy canes subject to wind damage can be cut back to reasonable lengths. Major rosebush pruning will be done in spring when buds break. Next month, after the ground freezes, crowns of rosebushes can be covered with a fine mulch of chopped leaves, pine needles or ground corn cobs to protect the grafted region. The covering will be taken away in spring.</p>
        <p>Dogwoods: These trees need special attention. Rake away and discard any leaves as a precaution for disease control. Scatter acid-type tree fertilizer on the ground around root zones and follow the rates on bag label.</p>
        <p>Ice: Keep bushel baskets or cartons of sand, sifted ashes or cat-box filler handy to use on icy drives, walks, steps and paths. Avoid rock salt (sodium chloride). Although it melts ice into a slush, this material filters down to plant roots, seeps into aquifers and raises the sodium content of water. In place of rock salt, look for calcium chloride crystals, a dehydrating chemical that absorbs moisture. Its exothermic reaction (heat) melts ice and snow at lower temperatures than rock salt and does much less damage to the environment.</p>
