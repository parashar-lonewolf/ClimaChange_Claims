        <p>LEAD: Name an environmental issue in Washington these days, and the chances are that John M. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, is in the thick of it, setting President Bush's policy.</p>
        <p>Name an environmental issue in Washington these days, and the chances are that John M. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, is in the thick of it, setting President Bush's policy.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Sununu, for example, who played a pivotal role in the recent White House decision to oppose financial aid for developing countries that phase out chemicals that contribute to destruction of the atmospheric ozone layer. He thought it too costly.</p>
        <p>And it is Mr. Sununu, Administration officials say, who is seeking to ease some elements of the toughened Clean Air Act passed by the Senate in April and awaiting action by the House, because he views the provisions as too expensive to business.</p>
        <p>Here in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sununu was Governor from 1983 to 1988, his recent actions come as no surprise. Many environmentalists and state officials say he is beginning to repeat in Washington a pattern that he set here, one that they say gives preference to economic development over environmental regulation.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists and state and Federal officials go so far as to say that as Governor, Mr. Sununu at times tried to bypass Federal environmental laws to speed favored projects.</p>
        <p>And some officials say Governor Sununu sought to intimidate them or have them replaced when they invoked Federal regulations that would have delayed projects he liked. Among the projects were the expansion of a ski resort on national forest land, the broadening of an important state highway through federally protected wetlands and the opening of the Seabrook nuclear power plant.</p>
        <p>D. Dickinson Henry, the director of the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, said other governors had sought to bypass Federal environmental regulations in individual cases. What was different about Mr. Sununu, Mr. Henry said, was that he made this a regular policy and ''often used extreme tactics,'' like trying to intimidate officials.</p>
        <p>Sununu Says Record Has Been Distored</p>
        <p>In an interview in his office in Washington, Mr. Sununu said he had only been doing his job as Governor to promote economic growth. He asserted that the problems in New Hampshire had been created by ''external groups'' who ''dragged the Federal agencies into the process.''</p>
        <p>''I really felt very strongly as Governor that this kind of interference from outside the state wasn't constructive,'' Mr. Sununu said. Regulation should have been left to his state environmental officials, who approved the developments, Mr. Sununu said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu said his record had been distorted by environmentalists, and he pointed to several accomplishments while he was Governor. They included passage of the nation's first acid rain legislation, which required a 25 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions in New Hampshire, and his administration's purchase of 45,000 acres of privately owned timberland to prevent its development.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists responded that in each case Mr. Sununu acted in response to widespread public pressure. Jackie Tuxill, an environmental consultant, recalled that Mr. Sununu became interested in the acid rain issue only after a highly unusual series of statewide town meetings called for action, and she said that since most of the chemicals that cause acid rain come from sources outside the state, the effect of the bill was limited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu's timber purchase has been criticized by environmentalists and political opponents for giving a group of businessmen a large profit and letting them keep lucrative rights to mine gravel on the new public land.</p>
        <p>Development Backer From Earliest Days</p>
        <p>Right from his first days in public office, after he was elected to the town planning board of Salem in the 1960's, Mr. Sununu has been a strong advocate of development.</p>
        <p>Patrick Jackson, a management consultant who was then chairman of the Southeast New Hampshire Regional Planning Commission, recalls that at meetings ''John Sununu used to stand up and give these speeches about the virtues of development.''</p>
        <p>''He would say: 'These developers are legitimate businessmen. You can't stop them,' '' Mr. Jackson said. ''His idea of open space was a K Mart parking lot.''</p>
        <p>Much of the interest in Mr. Sununu's record as Governor centers on his efforts to help the Loon Mountain ski area, already the state's busiest, double its size by expanding onto 930 acres of the White Mountain National Forest.</p>
        <p>The Loon Mountain Corporation was founded by Sherman Adams, who like Mr. Sununu was a Republican Governor of New Hampshire who went on to become a Presidential chief of staff. Mr. Adams served under Dwight D. Eisenhower.</p>
        <p>When the project was proposed, in 1986, the United States Forest Service initially indicated it would approve the expansion, but objections were quickly raised by other Federal and state agencies, which said the plan required an environmental impact study. The Federal environmental protection law requires such a study whenever a major Government action will have a significant effect on the environment. Federal officials have some discretion to determine which projects require studies, although in recent years the courts have tended to require them. A study can take a year or two to complete.</p>
        <p>The officials who favored a study on the Loon Mountain project were concerned by reports that sewage lagoons for a nearby town, Lincoln, were already so strained that they were leaking, and by questions of whether the new snow-making equipment would exhaust the town's water supply from the Pemigewasset River. That, in turn, would endanger a program to restore the river's salmon.</p>
        <p>It was then, state and Federal officials say, that Governor Sununu began calling them to head off a full environmental study.</p>
        <p>Letter of the Law Thwarts an Inquiry</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu, in the interview, said all his state environmental officials had approved the resort's growth and had advised him that it did not require an environmental study.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu said he never improperly tried to bypass Federal officials, implying that they probably should not have been involved in the first place. ''My message was clear,'' Mr. Sununu said. ''If you've got a problem, put it on the table and let the state agencies decide.''</p>
        <p>Under the conflicting pressures, the Forest Service reversed itself and called for a full environmental study. As part of the process, the agency organized a review committee and invited the state Department of Environmental Services to send representatives to give technical advice.</p>
        <p>But Governor Sununu permitted only one official from the department to attend, and he turned out to be the agency's public spokesman, who had little technical knowledge, several members of the review committee said.</p>
        <p>When the spokesman was asked about reports of the leaking sewage lagoons, he assured the group that everything was fine, said Mr. Henry of the Audubon, who was a member of the panel. It was only after Mr. Sununu left office at the end of 1988 that the group was able to hear the testimony of state specialists, who confirmed that the sewage system was indeed leaking and probably could not be fixed.</p>
        <p>''Sununu complied with the letter of the law,'' Mr. Henry said, ''but by careful omission he made it very difficult to get accurate information.'' A final decision the case has still not been made.</p>
        <p>Official Speaks, Appointment Stalls</p>
        <p>Dr. James Paine, a member of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Commission, said his reappointment to the commission was delayed after he opposed the Governor by calling for an environmental study of the Loon Mountain expansion. Like other officials, most of whom declined to quoted by name because of Mr. Sununu's current powerful position, Dr. Paine said the Governor used shouting and displays of temper to intimidate people on environmental and other matters. ''He could be real abusive,'' Dr. Paine said.</p>
        <p>Some officials and environmentalists are concerned that Mr. Sununu is continuing to influence the debate over the Loon Mountain project from the White House. Last December, the president of Loon Mountain, Philip T. Gravink, wrote to Mr. Sununu to thank him for his ''candid advice'' on how to make it easier for ski areas to expand on public land. The letter from Mr. Gravink, a past contributor to Mr. Sununu's campaigns for governor, was then forwarded by the White House chief of staff to officials of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Another of the disputes involving Mr. Sununu that pitted development against environmental interests was an effort by the state to widen Route 101, the only east-west highway in the heavily populated southern half of New Hampshire. The plan for the road would have taken it through 80 to 100 acres of wetlands.</p>
        <p>Without waiting for Federal approval, the state's Transportation Department began building a bridge and an access road.</p>
        <p>But the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal agency responsible for protecting wetlands, ordered the work halted, said Col. Thomas Rhen, then head of the New England Division of the Corp. ''It was illegal, no question about it,'' said Colonel Rhen, who has since retired.</p>
        <p>Governor Sununu was furious and summoned several state and Federal officials, including Michael Deland, then head of the New England Region of the Environmental Protection Agency and now chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
        <p>One of the participants in the meeting said Mr. Sununu ''ridiculed the violation and accused us of sneaking around trying to find it.'' The participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added, ''He said Federal officials had no business determining the alignment of a state road and should stay the heck out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu, in the interview, said he was ''upset by a lot of people using the Federal process in a way that was not intended.'' He said advocates were ''not using it to protect the environment but to block the expansion of a highway.''</p>
        <p>Last month Mr. Sununu's Republican successor as Governor, Judd Gregg, finally reached an agreement to conduct a full environmental impact study on the route.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu's most successful intervention to promote development in New Hampshire has been his support for the Seabrook nuclear plant. For years, he was one of its most visible and active supporters.</p>
        <p>Using White House For Seabrook Help</p>
        <p>In one important move, Mr. Sununu apparently worked behind the scenes to get the plant licensed. Under Federal law, nuclear plants must have an emergency evacuation plan able to protect residents within 10 miles.</p>
        <p>The agency responsible for evaluating such plans was the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the official in charge in the Boston office in the late 1980's was Edward Thomas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas argued that the plan for Seabrook was flawed and that in the event of a disaster at the plant, thousands of people would be trapped because of the poor road network, particularly if an accident occurred during the summer when crowds flock to the Atlantic beaches near Seabrook.</p>
        <p>Governor Sununu complained to the White House that certain ''personnel'' were not approving the evacuation plan ''in an expeditious and unbiased fashion,'' according to an affidavit by Samuel Speck, Mr. Thomas's supervisor in the Emergency Management Agency's Washington office.</p>
        <p>In the document, given to a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy, Conservation and Power, Mr. Speck said he met with Mr. Sununu, but that the Governor, apparently still unsatisfied, complained again to the White House about Mr. Thomas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas said in a recent telephone interview that he had been ordered not to comment on the matter. But a close friend said that Mr. Thomas had felt under pressure to change his position. The friend said Mr. Thomas had been denied vacation, made to work 70 or more hours a week, and was told by superiors that his career was in danger.</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan Solves the Problem</p>
        <p>In November 1988, shortly after President Bush was elected, Ronald Reagan ended the dispute by declaring that the Federal Government would henceforth have authority to draft such evacuation plans.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Wallace E. Stickney was nominated to be the new head of the Emergency Management Agency. He was Mr. Sununu's Commissioner of Transporation in New Hampshire and had pushed the Route 101 project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas's old job in the agency's Boston office is now held by Richard H. Strone, Governor Sununu's state emergency management chief, who had been in charge of the evacuation plan for Seabrook.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas, meanwhile, has transferred to do flood relief work in the South.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu defends his actions on environmental matters. ''I don't feel uncomfortable having done my job as Governor where economic development is a primary requisite,'' he said.</p>
