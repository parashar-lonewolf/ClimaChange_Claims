        <p>Search and rescue teams uncovered the flight data and cockpit voice recorders early this morning in the rubble of the section of the Pentagon hit by a hijacked jet on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The charred boxes were handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, officials said, and then sent to the National Transportation Safety Board laboratory in Washington. The voice recorder is the first found from the four hijacked aircraft.</p>
        <p>With rescue teams working through morning rain to shore up the Pentagon, military officials said preliminary estimates were that it would take many years and hundreds of millions of dollars to repair the building. Despite the extraordinary damage, two-thirds of the building was operating normally, they said.</p>
        <p>The size of the task of rebuilding is beginning to be understood, even though engineers have been unable to survey the extent of the structural damage.</p>
        <p>''It will cost less than a billion but certainly more than $100 million by quite a bit,'' said John Irby, director of the federal facilities division.</p>
        <p>The Army, which lost more people than any other service branch, released the names of the 74 people it says are missing. Among them was Lt. Gen. Timothy J. Maude, the highest-ranking officer believed to have died in the attack.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon announced on Thursday that 125 service members and civilians were missing and presumed dead, raising the death toll here to 189 people, including 64 passengers and crew members aboard the hijacked plane, American Airlines Flight 77.</p>
        <p>As part of the national day of mourning, the Pentagon held memorial services in the auditorium on the fifth floor, still soiled with soot and grime.</p>
        <p>Men and women bowed their heads in prayer, let the tears fall freely and occasionally glanced at the rescue cranes outside.</p>
        <p>Speakers and clergy members led hundreds of civilians and military men and women in prayers or talked of their own experiences.</p>
        <p>Addressing one of the services, Maj. Gen. Robert Van Antwerp Jr. of the Army said his secretary and administrative assistant were killed in the attack. ''I am experiencing some of the same emotions that many of you are,'' General Van Antwerp said. ''My heart pains for you.''</p>
        <p>In the crowd of more than 250 people spilling into an adjoining corridor was Christine Wormuth, a civilian employee on maternity leave. She went to the service with her 4-month-old twin daughters, squirming in their stroller.</p>
        <p>''I had to come,'' Ms. Wormuth said. ''I have friends who lost their friends. We are all family.''</p>
        <p>The ceremony ended with a mournful rendition of ''God Bless America,'' adding to the air of a wake with bodies still buried under the rubble nearby. Throughout the day, more remains were found, but officials said it was impossible to estimate how many bodies had been uncovered.</p>
        <p>They did provide the first assessment of the state of the Pentagon itself. The air quality has returned to normal, Mr. Irby said, with acceptable levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde and airborne asbestos.</p>
        <p>The soot-filled filters in the air ventilation systems were changed, he said. The electrical and air-conditioning systems were working well in the inhabited parts of the building, because electricians began working on the system minutes after the plane struck.</p>
        <p>''The Pentagon is an amazing building,'' he said. ''You just learn to love the building like a sailor loves his ship.''</p>
        <p>But parts of the building could still collapse, James Schwartz, assistant chief of the Arlington County fire department, said.</p>
        <p>''We continue efforts to shore up the building.'' Chief Schwartz said. ''It's extremely crucial that we make sure that we have a structurally sound area to work in so that we are not putting the rescuers at further risk.''</p>
        <p>Chief Schwartz also offered hope that they might find some of the missing alive under the rubble. ''We have a realistic expectation that there are live victims in there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, announced that most of those missing from the Army had worked in the offices for personnel and administrative organization.</p>
        <p>General Shinseki also spoke for his soldiers for the first time.</p>
        <p>''All of us understand what we expect warfare might be,'' he said,  ''but the visit of this kind of tragedy on innocents back here in our homeland has struck a nerve. We're in pain. We're also angry.''</p>
