        <p>LEAD: At the height of summer here a decade ago, the algae bloomed continually on Lake Waramaug. ''You'd step in the water and your toes became invisible,'' recalled Thomas A. J. McGowan.</p>
        <p>At the height of summer here a decade ago, the algae bloomed continually on Lake Waramaug. ''You'd step in the water and your toes became invisible,'' recalled Thomas A. J. McGowan.</p>
        <p>This summer, while the algae are still around, their blooms are both less frequent and less intense, and the waters are clearer. Visibility, once as little as a foot, is nine and a half feet, according to town officials, who use a device that vaguely resembles a barber's pole to measure just how far into the lake the average eye can see.</p>
        <p>''We're on the brink of moving Waramaug one step backward in the evolutionary cycle,'' said Mr. McGowan, the executive director of a task force formed by Warren and the neighboring towns of Washington and Kent to clean the lake.</p>
        <p>The improvements at Lake Waramaug, the second-largest natural lake in Connecticut, are due in part to a $500,000 pumping system that helps trap the nutrients that algae feed on and to return oxygenated water to the lake. Reviving Dying Lakes</p>
        <p>The system, installed eight years ago largely with Federal and state funds, is one of the more elaborate steps taken by several towns here in the northwestern hills of Connecticut and elsewhere in the Northeast to revive dying lakes.</p>
        <p>The system has clearly helped curtail algal blooms in Lake Waramaug, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency is considering financing similar systems for other lakes, said Warren K. Howard, the coordinator of the clean-lakes program in the agency's New England office in Boston. But how widespread the systems might become is not certain because of their cost.</p>
        <p>The other steps the towns have taken to clean their lakes vary from cosmetic approaches, like removing weeds and algae with harvesting machines or chemicals, to attacking the sources of algal growth with microorganisms or dredging equipment.</p>
        <p>But Judith F. Taggart, executive secretary of the North American Lake Management Society, a private organization in Washington, said these steps can have only limited success while people continue to encourage algae growth by allowing run-off from fertilizers or septic systems to enter the lakes.</p>
        <p>''People simply need to be more aware of the geography around them,'' Mrs. Taggart said. A Natural Cycle of Decline Here at Lake Waramaug, the natural cycle of decline to which Mr. McGowan referred - known as eutrophication -had in fact been accelerated for years by human activities, particularly farming and residential development along the lake's shore, as well as droppings from a growing population of Canada geese. All are heavy sources of phosphorous, which spurs the growth of the algae. Algae, in turn, take oxygen from the lake, leading to its decay.</p>
        <p>The algae build-ups in lakes are generally not harmful to people, although the blooms are both unsightly and odorous. Over time, however, the blooms can decimate fish populations.</p>
        <p>The two pumping stations at the 672-acre Lake Waramaug, part of what is formally called a hypolimnetic withdrawal system, handle a total of 5 million gallons a day. The pipes withdraw nutrient-rich waste water near the bottom of the lake, replacing it with well-oxygenated surface water. The waste water is then treated. Pumping surface water to the bottom helps strengthen thermal barriers in the lake, trapping much of the phosphorous below, where algae at the warmer levels nearer the surface cannot get at it.</p>
        <p>The system was designed by Robert Kortmann, a limnologist - a scientist who studies fresh-water lakes - and guest lecturer at the University of Connecticut. Neighborly Cooperation</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the lake, at Sucker Brook and several other streams leading into it, basins have been dug to catch the phosphorous-enriched sediment that would otherwise empty into the water, said Janet M. Bates, the chairwoman of the Lake Waramaug Task Force. And the owners of inns, private homes and farms along the lake have generally cooperated in cutting the flow of phosphorous into the lake by controlling the amount of fertilizer they use for crops and on lawns and by improving septic systems.</p>
        <p>Aside from a desire to preserve the beauty and recreational value of the lake, the motivation that led to the formation of the task force was economic, Mr. McGowan said. The inns and restaurants and the country club and state park along Lake Waramuag have generated almost $10 million a year in taxes and other income for the towns.</p>
        <p>Algal blooms and other problems associated with eutrophication are by no means confined to Lake Waramaug.</p>
        <p>A study by the State Department of Environmental Protection, begun eight years ago, identified at least 70 lakes in Connecticut with potential algae problems; nine of those are considered to be in improved condition today, but 13 are worse and the rest are unchanged. Defense Against Acid Rain</p>
        <p>Acid rain has affected a few of the state's lakes, but nowhere near as badly as in upstate New York. The reason, several environmental officials say, is both because the area is less exposed to the pollutants that fall with acid rain and because much of the soil around Connecticut's lakes is rich with acid-neutralizing limestone.</p>
        <p>The state recently began accepting grant applications for a $1 million lake management trust fund set up last year by the General Assembly. Under the program, towns or lake associations can apply for funds to analyze eutrophication or pollution and to develop solutions.</p>
        <p>The approaches used elsewhere in northwest Connecticut range from the mundane to the intriguing, and from the invisible to the eye-catching. At Bantam Lake in Morris, the largest natural lake in the state, a dredger has long been in operation. The machine slowly combs the bottom of the lake, which is relatively shallow, gathering sediment and depositing it onshore.</p>
        <p>Other towns have experimented with chemicals like copper sulfate that kill algae, but these are only a stopgap measure because they do nothing to attack the source of the problem. Moreover, some chemicals can be toxic to other marine life. Scooping Algae, and a Bathtub</p>
        <p>One of the more unusual attempts to bring back clear lakes can be seen in Salisbury, at the very northwest corner of the state. There, a large machine, bearing a passing resemblance to the Zamboni ice-cleaning machine used on hockey rinks, regularly plies the waters of Lake Wononskopomuc and Twin Lakes, scooping up weeds and algae and dumping them back on land.</p>
        <p>Again, the effect is mainly cosmetic, because the machine does not deal with the elements that create algal blooms, said Edward R. Davis, a biology teacher at the Hotchkiss School in town, where he has been teaching students about the problems at the lake for 15 years. Mr. Davis designed a small treatment system, used for several years, that was something of a forerunner to the one now in use at Lake Waramaug.</p>
        <p>''The thing's a lot of fun,'' Mr. Davis said of the weed harvester, which has scooped up snapping turtles and an old bathtub. ''But as a scientist, I can tell you it has only a minor impact on reversing the eutrophication process. Weed carcasses don't have that many nutrients for algae.''</p>
