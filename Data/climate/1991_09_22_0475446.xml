        <p>I LOVE WHITE PORTUGUESE wine more than claret," Jonathan Swift wrote to his beloved Stella. "I have a sad vulgar appetite."</p>
        <p>Not a man to mince words, Dean Swift. But, one suspects, he was also a bit of a snob. In his day, in the first half of the 18th century, England drank five times more Portuguese wine than French. It was the vin ordinaire of that epoch.

        <p>I LOVE WHITE PORTUGUESE wine more than claret," Jonathan Swift wrote to his beloved Stella. "I have a sad vulgar appetite."</p>
        <p>Not a man to mince words, Dean Swift. But, one suspects, he was also a bit of a snob. In his day, in the first half of the 18th century, England drank five times more Portuguese wine than French. It was the vin ordinaire of that epoch. Thanks to Hanoverian import duties and the Whigs who imposed them, claret -- red Bordeaux -- was more expensive than caviar is today; only aristocrats could afford it.</p>
        <p>Once relations with France had improved, the English abandoned Portuguese wines. Except, of course, for Port, which they concocted as an early substitute for central heating.</p>
        <p>Portuguese wines have never quite recovered from the snub. They have been dismissed as second-raters for two centuries. And, in truth, they've often lived up -- or, rather, down -- to their reputation.</p>
        <p>There is an interesting paradox associated with Portuguese wine. Ask a fellow who drinks an occasional glass of wine if he likes Portuguese wine -- other than Port, that is -- and you will get a blank stare. Ask him if he likes Lancers or Mateus Rose, and his face will light up. Americans who care little about wine drink millions of gallons of these pink, fizzy, commercial blends. Meanwhile, the best Portuguese wines go begging. Wine enthusiasts, who take pride in their eclectic tastes, ignore them.</p>
        <p>The modern equivalent of Jonathan Swift's white wine is vinho verde, or green wine. It's not really green, of course, but has a slightly greenish tinge. At its best, it's light, fresh, sharp and slightly fizzy. At its worst, it is sweet, sulphured and gets its fizz from carbon dioxide. There are some single-estate vinho verdes, but most of the wine is made by cooperatives in the Minho region in northern Portugal, between the Duoro River and the border with Galicia in Spain. The cooperatives buy both grapes and wine from small producers and blend it. Vinho verde is a wine to be consumed young, preferably close to where it's made. It matches well with the good fish caught along the Portuguese coast.</p>
        <p>There is also a red vinho verde that is drunk mostly in Portugal and usually exported only to countries with large overseas Portuguese colonies. The grapes included vinhao, azal tinto and espadeiro. How do the Portuguese justify the name? They don't bother to try.</p>
        <p>The largest wine region is the Estremadura, but the best reds come from the Dao, from Bairrada and from Colares. The Dao, which is south of the Port-producing Duoro region, was Portugal's first Government-authenticated red-wine district, the first to produce serious vinho maduro, the term used for matured wine. Most of the Dao wines are merchants' blends bearing brand names rather than those of the grapes or individual producers. The wines are usually sold when they are about four years old. Traditionally, they are hard wines that need years to mature. Modern vinification methods have made them more drinker-friendly.</p>
        <p>Wine has been made in Portugal at least since Roman times, but the Bairrada was not declared a demarcated region until 1979. It lies between the Dao and the Atlantic Ocean, and the sea mists, by moderating the normally torrid Portuguese climate, contribute much-needed acidity to the wine. Portuguese viticulturists say the basis of the Barraida wines' quality is its principal grape, the baga, which they say gives the wine color, fruit and longevity. Caves Alianca is a Bairrada producer whose label is often seen in this country.</p>
        <p>Some of Portugal's more interesting red wines come from Colares, west of Lisbon on the coast. One could say literally on the coast, because the vines grow on the beach, in the sand. The vines creep along the ground behind low stone walls and woven straw fences that protect them from the wind. The wines are intense, almost black in color, and take years to mature. When they do, they are said to be Portugal's best red wines.</p>
        <p>Lisbon is virtually surrounded by vineyards. Directly to the west is the Carcavelos area that produces a sweet, amber-colored wine. Bucelas, north of Lisbon, produces a pleasant but inconsequential white wine. Southwest, across the Tagus bridge, is the Setubal area, which produces one of the finest muscat wines in the world. Called, not suprisingly, Moscatel de Setubal, it is a wine that lasts for many years, improving in tastes and complexity as it ages.</p>
        <p>While most Portuguese table wines are commercial blends, there are a few outstanding single estates. One of them, Bussaco, comes from the Bairrada region and is made only for the Palace Hotel in Bussaco, which is south of Oporto, near the spa resort of Luso. The wine, red and white, is made by the hotel's manager, Jose Rodrigues dos Santos, and is aged and bottled in the hotel's cellars.</p>
        <p>Barca Velha, the old barge, is a red wine made from grapes grown in the remote Alto Duoro, where the grapes for Port are also grown. The estate is owned by descendants of Dona Antonia Ferreira, the doyenne of the Ferreira Port concern, and is vinified by Ferreira wine makers. Each vintage is aged up to two years in new Portuguese oak casks. It can take years to mature in the bottle, and is only released when the man who created the wine in the 1950's, Fernando Nicolau de Almeida, decides it's ready. Only 10 vintages have so far been released: 1953, 1954, 1957, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1978, 1981, 1982 and 1983. Lesser vintages sometimes turn up in a wine called Reserva Especial Ferreirinha.</p>
        <p>In Portugal, as in almost every other important wine-making region in the world, the famous Bordeaux grapes like cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc are being planted alongside the indigenous varietals and giving them stiff competition. Bacalhoa, a red wine from a vineyard in Setubal that is owned by Americans, is made entirely from cabernet sauvignon and merlot and has been rated one of Portugal's best single-estate wines.</p>
        <p>Whatever it does for local pride, using the Bordeaux varieties is a boon for wine writers. Wine writers, that is, who know nothing of the local varieties like baga, tinta pinheira, bastardo, trincadeira, tinta roriz, touriga francesa, touriga nacional, alicante and periquita. To name a few. So as they say in Portugal, Saude.</p>
