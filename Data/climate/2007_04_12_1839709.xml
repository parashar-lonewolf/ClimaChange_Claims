        <p>New York and six other Northeastern states announced yesterday that they have joined in a regional pact to try to force the federal government to enact tougher standards on mercury emissions.</p>
        <p>Claiming that they have done about as much as they can to reduce mercury pollution within their own borders, the states plan to focus on airborne mercury that drifts into the region from the Midwest, particularly from those states where coal-fired power plants are the prime source of electricity.</p>
        <p>The Northeastern states acknowledge that they have little power to force other states to reduce smokestack emissions. But by banding together, they hope to pressure the federal government to enact national standards.</p>
        <p>''The states can do a great deal on their own, but they cannot solve the problem,'' said Pete Grannis, the new commissioner of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. ''But New York and its sister states can gang up on Washington to force the administration's hand to move ahead on this.''</p>
        <p>Northeastern states have already tried a similar approach to compel Washington to act on environmental issues. In December 2005, New York and six other states formed a Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to curtail smokestack emissions that contribute to global climate change.</p>
        <p>Several other states subsequently expressed their intention to join the group or form their own, increasing pressure on the federal government.</p>
        <p>Under the draft mercury plan announced yesterday, the states would use provisions of the federal Clean Water Act to establish maximum levels of mercury that local lakes and rivers could absorb.</p>
        <p>Calculations of those maximum levels would recognize that the majority of mercury pollution in the region comes from other states.</p>
        <p>Thus, for the Northeastern states to meet federal clean water standards, the other states would have to reduce the amount of mercury they put into the air.</p>
        <p>''We have to remind the administration that this is a serious and ongoing problem,'' Mr. Grannis said. ''The federal government needs to come in and set national standards.''</p>
        <p>Besides New York, the states cooperating in the mercury agreement are Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. The states worked with the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission to put together the draft plan.</p>
        <p>Throughout the Northeast, mercury contamination has become a growing health concern. Mercury is a metal that occurs naturally. It is released in a gaseous form when coal is burned in electrical generating plants. Smokestack emissions drift across state borders, and the mercury lands far from where it was released.</p>
        <p>As the mercury falls on lakes and streams, it becomes methylmercury, a neurotoxin that accumulates in fish, with concentrations increasing in larger fish that eat smaller ones.</p>
        <p>The presence of harmful levels of mercury has led to health advisories limiting the consumption of sport fish taken from thousands of lakes, rivers and streams in the Northeast. In New York State, most of the lakes and streams in the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains are posted with consumption advisories because of excessive mercury levels.</p>
        <p>In recent years, New York has taken several actions to reduce or eliminate mercury contamination. The state has adopted tough air control standards to reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants within its borders by 90 percent by 2015, far exceeding existing federal regulations.</p>
        <p>The state has also tried to reduce the amount of elemental mercury in the environment by requiring dentists to collect and recycle mercury in dental fillings so that it is not flushed down drains or thrown into the trash.</p>
        <p>According to the draft plan, reducing the amount of mercury contamination in the region by 86 percent to 98 percent would cause the amount of mercury in fish to decline to levels at which consumption advisories could be lifted.</p>
        <p>Public hearings on the draft plan will be held in New York State on May 2 to 4. Locations for the hearings, and a copy of the draft plan, are available on the Department of Environmental Conservation Web site, www.dec.state.ny.us.</p>
