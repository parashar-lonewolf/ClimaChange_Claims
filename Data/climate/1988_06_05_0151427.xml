        <p>LEAD: TIME is shrinking. I don't know if someone is stealing it or if there's a conspiracy going on. Whether it's cooked up by our Government or another, on this planet or another, it's of cosmic proportions.</p>
        <p>TIME is shrinking. I don't know if someone is stealing it or if there's a conspiracy going on. Whether it's cooked up by our Government or another, on this planet or another, it's of cosmic proportions.</p>
        <p>You never have enough time anymore. You used to be able to do more in less time. You never used to run out of it so fast or so soon. Ask anyone and you will get a nod of agreement and a complaint that he or she does not have enough time to do anything.</p>
        <p>Even owners of $2,000 watches have not bought time. They've only bought a watch that does the same thing a $20 watch does. Time ticks away just as fast on a Rolex as on a Swatch.</p>
        <p>In Ecclesiastes we read that there is ''a time to every purpose under the heaven'' but find no mention of where we are to find the time for them all. It mentions a time to be born and a time to die but makes no reference to a time to answer mail or a time to return phone calls.</p>
        <p>Is there some metaphysical law that is making time spin faster these days? Is time suddenly following the shorter inner lap of a circular track?</p>
        <p>I had always heard that the older you get, the faster time flies. Yet, I meet many younger people who complain as vociferously as their elders: ''Where does the time go?''</p>
        <p>True, as I get older I find I need less sleep - the one great advantage of aging and one that, according to mathematical principles, should result in my having more time. Inexplicably, it doesn't.</p>
        <p>I used to get more done in a day, even an hour, than I do now. I used to have enough time to read the newspaper everyday and Sunday, even to work on the crossword puzzle. I used to have time to bake bread, visit with friends or talk with them on the telephone.</p>
        <p>No longer can I find time for a leisurely lunch or a chatty telephone conversation. Those conversations have deteriorated to messages bordered by beeps on ubiquitous answering machines - machines that talk to each other in much less friendly tones than I used to chat with my friends. Needless to say, I never write a letter. As for incoming mail, I barely have time to check nine-tenths of it before I throw it out unopened.</p>
        <p>It is not as if I am wasting time. Dinner and housework are simplified to the point of primitive. No candles on the table, no tablecloth, no complicated recipes. I no longer polish silver. (I never ironed.) In fact, I barely use dishes. It saves time.</p>
        <p>Access to an automatic washing machine and dryer means that I do not have to spend long hours kneeling on a rock by a river or bending over a washboard scrubbing laundry as women once did.</p>
        <p>A microwave oven reduces meal preparation time by 90 percent.</p>
        <p>An automobile speeds me to and from work at 55 miles an hour or more, often on roads that once boasted speed limits of 35.</p>
        <p>A computer is supposed to save me time, yet here I am writing this looking into a screen with little green letters and a magic cursor and I am still short of time.</p>
        <p>As a student, I must have read the equivalent of one book a night. Now I barely finish a book in two weeks. It's not as if I'm flipping through magazines instead. I've canceled all subscriptions rather than watch with growing frustration as issue upon issue piles up around me, walling me in like the victim in Poe's ''Cask of Amontillado.'' Remember words like ''stroll?'' When did you last amble over to your neighbor's? I don't even know my neighbor. I don't have the time! Today, if we use our legs to take us to our destination, we run, jog or racewalk. So where does the time go? Could rainfall be shrinking time as if it were an un-Sanforized cotton shirt? Are chemicals in our environment altering our perception of time and making us merely think we're losing it? Is one group cornering the market on time the way they have with money? Time is money, the saying goes, making such a conclusion more apparent.</p>
        <p>Is time vanishing along with melting polar ice caps? Or is it disappearing because of mistrals and tornadoes, the Gulf Stream, the rise in sea level, the decline in the whale population, volcanic activity, the drag caused by the widening of the San Andreas fault or the loss of drag caused by a diminishing ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The logician Kurt Godel maintained that the passage of time is an illusion, that our sense of time, like our sense of color, is but a form of perception. The device known as a clock can only measure objective time. What we consider an hour is no more than a measurement in space, an arc of 15 degrees in our planet's daily rotation.</p>
        <p>According to Einstein, subjective time is not measurable. It goes fast when we're happy and slow when we're not. Yet, I find that time speeds away just as fast when I am plodding along the valleys of depression, sadness or worry as when I am dancing atop Mount Euphoria.</p>
        <p>In the Woody Allen movie ''Annie Hall,'' little Alvie Singer thought he had something to worry about. ''The universe is expanding,'' he bemoaned.</p>
        <p>To which his mother replied: ''What is that your business? You're here in Brooklyn. Brooklyn is not expanding.''</p>
        <p>Like Alvie, I could begin to worry that, if time is shrinking, it could disappear entirely, and we could disappear with it. If that is the case, it might not be so bad. Perhaps we would find ourselves in some other dimension, one free of hurry and worry, violence and corruption, a dimension timeless and unblemished.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, all I can do is heed Herrick's time-tested advice and gather my rosebuds while I may. If I can just find the time.</p>
