        <p>After a year in which industry and environmental groups have been at war over Republican-led efforts to roll back Federal environmental regulations, a Presidential panel with adversaries from both sides has reached a rare consensus that while the existing system can be improved, it must not be weakened.</p>
        <p>Rather than strip away many environmental regulations, as Republicans in Congress tried to do last fall, the panel calls for a new regulatory framework to give businesses more flexibility in preventing pollution -- but only if they  can perform better than is required under the current system of strict safeguards.</p>
        <p>The group included two sides that are more likely to be found in court than  at a negotiating table: leading companies in the oil, paper and chemical industries, all of which have supported Republican proposals for regulatory relief, and major environmental organizations that have accused the industries of trying to undo 25 years of progress. It also included members of President Clinton's Cabinet and labor and civil rights groups.</p>
        <p>In its final report, the panel, the President's Council on Sustainable Development, also calls for a comprehensive review of taxes and corporate subsidies, aimed at increasing taxes on pollution and consumption in exchange for cutting income taxes.</p>
        <p>It urges long-range steps to stabilize the country's population, including more Federal money for family-planning and contraceptive research. And it says the United States, "even in the face of scientific uncertainty," should lead the world in heading off serious or irreparable global trends like climate change.</p>
        <p>The report will be issued by the White House in the next few weeks, and in the months ahead it appears destined to serve as the environmental platform for  Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign. Members of the council, created by the President in 1993, gave a copy of the report to The New York Times.</p>
        <p>For months, Mr. Clinton has been striving to make environmentalism a key issue separating him from the Republicans. The report offers him a coherent environmental credo that is not anchored in the status quo and that draws support not only from liberals but also from businesses.</p>
        <p>"Implicitly, this denounces the kind of work that the Congress has been up to for a year," said Kathleen A. McGinty, who heads the White House Council on Environmental Quality and who as Mr. Clinton's top environmental aide worked closely with the President's Council on Sustainable Development.</p>
        <p>"The environment is something that brings us together as a nation. It is a deplorable idea to use it to polarize the nation."</p>
        <p>The President's council spent three years touring the country and debating how to balance economic growth and environmental protection. Among the members were leaders of environmental organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund, and executives of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, the Enron Corporation, and the Chevron Corporation.</p>
        <p>"The current polarization is just the reason why our agreement is important," wrote the council's co-chairmen, Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, and David T. Buzzelli, vice president of the Dow Chemical Corporation.</p>
        <p>At the outset, council members could not even agree on the basic issue of whether economic growth in itself was a good thing, they recalled.</p>
        <p>The report binds no one and the recommendations are often vaguely couched, but these weaknesses may be offset by the political power of a joint statement from such an unlikely coalition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has already begun to adopt the report's language, as he did in calling for tough but flexible environmental standards in his State of the Union speech in January. And some of the report's language is unmistakably redolent of the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>"Americans want to take back control of their lives," the report proclaims, at once acknowledging and endorsing a shift of environmental power and responsibility away from the government and toward individuals and enterprises.</p>
        <p>The report's chapter on regulations is perhaps the most pertinent to the current political debate.</p>
        <p>"We didn't start the conversation by asking, 'What are we going to roll back?' " said Mr. Buzzelli of Dow Chemical. "You have to say, 'What do we have that is worth keeping, and what do we really need to do to get better?' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Lash of the World Resources Institute added, "There was a strong feeling  on the council that if you pull the foundation stones out, it is really hard to  go ahead and build a new building."</p>
        <p>Republicans in Congress, strongly supported by business groups, tried and failed last year to undo many environmental regulations, provoking an intense struggle with environmentalists and the Clinton Administration. While Republican leaders have promised to try once again to push through changes this  year, the momentum is going against them, and they are likely to take a more moderate approach.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, however, many business leaders have begun advising Republicans in Congress that they should scale back their earlier proposals, if  they expect to succeed in providing any regulatory relief to industry.</p>
        <p>The President's council shares some of the goals but few of the methods of the Republican approach, which would have changed how existing environmental laws are carried out by imposing elaborate new studies of costs and benefits, and by opening up new opportunities for industry to challenge burdensome rules in court.</p>
        <p>Instead, the council called for adding, not stripping away, a layer of environmental protection. The current system of standards, deadlines, permits, and inspections, while it might be modified, would be retained as a kind of safety net. At a higher level of performance, companies would be free to innovate.</p>
        <p>To this end, the report endorsed using financial incentives instead of dictates to discourage pollution, and putting more emphasis on results than on how they are obtained. The aim is less costly, but not less effective, pollution control -- and, wherever possible, preventing pollution rather than spending to  clean it up.</p>
        <p>"Regulations that specify performance standards based on strong protection of health and the environment -- but without mandating the means of compliance -- give companies and communities flexibility to find the most cost-effective way to achieve environmental goals," the report said.</p>
        <p>"But this flexibility must be coupled with accountability and enforcement to  insure that public health and the environment are safeguarded."</p>
        <p>It called for giving agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency specific authority to move away from "one size fits all" regulations. But it warned that a proliferation of pilot programs and demonstration projects would drive the agency's budget up, not down, as Congress has tried to do.</p>
        <p>In interviews, members of the council said the report was no less important for having steered clear of detailed prescriptions for new policies, new legislation, or new programs. Instead, they said the council chose to cite ground-breaking programs that are already getting results, often without much publicity.</p>
        <p>The "most important finding" of the council, the report said, is that new approaches can work only if they are based on collaboration and consensus.</p>
        <p>That has been a consistent refrain of the Clinton Administration all along, but one that has not always worked as hoped. In disputes over issues like forestry and automobile efficiency, some of the Administration's previous efforts at building consensus were disappointing.</p>
        <p>The early arguments over whether growth was good or bad finally were answered in the very first words of the statement of beliefs that all the members finally endorsed:</p>
        <p>"To achieve our vision of sustainable development, some things must grow -- jobs, productivity, wages, capital and savings, profits, information, knowledge  and education -- and others -- pollution, waste and poverty -- must not."</p>
        <p>That formulation, obvious as it might seem, drove the group toward a central  conclusion: that efficiency, profit and environmental protection are all linked. "Pollution is waste, waste is inefficient, and inefficiency is expensive," they  summed up.</p>
