        <p>By the time I first went to see Paul O'Neill this past fall, a lot of people in Washington had written him off. He'd been secretary of the treasury for less than a year, and in that time he had received painfully bad press. The harshest protests against him came in the conservative media. The National Review had called for his resignation. The Wall Street Journal had run a pair of front-page articles saying that he was a boob whose mere presence undermined confidence in the financial markets. The New York Post had published a report that Vice President Cheney had met with possible successors, specifically Donald Marron, chairman of UBS America.</p>
        <p>O'Neill himself, on CNBC, when told of the New York Post report, said, ''Hallelujah.'' The Treasury Department spokeswoman, Michele Davis, said, ''He meant it as a joke,'' though she added that she has long since given up hope that people will take a nuanced view of anything her boss says. His tendency to say things that treasury secretaries never say had turned him into a figure of fun.</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney poked his head out of his cave to tell me that the reports in The New York Post were ''total garbage'' and that O'Neill was welcome to keep his job as long as he wanted. President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card, told me that ''the president is really pleased with the job Paul is doing.'' O'Neill's chief of staff, Tim Adams, told me, with a knowing smile: ''The White House has never complained about O'Neill. Not once. And I can guarantee you that O'Neill won't be the first to go. He won't be the second or the third either.'' The White House even let it be known that the president was sufficiently irritated by the rumor in The New York Post of O'Neill's being on the way out that he'd had the rumor tracked down to its supposed source -- a public-relations person hired by . . . Donald Marron.</p>
        <p>None of this has had the slightest effect on O'Neill's predicament. Because the people who determine O'Neill's fate are unable to express the slightest dissatisfaction without communicating total despair, the people who interpret what they say ignore everything but the bad news and assume that any support expressed for the man is a case of What else are they going to say? A treasury secretary -- or any other senior cabinet member -- will always officially be doing a great job right up until the moment he is fired. There's a signaling problem between the White House and the press, and in the Bush White House it is worse than in most, because the Bush people don't speak to the press in anything but the official tone of voice. They've shut down the sneaky little off-the-record chats through which the truth finds its way into print.</p>
        <p>And so the White House's communications strategy has had the reverse of the intended effect. I've never had so many important people express such confidence in another human being as senior Bush people expressed to me about Paul O'Neill, but for all I know he'll be gone by the time you read this.</p>
        <p>When he left his job as chairman of Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum manufacturer, and became treasury secretary, O'Neill moved from a world in which he exerted near total control over his environment -- and on which he was able to impose his own sense of reality -- to a world in which he was virtually hostage to other people's perceptions of him. And he knew it. Yet despite knowing it, he bulled ahead anyway with his own idea about how things should be done. He may not be the first corporate big shot who has refused to acknowledge the difference between his old job in business and his new job in government. But he is the only one I can think of whose refusal is perfectly intentional. You can laugh at him, but if you do, you'll miss the whole point of him.</p>
        <p>THE O'NEILL RÉSUMÉ  O'Neill was offered the job in a hurry in December 2000. His name, pushed by Dick Cheney, was a surprise, as he had done nothing to help Bush be elected -- hadn't even given him money. But Bush was unhappy with the list of Wall Street big shots he was given. The red-map/blue-map distinction is more of a cultural phenomenon than a financial one; there are red-map rich people and blue-map rich people. Wall Street people are blue-map Americans. O'Neill is a creature of red-map America, about as far as you could get from Wall Street and still be in the land of the rich, which Bush liked. It also didn't hurt that O'Neill was a friend of Alan Greenspan's.</p>
        <p>O'Neill proves that there is more than one species of Main Street chamber of commerce Republican. He began his career, oddly enough, as an employee of the United States government. He was studying computer systems at Fresno State University in the mid-1950's when, as a lark, he followed a friend into a California post office and applied for a government internship. Three hundred thousand other people applied for an internship, 3,000 were invited to take a standardized test, 300 were granted interviews and 30 were given jobs. O'Neill was one of the 30. Had he not wandered into the post office, O'Neill says, he would have wound up in the construction business back in Alaska, where he had gone to high school and met his wife.</p>
        <p>He began at the bottom rung of the Veterans Administration in 1961. For the next 20 years -- except for a year off to acquire a master's of public administration at Indiana University -- he climbed the ranks of the civil service, until, in the Ford administration, he became deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget (where he met Cheney, Greenspan and Donald Rumsfeld). You can waste a lot of time looking for foreshadowings of his current problems back then. ''It was one of those jobs where you were always on a hot seat,'' says Bo Cutter, who now works as a venture capitalist but who, more than 25 years ago, as Jimmy Carter's deputy director of O.M.B., was the Democrat who succeeded O'Neill. ''You were always having to make tough decisions, and to deal with huge egos, to make sure that politics didn't lead to bad decisions. I could see that O'Neill hadn't been just good at it. He'd been fantastic.''</p>
        <p>When Carter took office, O'Neill, at the age of 41 and for the first time in his life, entered the private sector. His subsequent success caused a lot of people to forget he had ever had a career in the public sector. He had gone from career civil servant to C.E.O. of a midsize company, International Paper, inside of a decade. (He had been elevated to that job from another one inside the company by a board that included his old friend Greenspan.) He was then brought into a giant company, Alcoa, and became the first person to run it who hadn't worked there all his life. When I asked senior Treasury officials what struck them most about their new boss, several mentioned this out-of-left-field quality to his rise. ''This isn't a guy who went to Harvard or Yale and had life handed to him on a silver platter,'' said David Aufhauser, the Treasury's general counsel. ''This is a guy who went to Fresno State and began as a career civil servant.''</p>
        <p>O'NEILL'S LIST OF REASONS NOT TO TAKE THE JOB  O'Neill had just turned 65 and was resigning as chairman of Alcoa when he heard from Cheney. Cheney recalls that when he offered the Treasury job to O'Neill, O'Neill told him, flatly, no. He had other plans. Of course, O'Neill must have known that Cheney wouldn't leave it at that, and of course he didn't. Cheney asked O'Neill to come to Washington from his home in Pittsburgh to meet President Bush.</p>
        <p>O'Neill prides himself on thinking analytically about big, complex problems. He has spent all of his working life in meetings with other guys in suits, and in these meetings he is inevitably the one who has the most data at his fingertips and who has thought the most about the problem under discussion. Or, if he isn't, he has everyone else believing that he is. As his youngest daughter, Julie Kloo, says, ''My father is the sort of person who can, like, quote numbers from the 1977 federal budget.''</p>
        <p>Now the problem to solve was his own future, and so, characteristically, he set about analyzing his aversion to being Bush's treasury secretary. He wrote down all the reasons he did not want to be and should not be. When he was finished, the list came to three single-spaced pages. Then he flew to Washington to eat a hotel breakfast with Cheney and Bush.</p>
        <p>The breakfast wasn't a great deal different in spirit from the job interviews Bush had with most of the top shelf in his cabinet. Ashcroft was his own peculiar story, but Rumsfeld, Colin Powell and Cheney, like O'Neill, didn't need the job. Lord, how they didn't need the job! Each of them had somewhere between $50 million and $300 million and status to burn. All of them could plausibly approach their government as if it needed them more than they needed it.</p>
        <p>When he heard about O'Neill's list, Cheney had to be pleased: if you don't want a job, you don't bother making a three-page list of the reasons you won't take that job. Besides, the vice president had put himself through exactly the same exercise. ''Paul came loaded for bear with all the reasons he didn't want the job,'' Cheney says. ''I'd spent five years as the C.E.O. of a major company, so I knew where he was coming from. I had my own list, too.'' Of course he did! The first requirement for a top job in the Bush administration was a long list of the reasons you didn't want it. (The only ambition Bush trusted was the kind he couldn't see.)</p>
        <p>Actually, when you boiled these lists down to their essential ingredients, they weren't very long at all. They all had the same few general objections. ''Cheney had the same list I had,'' O'Neill says, ''except his had three heart attacks on it.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill's list served another purpose -- in addition to giving Cheney and Bush a number of specific objections to overcome. It allowed him to believe he was taking the job on his own terms. O'Neill's list formed the basis of a social experiment. Implicitly, it asked an interesting question: what happens when a supremely successful businessman tries -- as a matter of both pride and principle -- to descend, rather than claw his way up, into politics?</p>
        <p>REASON NO. 1: 'WASHINGTON HAS CHANGED FOR THE WORSE SINCE I LEFT IT'  For many years, one of O'Neill's pet peeves has been the coarsening of public life caused, in his view, by a combination of bad journalistic incentives and what he calls ''that awful sense in both parties of 'We don't care what's right or wrong, all we care about is getting more of our kind elected.''' As a corporate big shot, he peppered his speeches with off-the-cuff outrage on this theme. For instance, here he is, in May 1999, addressing a group of his fellow business leaders:</p>
        <p>''I saw something over the weekend that suggested to me the depths of the problem . . . about the vice president's wife disclosing that because her son was nearly killed in an automobile accident she was treated for depression. And the reason -- at least the reason given by The New York Times -- for this disclosure is that it was important for her to get it out before it was disclosed . . . in the midst of a political campaign. And it made me think to myself -- we've gotten so accustomed to what's going on, we're not even shocked by the notion that someone not running for office, but someone related to someone running for office, has to pre-empt in order not to become a liability in a political campaign. I, myself, find it just remarkable that we seem to have been so sandpapered by our current way of conducting political business that we just don't scream in outrage at what's going on around us.''</p>
        <p>From the moment O'Neill took office, he set a different tone, or tried to. Maybe the biggest break he made with local conventions was in his attitude toward his own thoughts. He found it useful to air them in a fairly straightforward manner for public consideration -- and never mind what a treasury secretary is and is not meant to say. The list of things O'Neill has said that have undermined the confidence of the financial markets, or created the impression with reporters that he is undermining market confidence, which may amount to the same thing, is now so long that it cannot be fully appreciated in a single paragraph.</p>
        <p>The smaller category of O'Neillian indiscretion arises from his tendency to express certainty about inherently uncertain situations. Examples of this include his prediction not long after he took office that the Treasury wouldn't need to raise the debt ceiling before 2008 (it asked Congress to raise it Dec. 12), his prediction that the Bush administration, unlike the Clinton administration, wouldn't be bailing out third world countries that failed to repay their debts (four months into the job, he agreed to send $10 billion to Argentina) and his prediction after Sept. 11 that the stock market would hit new highs within 18 months. Even the people on Wall Street who get paid to predict where the stock market will be in 18 months don't know where the stock market will be in 18 months. When the treasury secretary pretends to know, he earns their disdain.</p>
        <p>But by far the larger category of O'Neill's indiscretions are the many things he has said that are true, and that most people know to be true, but that treasury secretaries are not supposed to say. Included here are (a) his observation that despite decades of treasury secretaries suggesting otherwise, the United States government does not pursue a ''strong dollar policy'' and that in any case the Treasury has no ability to affect the level of the dollar; (b) that the most recent House Republican economic-stimulus package is ''show business''; and (c) that the real trouble in Argentina is that ''they don't have any export industry to speak of. . . . And they like it that way.'' It's hard for sane people to see any problem with any of this. Some, for example, will point to the convulsion in the market for Argentina's bonds that followed that last remark. So what? It's now clear that the bonds would have convulsed anyway.</p>
        <p>But that isn't the point. To the financial-establishment mind, O'Neill's approach to Treasury Department big-shot-dom is a travesty. It violates the central tenet of Washington financial life: never use the English language to convey meaning. The idea is that the economy benefits when important financial policy makers preserve their mystique and that they do this only when they avoid saying what's on their minds. The assumption underpinning this behavior is that the financial markets need to feel as if there is someone somewhere who knows something that they don't and who can, in a pinch, fix things. Greenspan has made a living by saying nothing in the most complicated possible ways and letting other people infer his genius. O'Neill's immediate predecessors, Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, took a slightly more direct approach but still stopped well short of saying anything worth discussing. And in any case, Rubin, who created the model Summers followed, was genuinely so diffident that his opinions were never likely to get him into trouble.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, O'Neill instinctively takes the opposite view: that people are more likely to prosper if you develop positive opinions on subjects and tell them what you think in plain English. ''I thought there would be a bigger market here than there is for clarity of expression,'' O'Neill says. He remains incredulous about the outrage over some of his comments. Take his remark about the strong dollar. It was simple fact: the value of the dollar is determined in the long run not by some Treasury policy but by America's growth rate relative to that of other nations. ''But nobody wrote that,'' he says. ''Not one person. All they wrote was 'controversy!'''</p>
        <p>The first time I went to visit O'Neill, I felt professionally obliged to try to get him to say something he shouldn't. When a man, with a single slip of his tongue, can turn you into the envy of investigative reporters, you have to go into any discussion with him armed with banana peels. But this business of getting him to make a spectacle of himself wasn't easy; these horrible gaffes aren't provoked -- they pop out of the treasury secretary unbidden, and either you are there to immortalize them or you aren't.</p>
        <p>Which brings me to the time I caught him at his Bloomberg, the desktop financial-news machine.</p>
        <p>O'Neill has a phobia of closed office doors and keeps his own wide open, in case anyone wants to walk in. Having learned from his secretary that he had returned from lunch -- a little doorbell had gone off, alerting the secretary that he had slipped in through a back door -- I quietly poked my head inside his open door. There he stood with his back to me, about 20 yards away, jabbing at the keyboard on his Bloomberg. (The Bloomberg arrived with O'Neill. Rubin never had one.)</p>
        <p>I walked up behind the treasury secretary, and he gave a start, then let out a noise that fell somewhere between a chuckle and a giggle. He knew well enough that he shouldn't let me catch him at whatever he was doing, but he decided to go ahead and let me catch him anyway. When he smiles, which he often does, there is a trace of the imp about him.</p>
        <p>''I think I just made news,'' he said. He kept staring at the Bloomberg screen. He left a lunchtime meeting with Republican senators just 20 minutes before. ''I came out of the meeting with Grassley,'' he said now, referring to Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, ''and we were immediately surrounded by all these microphones.'' Into these, he said something about the stimulus package debate he was sure would cause trouble -- I never could find out what it was -- and the memory of it still lit his face with a grin. Then he walked out the door of the Senate and into his private car, which whisked him back to his office, where, just a few minutes later, he expected that he would already be able to read news of his indiscretion. When you are treasury secretary, you don't have to wait long for your feedback.</p>
        <p>On his Bloomberg, O'Neill brought up the page with the news of the moment and scanned the headlines for his name. It wasn't there. In a gesture that was clearly already second nature to him, he pulled up a search page and, with a single index finger, tapped in P-A-U-L H O' N-E-I-L-L. Up popped the many headlines from the past few days with his name in them, but none from that day. He skipped around cyberspace in the spirit of a boy who had just hurled a stone into a pond and was trying to count the ripples. It wasn't just a matter of principle with him to shock people with his iconoclasm. It gave him pleasure.</p>
        <p>REASON NO. 2: 'I'VE CHANGED SINCE I LEFT WASHINGTON'  O'Neill didn't put it that way to Cheney, of course. What he said was, that as the C.E.O. of a company with 145,000 employees, he had grown used to being the final word on any subject. People who have known O'Neill for a long time say that to understand his behavior as treasury secretary you have to understand that he wasn't just any old C.E.O. When he became C.E.O. of Alcoa in 1988, O'Neill knew nothing about aluminum, and Alcoa was in trouble. Just about everyone believed that it would soon be impossible to make stuff for a profit in America and that commodities like aluminum and steel would be supplied by poor countries with cheap labor. Alcoa's previous C.E.O. had tried, with ill effects, to wriggle out of the closing trap by buying other kinds of businesses and getting Alcoa out of aluminum. O'Neill took the opposite tack: he shed all the extraneous businesses and made nothing but aluminum. In the next 12 years, he doubled Alcoa's global market share and more than doubled its number of workers. After several years of depressed earnings in the early 90's, O'Neill took Alcoa from a profit of $4.8 million in 1993 to a profit of $1.5 billion in 2000. Along the way, he transformed Alcoa's manufacturing process and grafted his character and his beliefs onto the lives of its workers.</p>
        <p>He also created, pretty much by an act of will, a new corporate culture. How he did this is actually interesting, in view of how he has gone about his job at the Treasury. He began by making a big pain in the rear of himself. On his first day, he told Alcoa's executives that they weren't going to talk people into buying more aluminum and that they weren't going to be able to raise prices, so the only way to improve the company's fortunes was to lower its costs. And the only way to do that was with the cooperation of Alcoa's workers. And the only way to get that was to show them that you actually cared about them. And the only way to do that was actually to care about them. And the way to do that was to establish, as the first priority of Alcoa, the elimination of all job-related injuries. Any executive who didn't make worker safety his personal fetish -- a higher priority than profits -- would be fired.</p>
        <p>On his second day, O'Neill told the same executives that he was eliminating the longstanding practice of paying their membership dues at a Pittsburgh-area country club that excluded women and blacks. (The club soon went looking to scare up a few blacks.)</p>
        <p>Well before it became fashionable -- that is, before the Internet boom -- O'Neill replaced the old corporate hierarchy with a flatter management structure. It took him several years, and he was forced to fire a few otherwise useful people who refused to believe he was serious about worker safety, but he eventually established Alcoa as the world's safest place to work. (To give you an idea of what he achieved, Treasury Department employees, most of whom don't do much but sit at desks, missed work because of injury 20 times as often as Alcoa employees, most of whom work with molten lava and man-eating machinery.) He proved to the satisfaction of the people who worked for him that their old ideas of what was possible were based on artificial limits. What Alcoa achieved with worker safety became a metaphor that could be applied to attacking any goal, including the goal of lowering costs. And having persuaded the workers that he was on their side, they paid him back with greater efficiency.</p>
        <p>Pretty much everything O'Neill did at Alcoa reflected his belief that most hierarchical distinctions were nonsense. (The great exception was the big money he and other top executives earned.) He created a profit-sharing plan that was the same for hourly workers and managers. He got rid of the company's headquarters -- in which senior executives worked on top floors with lovely views of everything but ordinary workers -- and moved everyone into a building that he more or less designed to maximize face-to-face encounters between employees of every level. As a corporate boss, O'Neill took a wholly original view of an ancient business -- metal making -- imposed on it his idea of how it should work and changed people's lives.</p>
        <p>That's the short version of a more complicated story. But it's enough to help explain why when Dick Cheney called him there wasn't a trace of the post-office-to-O.M.B. civil servant left in him. He was 100 percent Captain of Industry. He had proved that if you had a taste for extreme measures and a strong will you could bring about big changes. Alcoa had imbued him with a new idea of the possible. And at the same time, Alcoa had grounded him in the real, the tangible, the measurable. That day in his office, when he had given up looking for whatever controversial thing he had said, he clicked back to the default page on his Bloomberg screens. Up popped the prices on the London Metals Exchange: aluminum, copper, tin. These prices are the first thing O'Neill checks every morning. I said that it surprised me that the guy who oversees the financial markets wasn't more interested in financial prices. ''This is the real down-to-the-ground stuff,'' he said. ''Not advertising and marketing and Hula-Hoops.'' Or, he might have added, stocks and bonds. ''Commodity prices tend to be a leading indicator,'' he said. ''And they're moving up.''</p>
        <p>In places where perception is conflated with reality, cause is often confused with effect. There is a tendency on Wall Street to see finance primarily as cause rather than effect -- a view that inflates the importance of people who work on Wall Street. O'Neill sees finance as effect rather than cause, and the people who work in it as cogs in a bigger machine. Even now, when you talk to people who work on Wall Street about O'Neill, they can't quite get past what he said about them in an interview he gave to The Wall Street Journal last January. In their paper, he described Wall Street professionals as ''people who sit in front of a flickering green screen'' and went on to say that those traders ''are not the sort of people you would want to help you think about complex questions.'' When The Journal asked him if he had ever worked in front of a flickering green screen, he said he hadn't, but ''I probably could learn in about a couple weeks.''</p>
        <p>It was a marvelous red-map moment: At Alcoa, O'Neill liked to say that he didn't focus on the company's stock price or even the bottom line but on the factors that led to the bottom line. Indeed, one reason O'Neill is disinclined to worry about the effect of his words on financial markets is that he doesn't think words affect financial markets -- not in any fundamental way. And even if they did, the financial markets are really beside the point. The point is the real down-to-the-ground stuff.</p>
        <p>To that end, O'Neill has tried to create a new and better view for himself of the U.S. economy by gathering more data about down-to-the-ground stuff. For instance, Treasury staffers are now busy trying to elicit from the big automobile companies real-time information about the effects of auto sales on auto-parts suppliers. Other Treasury staffers are trying to persuade Visa and Amex to give them real-time data on credit card purchases.</p>
        <p>But knowing what is going on is not the same thing as doing something about it. The odd thing about being treasury secretary is that while people may pay attention to what you say, you can't actually do very much. ''When you're treasury secretary,'' says Bo Cutter, who, in addition to serving in Jimmy Carter's O.M.B., worked under Rubin in Clinton's White House, ''you get to talk about the world economy, but you can't actually do anything about the world economy. By definition, you get invited to the meetings, but you don't by definition get to control them.'' The sort of power even the most exalted treasury secretary has is only the power to persuade. He has, at best, the power to manipulate public perception of big events and to infect the mind of the president with his ideas.</p>
        <p>This is an uncomfortable position for a person who has grown used to holding the levers that control every detail in his environment. O'Neill has responded on the one hand by trying to sell his view of the world to the White House and on the other by yanking on what levers he has.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, O'Neill took me on a little tour around the Treasury. It was the day after Argentinians had first rioted in the streets, responding indirectly to the I.M.F.'s sudden tightfistedness. ''I hate seeing how this gets translated into physical violence on the street,'' O'Neill said. In refusing to supply further funds to Argentina, the I.M.F. seemed to be following O'Neill's lead on how to deal with the crisis. When the Argentinian economy minister turned up in Washington last month to beg for help, O'Neill's Treasury officials avoided meeting him. The White House, too, seemed to be taking O'Neill's lead, agreeing with him that you couldn't create confidence in Argentina by pouring more money into it -- that before it received any additional financial aid, the country needed to change the way it approached the real down-to-the-ground stuff. ''I think what we've been doing over the last 40 or 50 years in the World Bank and the I.M.F. has to some extent gone astray,'' O'Neill said. He knows a thing or two about turning a failing enterprise into a thriving one, and he sees no evidence that the I.M.F. has a similar understanding about a failing country. ''We still don't really understand in a straight-line way how to create economic development,'' he says.</p>
        <p>We walked out of his office and into the dark corridor, floored with black-and-white marble tiles and lined with portraits of 70 former treasury secretaries. (Rubin's picture hangs just outside O'Neill's door.) We left the third floor -- where all the most important people sit -- and marched down the hall. We passed a cleaning lady who had dropped her keys and spray cans. O'Neill stopped to help her pick them up. If she knew who he was, or found it remarkable in any way that this trim, taut figure in his well-pressed shirt had stopped to help, she didn't show it. Government workers, unlike, say, Alcoa workers, haven't any incentive to know who is boss. It takes an act of will to promote them and an act of Congress to fire them.</p>
        <p>The Treasury's halls are impossibly long, and as we walk them we have plenty of time to talk.</p>
        <p>''I really like building things that are the consequence of ideas,'' O'Neill says.</p>
        <p>His notion of building something that is the consequence of good ideas is Alcoa's Pittsburgh headquarters. The Alcoa building has the added attraction of being a consequence of his ideas.</p>
        <p>I tell him that when I visited the Alcoa building in Pittsburgh, I'd learned that pretty much everyone liked it except the lawyers -- an ominous sign for a man now working in a city run by lawyers. The lawyers, I was told, couldn't stand the idea of working out in the open, where they could be seen.</p>
        <p>''The lawyers hated it,'' he says. ''With them, it's a professional gene. I'd say: Tell me, why do you need secrecy? I'm out in the open, and you're working for me.''</p>
        <p>So far as O'Neill is concerned, the Treasury building represents pretty much everything that can be wrong with a building. Or, rather, the ideas that led to its design are, from the point of view of a modern American C.E.O. who is trying to get things done, bad ideas. The reverence of the past interferes with technical progress; the thick walls disrupt communication; the huge offices with massive wooden doors dissuade anyone outside them from imagining what should go on inside them and hide those on the inside from critical scrutiny. ''The idea of people working together is really defeated by walls,'' O'Neill says, ''and even more so by hierarchy.''</p>
        <p>By law and architectural design, our government is resistant to change. Its walls are some of the thickest in the free world. But here O'Neill, for once, got lucky. He arrived in the middle of the first big renovation in a century. One-quarter of the building was already under repair. So, O'Neill says, as we curve up the semispiral staircase, ''when they took all the walls down, I told them they couldn't put them back up. They said I couldn't do that. Their argument was that history was present. In the walls. They were historical walls.'' He's smiling now. ''So I said, Which are the historical walls? And I let them keep a couple of those.''</p>
        <p>The Treasury halls are dark, the stairways even darker. In places, you have to squint to see who is passing in the other direction. Then O'Neill throws open a door on a different epoch. Before us, in the middle of a 19th-century pile of stones, which everyone pretty much assumed could never be changed, is a cube farm. Light pours in from tall windows. It is clean and neat and open and straightforward and hopeful. It is, in fact, a replica of an Alcoa cube farm.</p>
        <p>''Look at all that light,'' he says. ''Isn't it wonderful?''</p>
        <p>REASON NO. 3: 'TAKING THIS JOB IS GOING TO COST ME $250 MILLION'  In 2000, his last year as chairman of Alcoa, O'Neill made $25 million. When he left the company, he had almost 4 million stock options and 2.37 million shares, worth another $80 million. The O'Neill fortune was different from the fortunes accumulated by the other pooh-bahs in the Bush administration. Powell made his tens of millions mainly speaking about leadership to businesspeople who wanted to rub shoulders with him. Rumsfeld and Cheney made their tens of millions as stewards of, and arrangers for, businesses they had no great effect upon. And Bush of course himself made his millions through connections.</p>
        <p>O'Neill was truly different. If you asked a seriously competent American C.E.O. -- that is, one you have never heard of, because he doesn't hire people to get his name in the papers -- whom in the Bush administration he admires as a businessperson, the only name he would come up with would be O'Neill's. Only O'Neill made his money by transforming a business and making it more productive.</p>
        <p>Taking the Treasury job meant walking away from the bigger part of his Alcoa-based fortune. He could sell the stock, but he assumed, at least at first, that he would have to give up his stock options. Interestingly, he calculated the value of these options at $250 million. Well-established pricing models value these options at roughly $25 million. O'Neill got to his number using financially naïve assumptions about how high Alcoa stock was likely to go in the next 10 years. Whatever. It was a lot of money. ''It wasn't my money ultimately,'' he says. ''It was my children's. So I talked to them before I went to this lunch'' -- with Bush and Cheney -- ''and I told them that it's not my money, I have more money than I'll ever use, it's your money. And they said, If this is the price of your doing it, fine. They didn't give a damn.''</p>
        <p>His daughter Julie recalls less being consulted by her father than her father calling her and her siblings together to inform them of his decision -- which is maybe a tiny sign that when O'Neill makes important decisions he is less interested in a flat management structure than he would like to think.</p>
        <p>In any case, the kids honestly didn't care about the millions, and O'Neill liked that they didn't care. Then things got complicated: Treasury lawyers told O'Neill that he could exempt himself from decisions that might affect Alcoa's stock and keep his Alcoa stock options. He decided to try it. He couldn't imagine anyone accusing him of ethical lapses because no one ever had, with reason. For the first three months on the job, he woke up every morning to find another jab in the newspapers about his potential conflicts of interest, as both a huge Alcoa shareholder and a man making decisions that could affect Alcoa's share price, and another joke at his expense on the Democratic National Committee Web site. ''They set up a Web site, and they were having a ball,'' he says. ''And I realized I should have walked away from all of it and not listened to the lawyers.'' On March 25, he walked away from a good part of his fortune.</p>
        <p>The whole mess still eats at him, however, partly because it is much less fun not to have those millions than to have them, but also because of the implications of the debate about his morals. ''If your standards are so low that you would let your personal finances affect your decision, then you have no business being here in the first place,'' he says. ''It should be grounds for nonconfirmation.'' But the moment he chucked his list and took the Treasury job, O'Neill became an artificial construct based only loosely on the man he was before he took the job. He was finding out that in public life as currently lived it doesn't matter what's ''real.'' All that matters is perceptions.</p>
        <p>There's an analogy to this experience in O'Neill's attitude toward the financial markets. Just as he refuses to accept that there is such a thing as ''an appearance of a conflict of interest'' (either you are conflicted or you aren't), he refuses to accept that the perceptions he creates with his words matter all that much.</p>
        <p>In this he couldn't be more different from his old friend Greenspan, the other government official who can move financial markets with a subordinate clause. One morning, I was sitting in one of the deep, dark leather chairs in O'Neill's office, beneath a portrait of Alexander Hamilton, having spent two hours or so watching him confer with several Treasury staff members who were trying to find him better economic data. As the staff members made to leave, O'Neill began to talk to me about one of the high points of each week, when he ate breakfast with Greenspan and argued about economic data.</p>
        <p>''Why don't you come along this Friday to breakfast?'' he said.</p>
        <p>The thought of it clearly amused him. The two men share not only a lot of history, having worked together in and out of government, but also a hobby: no other human being on the planet can match their interest in General</p>
        <p>Motors order books or the latest inventory numbers. Their breakfast has become a ritual.</p>
        <p>''That'd be great,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''I'd better call Alan just to make sure it's all right, but I can't see why he'd object,'' he said.</p>
        <p>O'Neill went off to call Greenspan, and as he did, I was able to think of about 10 reasons he would object. For one thing, Greenspan has always been the sort of guy who likes reporters to know that he is talking about complicated economic stuff with some treasury secretary over breakfast but never permits them to judge for themselves the interest of the conversation. A few hours later, I was back in O'Neill's office when Greenspan returned the call. I sat in the deep leather chair and listened to one end of a conversation.</p>
        <p>''I have a journalist here,'' O'Neill began, and went on to explain who I was and what I wanted. There followed an ominously long pause.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I didn't know that.''</p>
        <p>''Uh-huh.''</p>
        <p>''O.K.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill hung up and walked over with the closest thing to no expression on his face. ''Alan says he'll come, but he won't say anything,'' he said. I tried my best to look surprised.</p>
        <p>''Probably better if you didn't come.''</p>
        <p>It was hard not to like him for trying. It wasn't that he thought he was letting me in on some secret. In his mind, there was no reason for secrets.</p>
        <p>REASON NO. 4: 'MY POLITICS AREN'T NECESSARILY YOUR POLITICS'  It was with this point that O'Neill, so far as I can piece together and he can remember, filled most of the lines on his three-page list. In the late 1980's, he advocated a 50-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax. He thought global warming was a real problem. He thinks that the whole Social Security system should be scrapped and replaced with accounts owned by individuals and invested in stock market indices and bond funds. On and on, this list of specific policy points went. Some were clearly not Republican policies. He doesn't think in terms of Republican policies or Democratic ones. When you build your political views from the ground up, basing them on your own set of closely observed facts, you wind up in your own private place, well outside the boxes built by political parties. The greatest part of O'Neill's list can be summarized in a sentence: I disagree with you because I know more than you do about the down-to-the-ground stuff. He didn't put it that way to Bush, of course. Instead, he said, ''I've taken unpopular positions.''</p>
        <p>The last time I saw O'Neill was just before Christmas. I had finally gotten around to reading everything he had ever said publicly. I told him that if I didn't know anything about him but what he was on record as having said I wouldn't be sure if he was a Democrat or a Republican.</p>
        <p>He laughed and said, ''You're going to get me into trouble, aren't you?''</p>
        <p>''But it's true that the only way anyone would even guess you might be Republican is to know you were a rich businessman.''</p>
        <p>''Now there's a stereotype!''</p>
        <p>I said that while it's possible (just) to be a maverick in the Senate, it's another thing to be a maverick in the cabinet. Inside an administration, you aren't really allowed to stake out an independent political identity. O'Neill has a physical tic, a tendency to turn his head to his left in profile in the middle of a conversation, when he wants a moment to himself to actually think. He did this now. Then he said, ''That's not who I am.'' He is a registered Republican, he said. ''But if you asked me what I am, it would be a long time before I got around to political identification.'' He paused again, then said, ''When George Shultz hired me at O.M.B., he never asked if I was a Republican.'' Pause. ''Come to think of it, no one at O.M.B. ever asked me what I was.''</p>
        <p>''Did Bush and Cheney ask?'' Given the complete absence of O'Neill money from the Bush campaign, they might at least have probed him on this.</p>
        <p>''No.''</p>
        <p>REASON NO. 5: 'I TOLD MY WIFE I'D FINALLY PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD, TAKE CRUISES AND IN GENERAL BEHAVE LIKE AN ORDINARY RETIRED PERSON'  Everywhere O'Neill has worked, he has been known as the guy who puts in the longest hours. For a Kennedy School interviewer in the early 1990's, he recalled how at O.M.B. he had worked every day except Christmas, a minimum of 12-hour days. O'Neill's daughter Julie told me, ''My mother was saying how they were going to do this and do that when my father left Alcoa, but we all knew that it wasn't going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Last January, O'Neill moved from his nice home in Pittsburgh into a room in the Hotel Washington, across the street from the Treasury building, where he lived for the next 10 months. He might as well have slept in a cube. Where he lived didn't much matter because mostly all he did was work.</p>
        <p>He actually had a fairly long list of reasons for wanting to be treasury secretary to offset the list of reasons for not wanting the job. At the top was a chance to push ideas about public policy -- and especially about radically changing Social Security. Just below that was the chance to change the biggest organization on the planet -- the federal government.</p>
        <p>He has concerned himself with the most quotidian details of Treasury operations. Two months into the job, he visited the Philadelphia Mint and wound up on the factory floor making changes in the production line. He requested the Treasury worker-safety records and made a priority of eliminating job-related injuries. (Already he has cut the lost days in half.) He found that Americans made 77.5 million phone calls last year to the Internal Revenue Service -- which is part of the Treasury Department -- to ask for explanations of the tax code and that 3,654 government workers do nothing but answer these calls. He has set as a goal to create such clear explanations of the rules -- or even better, to simplify the tax code -- that the calls cease.</p>
        <p>When I asked him once how he judges himself, he said: ''It's not, Did we get some bill passed or did someone like what I said or wrote? What really matters to me is lasting institutional change.'' Then he turned his head to the left and thought a minute. ''Metal has shape. If you form metals into a shape they'll tend to return to that shape. Institutions are like that. I'd like to turn this into a place where people get fulfillment out of what they do with their life -- and it'll really be hard for subsequent people to take it away. Because it becomes a right.''</p>
        <p>It's a blessing, but also a curse, that our government resists people who want to change its shape. Much of what O'Neill has done as a boss has been aimed at eliminating indignities from the work lives of ordinary people. Small wonder that he has so little patience for indignity himself. But there is an aspect to being treasury secretary that is inherently undignified -- especially to a former C.E.O. who never had to worry one bit what people who didn't know him thought of him. It's the democratic part of his current job that requires saying what you don't really mean or believe, or at the very least remaining silent about what you actually think, all to make a shallow impression on a lot of people who don't know you. O'Neill has mostly ignored this part of the job. He has refused to sell himself to the financial markets. It should not come as a huge surprise that the financial markets haven't bought him.</p>
        <p>No one can say with authority whether O'Neill will be staying or asked to go. O'Neill himself may not know. On some level, the White House political people must realize that if they fire their treasury secretary they will implicitly be taking the blame for the stalled economy. But if he is still around as you read this, maybe it is because, in hiring O'Neill, Bush and Cheney knowingly signed on for an unusually interesting ride. If they did, now they've got it.</p>
