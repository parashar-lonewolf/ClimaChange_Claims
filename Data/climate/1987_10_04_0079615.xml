        <p>EVERY year when sunlight returns to the Antarctic, scientists can chart a thinning patch in the earth's ozone sunscreen. Every year the measurements are more precise and more ominous, and this year they were worse than ever.</p>
        <p>According to readings taken from mid-August to mid-September and announced last week, the ozone layer above the continent had been depleted by 50 percent. Last year the reading was 40 percent below the base level, recorded in the mid-1970's.</p>
        <p>The expedition's leaders hesitated to draw conclusions. There remains little doubt that ozone in the upper atmosphere is destroyed in chemical reaction with chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used to make aerosol propellants, Styrofoam, refrigerants and other products. But the scientists said extreme weather also accounted for part of the yearly ozone depletion over Antarctica.</p>
        <p>The expected result of increased ultraviolet radiation is crop damage and disruption of the food chain, especially in marine life. Among humans, more skin cancer is expected. The radiation is also thought to damage the immune system.</p>
        <p>This year's expedition, financed by Federal and private sources, coincided with an international conference in Montreal that reached an agreement to freeze and eventually reduce chlorofluorocarbon production. But last week, F. Sherwood Rowland, the chemist who hypothesized the ozone destruction 15 years ago and has said repeatedly that time is running out, said so again. ''We need to go further'' than the Montreal accord, he said, calling for a 95 percent reduction in CFC consumption.</p>
