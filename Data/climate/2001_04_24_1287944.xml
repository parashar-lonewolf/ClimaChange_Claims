        <p>Christie Whitman's influence in White House decision making was again drawing scrutiny after she suggested on Sunday that the administration was backing off its plans to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration because the proposal faced such strong opposition in Congress.</p>
        <p>But the White House said today that President Bush intended to press ahead with his campaign pledge to allow drilling in a 1.5-million-acre section of the 19-million-acre preserve.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether Ms. Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was left out of a decision-making process or whether the issue has not been resolved in the administration.</p>
        <p>Either way, the signals that the administration sends on oil drilling in Alaska are being watched closely because they can affect world oil prices and increase pressure by energy companies to search for oil on other public lands.</p>
        <p>The question of Ms. Whitman's level of involvement is important not only to her agency but also to her credibility.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, she said Mr. Bush wanted to carry out a campaign pledge to lower carbon dioxide emissions from power plants -- only to discover that the president had decided against such a policy.</p>
        <p>The proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic has drawn opposition not only from environmentalists but also from moderate Republicans in Congress.</p>
        <p>A bipartisan group of 40 members, led by Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, and Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent a letter to President Bush today urging him to give it up.</p>
        <p>''Of all the measures you could possibly choose to make the centerpiece of national energy policy,'' the letter said, ''drilling in the refuge is most certain to evoke a strong, vigorous, negative reaction in Congress.''</p>
        <p>With a nod toward such opposition, Ms. Whitman conceded on the ABC News program ''This Week'' that it would be ''very difficult'' for Mr. Bush to win Congressional approval for his plan. And on another program, she suggested that the White House might be backing away from the proposal.</p>
        <p>On the CBS News program ''Face The Nation,'' Ms. Whitman said the refuge ''couldn't be drilled if Congress didn't support it,'' adding: ''Somebody may have made a decision somewhere, but as far as our report goes, we didn't specifically say you must drill in A.N.W.R. We didn't recommend that to the president.''</p>
        <p>The president himself suggested  this month that he knew that the opposition in Congress was stiff and that he was prepared to start looking elsewhere for drilling possibilities.</p>
        <p>But Gale A. Norton, secretary of the interior, said on another program on Sunday that the president had every intention of going ahead with drilling in the Alaska refuge.</p>
        <p>Reminded that the administration lacked the votes for Congressional approval, Ms. Norton conceded nothing.</p>
        <p>''We have to convince Congress that we can do this in an environmentally responsible way.'' she said, adding, ''It's still something that we think ought to be explored.''</p>
        <p>Today, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, sided with Ms. Norton, saying that an administration task force on energy -- on which Ms. Whitman sits -- would recommend support for drilling.</p>
        <p>''An energy proposal that will be shortly submitted from the vice president's task force will include a provision calling for opening up a small portion of A.N.W.R. for energy development,'' Mr. Fleischer said.</p>
        <p>So, was Ms. Whitman out of the loop?</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer was less clear on that point.</p>
        <p>''No,'' he said. ''I think yesterday afternoon Administrator Whitman addressed that question and indicated just as I said.</p>
        <p>''I think there was some confusion in the early morning, as a result of a newspaper story or magazine story, and then that confusion was resolved.''</p>
        <p>He said Ms. Whitman was confused ''as a result of the question.''</p>
