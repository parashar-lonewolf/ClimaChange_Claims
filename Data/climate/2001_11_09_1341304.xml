        <p>Talks in Morocco aimed at finishing a pioneering climate treaty headed into a final sprint last night, with negotiators from more than 160 countries haggling over a few important details.</p>
        <p>If enacted, the treaty, called the Kyoto Protocol, would be the first international agreement requiring reductions in releases of heat-trapping greenhouse gases linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>President Bush rejected the treaty in March, saying it would harm the economy and unfairly apply only to industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>The decision put the United States -- the largest source of greenhouse gases -- on the sidelines drew strong criticism from much of the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>At a summer meeting in Bonn, Germany, a critical mass of participants -- mainly the European Union, Japan, Russia and a group of developing countries -- agreed on almost every element of the accord. After Mr. Bush's decision, European Union officials adamantly vowed to push ahead with completing the treaty.</p>
        <p>The current round of talks is intended to do just that and is scheduled to end today. To gain legal force, the pact must be ratified by at least 55 countries, including a group responsible for 55 percent of the emissions from industrialized countries in 1990. While European countries have strongly favored the treaty, they needed the support of Japan and Russia in particular to achieve that threshold.</p>
        <p>Last night, participants in the negotiations said, Russian officials were seeking new credits toward emissions targets for the role that the country's vast forests play in removing the dominant warming gas, carbon dioxide, from the air.  European officials opposed the change.</p>
        <p>Negotiators said that a compromise between Russia and the European Union was likely, and could be achieved essentially by splitting the difference between the amount of gas credits preferred by each.</p>
        <p>Russia was seeking a credit of 29.9 million tons of carbon dioxide for its forests, nearly double the 15.4 million tons it had agreed to in Bonn.</p>
        <p>''There's a strong will to finish,'' a European diplomat involved in the talks said.</p>
        <p>According to some environmental groups and European officials, Japan, where many industries oppose the treaty, was seeking language that would blunt the accord's teeth.</p>
        <p>Some critics of the treaty said that it still contained what amounted to an escape clause, in that countries had already agreed to put off for several years the drafting of language to make it legally binding.</p>
        <p>''This allows Japan and others to ratify the rest of the protocol without fear of it being legally binding,'' said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the Global Climate Coalition, a group representing American industries that opposed the treaty.</p>
        <p>But proponents of the treaty defended it, even with its accumulated compromises and the possibility of more. The treaty still represented a big step toward limiting the effects of human activity on the atmosphere, said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a group in Washington.</p>
