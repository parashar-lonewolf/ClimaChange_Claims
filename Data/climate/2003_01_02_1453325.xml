      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial with wishes for new year; says policy makers should improve fuel economy standards, and at very least they should require SUV's to meet same standards as passenger cars; says United States should press Israel to start reducing its settler population in Gaza Strip and West Bank; says if this is matched by reciprocal concessions on Palestinian side, it would strengthen prospects for durable agreement; says global system of agricultural subsidies should be killed; says poor farmers in developing countries cannot sell their products abroad because rich countries rig markets, subsidizing their farmers so heavily that nobody can compete</p>

        <p>We have several wishes for the new year. Nothing wildly ambitious, just a short list of familiar public policy ideas that have been waiting for the right person to make them real. They are not risk free, politically. If they were, they would not need leadership to move them along. But all are doable, and all would yield enormous, multiple benefits. In terms of payback-to-effort, they're our top priorities.</p>
        <p>Take the question of American dependence on foreign oil. There are plenty of big, futuristic ideas around -- developing a hydrogen-based economy, for instance -- and plenty of bad ideas, like the notion that we can drill our way to energy independence. But one obvious response is to improve fuel economy standards, which have not been tightened since the Reagan years. At the very least, policy makers should require S.U.V.'s to meet the same standards as passenger cars.</p>

        <p>We have several wishes for the new year. Nothing wildly ambitious, just a short list of familiar public policy ideas that have been waiting for the right person to make them real. They are not risk free, politically. If they were, they would not need leadership to move them along. But all are doable, and all would yield enormous, multiple benefits. In terms of payback-to-effort, they're our top priorities.</p>
        <p>Take the question of American dependence on foreign oil. There are plenty of big, futuristic ideas around -- developing a hydrogen-based economy, for instance -- and plenty of bad ideas, like the notion that we can drill our way to energy independence. But one obvious response is to improve fuel economy standards, which have not been tightened since the Reagan years. At the very least, policy makers should require S.U.V.'s to meet the same standards as passenger cars.</p>
        <p>President Bush recently promised to increase fuel economy in S.U.V.'s by 1.5 miles a gallon by 2007. But that's less than what the automakers say they can do on their own, and far less than what the National Academy of Sciences says is possible for all cars with existing off-the-shelf technology. And the rewards for a big increase in efficiency would be huge: cleaner air, fewer global warming gases, reduced dependence on Persian Gulf oil.</p>
        <p>Given a magic lamp, we might wish for stable, responsible democratic regimes in Iraq and North Korea for the new year. But for an idea that's doable, our foreign policy choice is dismantling Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Just as terrorism is the greatest Palestinian obstacle to Middle East peace, so the settlements established in territories captured in the 1967 war are the greatest Israeli obstacle. They deprive the Palestinians of valuable land and water and deny them geographical continuity. They are hard for Israel to defend against Palestinian attack, and they make it impossible to establish a clear, secure Israeli border.</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, the United States -- which has lately ignored the issue -- should press Israel to start reducing a settler population that's doubled in the last decade to 200,000 (without counting 200,000 in East Jerusalem). Israel's cooperation would show that it is serious about a two-state solution and, if matched by reciprocal concessions on the Palestinian side, would strengthen the prospects for a durable agreement.</p>
        <p>Here's a third wish: Kill the global system of agricultural subsidies. The obvious way for poor farmers in developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty is to sell their products abroad. But they can't, mainly because rich countries have rigged the markets, subsidizing their farmers so heavily that nobody can compete. That's not only unfair but perverse: reducing farm subsidies would do far more to help poor countries than large increases in direct foreign aid.</p>
        <p>Several proposals for reform are floating about, including a Bush administration idea for balanced and mutual reductions of subsidies in both Europe and America, so that neither gets an advantage. This deserves serious consideration. Another trifecta of payoffs awaits: more money in the pockets of the poor, greater social and political stability across the third world, and a fairer distribution of the fruits of globalization.</p>
