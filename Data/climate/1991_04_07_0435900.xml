        <p>SINCE the mid-80's, scientists and governments have been worried that the infamous Antarctic "hole" in the earth's protective ozone shield would spread around the globe, exposing people and other living things to harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. Most nations pledged last year to stop producing industrial chemicals, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, that are believed to weaken the ozone shield.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that the ozone layer had been partly depleted in many areas of the world and that at the latitudes of the United States the loss was more than twice what scientists had previously thought -- 4.5 to 5 percent in the last decade. The E.P.A. calculated that this would let enough harmful ultraviolet radiation pass through the atmosphere to cause 12 million more Americans to develop skin cancer in the next 50 years, and 200,000 more of them to die, than if there were no ozone depletion. Earlier estimates had forecast 500,000 new cancer cases and 93,000 additional fatalities over the same period.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, the agency administrator, called the findings stunning, unexpected, disturbing and full of unexplored implications. He said they made necessary a reappraisal of national and international policy on ozone, and a possible shortening of the timetable for phasing out chlorofluorocarbons, which are used, for example, as refrigerants.</p>

        <p>Michael Deland, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, reacted circumspectly, saying that the new data would be carefully scrutinized before any major policy overhaul was undertaken.</p>
        <p>The policy options include:</p>
        <p>* Moving up the United States' deadline for halting the production of chlorofluorocarbons to 1997 from the year 2000, as the European Community has already done.</p>
        <p>* Moving up the developing countries' agreed upon deadline, which is now 2010.</p>
        <p>* Placing stronger controls on the use of some of the substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons now being developed. These substitutes also destroy ozone but they degrade faster.</p>
