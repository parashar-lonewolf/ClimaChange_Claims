        <p>On his way to Japan a couple of weeks ago to salvage the international conference on global warming, Al Gore made a brief detour on behalf of another environmental objective close to his heart. In a setting that was part political rally, part country fair, the Vice President and a gaggle of Federal and state officials gathered in the colorful little fishing village of Everglades City to mark the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park and give fresh momentum to the campaign to save a once-wondrous ecosystem from further decay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore brought with him the announcement that the Federal Government would buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane land north of the park. This land, which the St. Joe Corporation offered after tortuous negotiations, will be the centerpiece of a planned series of reservoirs and pollution-filtering marshes between the Everglades and the sprawling agricultural areas south of Lake Okeechobee -- all aimed at restoring the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades and its threatened wildlife depend.</p>

        <p>On his way to Japan a couple of weeks ago to salvage the international conference on global warming, Al Gore made a brief detour on behalf of another environmental objective close to his heart. In a setting that was part political rally, part country fair, the Vice President and a gaggle of Federal and state officials gathered in the colorful little fishing village of Everglades City to mark the 50th anniversary of Everglades National Park and give fresh momentum to the campaign to save a once-wondrous ecosystem from further decay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore brought with him the announcement that the Federal Government would buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane land north of the park. This land, which the St. Joe Corporation offered after tortuous negotiations, will be the centerpiece of a planned series of reservoirs and pollution-filtering marshes between the Everglades and the sprawling agricultural areas south of Lake Okeechobee -- all aimed at restoring the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades and its threatened wildlife depend.</p>
        <p>But to anyone who cares about this fragile ecosystem, what was truly heartening was the commingling of people who for years have been at war with one another over what to do about restoring the Everglades and how to pay for it. Mr. Gore, along with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, shared the stage with state officials whom they had taken to court only a few years ago. Similarly, environmentalists stood within hailing distance of their historic adversaries from the sugar cane industry.</p>
        <p>The Everglades restoration effort is essentially an act of restitution for the violence that man has visited upon nature. In the 1930's and 40's, the Army Corps of Engineers embarked on a monumental flood control project, draining a half-million acres south of Lake Okeechobee with a vast web of levees, canals and pumping stations. That marvelous if misguided feat of engineering kept Florida's booming east coast flood-free and provided the rich soil for the profitable sugar cane industry. But it robbed the Everglades and Florida Bay of timely fresh-water flows, and nearly ruined both.</p>
        <p>Things have begun to turn around, especially this year. Congress doubled the money available for land acquisition to create filtration marshes, restore wetlands and reroute canals to restore a more natural flow of water. This week the Administration ordered a delay in building an airport at Homestead until an environmental study can determine what damage it might do to the Everglades.</p>
        <p>But there are daunting tasks ahead. A fight is brewing in the courts and the State Legislature over whether Big Sugar should pay more than the $233 million it has agreed to contribute toward a restoration project that may eventually cost $5 billion. Congress must also be persuaded, once more, to keep the restoration money flowing to the Interior Department and the Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>The revival of the Everglades could be one of President Clinton's greatest environmental legacies, second only to a successful treaty on global warming. But he will have to keep at it.</p>
