        <p>LEAD: NEW evidence from Sweden reveals that the average summer temperature in far northern Europe has fluctuated almost seven degrees over the last 1,400 years, illustrating how widely the earth's climate varies naturally and suggesting that in the northernmost parts of the world, the effects of any global warming will be hard to feel for a long time.</p>
        <p>NEW evidence from Sweden reveals that the average summer temperature in far northern Europe has fluctuated almost seven degrees over the last 1,400 years, illustrating how widely the earth's climate varies naturally and suggesting that in the northernmost parts of the world, the effects of any global warming will be hard to feel for a long time.</p>
        <p>Scientists have generally expected that global warming, to whatever extent it comes, will be felt sooner in some parts of the world than others and will vary in intensity from region to region, season to season, year to year and decade to decade. The earth's climate has always displayed such variability.</p>
        <p>The new evidence, reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature, casts these eccentricities in sharp relief.</p>
        <p>Seven European scientists analyzed summer temperatures for about the last 1,400 years in northern Sweden, as reflected in the density of the growth rings of pine trees. The scientists found that the average summer temperature in that region fluctuated within a range of 6.7 degrees Fahrenheit.(By way of comparison, the average temperature of the earth is about 9 degrees higher now than in the depths of the last Ice Age.) The range of variability, they found, was much greater than the summertime temperature increase of 1.6 to 2.7 degrees that some climatologists most recently have estimated will result from global warming in that region if, as many scientists expect, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles.</p>
        <p>Carrying the analysis further, the European scientists calculated that it would be 30 to 40 years before the expected human-induced global warming in Scandinavia, in the summer, could be distinguished from natural climatic variations.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a useful reminder to people that the natural variability at a given place is quite large'' and that especially high or especially low temperatures in a given year neither prove nor disprove any long-term warming trend, said an expert on global warming, Dr. James Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City.</p>
        <p>The degree of variability also differs from region to region, he said, and temperatures in far northern latitudes like Sweden show wider swings than those in more temperate zones. At the same time, he said, the effects of global warming are expected to be stronger in the temperate latitudes; this, coupled with the lower variability in those latitudes, means that global warming would probably be felt sooner there.</p>
        <p>Shortening an Ice Age</p>
        <p>The study, headed by Dr. Keith Briffa of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England, also turned up other evidence of climatic differences among regions. Its 14-century record found that the unusually cold climatic period called the Little Ice Age lasted for only a relatively short time in Scandinavia, from about 1570 to about 1650. The Little Ice Age has commonly been thought to have lasted for centuries in Europe, from the Middle Ages almost to the 20th century, and to have been similar in severity and timing throughout the world.</p>
        <p>The study also found no evidence in northern Sweden of an unusually warm period of several centuries, called the Medieval Optimum, that much of Europe is reported to have enjoyed between about 1000 and 1300 A.D. The Vikings colonized Greenland and vineyards flourished in England during this period.</p>
        <p>These findings imply either that northern Scandinavia ''has experienced climate fluctuations that differed markedly from the rest of Europe, or that the signficance of these climate periods in Europe has been overstated, or both,'' said the report in Nature.</p>
        <p>Dr. Briffa issued a caveat, however: natural variability in northern Sweden is greater in winter than in summer, and temperature measurements taken in winter might have revealed evidence of both the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Optimum in northern Sweden. Measurements of tree-ring temperature records are possible only in the summer, he said, because that is when nature creates them.</p>
        <p>''Very few records have this kind of detail,'' Dr. Minze Stuiver of the University of Washington at Seattle, an expert on ancient climates, said of the study. He said that efforts to simulate regional climates with computer models, the main tools for forecasting the effects of global warming, suffer from a lack of this and other kinds of information. ''We don't have the science,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Glacial Progress Recomputed</p>
        <p>Another study reported in the current Nature, headed by G. Seret of the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, has led scientists to conclude that in the last Ice Age, European glaciers may have reached a greater extent more than 30,000 years agothan they did in what is usually considered the ''glacial maximum'' about 18,000 years ago. The new study found that the more extensive, earlier glaciers moved down the slopes of the Vosges Mountains in France between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. The Vosges glaciers were not necessarily connected to broader continental ice sheets.</p>
        <p>Glaciologists have known for some time that the maximum advance of the ice took place at different times in different places, and that climate in general showed wide variations during that period.</p>
        <p>Some regional variation of climate was reflected in the distribution of ice. But much is unknown about this distribution, and the findings from France highlight the lack of knowledge, said Dr. Donald G. Sutherland, an expert on the subject at Placer Analysis in Edinburgh, Scotland, who wrote a commentary for Nature on the study.</p>
        <p>To understand fully how the mechanisms that control the earth's climate work, he said in an interview, it is vital to learn more about where ice masses actually were. Scientists know a lot about long-term glacial trends, he said, ''but that doesn't tell us where the ice occurred.'' Ice affects regional climates by reflecting the sun's heat back into space and also, simply because its mass affects air movements much as mountains do, by controlling precipitation patterns.</p>
        <p>Knowing the distribution of the glacial ice would enable scientists to construct more complete pictures of the ancient climate. These pictures, Dr. Sutherland said, could then be used to test the accuracy of computer models that attempt to forecast the regional effects of global warming. This is done by requiring the computer models to simulate the past climate.</p>
