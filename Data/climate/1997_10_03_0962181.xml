        <p>President Clinton met this evening with the chief executives of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler to promote his trade policies, but received instead an earful of complaints about the Administration's interest in limiting emissions of gases that may contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>The White House held the meeting the day after threatening South Korea with trade sanctions if it did not remove auto import limits. But the auto executives were more worried  about the Administration's stance on global warming for a United Nations conference in December, and took the opportunity this evening to tell the President just what they thought.</p>
        <p>Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, was particularly critical of the Administration for considering legally binding limits instead of voluntary targets. ''That would be bad for the auto industry in terms of jobs and the economic vitality of this country,'' he told reporters outside the West entrance to the White House after the meeting.</p>
        <p>Stephen Yokich, the president of the 800,000-member United Automobile Workers union, joined the Big Three executives at today's meeting and expressed misgivings afterward about possible moves to limit emissions of gases that may contribute to global warming. Auto exhaust has been linked to this greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>''We're taking a hard look at it because it is our jobs that are concerned,'' Mr. Yokich said.</p>
        <p>While the Administration has not yet made specific proposals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the possibilities include higher taxes on gasoline or tighter fuel economy requirements for new vehicles. The auto makers make most of their profits on big sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that might not meet tighter fuel economy standards unless fewer are sold or the vehicles are redesigned in smaller versions at considerable cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trotman contended that if the United States did accept binding limits on emissions of gases that contribute to global warming, only American companies would be forced to comply because legal systems and public pressures are weaker in some foreign countries. The American auto makers also fear that the more lenient rules being drafted for 132 developing countries, including South Korea, would give an advantage to manufacturers in those countries and might create an incentive for them to move factories overseas.</p>
        <p>''There will be an incentive to move plants,'' said Mr. Trotman, who stopped short of threatening to move Ford factories abroad.</p>
