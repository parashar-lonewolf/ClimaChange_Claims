        <p>President Bush's decision not to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, does more than betray a campaign promise. It embarrasses the administrator of his Environmental Protection Agency, Christie Whitman, angers the Europeans and creates needless headaches for his secretary of state, Colin Powell. It also undercuts some of his natural allies in the energy industry who have been willing to go out on a limb in favor of a more aggressive strategy.</p>
        <p>During a broad policy speech on energy last Sept. 29, Mr. Bush promised to ''establish mandatory reduction targets'' for emissions of four major pollutants, including carbon dioxide, a gas that has never been regulated under the federal Clean Air Act. In later remarks, Mr. Bush made quite a point of the fact that he was calling for mandatory targets, whereas Al Gore was asking for only voluntary reductions.</p>
        <p>Because the burden of regulating carbon emissions would fall most heavily on coal-burning power plants, the coal producers and some utilities urged Mr. Bush to change his mind. But his campaign stance delighted most atmospheric scientists, who believe that warming over the next century will increase far more than was originally thought, with potentially devastating consequences to the natural systems in some regions.</p>
        <p>European leaders, persuaded by the gathering evidence on the causes and dangers of global warming, have been urging the United States to help put some teeth into the Kyoto Protocol, the draft agreement to curb greenhouse gases negotiated in 1997.  Meanwhile, the country's more progressive utilities, like Consolidated Edison and New Jersey's Public Service Electric and Gas, are on record as favoring clear targets and timetables for carbon dioxide as part of a multipollutant approach that would create a more predictable regulatory climate and a surer guide to making costly pollution-control investments.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as recently as 10 days ago, Ms. Whitman was describing Mr. Bush's campaign promise as if it were already policy. Then came the president's  reversal. In a letter to four Republican senators who had criticized the Kyoto agreement, Mr. Bush said he would proceed with plans for further cuts in sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog, as well as with new regulations on mercury emissions. But carbon dioxide was off the table, for two main reasons.</p>
        <p>One was that the science about global warming was ''incomplete,'' by which he meant that it was insufficient as a basis for taking action. That was an astonishing statement in view of the recent documentation assembled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
        <p>The second was that reducing emissions would require converting older coal-fired plants to natural gas, which, in turn, could ''harm consumers'' by causing a spike in gas prices -- as California's energy crisis has demonstrated.</p>
        <p>This was a particularly slippery piece of reasoning. It is true that switching fuels will be necessary and costly. But by cynically invoking the California crisis and the specter of sudden price spikes, Mr. Bush made it sound as if a policy aimed at gradual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions would have an immediate and devastating effect on American consumers and the economy.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Bush's protestations to the contrary yesterday, one can conclude only that political considerations carried the day. His reversal came as a shock to moderate Republicans like Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont and Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York, who were preparing to join Democrats in a bipartisan effort to reduce  carbon dioxide emissions in power plants over the next six years. They should push ahead anyway. At the moment, Mr. Bush's evolving energy strategy seems to consist largely of finding new sources of energy without giving any real thought to their global consequences.</p>
