        <p>LEAD: The search for new sources of oil in the United States continues to focus on deep ocean waters and regions like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where oil exploration is pitted against environmental concerns. But some energy experts are successfully prospecting for oil in such places as windows, ceilings and doors.</p>
        <p>The search for new sources of oil in the United States continues to focus on deep ocean waters and regions like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where oil exploration is pitted against environmental concerns. But some energy experts are successfully prospecting for oil in such places as windows, ceilings and doors.</p>
        <p>These experts contend that major reductions in oil consumption can be achieved through the better design of things like light bulbs, insulated windows and doors and refrigerators. This would reduce the consumption of oil burned to heat homes, or to generate electricity for light, heating and air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>Some energy experts maintain, in fact, that a barrel of oil could be saved for every $2 spent installing high-technology, highly insulated windows.</p>
        <p>Installing such windows throughout the country would limit heat loss and save more energy than is contained in the oil that flows through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, according to Amory B. Lovins, a physicist and an author.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lovins is in the forefront of a school of thought that holds that the way to balance energy supplies and needs is by changes at the point of use, not the point of production. His Rocky Mountain Institute in Snowmass, Colo., has been demonstrating a variety of energy-saving technologies.</p>
        <p>To varying degrees, state and Federal policy makers and a growing number of utilities are coming to Mr. Lovins's point of view, although the market has been slow to implement new technologies. Doing More With Less</p>
        <p>Utilities from Maine to California are spending money on programs to help their customers use electricity more efficiently. Some of these conservation programs were ordered by state utility regulators. But other utilities are voluntarily offering them in an effort to delay building new power plants.</p>
        <p>At first glance, some proposals that Mr. Lovins and similar energy analysts are making seem too costly. But these experts contend that realistic payouts are possible in many cases. They say consumers and businesses must learn new ways to use energy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lovins and others do not define energy conservation as making do with less, as in turning down the thermostat. Instead, they speak of doing more with less, like replacing a 75-watt incandescent bulb with another employing high-efficiency fluorescent technology that uses only 20 watts or installing storm doors that keep in a building's heat better.</p>
        <p>Products that save electricity and reduce heat loss are commercially available. They are beginning to show up in offices, hospitals, apartment house hallways and, occasionally, homes. The experts contend there is a potential for saving substantial sums of money and energy. Limited Popularity</p>
        <p>Still, consumers have been slow to buy these products, the experts said. ''I don't know why, to tell you the truth,'' said Asher A. Zelin, president of Energy Conservation Products, a New York wholesaler of high-efficiency lamps and similar products.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the newness of the lamps,'' he said. Another factor, he and others note, is price; the least-expensive screw-in compact fluorescent bulb sells for about $17.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Rudy Verderber, a staff scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., which runs the Federal Department of Energy's lighting research program, the new high-efficiency electronic ballasts, or transformers, for fluorescent lights account for probably only 3 million to 4 million of the 900 million ballasts now in use.</p>
        <p>Perhaps 40 million screw-in fluorescent bulbs are in use, in a nation that has 2.5 billion light bulb sockets, he said. Of these sockets, an estimated one billion could easily use the high-efficiency bulbs.</p>
        <p>''The products that are available on the marketplace really haven't grown to what they should be,'' he said. Justifying the Cost</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Craddock, a spokesman for the Philips Lighting Company, which manufactures screw-in fluorescent bulbs, noted that consumers often have to clear some mental hurdles before switching to the screw-in fluorescent bulbs made by his company and others. ''Most consumers are used to using incandescent light bulbs; they have a general sense of what they should cost,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's hard for the individual consumer to justify in his own mind that high acquisition cost, even though one of those bulbs will last 10 times as long, and use one quarter the energy,'' Mr. Craddock said.</p>
        <p>One efficient fluorescent bulb will burn 10,000 hours and use 160 kilowatt hours of electricity. At 14 cents a kilowatt hour, the cost of electricity in New York City, using such bulbs would cost $22 for the electricity and $17 for the bulb itself, a total of $39.</p>
        <p>For the same illumination using incadescent bulbs, ten 1,000-hour 60-watt bulbs would be required, plus 600 kilowatt hours of electricity. At a cost of $1 a bulb, the bulbs would cost $10 and the electricty $84, a total of $94. An Energy-Saving Home</p>
        <p>The potential for energy efficiency is exemplified at Mr. Lovins's Rocky Mountain Institute. Experimental, energy-saving technologies are used in the building containing the home of Mr. Lovins and his wife and collaborator, Hunter, and the institute's offices, where a staff of 34 works.</p>
        <p>Most dramatic are technologies that save heat. The 4,000-square-foot structure is at an elevation of 7,200 feet where the winter temperature routinely falls to 20 below zero and sometimes reaches 40 below at night. The longest cloudy stretch since the building was finished in 1984 was 39 days. But it has no heating system, other than its windows, which are oriented to face the sun. There are two small wood-burning stoves, ''mainly for esthetics,'' Mr. Lovins said.</p>
        <p>The building is an extreme example, he admitted. Its 16-inch stone walls have four inches of polyurethane foam insulation and the roof has twice that.</p>
        <p>But other parts could be ''retrofitted'' to existing homes, like the storm door. That has two panes of glass and a very thin sheet of Mylar between them. The two resulting spaces are filled with argon gas, which is a better insulator than a partial vacuum. In addition, the glass is treated so that infrared light cannot radiate out of the house. Heat-Tight Windows</p>
        <p>The result is a window so heat-tight that when it is closed and the main door is closed, the sun's heat will cause the space in between to become hot enough to blister the varnish on the oak door.</p>
        <p>The windows around the house demonstrate various approaches to retaining energy. Measured by what is known as ''r-value,'' the standard measure of heat loss, most are above five, which is double the value of standard triple-glazed windows. A single-pane window has an r-value of about one.</p>
        <p>The windows have coatings to keep energy from radiating back outside, and all have thermal breaks in the frames to prevent the metal frame from conducting heat out.</p>
        <p>''When everyone has superwindows in the United States, the oil and gas saved will be more than what comes from Alaska,'' Mr. Lovins said. The windows cost about $7 a square foot in standard sizes and would pay for themselves in oil savings in two years, he said. A Quicker Fix</p>
        <p>Stated differently, the windows' cost divided by the amount of oil they save makes them a ''source'' of oil at $2 a barrel, Mr. Lovins said. That compares with a current price of about $17.50 a barrel for the leading domestic crude oil, West Texas Intermediate. The calculation assumes, among other things, that the windows would last for 40 years.</p>
        <p>A quicker fix, the institute said, can be found in troffers, four-foot-long inverted troughs on office and factory ceilings, each of which holds four fluorescent tubes and a ballast. Typically, the tubes are 40 watts each and the ballast is 40 watts, for a total load of 200 watts. But with a modern electronic ballast, a mirror-like reflector behind the bulbs and two bulbs of a slightly improved design, the same job can be done for 80 watts.</p>
        <p>A further refinement is a sensor that measures the amount of natural light in the room and raises or lowers the bulbs' output to keep the light level constant.</p>
        <p>The initial saving is 120 watts. But if the lighting uses less electricity, it gives off less heat, which means a slightly higher heating bill in winter and a much lower air-conditioning bill in summer. The net effect, Mr. Lovins said, is that for every three watts saved in lighting, a fourth watt is saved in the cooling bill. Reducing Pollutants</p>
        <p>In areas where electricity is generated by oil-fueled power plants - the Northeast and Florida, for example - replacing a troffer that runs 12 hours a day, five days a week, with a model that uses 120 watts less would save more than half a barrel of oil a year. In other parts of the country, such a move would save coal, reducing acid rain and other pollutants.</p>
        <p>Reducing demand for electricity also cuts the capital costs for utilities. For a coal-burning power plant with advanced antipollution equipment, the capacity needed to run a single standard troffer is estimated to cost about $320; to run the more efficient troffer, about $128.</p>
        <p>Minimum efficiency standards set by the Federal Government for household appliances have already brought some improvements. For example, the average refrigerator sold in 1985 consumed about 1,100 kilowatts a year, down from more than 1,700 kilowatts in 1972.</p>
        <p>The refrigerator in Mr. Lovins's house, built to order by a local supplier, slices another 85 percent from consumption. The changes are simple: the compressor is on top of the box, instead of under it, so that the heat from its motor does not rise to warm the food compartment. The sides of the refrigerator are three inches thick and filled with polyurethane, which makes it resemble an ice chest.</p>
        <p>A refrigerator like Mr. Lovins's, if mass-produced, would not cost substantially more than ones being sold now. But this model does not have the feature that appliance manufacturers believe consumers want most: a bigger food storage compartment in a smaller box. Thus far, the major manufacturers have not concluded that a super-efficient refrigerator could be successfully marketed.</p>
