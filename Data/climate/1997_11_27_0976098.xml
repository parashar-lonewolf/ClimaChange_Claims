        <p>Saying that criticisms by other countries of the United States' position on global warming are ''ill-founded,'' the Clinton Administration's new chief negotiator on a climate treaty acknowledged today that it might not be possible to bridge the remaining differences with Europe and the developing world.</p>
        <p>''We are not going in with the notion that we have to have an agreement at any cost,'' Under Secretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat said in a telephone conversation with journalists as he prepared to lead the American delegation to talks that will begin next week in Japan.</p>
        <p>''We will go to Kyoto and make an all-out effort,'' Mr. Eizenstat said. But he added that he was ''neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but realistic,'' about the difficulties.</p>
        <p>''We must remember that nations remain quite far apart,'' he said, ''and achieving agreement will be a challenge.''</p>
        <p>Whether his comments were meant to lower expectations and pave the way for possible failure or a weakened treaty, or to raise the pressure and persuade other countries to make concessions, Mr. Eizenstat's remarks were more guarded than those made recently by his predecessor as chief negotiator, Tim Wirth.  Mr. Wirth had said that differences with Europe, especially, were not so great and were shrinking.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Eizenstat said that the United States had ''significant problems'' with a central feature of Europe's position: that members of the European Union be considered as a unit in achieving reductions in the emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap the sun's heat like a greenhouse, rather than requiring each nation to achieve reductions. He called it ''an artificial advantage, and one that no other country or set of countries has.''</p>
        <p>The United States, Mr. Eizenstat said, would insist that many developing countries agree to binding reductions in their emissions of those gases ''over a reasonable period of time,'' but he added that these commitments need not be the same as the targets for developed countries.</p>
        <p>The commitments must come from the wealthier developing countries, measured by per capita income, and from the developing countries that, because of their sheer size, emit large amounts of such greenhouse gases, Mr. Eizenstat said.</p>
        <p>Those countries would probably include, among others, the top five sources of carbon dioxide emissions in the developing world: China, India, South Korea, South Africa and Mexico, which among them in 1996 gave off almost as much greenhouse gases as the United States. Their emissions have been growing much faster than American emissions, although emissions per person in the United States are much greater.</p>
        <p>''We are talking about focusing on key developing countries,'' Mr. Eizenstat said. ''They have to make a meaningful contribution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat said a provision in the current draft of the proposed treaty, allowing developing countries to sign up voluntarily for binding emissions targets, was a positive step toward what the Administration is seeking. But he said that a treaty, to be acceptable, also had to provide for international trading of emission control credits, which would let countries like the United States pay for reductions to be made in other countries instead of making domestic cuts at greater expense.</p>
