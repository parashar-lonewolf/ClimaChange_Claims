        <p>The Cassini spacecraft bearing down on Saturn has confirmed that its farthest moon, Phoebe, is an icy remnant of the solar system's birth more than four billion years ago, scientists said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Phoebe appears to be more akin to comets than to asteroids and typical rocky moons, the researchers said. The cratered, oval-shaped body, measuring about 137 miles wide, was apparently captured by Saturn's powerful gravitational field when it wandered close eons ago.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., where the mission is being directed, scientists said preliminary results from Cassini's readings indicated that Phoebe was similar to icy bodies populating a region beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. These bodies, believed to be some of the early building blocks from which planets formed, are also a source of the comets that periodically plunge into the inner solar system.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roger N. Clark, a Cassini imaging team member with the United States Geological Survey in Denver, said, ''All our evidence leads us to conclude Phoebe's surface is made of water ice, water-bearing minerals, carbon dioxide, possible clays and primitive organic chemicals in patches at different locations on the surface.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Clark also said spectrometer measurements that identify materials by the wavelengths of light they reflect showed evidence of other materials that had yet to be identified.</p>
        <p>Cassini, at the end of a seven-year journey from Earth, flew within 1,285 miles of Phoebe on June 11 and scanned it with a suite of 11 instruments, including a radar device that probed several inches below the moon's surface. Measurements confirmed the strong presence of water ice previously detected by Earth-based telescopes.</p>
        <p>Phoebe has long been thought to be a captive object because of its odd behavior and unusually dark appearance. It revolves backward with respect to Saturn's rotation and orbits in the opposite direction from Saturn's other major satellites.</p>
        <p>''One intriguing result is the discovery of possible chemical similarities between the materials on Phoebe and those seen on comets,'' said Dr. Robert H. Brown of the University of Arizona.</p>
        <p>This chemical commonality strengthens the case that Phoebe is related to Kuiper Belt objects, Dr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Pearl of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said infrared readings showed very low temperatures on Phoebe. The moon registered at minus 267 degrees Fahrenheit at its warmest point, with nighttime temperatures falling to minus 325 degrees. The lowest temperature recorded on Earth is minus 127 degrees, in an Antarctic winter.</p>
        <p>Scientists said Phoebe appeared to be a jumbled mixture of ice, rock, dust and other material covered by a dark, porous surface layer. The moon does not appear to be distinct layers of materials, but a blending of various components, said Dr. Torrence Johnson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Phoebe has a density of 100 pounds per cubic foot of material, which is lighter than most rocks but heavier than pure water ice (58 pounds per cubic foot). Dr. Johnson said this suggested that Phoebe had an ice-rock combination similar to the planet Pluto, which is also thought to be a Kuiper Belt object.</p>
        <p>The $3.3 billion Cassini mission, which is to explore the Saturn system for at least four years, is sponsored by NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The spacecraft, the size of a small bus, is to go into orbit around Saturn on June 30.</p>
