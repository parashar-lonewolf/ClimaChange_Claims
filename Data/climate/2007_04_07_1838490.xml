        <p>Emissions Already Shaping World Climate, Panel Says  The earth's climate and ecosystems are already being shaped by greenhouse gases, the world's leading scientific panel on climate change said.

        <p>Britons Describe Iran Captivity  Six of the 15 British marines and sailors who arrived home after being held in Iran said days of psychological pressure extracted ''confessions'' from some of the captives that they strayed into Iranian waters. They said they were separated, put in pajamas and placed in cells.</p>

        <p>Zambia to Exhaust U.N. Rations  Within weeks, rations provided by the United Nations World Food Program will run out for 500,000 Zambian paupers, including thousands of people wasted by AIDS who are being treated with American-financed drugs that make them hungrier as they grow healthier.</p>

        <p>Chlorine Truck Bomb in Iraq  A suicide truck bomb loaded with chlorine gas exploded in Ramadi, killing as many as 30 people, many of them children, a security official said. The blast was at least the sixth chlorine bomb detonated in Anbar Province since late January.</p>
        <p>A6</p>
        <p>Gandhi Heir Fights for Base  Rahul Gandhi, the 36-year-old heir apparent to India's ruling political dynasty, is facing his first test of political mettle: whether he can save his Congress Party from becoming irrelevant in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and the Nehru-Gandhi family's home base.</p>

        <p>NATIONAL A8-11</p>

        <p>Charity Act Raises Questions  One of Japan's richest real estate developers, Genshiro Kawamoto, is making good on a plan to open eight houses he owns in one of Honolulu's most exclusive communities to poor families of Native Hawaiian descent. But while his act of charity has made headlines around the world, it has also raised plenty of questions.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>A Faster 'Road Home'?  Louisiana homeowners may get faster access to rebuilding grants after a surprise ruling from Washington that is forcing the state to change its slow-moving $7.5 billion ''Road Home'' program to repair houses damaged or destroyed by the 2005 hurricanes.</p>

        <p>Many Unhappy With School Law  As the president and some Democrats push to renew the No Child Left Behind law, discontent with it in many states is threatening to undermine the effort in both parties.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>California Psychiatrist Arrested  A prominent California child psychiatrist who had treated four generations of troubled youth and preached sex education on public television was arrested, accused of sexually abusing three of his charges.  A8</p>
        <p>Orders to Stop Sale of Drug  The Food and Drug Administration ordered drug companies to stop selling anti-nausea suppositories containing a drug that they said does not work when used in that form.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-5</p>
        <p>Fourth Man Arrested In String of Bank Robberies  A fourth man was arrested in connection with a string of recent bank robberies in New Jersey, one day after an F.B.I. agent was killed, apparently by another agent, while following the suspects, the authorities said. The charges filed against three of the men may be amended to include murder, officials said. B1</p>
        <p>Opposition Rule Not So Bad  The Democratic majority in Washington has created a peculiar reality: many moderate Republicans from swing districts in the Northeast are finding that life under Democratic rule has its advantages. A1</p>
