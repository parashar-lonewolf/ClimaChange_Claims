        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A recent study of the historical record of global average surface air temperatures over the last 100 years by James Hansen and Sergej Lebedeff, climatologists for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shows a warming of 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit after correcting for urban effects. Observed warming has been more than double this in high latitudes and less in the tropics. Yet Prof. Kenneth Watt of the University of California, Davis (''Cooler Reality Contradicts Greenhouse Theory,'' letter, Aug. 11), implies that the earth is actually getting cooler.</p>
        <p>Professor Watt's first evidence for cooling is that slightly more than half the cities whose temperatures you reported on a particular day, July 18, were cooler than normal. We note that those of us in Boston suffered through 25 days this summer with temperatures of 90 degrees Fahrenheit and above, during an unusually warm summer. However, both of these facts are essentially meaningless in establishing a long-term trend. In addition, greenhouse theory does not preclude extreme cold or extreme heat in any particular place or time, and the Florida freezes noted by Mr. Watt do not contradict the theory.</p>
        <p>His main claim is that the evidence for global warming is strongly biased by, and is indeed the result of, warming from urban activity, known as the urban heat-island effect. It is well known that buildings, asphalt, concrete and the removal of vegetation keep our cities warmer than their surroundings. Many temperature measuring stations are near population centers. This is a serious issue that does worry climatologists examining temperature records.</p>
        <p>However, contamination accounts for only a small part of the warming trend. The greatest warming has occurred, not in the regions of greatest population growth, but consistently in higher latitudes, as predicted by greenhouse theory. Though urban heat-island effects can cause great warming in the center of a city, this is not where meteorological measurements are usually taken. Warming has been observed in records of marine air temperature and in sea surface temperature, where there are no urban effects. Measurements above the surface, but within the lower atmosphere, show warming during the last 20 years. There are problems in all of these data sets, including a paucity of data for the Southern Hemisphere and over the oceans. However, it would be odd for the errors all to be in the same direction.</p>
        <p>While Professor Watt notes the fall in temperatures since 1940 in a set of rural stations, this should be placed in context. From 1940 to 1970, the average temperature did fall, not only in that special rural data set, but in the global data that Mr. Watt distrusts as well. This cooling is not a great mystery, but was probably caused by soot from unusually large amounts of volcanic activity.</p>
        <p>Globally, average surface air temperature increased steadily between 1880 and 1940, declined for the next 30 years and has increased rapidly since about 1970. Indeed the four warmest years on record have all occurred within the 1980's, with this year adding to that tally. The recent warming is all the more significant because incoming solar radiation has decreased by .1 percent in the last decade. The ''cooler reality'' is a chimera.
