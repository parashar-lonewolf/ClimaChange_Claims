        <p>LEAD: A special prosecutor's attempt to serve subpoenas in the perjury trial of Michael K. Deaver, the former Reagan aide who left the White House to start a multimillion dollar lobbying business, stirred up a diplomatic tempest last week.</p>
        <p>A special prosecutor's attempt to serve subpoenas in the perjury trial of Michael K. Deaver, the former Reagan aide who left the White House to start a multimillion dollar lobbying business, stirred up a diplomatic tempest last week.</p>
        <p>The trouble began Tuesday when the prosecutor, Whitney North Seymour Jr., sought to force the Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Allan E. Gotlieb, and his wife, Sondra, to appear in court to testify on Mr. Deaver's involvement in Canadian-American issues when he was still working for the President.</p>
        <p>Canada said the Gotliebs would refuse and filed a protest with the State Department, arguing that the action violated the Ambassador's diplomatic immunity. The State Department agreed. But Mr. Seymour, a court-appointed prosecutor, accused Canada of trying to hamper the prosecution of Mr. Deaver, who is charged with lying to Congress and to a Federal jury.</p>
        <p>The former deputy White House chief of staff, who left the White House in May 1985, was reportedly paid $105,000 by the Canadian Government for his lobbying help. One of the five counts against him charges that he lied about his participation in White House meetings on acid rain and in the selection of a special envoy on the issue. It also accuses him of lying when he testified that he did not recall a lunch with Mr. Gotlieb in January 1985.</p>
        <p>The special prosecutor asked a Federal District judge to enforce the subpoenas on the ground that Mr. Gotlieb was an ''essential'' witness. The State Department sided with Canada, telling the judge that the incident ''calls into question the ability of the United States to carry out its international obligations.'' The court delayed a decision on the subpoenas. The trial was to have begun June 8.</p>
