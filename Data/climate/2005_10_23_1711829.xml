        <p>THE television critic Nancy Franklin wrote in a recent issue of The New Yorker that ''this is a very good time to be a manufacturer of smoke machines.''</p>
        <p>Her observation was based on the abundance of new television shows, like ''Invasion'' and ''Night Stalker,'' that are filmed on dark, foggy sets, meant to inspire ominous vibes. Ms. Franklin didn't even mention ''The Fog,'' the horror movie in which vapor-shrouded ghosts menace a seaside town. The film was No.1 at the box office last weekend.</p>
        <p>Yet smoke machines needn't always be used to create a sinister atmosphere, as evidenced by the list of customers using the Jem Glaciator X-Stream, a 253-pound box on wheels that is advertised as ''the last word in heavy fog.'' The plumed showgirls at Bally's Hotel in Las Vegas, for example, shimmy through the Glaciator X-Stream's murky fog; so do the performers of Acquire the Fire, a Christian youth tour.</p>
        <p>Large-scale productions like these obviously can't settle for the old high-school theater trick of filling buckets with frozen carbon dioxide, better known as dry ice; the substance emits a bare wisp of vapor, and it's dangerous to move from truck to stage. Instead, professionals rely on huge fog machines like the Glaciator X-Stream, produced by the lighting company Martin Professional of Arhus, Denmark. At full power, the X-Stream can blanket an 860-square-foot space with opaque haze in 60 seconds flat.</p>
        <p>Martin Frihagen, international business manager for Martin's line of Jem smoke machines, talked about the specifications of the Glaciator X-Stream as if the machine were a muscle car. ''We have a 3.5-kilowatt heat exchanger,'' he said, ''and we have a one-horsepower compressor for maximum cooling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frihagen explains that the machine heats up a glycolic fluid, then rapidly chills it down to minus 44 degrees Fahrenheit. That creates a dense fog that is pushed outward by quiet two-speed fans.</p>
        <p>The Glaciator X-Stream is now the company's primary heavy-fog solution. Its predecessor, called just the Glaciator, worked all right, Mr. Frihagen said, but it couldn't keep pumping the haze for long periods because of overheating. The X-Stream, by contrast, has a microprocessor that automatically reduces output by 60 percent after a few minutes of full-tilt fog production.</p>
        <p>''It can run 24/7 if you wanted it to,'' Mr. Frihagen said, though he acknowledged that no one really needed that much heavy fog.</p>
        <p>Development of the X-Stream began in 2001 and took approximately 18 months. Martin's researchers had to verify that the machine could survive the rigors of handling. ''You have roadies treating them really roughly at rock concerts, throwing them in and out of vans,'' Mr. Frihagen said. ''So we did vibration testing, to simulate them being trucked around America.'' The X-Stream still worked, no matter how violently it was shaken and banged.</p>
        <p>The machine is intended to accommodate two different types of glycolic fluid. The B2 mix creates a fog that is heavy yet evaporates quickly; the fluid's spec sheet says that it is ''ideally suited for dramatic scenes involving a lot of stage activity or dance.'' The C3 mix, on the other hand, produces a lingering mist that resembles the froth atop a witch's kettle.</p>
        <p>The machine, priced at $9,995, is available from just three authorized distributors in the United States, so it is not for the casual user who simply wants to spice up a Halloween party. That's probably for the best, as the owner's manual warns of what may befall household users: if operated incorrectly, it says, there is a serious risk of electric shock, burns and respiratory complications. Better to save the 10 grand and buy a few more cardboard skeletons and bags of candy corn.</p>
