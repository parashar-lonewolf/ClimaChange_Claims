        <p>Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich, a professor of biology and population studies at Stanford University, believes in evolution -- or, more precisely, in evolutions. He believes in Darwinian evolution, of course, and the premise that life evolves through genetic mutations coupled with the crucible of natural selection.</p>
        <p>But more important, he believes in the power of cultural evolution -- all the nongenetic changes that human societies and individuals undergo, from decade to decade and moment to moment, including changes in language, technology, ethics, behavior, alliances, enmities, schemes and visions.</p>
        <p>It is because he believes so profoundly in the power of cultural evolution to shape human behavior that he has written a new book called ''Human Natures: Genes, Cultures and the Human Prospect,'' which seeks to counterbalance the popularity of neo-Darwinism and behavioral genetics with a recognition that culture should not be ignored in our effort to understand who we are, where we're going, and what we're doing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ehrlich also displays a bit of personal evolution. Since the publication of his spectacularly successful and often harshly criticized book ''The Population Bomb'' in 1968, his ideas about the threat of overpopulation, as well as other environmental crises, have grown more nuanced, though no less fiercely held. His appearance, too, lately has evolved, through the addition of a short, gray-and-white beard that gives him the look of a fisherman in want of a corncob pipe -- or a village preacher in search of a soapbox.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ehrlich, 68, took a seated soapbox recently at the Mayflower Hotel here to talk about his new book, his past missteps, and the ever-evolving tragicomedy called humankind.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you name your book ''Human Natures'' deliberately, to emphasize your belief that there isn't just one genetically hard-wired human nature, but many different natures?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, everybody who thinks about the problem closely realizes that there is no such thing as a fixed human nature, but rather an interaction between our genotypes, the genetic information we have and the different environments we live in, with the result that all our natures are unique.</p>
        <p>A main theme of the book was to emphasize the gigantic role that cultural evolution plays in making individuals different, and in making groups different. I'm hoping to counter a view that I'm afraid is all too common among the American public, that all of our behavior is controlled by our genes, and that there are genes that code for aggressiveness, acquisitiveness and so on.</p>
        <p>The truth is, You can never remove culture from the mix. There's some really interesting work coming out on how culture affects how we think, and how our brain develops. The new results suggest, for example, that Japanese people raised in Japan and the Japanese raised in this country actually think differently about the world.</p>
        <p>Q. Cultural evolution is one of those things that we all know goes on, but none of us really knows what it means. Do you have your own definition?</p>
        <p>A. Cultural evolution, from a biologist's point of view, and I think from the point of view of most social scientists, can be defined most simply as change in the body of nongenetic information that we human beings have, including what's stored in our brains, what's stored in our books, our buildings, our computer disks, our films, and obviously it's changing all the time. Cultural information can change much more rapidly than genetic information.</p>
        <p>It's not constrained by the human generation time, which is about 20 years, and it's not constrained in the direction in which it flows or in the number of people who can acquire that information. My grandchildren may not be able to give me genes, but they can, and do, teach me things, which to an extent restructure my brain.Charles Darwin was able to teach me things. Plato has passed on information to me over thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Q. So how do we benefit by thinking about the importance of cultural evolution?</p>
        <p>A. When you look at situation in the world today, the physicists, the biologists, the ecologists, we all pretty much know what's wrong in general terms, particularly with the environment, and we know what direction we ought to be moving in, but we don't have much of a clue about how to get there. That's because we don't know how cultural evolution works, and we don't even acknowledge that it's going on.</p>
        <p>I'm employed by an institution that's trying to change cultural evolution -- it's called Stanford University. In upstate New York there's a place that's another attempt at changing cultural evolution, called Sing Sing. But there are pitfalls in trying to change human behavior without being aware or honest about it.</p>
        <p>Stalin sure tried to change human behavior, and what a disaster that was. Somewhere there's got to be a careful line in which we try to influence people's behavior, because we're always trying to do that anyway, but to do it in a more open, coordinated and well-informed way.</p>
        <p>Q. Is it really possible to take a biologist's approach to the study of cultural evolution?</p>
        <p>A. So far, a general view of cultural evolution has eluded us, but that doesn't mean it's not worth trying. Obviously very small things can have enormous impact. Look at Chang and Eng, the Siamese twins who were joined at the chest. They had virtually identical genotypes, and you can't imagine two people being raised in a more similar environment. Yet one was dominant, the other submissive, one was a drunk, the other sober, and they even sometimes voted for opposite parties in elections.</p>
        <p>Their story tells us right off the bat that genes don't control you. It also tells us that very small differences in upbringing and environment can escalate into very different outcomes.  We ought to be looking at what these small differences are, how early they can act and how we might put them to good use.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you propose that an understanding of cultural evolution might be put to use?</p>
        <p>A. Well, apart from the four or five contrarians who say we shouldn't worry about global warming, the vast majority of the scientific community says it's a problem, and that we should be paying attention and doing something about it. But you tell me how you get Americans out of their automobiles and S.U.V.'s, and convince them that gasoline prices today -- which, incidentally, are very similar in terms of constant dollars to the gasoline prices of the 1950's -- are too low, not too high, as everybody is complaining.</p>
        <p>That's one reason for writing the book. I'm saying, let's look at our history as a species to figure out what that will tell us about how we might change.</p>
        <p>Q. What do we learn by looking at our deep prehistory?</p>
        <p>A. We learn that the rates of some kinds of cultural evolution are getting faster and faster. For millions of years of our prehistory, there was very little change in our culture. We had the same stone tools for hundreds of thousands of years. Then about 50,000 years ago, all of sudden culture changed very dramatically, and you started to get art, much finer tools and the start of a period of increasingly frequent revolutions -- in agriculture, printing, industry.</p>
        <p>Since the spacing of cultural revolutions is getting shorter, that's something we should pay attention to. There's also a mismatch in the speed of evolution of our technology compared with the evolution of our ethics. If you understand that simple thing, which many people don't, then a lot more effort might be put into play by our society to see how we might speed up evolution of our ethics.</p>
        <p>Q. What about the argument that it's better to let the free market make whatever changes need changing, rather than to try to socially engineer such changes?</p>
        <p>A. There are many things that markets do better than we can with command and control, and there are many environmental problems that can use an even greater infusion of market principles than we have today. But the markets don't account for everything, like so-called externalities.</p>
        <p>The price you pay for gas at the pump doesn't include the costs of air pollution, or cleaning up rivers if oil spills into the ground, or the time wasted in traffic jams from all the cars on the road. If the market could totally capture all these other things, then the market alone would probably do the job. But there's not the slightest sign that we can internalize the externalities.</p>
        <p>Q. You've been accused of being a Jeremiah and a fearmonger, and your critics love to point out how wrong some of your predictions in ''The Population Bomb'' were.</p>
        <p>A. The book was a tract written with a very explicit purpose, and that was to bring the population issue into the then-building discussion of the environment. Would I say today everything I said back then? You show me a scientist who believes everything he believed 32 years ago, I'll show you a nut. Obviously I've learned a lot.</p>
        <p>My analysis of agriculture was off. I thought there were going to be a lot of large-scale famines, as did a lot of other people. It turns out that, while there have been some large famines, and though about 10 million people a year still die of things related to food shortages, the food problem has improved overall. We underestimated the speed with which farmers would adopt the green revolution.</p>
        <p>Yes, I was naive when I wrote ''The Population Bomb.'' But in my view, the basic situation hasn't changed, except to get worse. The environment is deteriorating, we're using up our natural capital, and someday, we don't know how, that's going to get us. But if we get smart, we might be able to dodge that bullet.</p>
