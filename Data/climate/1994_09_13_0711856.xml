        <p>SINCE the first stone tools appeared in Africa about two and a half million years ago, corresponding with the emergence of the earliest direct human ancestors, anthropologists have long assumed that the ability to make tools was somehow linked to brain size. The earliest members of the genus Homo, with a relatively large brains, had the ability, so it was thought, but not their smaller-brained primate relatives.</p>
        <p>This standard assumption is now being challenged by an anatomical study that has produced a rule of thumb that is more than a figure of speech.</p>
        <p>Applying the rule with surprising results, a scientist has determined that all hominids, small-brained australopithecines as well as large-brained Homos, could have been using tools at least two million years ago. The new findings provide further evidence to discredit a theory, once widely held, that no two species of hominids with similar cultural abilities, like toolmaking, could possibly have existed at one time and place.</p>
        <p>In a close examination of the modern human thumb, Dr. Randall L. Susman, an anatomist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, got the idea for the study. He identified a particular bone whose size and shape are related to the thumb muscles that enable people to grasp things with force and precision. This bone, the first metacarpal, which is embedded in the palm of the hand at the base of the thumb, is broader in humans than in chimpanzees, the closest living relative of humans, because it must support three extra power muscles, which chimpanzees lack.</p>
        <p>Like humans, chimpanzees can oppose their thumbs to the rest of their fingers and so can use sticks for digging and stones for simple tasks. But their hands are better adapted for swinging from branches. Only humans can apply the significant force needed for opening jar lids and grasping hammers or the dexterity for holding a pencil, needle or surgeon's scalpel.</p>
        <p>Once Dr. Susman recognized the revealing nature of the first metacarpal bone, he reasoned that a comparative analysis of fossil thumbs should be a reliable way of determining which of the early hominids would have had hands that functioned in a way similar to those of modern humans. The results of the study were reported in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>Of the four fossil species examined, only Australopithecus afarensis, the species associated with the famous "Lucy" skeleton, failed the rule of thumb. Its first metacarpal bone was narrow and apelike, incapable of supporting the enhanced thumb musculature required for toolmaking. This was to be expected, because this species lived three million to four million years ago, long before any evidence for toolmaking. Another member of this group, Australopithecus africanus, was not tested, but it became extinct two million years ago and tools have never been found with its fossils.</p>
        <p>Nor was it surprising that the thumbs of Homo erectus and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis were of the toolmaking and tool-using type. Homo erectus evolved some 1.8 million years ago and is the immediate ancestor to modern humans. The Neanderthals, which became extinct less than 40,000 years ago, were apparently a subspecies of modern humans with more in common than not. Ample evidence of stone and bone implements has been found at sites associated with both groups.</p>
        <p>Gorilla-Like Toolmaker?</p>
        <p>A result that may be harder for paleoanthropologists to accept is the discovery through this analysis that Paranthropus robustus also had a toolmaker's thumb. This Paranthropus, also known as Australopithecus robustus, emerged at least two and a half million years ago and was a longtime contemporary of Homo erectus. But it looked more like a gorilla, had a brain size roughly half that of Homo erectus and one-third that of Homo sapiens and belonged to a branch of the hominid family tree that became extinct about a million years ago.</p>
        <p>The result did not surprise Dr. Susman, who for several years has contended that some of the fossil bones associated with tool discoveries in South Africa belonged not to Homo erectus but to Paranthropus robustus. The thumb tests, he reported, "indicate that tools were likely to have been used by all early hominids at around two million years ago."</p>
        <p>The technique, he said, should lend itself to wide application. An advantage is that it relies on a single thumb bone, not a complete hand, and one that is well represented in the fossil record.</p>
        <p>In comments accompanying the published report, Dr. Leslie C. Aiello, a paleontologist at University College London, praised the analysis as "simple, but elegant." But she cautioned against making any sweeping inferences based on the research until it can be more firmly established that the fossils tested were from a Paranthropus and not a Homo erectus.</p>
        <p>"Two ambiguous bones are insufficient evidence upon which to determine whether more than one contemporaneous species of our early ancestors made and used tools," Dr. Aiello wrote.</p>
        <p>Dr. Susman suggested in an interview that Dr. Aiello must not have been aware that more recent research had, he said, cleared up the ambiguity and identified these fossils from Swartkrans Cave in South Africa as definitely belonging to Paranthropus.</p>
        <p>Other scientists reserved judgment, but foresaw controversy. Even though the single-species hypothesis is dead, said Dr. Pat Shipman, a paleontologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, some scientists in the field are still resistant to the idea that more than one hominid could have been making tools at the same time and place. Some Difficult Questions</p>
        <p>If they eventually award a thumbs-up to the research, scientists will face other questions of interpretation. How could two species manage to have developed similar toolmaking abilities? How did they coexist? Why did one line of toolmakers survive to the present, while the other fell by the wayside?</p>
        <p>Five years ago, when Dr. Susman first offered indirect evidence for Paranthropus toolmaking but before he hit upon the thumb test, Dr. Shipman suggested an explanation for why two different species might have made the same type of simple tools, mostly choppers, scrapers, sharp flakes and spheroids for cracking nuts or bones.</p>
        <p>Making these tools might have been fairly simple, she said, but the idea of turning a blunt, heavy rock into something small and sharp was an inspired conceptual leap. Perhaps the idea first came to the larger-brained Homo, but the practice was eventually imitated by the contemporary species of more limited intellect.</p>
        <p>The early tools, being so unspecialized, were equally good for many tasks. "The same spheroid that broke open nuts for one species might have cracked open marrow-bearing bones for another," Dr. Shipman wrote.</p>
        <p>Differences in eating habits and other behavior could have held competition to a minimum and insured a long coexistence between the two species in the same geographical area, paleontologists said. Paranthropus was a vegetarian and Homo an omnivore.</p>
        <p>The apparent toolmaking skill will deprive scientists of one item on the list of reasons for the extinction of Paranthropus, the last of the australopithecines. When it occurred more than a million years ago, paleontologists thought, climate change was sweeping Africa and drier conditions led to a loss of forest habitats. Perhaps the vegetarian Paranthropus could not adapt to change quickly enough, but Homo erectus could. The new evidence seems to show that Paranthropus had more talents than given credit for.</p>
        <p>The new thumb test, Dr. Susman said, might also help clear up questions about who produced three stone tools found in 1960 in Olduvai Gorge, in Tanzania. The discovery by Mary Leakey of a partial hand of Homo habilis, the earliest identified member of the human lineage, prompted the inferences that early Homo was the first toolmaker. Some of those tools could have been made by Homo's vegetarian neighbors.</p>
