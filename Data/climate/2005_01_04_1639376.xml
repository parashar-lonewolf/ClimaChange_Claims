        <p>The career of Richard Ellis advances the maxim that scientific knowledge is often moved forward by the work of committed amateurs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis, an unpaid member of the paleontology department at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, where he has an office, researches the habitat, activities and daily lives of animals, past and present.</p>
        <p>He then weaves that research into books, 14 so far, that describe and illustrate what he has learned.</p>
        <p>Extinct species -- and how they got that way -- is the subject of his latest effort, ''No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species.''</p>
        <p>In it, he gives new life to creatures like the Irish elk, extinct for about 5,000 years, and the Bullockornis, a fantastic bird eight feet tall that disappeared from Australia some 50,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis, who is 66, spoke of his work on a recent morning in the sprawling Manhattan loft he shares with his partner of 15 years, Stephanie Guest, a restaurateur.</p>
        <p>Q. How would you describe your profession?</p>
        <p>A. I'm a naturalist who draws pictures. In terms of the American Museum, I'm a research associate. It's a title that bestows no salary. I have an office.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you develop this job?</p>
        <p>A. When I was a kid, I drew animals. This was my homage to the creatures I admired. I wasn't a hunter. Other people will tell you that they admire deer and buffalo and they shoot them. I didn't want to shoot them. I would make them ''mine'' by drawing them.</p>
        <p>As a kid, it occurred to me that the ideal job was to paint dioramas at the American Museum. By the time I was in my 20's, I was doing that. In the late 1960's, I participated in the design of the Hall of Ocean Life. I designed the whale, which is still hanging there.</p>
        <p>It was my work on it that led me to become active in the whale conservation movement. In the 1960's, the Russians and the Japanese were killing about 25,000 sperm whales a year in the Pacific.</p>
        <p>My feeling was, Who gave them the right to kill the world's whales? I spent a lot of the 1960's on street corners exhorting strangers about this matter. Later, I decided I could reach more people with books.</p>
        <p>Q. Your latest book is a survey of extinctions. Why tackle such a grim subject?</p>
        <p>A. I don't think of it as grim, although my publisher did. They didn't want me to call the book ''The Extinction Scenario.'' So we compromised with the current title. But extinction is a fact of life. Like death, it happens. And one would like to understand why and how.</p>
        <p>Almost everything that's ever been on earth is extinct. The figure generally quoted is that 99.9 percent of all species are extinct.</p>
        <p>So learning about extinction is as much a part of evolutionary theory as the standard concepts of evolution because everything dies -- every individual and every species. Since we don't know why this is so, it seemed useful to survey what we do know.</p>
        <p>Q. It must have been technically difficult to learn about the various extinctions. There can't be a lot of source material.</p>
        <p>A. It wasn't easy. Much of what we know about prehistoric life comes from the fossil record, and that is incomplete. We only know about those animals who died under the right circumstances and who thus left us fossils. There are an enormous number of species of which we know nothing and probably never will. They just didn't fossilize.</p>
        <p>Of course, we know a lot more about modern extinctions. The passenger pigeon, which was the most numerous bird in the world, was put out of existence by wanton slaughter. Right now in the oceans there are many many species in danger of becoming extinct. The why is obvious: overfishing.</p>
        <p>Q. Your new book is full of drawings of extinct creatures in their natural habitats. How can you know what their lives were like?</p>
        <p>A. Mostly from fossil material. If you find an animal with big teeth and powerful jaws, chances are that it was a predator.</p>
        <p>If it's a creature like Archaeopteryx with wings and feathers, we know it probably flew. In many cases, there are relatives of those animals living now. We may not have saber-toothed cats, but we do have tigers. So we can make some suppositions. I do try to give the creatures dignity in my drawings. I respect them.</p>
        <p>Q. What are your research methods?</p>
        <p>A. I read. I look at fossils. I go to museums, look at the mounted skeleton, and imagine what it might look like fleshed out. Because of my connection to the American Museum, I can sometimes go into backrooms and look at bones, see how they work, examine the skull.</p>
        <p>There are times, too, when I work with paleontologists. I've worked, for instance, with Philip Gingerich, who in the 1970's discovered the skeleton of Pakicetus, the first walking whale.</p>
        <p>I'd send him my drawing and he'd write back, ''According to my fossil, the legs should be longer.''</p>
        <p>The drawing of a creature that looked something like an otter was eventually in my book ''Aquagenesis.'' After it came out, Hans Thewissen, the other big guy in this area, said, ''No, no, no, Pakicetus looked more like a long-legged shrew.''</p>
        <p>So I sent a new drawing to Gingerich and he said, ''I think he's right.'' So in the paperback, we have a completely different-looking animal.</p>
        <p>Q. Some biologists believe we are in the midst of great extinction right now. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>A. I think we are going through what is sometimes called the sixth great extinction. I think the reasons for the current extinctions are not necessarily like those of the past, which were often related to natural phenomena like disease, climate change or meteorites. What we are experiencing now is man-made.</p>
        <p>E.O. Wilson at Harvard has tried to quantify the number of species going extinct. But it's hard to do because there are still so many undiscovered small animals, insects particularly. They are dying off as we destroy rain forests and wetlands. So we're losing animals that we don't know exist.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the book you are currently working on?</p>
        <p>A. I'm writing about how tigers, rhinos and bears are being made extinct by the practices of traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
        <p>There wasn't enough room in the current book to really to discuss this, and I wanted to say more about how practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine use animal potions to cure and alleviate disease or to serve as aphrodisiacs.</p>
        <p>Some of the most popular of these ''medicines'' are made from tiger bones, rhino horns and bear gallbladders, for which the animals must be killed. Before they are killed, the bears are put into cages and a catheter is inserted into their gallbladder to drain the bile until they die. The medicines probably don't work, and tigers, rhinos, and bears are close to extinction.</p>
        <p>Did you know that there are probably more tigers now in Texas than there are in India. It would be much better if they used aspirin or Viagra.</p>
        <p>Q. Can some of the new reproductive and genetic technologies serve as a hedge against extinction?</p>
        <p>A. There are people working on that. If they are successful, it will create interesting problems. For instance, one of the recent extinctions has been of the Tasmanian tiger. The last one was known to exist in 1934.</p>
        <p>But the DNA to the animal is easily available. And therefore, the director of the Australian Museum in Sydney thinks it would be a good idea to clone a Tasmanian tiger. If they succeed, they will have resuscitated an extinct animal.</p>
        <p>But then the question becomes: What do we do with it? Do we put it in a zoo till it dies? Do we turn it loose in the Tasmanian and Australian countryside where the sheep herders can kill them again? Do we clone a whole lot of them to keep each other company?</p>
        <p>Q. Some of this sounds a little bit like the opening of ''Jurassic Park.''</p>
        <p>A. Yes. ''Jurassic Park'' begins with John Hammond's thinking it would be a wonderful thing for people to see dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>The technology of today is not advanced enough to recreate a dinosaur from a drop of blood preserved in amber, but it might really be possible to recreate a Tasmanian tiger. If they succeeded, I'd certainly want to see it. I'd love to see a recreated Irish elk. I'd be first in line for that.</p>
