        <p>THREE long years in advance, perhaps factoring in the effects of global warming, the mayor of New York forecast the opening-day weather for the field of dreams the Mets announced yesterday they are planning to inhabit by 2009.</p>
        <p>''Sixty-eight, sixty-nine degrees,'' Michael R. Bloomberg promised during a news conference of the sunniest order, as politicians and Mets owners and administrators basked jointly in their own munificence, in the gift, soon to break ground, they said they would give to New York.</p>
        <p>Hours later, back in chilly, charmless Shea Stadium, Pedro Martínez once again demonstrated that he doesn't need wider concourses and better sightlines to excite, or incite.</p>
        <p>Short on Florida perspiration and innings, Martínez had a characteristically loony and longer-than-expected six-inning, 96-pitch outing against the Washington Nationals in what was billed in the newspaper advertisements as ''Pedro Martínez's Opening Night.'' Fright and near-fight night, as it turned out, as Martínez hit three batters, including Jose Guillen twice.</p>
        <p>The second time, Guillen wanted to get even with a bat in his hands, but, fortunately, was stopped from behind by Ted Barrett as both dugouts and bullpens emptied. Nick Johnson, the Nationals' other plunkee, had better luck, tagging Martínez for a three-run homer, but the Mets and Martínez got a 10-5 victory with home-run support from Carlos Delgado and Carlos Beltran.</p>
        <p>''Whenever he pitches, something seems to happen,'' said David Wright, himself a target -- though not actually hit -- for retaliation by the Nationals' Ramon Ortiz.</p>
        <p>Every five days last season, Martínez made the Mets matter well beyond their chronic mediocrity, more than measuring up to the first leg of his four-year, $53 million contract. A pitcher people can only love when he's on their side, he won 15 games and might have had 20 with more bullpen help. Martínez, Omar Minaya's first statement signing, figuratively towered over his team at 5 feet 11 inches, 180 pounds.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't believe how small he was,'' said the new closer, Billy Wagner, describing his first spring training chat with Martínez. ''I thought everybody like that would be 6-5.'' Such is the power of Pedro's provocation, which Wagner first experienced a decade ago, as a rookie with Houston. Martínez, throwing much harder than he does now, drilled Craig Biggio with a pitch. The Astros' Doug Drabek retaliated by hitting Martínez.</p>
        <p>''He started hitting people and we started hitting people,'' Wagner said. ''The next thing I knew we were in a brawl.''</p>
        <p>Martínez's only casualty last night was Barrett, the umpire. The fifth-inning pitch that grazed Guillen struck Barrett in the neck causing him to leave.</p>
        <p>''You want to charge, charge, but don't bring your bat,'' Martínez said of Guillen, claiming, as usual, that all he was guilty of was pitching inside.</p>
        <p>One night after Wagner blew his first save as a Met, after the rookie Brian Bannister unintentionally hit two Nationals and emotions were already raw, Martínez made his debut with a salty performance, if not his best stuff.</p>
        <p>''There's an aura, a swagger that I've never seen before with a starting pitcher,'' Wright said.</p>
        <p>Some day soon, Wright, who had three more hits last night, is going to be the face of the Mets. Not yet, at least not on the night Martínez pitches.</p>
        <p>Wright was one of the players the Mets trotted out for their midday news conference yesterday to celebrate the architectural vision of the team's principal owner, Fred Wilpon, the ballpark to be built in the modernized spirit of Ebbets Field. Other players included were Beltran, Bannister and José Reyes. Their commonality was their youth, that they will likely be core Mets in 2009.</p>
        <p>Don't count on Martínez being in the new ballpark with them. His contract will expire after the 2008 season, when he is 37.</p>
        <p>Minaya gave him a fourth year to distinguish the Mets' bid from the Red Sox', to lure him from Boston. The Mets were a bad team in a park that is hospitable to pitchers but has long had the feel of a stadium that could be taken apart after a game, like a county state fair, the anti-Fenway.</p>
        <p>More than any of the New York metropolitan area pro teams pushing hard for a new home, trying to get that first shovel into the ground, the Mets had a case. Like the Yankees, they will pay construction costs for their new digs. Unlike the Yankees, they are not demanding or taking any more neighborhood space.</p>
        <p>Watching the politicians get their face time from the front row yesterday, Wright said he wished he could ''play in the new stadium tomorrow. But you have to be patient. It's still three years down the road.''</p>
        <p>Three more seasons at Shea, with Pedro Martínez on the payroll, helping to build a bridge he probably isn't going to cross, to a new ballpark that Wilpon said would be constructed to ''link the past with the future.''</p>
        <p>Martínez came to the Mets for the here and now, and helped attract Beltran right behind, then Delgado and Wagner last winter. He keyed a three-run fourth inning with an R.B.I. single, drew 25,839 fans to Shea on a cold April weekday night and had them chanting his name when Guillen wanted to wring his neck.</p>
        <p>He is the face of the Mets, and he has given them the facelift they needed in the dying years of their doughty old ballpark.</p>
