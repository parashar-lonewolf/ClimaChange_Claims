        <p>It's easy to imagine a bassoon as a person: tall, thin, reedy, a basso voice, the mouthpiece jutting out like an eerie index finger. At this concert of American and Greek folk music, the bassoon will be the centerpiece and Kim Laskowski, a professional bassoonist, is to play the instrument, which corresponds in range to the cello of the violin family.</p>

        <p>Children's Concert</p>
        <p>Riverside Church  490 Riverside Drive, at 120th Street  Morningside Heights  (212) 222-5900, extension 220  Recommended ages: 4 and up  Tomorrow</p>
        <p>It's easy to imagine a bassoon as a person: tall, thin, reedy, a basso voice, the mouthpiece jutting out like an eerie index finger. At this concert of American and Greek folk music, the bassoon will be the centerpiece and Kim Laskowski, a professional bassoonist, is to play the instrument, which corresponds in range to the cello of the violin family.</p>
        <p>"I started in junior high," Ms. Laskowski said. "My mother told me to take oboe or bassoon because nobody picks them. I knew I was going to do the bassoon for the rest of my life."</p>
        <p>But the hard-to-play bassoon will not be alone. Ms. Laskowski's husband, Zaharis Kalaitzis, is to be on percussions; Don Yallech is to sing and play the guitar, and Melissa Slocum is to be the double-bass player. The concert is part of a new series presented by the Riverside Weekday School (nursery and kindergarten) and the church's music department to offer inexpensive, good music to families. All the performers, except Mr. Yallech, have children at the school.</p>
        <p>The concert will be at 1 P.M. in the church's Gothic-style Tower Room, which has stained-glass windows and which overlooks the Hudson, leaving visitors feeling as if they are in a castle. The suggested admission for the hourlong concert is $5 for adults and $2 for children; the money is given to the musicians. Parents must stay with their children; stroller parking is available. You may tour the rest of the church before or after the music.  'Chemical Magic'</p>
        <p>Midtown West School  328 West 48th Street  Clinton  (212) 242-2372  Recommended ages: 5 to 12  Tomorrow</p>
        <p>Patricia Redden is a devotee of dry ice. "It's basically Perrier water," she said, referring to the results when dry ice is added to water and becomes bubbly. Ms. Redden, a professor of chemistry and the department chairwoman at St. Peter's College in Jersey City, is to present amazing chemical transformations at this "science can definitely be fun" program.</p>
        <p>"When dry ice is added to different acid-based indicators, it changes colors, like from red to yellow, red to blue, blue to red," she said. "It can also produce a smoky effect." Ms. Redden has traveled around New York City for eight years (she now takes her 8- and 5-year-old children along), demonstrating that science is magic but not necessarily an illusion. She performs a science show, for example, at the American Museum of Natural History during National Chemistry Week each November.</p>
        <p>What else will she prove tomorrow? That nitric acid mixed with copper creates the equivalent of acid rain, and that some polymers bounce. (If you don't know what a polymer is, you'd better head to this show.) "I like to give explanations of what I'm doing," she said. "I let the audience know how it's important to them." She also takes questions, so don't be shy.</p>
        <p>The hourlong program starts at 11 A.M. and is a fund-raiser for Midtown West, the elementary school that is a collaboration with Bank Street College. Admission to the school, which serves pupils from the five boroughs, is by lottery.</p>
        <p>In addition to Ms. Redden's scientific feats, there will be science books and cookies for sale, free Mary Kay facials (cosmetics for purchase) and a mini-thrift shop. Tickets are $6 for adults and $4 for children, at the door.</p>
