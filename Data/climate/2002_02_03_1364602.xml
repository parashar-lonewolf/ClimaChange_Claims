        <p>Only a few months ago, Democrats saw great promise in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, figuring it could play a big part in their plans to take back the House in the 2002 elections.</p>
        <p>It is easy to understand why. The seat is held by a freshman Republican, Mike Ferguson, who eked out a victory in the 2000 election in a district that voted overwhelmingly for  Al Gore.</p>
        <p>But there was more to it than that. Moderate Republicans like Mr. Ferguson had been placed in a political bind because the new Republican president, George W. Bush, began advancing a decidedly conservative agenda during his first eight months in office.</p>
        <p>Democrats seemed eager to exploit this, threatening to tie Mr. Ferguson to the Bush agenda in the 2002 elections -- even as Mr. Ferguson moved to distance himself from some of the President's policies and establish his independence.</p>
        <p>Then came the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the war in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Now, the president's popularity is soaring, and Democrats are suddenly acknowledging that their strategy could backfire.</p>
        <p>This reversal underscores the volatility of politics and how quickly the public's view of its leaders can change. More than that, though, it suggests the new obstacles Democrats face in their campaign to take back the House, where Republicans hold a six-seat majority.</p>
        <p>One Democratic strategist marveled at how things have changed in the past few months.</p>
        <p>''If the election were held tomorrow, Mike Ferguson would be re-elected,'' the strategist said. ''Tying him to the president would only help him right now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson is also keenly aware of the new political environment.</p>
        <p>''The world has changed,'' he said in a recent interview. ''It's an amazing turnaround.''</p>
        <p>Before Sept. 11, Mr. Ferguson faced a major balancing act, forced to choose between his president and a district that he won with a mere 50 percent of the vote, as against his opponent's 48 percent.</p>
        <p>But he moved decisively, taking positions that helped inoculate him against Democratic charges that he was unwilling to stand up to his party's dominant conservative wing. Again and again, he defied Mr. Bush, particularly on environmental and educational issues.</p>
        <p>He joined his fellow Republican, Representative Marge Roukeman, the dean of the New Jersey delegation, in sending a letter to the president after his administration reversed itself on placing certain limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferguson also spoke out against the Bush administration's proposal to allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- as well as the administrations decision to reconsider a Clinton-era policy that called for cutting the amount of naturally occurring arsenic in municipal drinking water.</p>
        <p>He also defied Republican congressional leaders in seeking full financing for special education programs. This was all the more remarkable because he had an unlikely ally: Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island, the former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who traveled to New Jersey the previous year to campaign against Mr. Ferguson.</p>
        <p>The Ferguson camp believes that moves like this have helped the congressman shore up his standing in the district, regardless of how voters feel about the president.</p>
        <p>''I think Mike has charted a middle course that has been faithful to his district,'' said Chris Jones, his chief of staff.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's high approval ratings certainly do not hurt these days.</p>
        <p>''We've had the wind at our backs for the last few months because of the President's popularity,'' Mr. Jones acknowledged before noting, with amazement, that his boss does not even have a challenger yet.</p>
        <p>''A year ago, I would not have said that we would not have an opponent in February 2002,'' said Mr. Jones, noting the obvious political vulnerabilities that Mr. Ferguson had when he took his seat in Congress in January.</p>
        <p>But a lot still can happen between now and the Election Day, and Democrats contend that Mr. Bush's popularity could fade as quickly as it appeared, particularly if their party can shift the focus to Mr. Bush's domestic agenda and the slumping economy.</p>
        <p>Democrats say that Mr. Ferguson will have a lot of explaining to do if that happens. They argue that he has sided with the President on several  domestic matters that may not be all that popular among the moderate-leaning voters of his district.</p>
        <p>Democrats say, for example, that Mr. Ferguson is vulnerable because of the position he has taken in the debate over revamping the nation's campaign finance laws. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in the House have pushed for a vote on a bill opposed by Republican leaders and the president. But Mr. Ferguson has refused to join that bipartisan effort.</p>
        <p>''People are fixated with the war right now, but there is going to come a time in the next few months when people will focus on the domestic agenda,'' a Democratic strategist said. ''That's when Mike Ferguson becomes vulnerable, because he has cast votes with the president on a very reactionary, conservative agenda.''</p>
