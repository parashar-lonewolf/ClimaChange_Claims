        <p>LEAD: The decline in the earth's environmental health can be reversed, but only with a substantial investment by the rich nations, according to the 1988 State of the World report published by the Worldwatch Institute.</p>
        <p>The decline in the earth's environmental health can be reversed, but only with a substantial investment by the rich nations, according to the 1988 State of the World report published by the Worldwatch Institute.</p>
        <p>The institute, a Washington-based research and policy organization, estimates that $150 billion a year would be required to reverse the declining environment and put the developed and developing nations on the path to sustainable economic growth.</p>
        <p>The money would be used for reforestation, halting and reversing the growing loss of topsoil and the growth of deserts, family planning and other measures to curb population growth, developing energy sources that do not damage the environment, and dealing with the heavy burden of third world debt. The institute says foreign debt is an environmental issue because it leads poorer countries to waste their resources to obtain immediate capital.</p>
        <p>''Putting the world on a sustainable footing will not be easy, given the environmental degradation and economic confusion that now prevail,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and its project director for this report. To do so, he added, would take ''a wholesale reordering of priorities, a basic restructuring of the global economy and a quantum leap in international cooperation.''</p>
        <p>''To continue with a more or less business-as-usual attitude - to accept the loss of tree cover, erosion of soils, expansion of deserts, the disappearance of plant and animal species, the depletion of the ozone layer and the buildup of greenhouse gases - implies acceptance of economic decline and social disintegration,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The report pointed to a ready source for the money needed to restore the earth to health: global military expenditures that have now reached $900 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The report said national security is increasingly being defined in terms of environmental and economic security rather than by the standard of military power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown noted that in the last decade China had shifted much of its resources from military spending for just the kinds of investments called for in the institute report. In effect, he said in an interview, ''the Chinese walked away from the arms race,'' and in the process, doubled per capita income and raised food production by half.</p>
        <p>He said the United States and the Soviet Union ''are fully aware of the high price they are paying for the arms race.'' They are also aware, he contended, that Japan ''is amassing economic and political power without spending money on arms.''</p>
        <p>This is the institute's fifth annual State of the World report. It is printed in 11 languages and about 250,000 copies are sold worldwide.</p>
        <p>Among the issues examined in this year's report are ways to use energy more efficiently, reforestation, action to avoid what appears to be the accelerating extinction of plant and animal species, controlling toxic chemicals, and family planning. 'Readings Are Not Reassuring'</p>
        <p>In assessing the earth's ''vital signs,'' the report said, ''the readings are not reassuring: The earth's forests are shrinking, its deserts are expanding and its soils eroding - all at record rates.''</p>
        <p>Underground water tables are falling in North Africa, China and India and groundwater in the United States and other areas is increasingly contaminated by pesticides and other toxic substances, the report said. Lakes are dying from acid rain in the industrial North of the globe and the entire world faces the prospect of imminent warming because of the greenhouse effect, the buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, which prevents infrared radiation from the sun from escaping back into space.</p>
        <p>''The health of the earth's inhabitants,'' the report admonished, ''cannot be separated from that of the planet itself.''</p>
        <p>Copies of the report may be obtained from Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. The price is $18.95 for the hard-cover edition and $9.95 for the soft-cover.</p>
