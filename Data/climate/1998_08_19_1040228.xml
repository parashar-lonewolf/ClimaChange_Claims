        <p>Like many of my colleagues in the British House of Commons, I have been saddened by the way in which, from whatever motives, the independent counsel and sections of Congress have apparently decided that Bill Clinton's private life is more important than any of the challenges facing the world (editorial, Aug. 18).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Like many of my colleagues in the British House of Commons, I have been saddened by the way in which, from whatever motives, the independent counsel and sections of Congress have apparently decided that Bill Clinton's private life is more important than any of the challenges facing the world (editorial, Aug. 18).</p>
        <p>The allies of the United States recognize Mr. Clinton's strengths and want to work with him in the remaining years of his office on issues as diverse as the Japanese and Russian crises, the embassy bombings and the long-term challenges of global warming. We hope that he will now be allowed to get on with the job, and that members of Congress who support this will emerge strengthened from the midterm elections. We need the intelligent, strong partnership that the United States can offer.</p>
