        <p>LEAD: Get ready, America. It's almost time to celebrate our independence -independence, that is, from environmental ignorance.</p>
        <p>Get ready, America. It's almost time to celebrate our independence -independence, that is, from environmental ignorance.</p>
        <p>Next Friday, the Federal Community Right to Know Act goes into effect. For the first time, manufacturers and other businesses that use chemicals will be required to file reports detailing exactly which ones, and in what quantities, are emitted into the air, dumped into the ground and splashed into water.</p>
        <p>The reports will be more than just sterile numbers and polysyllabic chemical names. Whether you live near the tangle of pipes and smokestacks around Exit 13 of the New Jersey Turnpike, along the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, La., or near the major refineries south of Houston, you may find out that the health threats you've long worried about are indeed real.</p>
        <p>That might be scary but it also will be enlightening. People won't stop when they realize that they can apply pressure and make changes as a result of what they have learned from the right-to-know disclosures.</p>
        <p>Right to know possesses vast potential to get prompt action not only on the emissions it is specificially designed to catalogue but also on the full range of serious pollution problems plaguing us.</p>
        <p>We must deal with acid rain, ozone depletion, risks from garbage incineration plants and other dangers. From the right to know will flow the right to demand, and get, tougher laws and safer practices.</p>
        <p>Under the act, passed in 1986, data about chemicals will be made available to local planning committees, state agencies and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The intent of the law is to put the responsibility for decisions and responses in local hands. The E.P.A. plays less of a role than it has in other programs.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. will collect data nationwide and monitor the compliance required for businesses to avoid fines of $25,000 per day. But much of the obligation to make this idea work rests with citizens, whose committees, to make the law work, must compel disclosure by reluctant companies -using, among other tools, the right given them by the act to sue if necessary.</p>
        <p>With information in hand, local groups must hold companies accountable by pressing them to change their practices if the reports show undue health and safety risks, or to comply more fully with the reporting requirements if the companies do not appear to be doing so in good faith.</p>
        <p>Of course, if the act is to live up to its potential, industry must take compliance seriously. So far, there are encouraging signs that this will be the case. Some companies have even found ways to make the act profitable. One large chemical company, for instance, is marketing computer software that helps other companies fill out the forms.</p>
        <p>The Chemical Manufacturers Association reported in May that a large share of its members are explaining the provisions to their employees and to local committees established by the law. Yet the association expressed a fear that many share: Because of all the attention focused on chemical companies, many companies in other businesses do not yet realize they are among the thousands that also must comply.</p>
        <p>Those three little words - right to know - just might pack the punch we need to win the long fight against pollution.</p>
