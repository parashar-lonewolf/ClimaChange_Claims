        <p>Early on, one of the central characters in Kim Stanley Robinson's PACIFIC EDGE (Tor/Tom Doherty Associates, $18.95) declares, "There is no such thing as a pocket utopia." What he means is that an elitist paradise cannot survive for long as an island of perfection in an imperfect world. This sounds like a truism, yet Mr. Robinson spends the rest of the book bringing to life an appealing and perversely believable pocket paradise.</p>
        <p>Most utopian visions make boring reading. Despite some attempt (typically in the opening chapters) to disguise philosophy as fiction, authors with an ax to grind tend to scant storytelling in favor of polemics. Ursula Le Guin's 1974 novel "The Dispossessed" is a modern exception that speaks to our emotions as well as our intellect. Ms. Le Guin placed her utopian society in jeopardy in a way that challenged the wider applicability of that society's ideals; Mr. Robinson engages our attention by focusing on the day-to-day labor of putting ideals into practice.</p>

        <p>Most utopian visions make boring reading. Despite some attempt (typically in the opening chapters) to disguise philosophy as fiction, authors with an ax to grind tend to scant storytelling in favor of polemics. Ursula Le Guin's 1974 novel "The Dispossessed" is a modern exception that speaks to our emotions as well as our intellect. Ms. Le Guin placed her utopian society in jeopardy in a way that challenged the wider applicability of that society's ideals; Mr. Robinson engages our attention by focusing on the day-to-day labor of putting ideals into practice.</p>
        <p>If the residents of El Modena (in late 21st-century southern California) live in paradise, it is only because they work so hard to defend their way of life. Like all Californians, Kevin and Doris and Hank and Gabriela and Alfredo and Ramona worry about economic development and land use and water rights; they know where their water comes from -- mostly far away -- and they understand the political arts of compromise and give-and-take. Mr. Robinson tells us just enough about their cooperative, town-meeting type of self-government to make it sound plausible without reducing it to a bloodless formula. The issue that splits the town is what to do about Rattlesnake Hill, the last unspoiled hilltop in the area.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes Mr. Robinson's treatment of this conflict from dozens of overheated ecological-disaster scenarios is his sense of scale. He never equates the fate of a particular hill with the fate of civilization. Instead, through a blend of dirt-under-the-fingernails naturalism and lyrical magical realism, he invites us to share his characters' intensely personal, intensely local attachment to what they have. The result is a bittersweet utopia that may shame you into entertaining new hope for the future.</p>
        <p>The membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America once voted Isaac Asimov's "Nightfall" the best science fiction short story of all time. Now, a half-century after the story's publication, we have the novel NIGHTFALL (Doubleday, $19.95), a collaboration between Mr. Asimov and Robert Silverberg.</p>
        <p>The original story, written when Mr. Asimov was 21 years old, took off from a line of Emerson's: "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God!" The whole point of the story was to invent a scientifically plausible solar system in which such an event could actually occur, and then turn Emerson's prediction on its head. The inhabitants of the planet Kalgash, whose system is blessed with six suns and who have no way of imagining a dark night, much less a sky emblazoned with stars, react to the periodic "nightfall" with a worldwide panic that all but obliterates civilization.</p>
        <p>It was not only Emerson who took it on the chin in the original; the cocky scientists of Kalgash who thought they understood the universe were reduced to whimpering idiots by the immensities of time and space revealed when the last veil of sunlight dropped from their eyes.</p>
        <p>Continuing the story into the days and weeks following the terrifying nightfall, Mr. Silverberg and Mr. Asimov have altered the trajectory of the narrative out of all recognition. Instead of a fable about intellectual pride that ends in a thought-provoking blackout, this novel offers a rather pedestrian chronicle of the efforts of the surviving scientists and their religious adversaries to put the eggshell of society back together again. Unfortunately, we have read something like this a hundred times before, in the subgenre of science fiction known as the post-collapse novel. In such novels, which have proliferated in recent years, the collapse of civilization is typically triggered by a nuclear holocaust or some ecological catastrophe like global warming. By a curious alchemy, the new ending has transformed the appearance of the stars that made the original story so memorable into what might be called a retroactive cliche.</p>
        <p>WINTERLONG (Bantam Spectra, $4.95) by Elizabeth Hand is a post-collapse novel with a vengeance. The environment is shot to hell. Nuclear explosives and virus bombs have scrambled genes to produce some bizarre variants on the human standard. Remnants of warring governments still duel over the devastated terrain. And in the ruins of the City (Washington) a strange new civilization, cobbled together out of bits and pieces of the old, struggles to survive.</p>
        <p>The overgrown Mall is now a "Narrow Forest," haunted by "lazars" and "geneslaves." The cavernous buildings, which have grown "heavy kudzu beards," now house Curators who preserve, with some degree of success, the old scientific knowledge. But the real center of this world, and of Ms. Hand's novel, is the houses of pleasure where all the technology that has not yet been turned into instruments of destruction has been placed in the service of lust.</p>
        <p>The plot, which has as many twists as a mutated chromosome, deals with the re-emergence of magic (white and black) in a world familiar with the worst that science can do. The characters include several mad scientists, a military commander of surpassing maleficence, doomed decadents of every stripe, some not-so-innocent innocents and a few enigmas whose true nature may be revealed in the promised sequel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hand's style tends toward the ornate: "At the sound I start to turn, to break the reverie that binds me to this place, this tree stirred by a tainted wind riven from a bleak and noiseless shore." But her vision of children used and abused by malign forces is so strong it keeps bursting through the language to evoke not just horror and disgust but outrage and even -- a word much bandied about by inhabitants of the City -- empathy.</p>
        <p>If Rod Serling ever came back from the Twilight Zone to take up his career where he left off, the result might be HER PILGRIM SOUL: And Other Stories (Tor/Tom Doherty Associates, $17.95) by Alan Brennert. Here are all the master's tics, recycled for today's brave new world. The title story (which was in fact adapted from a script for CBS-TV's recent revival of "The Twilight Zone") strikes just the right tone of stylistic and conceptual pretension. A brilliant computer scientist who has trouble connecting with flesh-and-blood people gets a lesson in love (complete with many pregnant ellipses, italicized emphases, stunned dashes and a dynamite tag line by W. B. Yeats) from a long-dead woman who haunts his holograms.</p>
        <p>In another retread from "The Twilight Zone," a group of space explorers approaches a "sad, wounded" planet shrouded in pollution. A technician asks, "There was a name for this one, in one of the old languages, wasn't there, Professor?" The professor (quietly): "Earth. They called it Earth." After discovering that the dead world is haunted by its former inhabitants, the explorers somehow trigger a planetary rebirth, which they recognize as scientifically impossible: " 'It's as if something is . . .  accelerating evolution, somehow,' Archer said. 'As if -- ' " Two more dashes, one italicized exclamation and an ellipsis later, the truth is suddenly apparent: "The oceans are</p>
        <p>swarming</p>
        <p>with . . .  cyanobacteria," the precursors of all higher organisms. "For the Earth, the long night was over; and if she knew what strange dawn was about to break, she kept her counsel, and remained silent, silent as the dead."</p>
