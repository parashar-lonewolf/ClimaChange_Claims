        <p>The Great Pretender</p>
        <p>Flattery may get you nowhere, but mimicry -- that's another story. Take Chiloglottis trapeziformis, also known as the broad-lipped bird orchid, which grows in Australia. In appearance its lowest petal, or labellum, resembles a particular species of parasitic wasp, attracting males of the species that in trying to mate with it end up pollinating the plant.</p>
        <p>Such sexual mimicry (and deception) is not uncommon in nature. But the orchid takes it a step further: it also imitates the female wasp's scent. So the male is doubly deceived.</p>
        <p>Now, researchers from Australia and Germany have analyzed the compound produced by the orchid and compared it to the pheromone produced by the wasp. Their finding, reported in the journal Science, is that the two are identical.</p>
        <p>What makes this unusual, the researchers say, is that the chemical attractant consists of just one component. In other plants that use a mimicking chemical to attract pollinators, it is a blend of many common compounds.</p>
        <p>In a European orchid, Ophrys sphegodes, for example, the attractant consists of 14 hydrocarbon ingredients. The researchers suggest that this may offer evolutionary flexibility to this type of orchid; different species can evolve with different blends to adapt to different mating insects.</p>
        <p>By contrast, chiloglottis's chemical mimickry is much less flexible. The researchers point out, however, that this apparently has not stopped orchids that are pollinated by species of parasitic wasps from diversifying. There are about 300 of these orchid species.</p>
        <p>Albatross's Last Storm</p>
        <p>Hurricanes can cause widespread destruction: witness the millions left without electricity last month when the storm Isabel blew ashore. But on Bermuda 400,000 years ago, a hurricane caused a different kind of damage. It wiped out a breeding colony of albatrosses.</p>
        <p>That is the conclusion of Storrs L. Olson of the Smithsonian Institution and Paul J. Hearty of James Cook University in Australia, who studied albatross fossils on Bermuda.</p>
        <p>There were five species of albatross in the North Atlantic five million years ago. Nowadays there are none, except for the occasional bird that wanders up from the south. The fossil study, published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, gives a strong clue as to what happened to them.</p>
        <p>The researchers found the fossils, of short-tailed albatrosses, at a site they determined to be 405,000 years old. That date corresponds to a warming period when scientists believe that ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melted, raising sea levels by at least 65 feet.</p>
        <p>The fossils were buried in sediments and included adults, juveniles, hatchlings and even intact eggs, indicating the birds were entombed by a sudden event. The researchers say that this most likely was the storm surge from a hurricane (since the surge came from the south), which washed beach sand up and onto the nesting site.</p>
        <p>For the albatrosses, which breed only on islands and need flat, exposed sites to take off and land, the surge was the last straw. Over time, the rising sea level had reduced the amount of land available to the colony, and then the remaining land was overrun. The researchers suggest that loss of breeding sites like this one because of the elevated sea level was a probable cause of the disappearance of albatrosses from Bermuda, and from the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Return of the Rock</p>
        <p>Hermes, an 800-meter diameter asteroid, caused a splash -- figuratively -- 66 years ago when it passed about half a million miles from Earth, the closest known asteroid encounter at the time. But within days the rock was lost to astronomers.</p>
        <p>It remained lost until last week, when it was spotted by Brian Skiff of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz.</p>
