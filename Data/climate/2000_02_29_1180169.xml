        <p>Debate continues over over best method for measuring earth's temperature, using surface temperature readings, or readings measured by earth satellite (M)</p>

        <p>When the debate over global warming burst into prominence more than a decade ago, scientists based their assessment that the earth's temperature was rising on a single set of observations, those at the planet's surface.

        <p>Both had been weather observers, and both knew that the surface temperature readings were subject to multiple kinds of distortion -- including poor placement of thermometers, spotty coverage of some regions and the heat emitted by the concrete of cities.

        <p>When the debate over global warming burst into prominence more than a decade ago, scientists based their assessment that the earth's temperature was rising on a single set of observations, those at the planet's surface. Dr. John R. Christy and Dr. Roy W. Spencer were troubled by that.</p>
        <p>Both had been weather observers, and both knew that the surface temperature readings were subject to multiple kinds of distortion -- including poor placement of thermometers, spotty coverage of some regions and the heat emitted by the concrete of cities. So Dr. Christy and Dr. Spencer, atmospheric scientists at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, respectively, began wondering: could global temperatures be measured by earth satellite? If so, the problem of distorted data might be eliminated.</p>
        <p>They decided to find out, and discovered that in some ways the satellite and surface trends roughly matched. Both sets of measurements found substantial warming over Northern Hemisphere continents, for instance, and the timing of year-to-year temperature fluctuations was about the same in both. But unlike the surface record, the satellites revealed no underlying warming trend for much of the free atmosphere, up to about five miles, mainly in the tropics. In fact, the raw numbers showed a cooling there.</p>
        <p>It was this disclosure on which skeptics seized in their efforts to use the satellite record to cast doubt on the idea of global warming. Later, the satellite record was adjusted to filter out the effects of natural, short-term climate fluctuations like the El Nino phenomenon and temporary cooling produced by sun-blocking haze from volcanic eruptions. Later still, the record was corrected to eliminate distortions caused by the movements of the satellites.</p>
        <p>Now the satellite record showed a slight warming, but one much smaller than the apparent surface warming.</p>
        <p>Other analysts had for some time been examining the surface record and trying to eliminate or compensate for some of the imperfections that had originally concerned Dr. Spencer and Dr. Christy.</p>
        <p>Enter the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Christy and Dr. Spencer were members of the panel. In January, it published its analysis of the disparity.</p>
        <p>It found that the remaining margin of error in the surface measurements was now probably about one-tenth as large as the observed trend over the last century, and that the surface warming over the 20-year period of the satellite measurements, from 1979 to 1998, was ''undoubtedly real.'' That warming, it reported, was equal to 2.25 degrees to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit per century -- ''substantially greater'' than the surface warming over the preceding century as a whole.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the study panel found that over the same 20-year period, the satellite record showed an average global warming rate in the lower to middle free atmosphere of zero degrees to 1.8 degrees per century.</p>
        <p>How real was the discrepancy? The research council's panel of scientists found that the level of uncertainty inherent in obtaining and analyzing temperature observations was almost as large as the disparity, so it was difficult to know.</p>
        <p>To the extent the disparity exists, what has caused it? The panel said this was also unclear. Errors in measurement and analysis of data could account for some of the difference, the group said, but concluded that some of the apparent disparity was probably real.</p>
        <p>It noted that surface temperatures and temperatures aloft were subject to different influences and were often ''decoupled'' from one another; that is, the surface and the upper air do not necessarily behave alike. For example, the group said, sun-blocking haze from volcanic eruptions is believed to cool the upper air more than the surface. In 1991 there was  an eruption, the biggest of the century from a climatic standpoint.</p>
        <p>Short-term effects like these should probably wash out over the long run, the panel said. Therefore, it cautioned, a 20-year temperature record is ''not necessarily indicative of the long-term behavior of the climate system.'' (That is true not only of the satellite record but also of the unusually sharp spike in surface temperatures over the two decades.)</p>
        <p>In fact, said the study panel's chairman, Dr. John Michael Wallace of the University of Washington in Seattle, weather balloons confirm  the disparity between the surface and the upper air over the last 20 years, but show an upper-air warming comparable to that of the surface over a longer period of the last 40 years.</p>
        <p>''The very likely possibility,'' Dr. Wallace said, ''is that in the next decade we might see a different behavior'' than what has been revealed over the last two decades.</p>
        <p>But for now, the great satellite debate remains at least partly unsettled.</p>
