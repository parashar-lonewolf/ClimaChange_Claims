        <p>The oil-well fires that continue to burn in Kuwait threaten -- if they have not already produced -- an unprecedented environmental catastrophe. The plight of Kurds and Shiites who are fleeing Iraq is more dramatic; but the Kuwaiti fires just keep burning. They may burn for years.</p>
        <p>When it was suggested in this space on April 3 that the U.S. bore a degree of responsibility for the fires and their incalculable consequences, some readers protested strongly. Though Saddam Hussein clearly had threatened to set the fires if the U.S. went to war to liberate Kuwait, these readers insisted that the conflagration was entirely his doing.</p>
        <p>That's true if the Bush Administration is correct, that there was no acceptable alternative to the Persian Gulf war; but many Americans believe there was such an alternative.  There can be no dispute, however, that the oil fires are one of the most dangerous and deplorable consequences of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent allied response.</p>
        <p>These fires pour emissions from nearly a million tons of burning oil into the atmosphere every day, and are being extinguished at an agonizingly slow rate -- only about 50 so far, out of the original 550 blazing wells.  Daily emissions include about 50,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain; over half the rest is carbon dioxide, which adds to global warming.</p>
        <p>A more immediate threat is the 100,000 tons of sooty smoke also rising daily from the burning wells. Already what Matthew Wald, a New York Times correspondent, describes as "a dusk-like gloom" hangs over Kuwait City. But normal summer temperatures of more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit will concentrate the smoke into a thicker, low-lying cap over the desert sands.</p>
        <p>This lid of smoke will magnify the ill effects of the area's frequent temperature inversions. These occur when desert sands cool at night, cooling the surface air, which then is held down by the layer of warm air above.</p>
        <p>The thicker smoke cap from summer heat will sharply reduce the solar rays reaching the earth in Kuwait.  This will cause inversions to last longer, increasing the threats to crops and human health. Kuwaiti hospitals already are jammed, for example, with respiratory patients.</p>
        <p>The disaster of the fires is not Kuwait's alone; winds will carry the harmful emissions perhaps to India and beyond. Even conservative estimates are that environmental damage could be suffered over an area extending 1,000 kilometers from the fires. With carbon dioxide sharply increasing in the atmosphere, a global warming effect is likely; paradoxically, the smoke that makes it more difficult for the sun's rays to reach the earth may also produce a sort of "nuclear winter."</p>
        <p>The worst of it, however, may be consequences that not even scientists can forecast. "We're talking about massive sources of pollution, of a kind that have never been monitored," Dr. Hassan Nasrallah, a climatologist, told Mr. Wald. The world, in fact, has no experience with a conflagration of the magnitude of Kuwait's -- which Joel S. Levine, a NASA expert on biomass burning, has termed "the most intense burning source, probably, in the history of the world."</p>
        <p>Is it outlandish or outrageous, therefore, to discern a parallel in the calamitous oil fires and the explosion of the first atomic bomb by the U.S. on Japan in 1945?</p>
        <p>Then, too, the worst consequences -- immediate on Hiroshima and long-term in the threat of nuclear holocaust -- were not well understood.  They were only dimly perceived by the political and military leaders who decided to drop the bomb.</p>
        <p>But in 1945, too, President Truman and his advisers believed they had no acceptable alternative to use of the weapon on Japan, once it was available. (That's still disputed by some analysts, although a half-century later few agree on what other action might or should have been taken.)</p>
        <p>To draw a parallel between the fiery catastrophes of Hiroshima and Kuwait is not to accuse the U.S. of villainy or indifference, in either instance; nor is it to contend that it should have prevented both. The parallel only suggests that if the consequences of such drastic actions are not reasonably foreseeable, the claim that there's "no alternative" may not be a sound enough reason to proceed.</p>
