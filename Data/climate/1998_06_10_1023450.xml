        <p>HOTEL room rates are expected to rise slightly this year, even though occupancy rates will decline slightly, but travelers should not be lulled into thinking they need not book well in advance. With the economy still chugging along, rooms will continue to be hard to come by in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and other business cities.</p>
        <p>Chicago, for example, just added the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, a 33-story property. All of its 800 rooms are expected to be open next month; more than 500 are already open. Even with that capacity, the hotel already projects that more than 100 nights will be sold out through the end of June 1999.</p>

        <p>HOTEL room rates are expected to rise slightly this year, even though occupancy rates will decline slightly, but travelers should not be lulled into thinking they need not book well in advance. With the economy still chugging along, rooms will continue to be hard to come by in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and other business cities.</p>
        <p>Chicago, for example, just added the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place, a 33-story property. All of its 800 rooms are expected to be open next month; more than 500 are already open. Even with that capacity, the hotel already projects that more than 100 nights will be sold out through the end of June 1999.</p>
        <p>Designed for business travelers, all rooms have desks, ergonomic chairs and power strips with grounded outlets. There are also 53 suites, including 5 for entertaining clients. The hotel has an indoor heated swimming pool with outdoor sun deck and a health club with sauna and cardiovascular and strength training equipment.</p>
        <p>Poor Skiing in 2050?</p>
        <p>A warning for skiers: According to predictions at the recent World Congress on Snow and World Tourism, climate change caused by global warming will cause the snow line to withdraw significantly up the mountains and snow cover can be expected to last for fewer months. But there is no need to panic just yet, since the effects are not expected to be felt for 30 to 50 years.</p>
        <p>Cruise Update</p>
        <p>Remember when cruise passengers wanted to leave their worldly cares behind? They still can, but only if they don't turn on the television in their cabins. More and more ships are offering live news and sports via satellite, as well as an array of reruns for children and adults. Princess Cruises, part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company of Britain, has CNN and ESPN live, and is adding BBC reruns to its television schedule. It will also, of course, continue to show reruns of the ''Love Boat'' series, which was filmed on the original Sun Princess and two other Princess ships, and ran on ABC television from 1977 to 1986.</p>
        <p>As one indication of how the cruise industry has grown, literally, consider that the Sun Princess was 17,000 tons while the Island Princess and Pacific Princess were 20,000 tons. By contrast, the Grand Princess, which made its debut May 26 and is currently sailing European waters, is 109,000 tons. While in nautical terms a ton is not a measure of weight -- more formally known as a gross register ton, it represents 100 cubic feet of internal capacity -- it is worth noting that any of those earlier ships would fit comfortably in the Horizon Court, the 24-hour restaurant aboard the Grand Princess.</p>
        <p>Speaking of huge ships, two days ago Cunard Lines -- recently bought by the Carnival Corporation and a group of Norwegian investors -- said it was going to build ''the grandest and largest liner ever built.'' Details will be announced.</p>
        <p>Airline Update</p>
        <p>In the last 10 days, Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines have begun nonstop service to Japan -- Northwest with two flights a week connecting Tokyo and Las Vegas, Nev., and Delta with daily nonstops between Atlanta and Tokyo. On Oct. 2, Japan Airlines will operate twice-weekly nonstops from Tokyo to Las Vegas. The Northwest and J.A.L. flights are largely a response to growing Japanese tourism to Las Vegas, while the Delta flights reflect the growing Japanese investment in the Southeast, which amounts to almost $14.5 billion, and the region's exports to Japan, which exceed $5.5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Air New Zealand and Ansett Australia have agreed to join the year-old Star Alliance in 1999, bolstering the alliance's access to the Pacific, especially the South Pacific. The current alliance members -- United, Air Canada, Lufthansa of Germany, Scandinavian Airlines System, Thai Airways International and Varig Brazilian Airlines -- already serve some 650 destinations worldwide, and alliance flights average a takeoff every 15 seconds around the clock.</p>
        <p>Alaska Airlines is again offering special summer fares to and from three of the five cities it serves in the Russian Far East. Round-trip fares to Vladivostok or Khabarovsk range from $585 from Anchorage to $635 from Seattle, Reno or the San Francisco Bay area to $735 from Las Vegas, Phoenix and greater Los Angeles. Round trip to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is an additional $250 from each of those American cities. Fares represent savings of 48 percent to 69 percent, and as usual, restrictions apply.</p>
        <p>Best Western International and the Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa are the newest members of the frequent-flier program of America West Airlines.</p>
        <p>Austrian Airlines is offering trans-Atlantic round-trip passengers a one-week car rental from Budget Rent-a-Car in Austria for $163.80 a week, or less than $24 a day, including unlimited mileage and taxes.</p>
