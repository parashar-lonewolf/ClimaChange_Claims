        <p>TECHNOLOGICAL RISK  By H. W. Lewis. 353 pp. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. $22.95.</p>
        <p>MOTHER, grotesquely obese, sits in the front seat munching potato chips. Father alternately sips his beer and puffs on his cigarette, while maintaining two fingers on the steering wheel. And Junior stands between them, playing with the rear-view mirror. All the while they bemoan the poisons in our drinking water, the radiation in the air and the pesticides in our food. I suspect that something like this parody of an American family may have prompted H. W. Lewis to write "Technological Risk," whose main thesis is that the things many people fear most pose hardly any real risk, whereas those things they fear least kill hundreds of thousands annually.</p>
        <p>A physicist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with much experience in risk assessment and management, Mr. Lewis takes the reader on an engagingly iconoclastic tour of the primary sources of risk arising from technology. Along the way he offers scientific insights, criticism of the media and lawyers, knowledgeable accounts of topical news stories from Bhopal to Chernobyl, a disparate collection of facts and ideas and a perspective that may appear smug and reductionist to some readers.</p>
        <p>He sets the stage with a little actuarial data. Of the approximately two million Americans who die each year, 978,000 do so from cardiovascular diseases, 462,000 from malignancies of various sorts, 93,000 from accidents half of which involve motor vehicles, 75,000 from chronic pulmonary diseases, 68,000 from pneumonia, and so on for diabetes (37,000), suicide (30,000), liver disease (27,000), homicide (20,000) and a host of lesser killers. Counting the number of years of life lost (for those who die before reaching age 65) rather than the number of actual deaths, the four biggest killers are, in order, accidents, cancer, heart disease and finally suicide or homicide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis dismisses the romantic notion that these lives are priceless. They may be in moral theory, but we certainly don't (and can't) behave as if they are in practice. According to the author, the value of a human life can be inferred by the actions regulatory agencies take and the safety expenditures that legislatures authorize. These expenditures -- ranging from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million dollars per life saved -- depend to a great degree on public perceptions: is the risk voluntary or not, familiar or unfamiliar, of immediate or distant concern? (This last has relevance for policy on AIDS, the greenhouse effect and ozone depletion.) Yet despite brief patches of statistics and Mr. Lewis's talk of "discounting rates" in assessing the future consequences of present actions, "Technological Risk" is decidedly nontechnical, and is written for the proverbial intelligent layman.</p>
        <p>Excluded from this characterization, it seems, are lawyers, who are the object of a mild disdain throughout the book. Mr. Lewis derides the Delaney clause of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which limits to zero the amount of any additive (such as saccharine) that has shown the slightest evidence of causing animal cancers at any dosage. Other health bills, as well as some court orders, disallow any reference to cost or feasibility in protecting against risks, leading to the squandering of scarce safety resources on trivial risks, and sometimes to agency subterfuge to accommodate impossible legislative and judicial requirements. The increasingly popular "deep pockets" approach to litigation -- in which attorneys go after parties who can afford to pay rather than those actually responsible for a hazard -- clearly has little relevance to truth or culpability although it has enriched lawyers. Mr. Lewis also gripes about lawyers' lack of scientific background, predilection for assigning blame and impatience with scientific uncertainty.</p>
        <p>More to his liking is the work of the California biochemist Bruce Ames, the inventor of the Ames test for carcinogenicity, who argues that we ingest at least 10,000 times as much natural pesticide as man-made. Plants, as they evolved, had to protect themselves against insect pests, and didn't have to seek the approval of the Natural Resources Defense Council (which brought us the great apple panic of 1989) to do it. Dried basil contains estragole, mushrooms contain hydrazines, comfrey tea contains symphytine, peanuts contain aflatoxins, as does the milk of cows that have eaten moldy grain. More generally, Mr. Lewis maintains, "there are far more natural toxic and carcinogenic substances in the world than there are man-made threats, and . . . only an extremely small proportion of cancer is due to toxic wastes and pollution."</p>
        <p>LEAD is one of several exceptions to the general debunking tone of the book. Mr. Lewis agrees that it is a genuine health threat, and accuses environmental groups of being insufficiently passionate about this "humdrum but important" hazard. Reducing the prevalence of lead in gasoline, paint and plumbing solders, he points out, has improved the situation substantially in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis is especially insightful in his examination of the risk subculture: the regulatory agencies, their safety officials and staff, and the informal web of communication that binds them and lends some consistency and rationality to their directives. He bestows particular praise on the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates air crashes and, through this oversight role, has developed a growing body of knowledge that has helped make commercial aviation as safe as it is: at present, a traveler has one chance in one billion passenger miles of being killed in an airline crash, versus one chance in 100 million passenger miles of dying in a car crash. From Three Mile Island to the Challenger disaster, Mr. Lewis attributes most industrial accidents to complacency, poor safety systems overly focused on worst-case scenarios and the lack of oversight agencies such as the N.T.S.B.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Lewis is pro-nuclear power for environmental and cost reasons. Furthermore, since very radioactive materials have short half-lives, meaning that after a few hundred years only the relatively benign stuff is left, he states flatly, "High-level nuclear waste disposal is a non-risk." On a more mundane level, he points to fluorides as another case where the common good is ill-served by technology-bashers exploiting unfounded fears.</p>
        <p>Occasionally repetitive and opinionated, "Technological Risk" reads too consistently like a hardheaded scientist lecturing a misguided bleeding heart. Still, it is a valuable, clearly written appraisal of the risks (and non-risks) we face as a nation and as individuals, and should be widely read, even by lawyers.</p>
