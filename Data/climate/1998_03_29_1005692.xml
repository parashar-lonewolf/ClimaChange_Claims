        <p>Folk Art in Old Lyme</p>
        <p>There is nothing in the world of art quite like early American folk painting. No other school, if it can be called that, is so recognizable, so incisive in its portrait characterizations, so artlessly artful in its simplicity, so reflective of the downright uprighteousness of early American society, and all done by painters who are mostly named ''anonymous.''</p>

        <p>Folk Art in Old Lyme</p>
        <p>There is nothing in the world of art quite like early American folk painting. No other school, if it can be called that, is so recognizable, so incisive in its portrait characterizations, so artlessly artful in its simplicity, so reflective of the downright uprighteousness of early American society, and all done by painters who are mostly named ''anonymous.''</p>
        <p>Thirty-five such paintings by artists from the late 18th through the 19th century, on loan from the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., may be seen at the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme through May 31.</p>
        <p>Most of the artists were self-taught, many were itinerant, wandering from town to town painting whoever would pay, often pre-painting the figure and filling in the head, hands and some item of interior decoration on site. One or two of the most accomplished, like Edward Hicks, are now famous.</p>
        <p>The exhibition contains a selection of requisite compositions -- a dignified portrait of an upper-class matron, a scientist in his study with his dog at his feet, a child with a pull-toy, the cozy little houses that New England became famous for, a circus bareback rider, a blacksmith's shop, and so on.</p>
        <p>Accompanying the antique paintings are works created by self-taught 20th-century artists on loan from a private collection. The museum, open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M., is at 96 Lyme Street. Admission is $4, or $3 for older adults and free for children under 12. The number for more information is (860) 434-5542.</p>
        <p>Getting Outdoors</p>
        <p>The New England Orienteering Club is preparing for another season of getting un-lost in the woods. Orienteering is the art of finding one's way in unknown territory by using a map, a compass and a series of checkpoints.</p>
        <p>Next Sunday the club will offer an event on land surrounding the Metropolitan District Commission Reservoir No. 5, at Farmington Avenue in West Hartford. Beginners are welcome and participants may register and start hiking at any time between 10 A.M. and 1 P.M. Rental compasses and map-reading instructions will be available for beginners and intermediates. A fee of $6 includes the map.</p>
        <p>To get there, take Interstate 84,Exit 39 to Route 4, which is Farmington Avenue. Go east for two miles to the Metropolitan District Commission gate. Enter the reservoir property and follow red and white O-Meet signs to the parking lot. For more information, the number is (860) 745-7457.</p>
        <p>Updating Global Warming</p>
        <p>So you thought the weather this winter and spring was strange?</p>
        <p>If so, you may want to hear a talk on global warming and what the world is doing about it. ''Climate Change After Kyoto: Challenges and Opportunities'' is the title of a free program to be conducted by Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund today at 4 P.M. at the New Canaan Library, 151 Main Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krupp led the fund's delegation to the Kyoto accords, which still must be approved by the legislative bodies of the participating countries. He will describe the emissions trading mechanism by which companies and countries that can make more greenhouse gas reductions than required could earn money by selling them to countries and businesses that have difficulty in making cuts in emissions.</p>
        <p>A lawyer with degrees from Yale and the University of Michigan, Mr. Krupp was a key figure in the passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Since he joined the Environmental Defense Fund in 1984 its budget has increased from $3 million to $25 million and membership has grown from 40,000 to 300,000. For more information, the number of the New Canaan Nature Center, sponsor of the talk, is  (203) 966-9577.</p>
        <p>On the Drums</p>
        <p>The beat of the tom-tom, trap, kettle, or drum-of-choice, is getting louder as all sorts of people are getting into what are called drum circles where they can express themselves, rhythmically speaking.</p>
        <p>Two workshops on Rhythm Games and Rhythmic Improvisations scheduled today at 1 and 3 P.M. in Weston are typical of such instructional get-togethers. Part of a world music series presented by Randy Brody and Kevin Makarewicz, music teachers who founded Drum-n-Dance in Norwalk, the session will take place at Emmanuel Episcopal Church, 285 Lyons Plains Road.</p>
        <p>No musical training is necessary. Tuition for the 1 P.M. games is $20 for one adult and one child, with special rates for larger families. Improvisations, at 3 P.M., are for adults only and cost $25. The number is (203) 855-0811 for more information or to register.</p>
        <p>Remembering the Group</p>
        <p>Phoebe Brand Carnovsky, one of the original members of New York's famed Group Theater, will give a talk tomorrow in Stratford about the heady period in the 30's and 40's when the Group was in its heyday. Its directors, Harold Clurman and Elia Kazan, the playwright Clifford Odets, the actors Luther and Stella Adler, John Garfield, and Ms. Carnovsky's husband Morris Carnovsky, lit up the Broadway stage with firecrackling images of real people as opposed to the drawing room comedies and dramas that had prevailed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carnovsky, an actress, director, lecturer and teacher now in her 90th year, teaches at the Westport Theater Arts Center in Norwalk. Her talk, titled ''A Discussion of the Group Theater,'' begins at 7:30 P.M. in the Stratford Library, 2203 Main Street. Admission is free but reservations are required by calling (203) 385-4162.</p>
        <p>Racing in Westport</p>
        <p>Runners and walkers will be checking in next Sunday from 7 to 8:40 A.M. for the 20th annual Minute Man Race at Compo Beach in Westport. Three events are scheduled: a five-mile race for individuals and teams along the coastline and through Longshore Park; a three-mile noncompetitive walk along the shore, and a one-mile scamper for children and tagalong adults. Ribbons will be bestowed on all finishers under 18, in addition to children's prizes and entertainment. Awards will be made to race winners at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>In celebration of the race's 20th anniversary, a pasta dinner will be held for runners and their families on Saturday evening at the Westport Women's Club on Imperial Avenue.</p>
        <p>Registration for the five-mile-walk and the three-mile walk is $15; the scamper fee is $7. Proceeds are to be distributed among charities by the Westport Young Women's League, founder and sponsor of the event. Since its inception in 1956, the league has donated almost $2 million to community organizations. The number for more information is (203) 222-1388.</p>
