        <p>Strong as a Sleeping Bear</p>
        <p>Imagine you are a top runner, in prime physical condition, and you decide to take six months off. Really off -- curled up somewhere with no physical activity, not even eating or drinking. At the end of those six months, those legs of steel would no doubt have turned to mush.</p>
        <p>Black bears, which are in pretty good shape themselves, take five to seven months off every year to hibernate. So they might be expected to emerge with Jell-O legs as well.</p>
        <p>But a study from the University of Wyoming shows this is not the case. Black bears, it found, lose only about 25 percent of their muscle strength while in their winter den. A human in a similar situation would be expected to lose about 90 percent.</p>
        <p>The researchers let sleeping bears lie, but hooked their hind legs up to an apparatus to measure force in the tibial anterior muscle, the one that bends the foot up. Six bears were tested in the fall and again in the spring.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggest that the bears could be conserving muscle strength by using other body proteins, making new proteins from urea nitrogen, or perhaps simply by shivering -- nature's way of giving muscles an isometric workout. Understanding why bears keep their muscle tone, the researchers say, may someday help humans cope with lengthy confinement, either in a hospital bed or a spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Eels' 'Wild Party'</p>
        <p>As wild parties go, the one among a certain species of eel every year in the Sargasso Sea has been thought to be true debauchery. European eels from different parts of Europe and North Africa migrate to the sea -- a mass of slow-moving warm water in the middle of the North Atlantic -- and randomly mate.</p>
        <p>That was the hypothesis, anyway. But new genetic research by Quebec scientists shows that the gathering is a lot tamer. The researchers, writing in Nature, report that eels there tend to breed with those they came with.</p>
        <p>DNA analysis showed that genetic differences among eels could be correlated with their origin. In fact, the degree of the genetic difference correlated  nicely with distance from the breeding ground -- eels from the Mediterranean had more in common genetically than with those from the North Sea, for instance.</p>
        <p>The best explanation for these findings, the researchers suggest, is that eels from different regions arrive in the Sargasso at different times based on how far they have to travel. So rather than being a free-for-all, the Sargasso is more like a rolling party, with waves of eels arriving ready to breed with one another.</p>
        <p>Forget Sludge Cocktails</p>
        <p>A problem for science is what to do with sludge. At a sewage treatment plant, the sludge that remains is usually dried and disposed of in a landfill.</p>
        <p>One proposed solution is to grind up the dried sewage with coal and burn it in power plants. That would get rid of the sludge and, because burning sludge does not add ''new'' carbon dioxide to the environment, would mean lower net carbon dioxide emissions than burning coal alone.</p>
        <p>But a new study by Dr. Jost Wendt of the University of Arizona and colleagues shows that the idea may have potentially harmful effects. Laboratory mice exposed to particulates from the burning of pulverized coal and sludge suffered lung damage.</p>
        <p>The lungs of the mice became more permeable, and the permeable lungs allowed other toxins to enter the pulmonary system. The effect for mice exposed to coal-sludge particulates was significantly higher than for those exposed to coal particulates alone, a finding that may be explained by the presence of zinc in the sludge, the researchers say.</p>
        <p>The mice were exposed to particulate doses that were comparable to human doses allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The researchers suggest that any plan to burn sewage with coal to help the environment may carry unacceptable risks for human health.</p>
