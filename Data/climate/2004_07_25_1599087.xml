        <p>RICHARD GREELEY has no trouble explaining why he came from a Philadelphia suburb to the middle of the Shelter Island Sound to watch two large silver wheels spin, pushed by the current rushing by his barge.</p>
        <p>As a former professor turned full-time researcher, Dr. Greeley, 76, seems to relish explaining how he came to harness the strong tidal currents racing twice a day around the East End of Long Island. It did not hurt, of course, that the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority gave him $150,000 and the Long Island Power Authority another $65,000 to perform the research, aimed at determining how much energy can be produced by two small turbines powered by tidal currents.</p>
        <p>But the real reason he has brought his wife and stepson to live in a small trailer in a Shelter Island boatyard for the summer is that this is where the idea of powering houses and businesses with tidal electricity came to him. Or rather, where it came to his friend Robert Berks, a sculptor and a longtime resident of Orient.</p>
        <p>In his younger years, Mr. Berks was a sailor who spent many afternoons fighting the current in Plum Gut and thinking about ways to tap its energy.</p>
        <p>So now, almost 30 years and dozens of projects later, Dr. Greeley, who lives in St. Davids, Pa., watched anxiously on Monday as one-and-a-half tons of steel and aluminum, two turbines that have taken years to design, were lowered into the fast green waters south of Shelter Island.</p>
        <p>The homemade unit, a bright red and yellow frame, hung from one end of a small barge attached to four huge anchors. Inside the frame, two cylinders, each about the size of a bathtub, twice the speed of the current, turning the silver wheels and eventually a pair of generators.</p>
        <p>After some last-minute urging with a sledgehammer, the contraption was in place, and the single filament of a large bulb began to glow a pale orange. Running at maximum capacity, the turbines can produce enough electricity to power a small house.</p>
        <p>That is a far cry from the electricity that could come from the large-scale windmill project proposed for the waters south of Montauk Point or that now flows through the Cross Sound Cable, which carries electricity to Long Island from Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Still, Dr. Greeley says big things are possible. ''We can power all of Suffolk County with 35,000 to 50,000 turbines at the bottom of Plum Gut,'' he said, adding that they would pose no threat to surface navigation.</p>
        <p>He uses detailed figures to dismiss skeptical inquiries about how such a mammoth undertaking could be put in place, never mind maintained. According to his estimates, tidal electricity would cost slightly more than conventionally produced electricity: 14 cents per kilowatt hour compared with 12 cents. But this assumes that heavy subsidies would be available to get a tidal electricity program running.</p>
        <p>Experts in alternative sources of energy are already pursuing several pilot projects, using either tides or river currents to generate power. Joseph Sayer of the state's energy research authority said his office was financing not only Dr. Greeley's work but also a separate project in the East River just off Roosevelt Island later this summer.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that unlike winds, which often come and go, tides run twice a day, every day. And tidal electricity is entirely pollution-free, he said: it produces no smoke, no fossil fuels are consumed, and there is no harm to the environment.</p>
        <p>The idea of harnessing flowing water to run machines is, of course, millenniums old. As they did during the energy crisis of the 1970's, both garage inventors and professional engineers are searching for new ways to tap renewable resources, hoping to lessen the nation's -- and Long Island's -- dependence on electricity generated by natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel.</p>
        <p>Tidal power, like many of the ideas being proposed, relies on emerging technologies and also on small-scale production for local use. Mr. Sayer contends that after more than two decades in which policymakers and the public have lost their will to financing alternative energy programs, world events have moved the issue back front and center. He predicts several new technologies, more efficient wind generators and multiple types of fuel cells will be for available commercially within two years.</p>
        <p>Whether some form of tidal power unit will be among them remains to be determined. Over the next two weeks, Dr. Greeley and a staff of volunteers will monitor every conceivable variation in output and performance before he heads back to the lab. Despite their optimism, for a host of practical and logistical reasons, particularly an absence of legislation and an almost-guaranteed fight from rod-and-reel anglers, tidal power may be on the horizon but still appears a long way off.</p>
