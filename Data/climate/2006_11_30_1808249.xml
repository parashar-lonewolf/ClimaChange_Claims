        <p>Sexual oddities and sexual abuse, the ravages of war, the challenges of immigration, human disabilities and the writer's life: all will be recurring themes at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, Jan. 18 to 28.

        <p>Sexual oddities and sexual abuse, the ravages of war, the challenges of immigration, human disabilities and the writer's life: all will be recurring themes at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, Jan. 18 to 28. Organizers say the festival's lineup of 64 American and international films in dramatic and documentary competition, announced here on Wednesday, stretches across a vastly expanded range of subject matter and narrative styles.</p>
        <p>As one indication five dramas made by American directors were shot with characters speaking mainly in Spanish, Hindi, Korean, Portuguese or Muskogee, an American Indian language. As another indication, said Geoffrey Gilmore, the festival's director, this year's 3,287 feature submissions often focused on issues abroad, including at least half a dozen films about Africa.</p>
        <p>''It's a completely different horizon,'' Mr. Gilmore said in an interview. ''It feels as if we're at the cusp of a new era. There's a real change that's gone on from the insularity of a decade ago. It really brings you back to a sense of a new form of American independent film as an engaged cinema. You start to watch films gradually think about not only that sense that the world's about to change, but how to change it.''</p>
        <p>One example: ''Everything's Cool,'' a documentary that no doubt aspires to be a sequel to ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' It introduces a fervent group of messengers warning about global warming, hunting for the right words and images to convert public awareness of climate-change science into the political will to push the nation into alternative energy. (The directors, Judith Helfand and Daniel B. Gold, took ''Blue Vinyl,'' about the dangers of pollution and plastics, to Sundance in 2002.)</p>
        <p>Those eager to discern liberal leanings at Sundance will probably also seize on ''For the Bible Tells Me So,'' Daniel Karslake's documentary exploring the Christian right's ''agenda of stigmatizing the gay community,'' according to a synopsis by Sundance organizers.</p>
        <p>Sundance will again confront the Iraq war: In ''Ghosts of Abu Ghraib'' Rory Kennedy, the producer of ''American Hollow,'' a 1999 Sundance film, draws on the accounts of perpetrators, victims and witnesses of the notorious prison-abuse scandal. In ''No End in Sight'' Charles Ferguson, a former Brookings Institution fellow, interviews government officials about the decisions leading to the present crisis. And in the drama ''Grace Is Gone'' John Cusack portrays a supporter of the war who learns that his soldier wife has been killed in Iraq and takes his daughters on a road trip to break the news.</p>
        <p>Two documentaries explore Asian suffering during World War II: Steven Okazaki's ''White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,'' and ''Nanking,'' about Japanese atrocities in China. ''Nanking'' was produced by Ted Leonsis, better known as AOL's vice chairman, and directed by Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman, a director and producer of the Oscar-winning documentary short ''Twin Towers.''</p>
        <p>But sex could well be the story of this year's Sundance.</p>
        <p>In ''Teeth,'' directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein -- the son of the artist Roy Lichtenstein and an actor who starred in Ang Lee's ''Wedding Banquet'' -- a high school student who is the object of male violence discovers that she has a quite literal case of vagina dentata. Several men learn this the hard way, in what might be called a feminist horror film.</p>
        <p>In the documentary ''Zoo,'' Robinson Devor, best known for the drama ''Police Beat,'' which played at Sundance in 2005, takes a ''humanizing look,'' in the festival staff's words, at the life and bizarre death of a man in Enumclaw, Wash., who died in 2005 after having sex with a horse.</p>
        <p>And in an as-yet-untitled Southern gothic directed by Deborah Kampmeier (''Virgin''), Dakota Fanning plays a precocious girl in 1950's Alabama who sings and dances like Elvis Presley. But the 12-year-old Miss Fanning's role at one point called for her to appear partly naked, and the film includes a scene in which her character is raped.</p>
        <p>Among the dramatic entries that break narrative molds, Mr. Gilmore said, are J J Lask's ''On the Road With Judas,'' about a successful businessman who leads a double life stealing computers from college campuses. It shifts from the businessman to an ''actor'' playing him to the ''author'' of the actor's character, Mr. Gilmore said, in a way that suggests influences ranging from Internet video to the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman.</p>
        <p>Immigration is as popular a Sundance subject as ever, with films looking at Kurds, Moroccans and Romanians in Europe; a Nigerian in Burkina Faso; and a Chinese in Britain. In ''Padre Nuestro'' Christopher Zalla, a first-time director who learned Spanish as a child in Bolivia, weaves a suspenseful tale of stolen identity among Mexicans in New York City.</p>
        <p>Two other New York-based films of note include ''Adrift in Manhattan'' by Alfredo de Villa (''Washington Heights''), with Heather Graham, William Baldwin and Dominic Chianese as a grieving eye doctor, a photographer battling his own demons and an aging artist losing his eyesight; and George Ratliff's ''Joshua,'' with Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga as successful parents torn apart when their 8-year-old prodigy turns bad seed.</p>
        <p>A number of films explore disabilities or disorders. In the documentary ''Hear and Now,'' Irene Taylor Brodsky tells the story of her deaf parents, who after 65 years of silence decide to have cochlear implant surgery; the effects on their lives are not entirely positive. In Matthew Saville's drama ''Noise,'' from Australia, a policeman suffering from tinnitus plunges into the chaos of a mass murder.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Blitz, whose 2002 documentary ''Spellbound'' received an Oscar nomination, delivers a drama inspired by his own childhood problem. In ''Rocket Science,'' a 15-year-old boy with a stutter falls in love with the star of the debate team and joins up to impress her.</p>
        <p>And in ''The Night Buffalo'' (''El Bufalo de la Noche'') -- written by Guillermo Arriaga (''Babel,'' ''21 Grams'') and Jorge Hernandez Aldana, and directed by Mr. Aldana -- a young schizophrenic kills himself after his girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend, but first schemes to drive the two lovers mad.</p>
        <p>A number of films will examine trailblazers of one stripe or another: the documentaries ''Cocalero'' and ''Enemies of Happiness'' (''Vores Lykkes Fjender'') look at an Aymara Indian who campaigned in sneakers and jeans to win the presidency of Bolivia (''Cocalero'') and an Afghan woman who won election to that country's parliament (''Enemies''). ''Crossing the Line'' looks at an American who defected to North Korea in the cold war, and ''The Future Is Unwritten'' chronicles the life of Joe Strummer of the Clash.</p>
        <p>Some Sundance newcomers have familiar names. Zoe Cassavetes, the daughter of John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands, directed ''Broken English,'' about a 30-something woman who finds all her friends are in relationships, then meets a quirky Frenchman. The film stars Ms. Rowlands, Parker Posey, Drea de Matteo and Griffin Dunne. And Julie Gavras, the daughter of Costa-Gavras, directed ''Blame It on Fidel'' (''La Faute à Fidel''), in which a 9-year-old girl watches as her parents become radicalized in 1970s Paris.</p>
        <p>The festival also features several films about writers real and imagined. In ''Starting Out in the Evening'' Andrew Wagner looks at a solitary writer (Frank Langella) and the ambitious graduate student (Lauren Ambrose) who tempts him with a return to the spotlight. And in ''Girl 27'' David Stenn traces the path he took in researching and writing about a notorious Hollywood scandal: the story of Patricia Douglas, who was raped at a wild MGM stag party in 1937, made headlines, and then disappeared.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 5, 2006, Tuesday  An article in The Arts on Thursday about the lineup of the Sundance Film Festival in January referred incorrectly to Dakota Fanning's role in a movie, not yet titled, that will be shown there. Miss Fanning's role never called for her to appear partly naked, according to the director, Deborah Kampmeier.</p>
