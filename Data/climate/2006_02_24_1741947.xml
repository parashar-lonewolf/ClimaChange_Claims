        <p>FOR 137 years Mohonk Mountain House, a resort blending rustic simplicity and Victorian-era formality on the outskirts of New Paltz, N.Y., has stood for timeless pleasures. Still run by the same Quaker family that founded it, Mohonk clings to tradition. Rooms are large and comfortable, but devoid of television sets, radios -- even clocks. Jackets are required for men at dinner. On summer Sundays, there is a nondenominational worship service in the Parlor, while every day at 4 p.m., guests gather for tea and cookies in the Lake Lounge.</p>
        <p>Guests are encouraged to get out and explore the remarkable natural setting, snowshoeing along the Shawangunk Ridge in winter or plunging into the bracing waters of Lake Mohonk in summer. Organized activities and entertainment are often highbrow and always wholesome: from square dancing to classical music.</p>
        <p>But in the last year, the founding family, the Smileys, have gingerly nudged Mohonk into the 20th century, if not quite the 21st. A new three-story wing, nestled among tall pines, opened in August. It contains a sumptuous new spa, offering eucalyptus-scented steam baths and warm-stone massage as well as that pillar of resort life, an indoor pool.</p>
        <p>Even more consequential, from the point of view of traditionalists, is a much smaller project, hidden away in a discreet area below the main dining room: the West Lounge, Mohonk's first bar. Since it opened in June, guests have been able, for the first time, to drink alcohol outside the dinner hour.</p>
        <p>Both additions were carefully debated within the Smiley dynasty and are hardly groundbreaking. But for those who regard Mohonk as a touchstone in an ever-shifting world, they are seismic.</p>
        <p>''Dealing with change is hard,'' acknowledged Nina Smiley, Mohonk's marketing director. ''Guests love Mohonk just the way it is. The sense of place is really important to us. We wanted people to know that whether they were in the new wing or the old, it's absolutely Mohonk.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smiley, a psychologist by training, is the wife of Albert K. Smiley, Mohonk's president and a great-grandnephew of the twin brothers who founded Mohonk in 1869. He took over the family enterprise in 1990 after doing postdoctoral research in economics at Princeton University and then working as an economist for the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>PERENNIAL guests and certainly the Smiley family itself see Mohonk as a mind-set, a mission. When Albert Smiley, one of the co-founders, died early in the last century, he was eulogized as a humanitarian and conservationist first, a hotel owner second.</p>
        <p>Around the turn of the last century, Mohonk was the setting of major conferences on the fate of American Indians and international peace. Private guests were as varied as they were notable, from John D. Rockefeller to Arturo Toscanini to the writer and naturalist John Burroughs. They were drawn by the opportunity to renew the spirit in a corner of the Hudson Valley that felt a world away. And the Smileys kept expanding that world. Through about 100 purchases, Mohonk grew from 280 acres in 1869 to 7,500 acres a century later. In the 1960's, the family set aside more than 5,000 acres as a forever-wild preserve, leaving more than 2,000 acres for the resort.</p>
        <p>The seven-story hotel, with 261 guestrooms and 138 working fireplaces, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. It spreads out with a number of stone and clapboard additions, lending it a castle-like whimsy. Guests today include artists, nature lovers, affluent young families, older couples and the occasional celebrity (Alan Alda was seen there at Thanksgiving).</p>
        <p>Since the early days, Mohonk's owners have documented the annual return of each species of warbler, the date of the mountain laurel bloom and the daily temperature and acidity of Lake Mohonk. Decades ago, Mohonk's record of changes in the lake helped lay the groundwork for studies on the dangers of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Guests have an unusual sense of ownership. Many have donated rough-hewn benches that dot the trails, their small plaques honoring grandparents or extolling vistas. One, given by the preacher Norman Vincent Peale and his wife, Ruth Stafford Peale, says simply, ''Glory to God.''</p>
        <p>When Nina and Bert Smiley arrived 15 years ago, Mohonk was at a low point. The hotel had been turned over to outside management five years before, for the first time in its history. Business was off, and the buildings needed help. The couple dropped the manager, and along with two dozen family members, they have since tried to inject new life, investing in renovations to shed dowdiness, installing air-conditioning and upgrading the food with more imaginative dishes and high-profile chefs. In 2001, they spent $3 million on a new skating rink in a dramatic open-air pavilion with a 39-foot-tall fireplace at one end.</p>
        <p>''The marching orders for the skating pavilion was to make it look like it had been here for 100 years, and the architects got that,'' Mr. Smiley said.</p>
        <p>The newer changes, although subtle, are more revolutionary. The bar is not only understated, but has almost as many nonalcoholic drinks (called mocktails) on its menu as alcoholic ones. There is a sign at the door admonishing exiting guests that alcohol is not allowed ''beyond this point'' -- just in case they might get it into their heads to sneak a glass of merlot up to a fireplace on the main level. Still, some guests have grumbled that the bar is not in keeping with the spirit of Mohonk, which got a liquor license only in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>Lila Touhey, a great-grandmother from Slingerlands, N.Y., who makes an annual pilgrimage to Mohonk with three dozen relatives, has misgivings about the bar. ''I don't think it's necessary,'' she said. ''It's a family place, No. 1. I know young people want that, but there are so many other things to do.''</p>
        <p>But other guests had been clamoring for a place to go for a drink for more than a decade, and the majority of the Smiley family (with a few dissenters) agreed that the time had come to embrace the inevitable. ''We've kept it very low-key,'' Ms. Smiley said. ''Mohonk is about options.''</p>
        <p>An aversion to alcohol is an integral part of Mohonk's early history. When Albert and Alfred Smiley, both temperance advocates, purchased the Stokes Tavern on the current site of Mohonk they banned liquor, dancing and card playing. This was a considerable change, since the wanton nature of the 10-room tavern had been notorious. According to ''Mohonk: Its People and Spirit'' by Larry E. Burgess (Purple Mountain Press), when Stokes Tavern guests became drunk and unruly, the owner chained them to trees.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mohonk's stand on alcohol lightened a bit, even before the hotel started serving it with dinner, a move that was fiercely contested. Mr. Smiley, the present president, remembers what his Uncle Francis used to tell guests years ago when they asked where the bar was. ''He'd say, 'Just knock on any door,' '' he recalled, shaking with laughter.</p>
        <p>The spa wing was less problematic than the lounge, but still debated. It was the first addition to the main hotel building since 1902. It was also expensive, at more than $13 million. ''It's normal to be anxious about a major building project,'' Mr. Smiley said.</p>
        <p>One could argue, too, that Mohonk's founders did not blaze 85 miles of hiking trails, past lily ponds and lichen-dappled rock formations, so that guests could take a three-mile power walk on a treadmill.</p>
        <p>But years ago Mohonk went from being a summer getaway to a year-round establishment, and vacation habits also changed. While a day or two of rain was tolerated by guests who used to come for ''the season,'' it could prove disastrous for guests on the shorter stays that are more common now.</p>
        <p>''The founders of Mohonk were real visionaries, and I'd like to think that if they knew Mohonk would be open year-round they would have had an indoor pool,'' Mr. Smiley said.</p>
        <p>So far, the spa is a hit. With a curved wall of windows facing the distant Catskills, the new wing echoes the lines of the dining room at the hotel's other end. In addition to the pool and fitness center, there are 16 treatment rooms, an outdoor mineral pool and a lounge area with a huge stone fireplace.</p>
        <p>The ecologically friendly design would have made the founders proud. The spa has a geothermal heating and cooling system. A ''green roof'' cultivated with native plants cuts summer cooling costs and reduces rain runoff while providing a habitat for birds and butterflies.</p>
        <p>Business is up, and recent guests gushed about the design, which could be called backwoods-luxe. ''I think it's absolutely incredible,'' said Joan Snyder, a painter whose work was shown in a retrospective at the Jewish Museum last year. ''It's a class act.''</p>
        <p>But even those guests who applaud the changes draw the line at other attributes they hold dear. Marialeonie Vidal of Brooklyn, a human resources associate with the United States Postal Service, has no problem with the bar. But she does not want alcohol trickling to other areas -- especially the Lake Lounge, where guests play Scrabble and read by one of two fireplaces.</p>
        <p>''It would change the climate of the room,'' she said. ''I wouldn't be able to hear the fireplace crackling because people's voices would drown out the fire. Each crackle is significant to me.''</p>
        <p>Be advised, Mr. and Ms. Smiley.</p>
