        <p>Wisconsin Power and Light announced yesterday a second, larger sale of emissions allowances under the Clean Air Act, after the previous disclosure of a sale to the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p>
        <p>The second sale is to the Duquesne Light Company, which has headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Erroll B. Davis Jr., the president and chief executive of Wisconsin Power, which is based in Madison, said yesterday that the sale was for 15,000 to 25,000 allowances, at a price of $250 to $400 per allowance. The T.V.A. deal, which was also formally announced yesterday but had been disclosed earlier, was in the same price range, he said, but for 10,000 allowances.</p>
        <p>Participants in the deals have been vague about the price, although the information is likely to be disclosed eventually in filings with state regulators. These sales, the first two to be publicly disclosed, are likely to set a benchmark for future transactions, but both the buyers and the seller are hoping for price changes favorable to them as the market develops. Established Trading System</p>
        <p>Each allowance represents the legal right to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, a chemical that is the main cause of acid rain. The Clean Air Act of 1990 calls for cutting national emissions of sulfur dioxide roughly in half, but to cut costs, the act established a trading system. Duquesne is paying less for the rights than it would cost to take the sulfur out of its own smokestacks, thus saving money for its rate payers.</p>
        <p>The Wisconsin utility has already been required to clean up its smokestacks because of state environmental laws, and it has tens of thousands of allowances to sell. It is also committed to a continuing reduction in sulfur emissions.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Duquesne said that the purchase "represents a small percentage" of the reductions that the Clean Air Act would require it to make, and was being made to give the company more flexibility. Having extra allowances in a "bank" will provide a reserve, the company said, to deal with "unforeseen operating or fuel supply circumstances."</p>
        <p>Operating circumstances refers to scrubbers, which remove sulfur effectively but sometimes break down. Sulfur levels can also be reduced by burning low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>The company said that buying allowances "will help protect local mining and coal transportation jobs."</p>
        <p>Duquesne has approximately 575,000 customers, in Pittsburgh, Allegheny and Beaver counties. Wisconsin Power and Light, has 345,000 customers, in southern and central Wisconsin.</p>
