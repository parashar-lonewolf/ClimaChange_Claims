        <p>On a clear day during the Southern Hemisphere winter, the towering Andes mountains glisten with a blanket of snow. But from here they are for the most part invisible, hidden behind a thick brown layer of smog that fills this city of more than four million people, making Santiago among the most polluted cities in the world.</p>
        <p>This is the time of year when most Chileans would like to avoid the capital. Eyes sting. Bronchial illness surges. And, according to doctors, the march of cancer in the population increases.</p>
        <p>If smog were the only pollution problem in Chile, it might seem less daunting. But it is only the most visible of numerous woes from the country's southern forests to its northern desert.</p>
        <p>Chile has some of the world's dirtiest factories, belching sulfur dioxide, arsenic and heavy metals into the atmosphere. Many of its rivers are heavily contaminated with industrial and human waste and its natural resources, experts say, are over-exploited.</p>
        <p>As the two-year-old democratic Government of President Patricio Aylwin enters the first stages of addressing the pollution problems, many critics are pointing fingers at the former military Government as the main cause of the problem. The Free-Market Fever</p>
        <p>They say that during the 17-year military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, economic growth, based on the free-market model of the University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman, was pushed at all costs, creating a political atmosphere in which concern for the environment did not exist.</p>
        <p>It is open to debate whether the pollution is the result of Friedman economics or Friedman economics misapplied. What is undeniable is that Chile, which under General Pinochet,emerged as the most robust and stable economy in Latin America, now faces the dilemma of choosing between the daunting cost of cleaning up -- imperiling economic growth in the process -- and the daunting cost of not cleaning up.</p>
        <p>"For years, we could not even talk about the problems of pollution or environment," said Francisco Gonzalez, who is in charge of environment at La Ventana copper smelter just north of Chile's famous beach resort, Vina del Mar. "We could lose our jobs. And if a report was made warning of pollution, it was marked secret and put in a drawer. Produce, produce, produce -- that was the politics of the day."</p>
        <p>The Ventana smelter, which supports the livelihood of small copper-mining operations around the country, is a classic example of the Government's problems. With its antiquated technology, the plant has spewed noxious sulphur dioxide into the surrounding area for years. Not only have its workers been exposed to dangerously high levels of toxic gases and shown a growing rate of illness, but farmers and peasants living miles from the smelter have complained of health problems, lost productivity in the fields and livestock illnesses believed to be linked to the pollution.</p>
        <p>Though the Government installed equipment to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by 30 percent, it will cost $240 million to modernize the smelter and bring it up to current health standards, an investment the plant is not likely to make quickly.</p>
        <p>"We will never clean up this area," said Carlos R. Risopatron, director of a project to monitor the Ventana pollution. "You cannot talk about decontamination. The best we can hope for is not to let the situation get worse."</p>
        <p>Almost 400 hundred miles north along the Huasco River, farmers growing olives found that production fell precipitously, and investigators blame carbon dioxide emissions and particulate from a plant that makes iron pellets upriver.</p>
        <p>Yet another 200 miles north near Chanaral, runoff from a large copper mine has created a vast encrustation of white sediment, including heavy metals, that flows into the ocean, a deposit that few think will ever be cleaned up.</p>
        <p>And at Chile's largest copper smelter, Chuquicamata, researchers have found it belching unusually large amounts of arsenic, causing health problems among hundreds of workers.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is the pollution problem worse than in Santiago. Environmental specialists consider Santiago the most polluted city in Latin America after Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Though for years the city has had intense smog problems, experts here say the the military dictatorship and world preoccupation with the lack of democracy here muffled public debate and concern about pollution.</p>
        <p>Experts give the Aylwin Government passing grades for its actions to date, but add that it is only now casting about for a comprehensive plan.</p>
        <p>Santiago's pollution results mainly from the city's fleet of 11,000 diesel buses, most of which are old and burn fuel inefficiently, and from the fact that the city has more than 400 miles of unpaved roads, where vast amounts of dust are stirred up.</p>
        <p>During the Pinochet years, the bus system was totally deregulated, and the Government permitted the import of thousands of used vehicles. By contrast, Sao Paolo, with close to 20 million inhabitants, four times the size of Santiago, has 7,000 buses.</p>
        <p>The intensity of the pollution here is also a geological and atmospherical problem. Like Mexico City, Santiago lies among mountains and is subject to thermal inversions that do not permit polluted air to escape during the winter months.</p>
        <p>This winter has been one of the worst. In mid-June, pollution alerts were issued for eight straight days.  Water Is Foul, Too</p>
        <p>A far greater concern, according to experts, is the pollution of the city's water supplies -- a problem brought home when cholera broke out here a year ago. The city of Santiago has no water treatment plants, and thus almost all home and industrial waste water is dumped into rivers, which in turn run through much of the country's farm land.</p>
        <p>Two years ago officials discovered that almost all of the country's vegetables were being grown through irrigation with contaminated water.</p>
        <p>To this day there is no regulation of toxic waste. The Government is only now trying to conduct a survey of such waste, which it hopes to complete by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>"We have no idea of where and how much industrial toxic waste is being dumped," said Eduardo Arriagada, president of the Special Commission for Decontaminating the Metropolitan Region. "It could be anywhere. We assume a lot goes into rivers but we just don't know."</p>
