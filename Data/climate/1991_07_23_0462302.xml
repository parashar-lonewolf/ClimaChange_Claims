        <p>THERE is no sign of panic here. In fact, the only health warnings in this wind-blown, 19th century port in southern Chile are how to prevent the spread of cholera.</p>
        <p>But there is reason for low-grade uneasiness. For the last four years, residents have known that from late August through early December, the heavens open upon them, exposing them to increased amounts of ultraviolet radiation. This happens as an ozone hole over Antarctica stretches toward Punta Arenas, and its thinning outer reaches cover this city of 120,000 people.</p>
        <p>Some estimate that the radiation here from the depletion of the ozone layer increases several fold, threatening to multiply cases of skin cancer and to make the city a potentially important laboratory for studying the long-term effects that a thinning of the earth's protective ozone layer would have on humans.</p>
        <p>"Just think what would happen in the United States if radiation over Washington, D.C., increased 10 times," said Bedrich Magas, an instructor in electrical engineering at the University of Magallanes here and the town's radical environmentalist. "But here, the Government has yet to take this seriously. We can't even get a simple instrument to study just how much UV radiation we're getting." Studies on Plankton</p>
        <p>Mr. Magas regularly wears sunglasses whenever he walks outside, uses 30-level sunblock and hardly exposes a bare forearm to the sun at any time of the year. He also says that the town employers should consider letting employees work evenings during high radiation periods.</p>
        <p>Punta Arenas is not the only city close to the Antarctic that falls under the ozone hole during the austral spring, but it is by far the largest.  Scholars like Mr. Magas as well as some medical doctors say that ozone studies should be carried out here.</p>
        <p>So far, most of the study in this region has focused on the effects of intense ultraviolet radiation on marine life, in particular plankton. But the results have been inconclusive. Some studies claim to have found that high radiation levels reduce the plankton population. Scientists argue that if this is the case, the numbers of fish, birds and mammals in and near these rich southern waters could be severely reduced, since plankton is the basis of the marine food chain.</p>
        <p>Despite the uncertainty, researchers are sure of several things, primarily that greater exposure to ultraviolet radiation will substantially increase the rate of skin cancer over the next decade. Scientists predict that in the United States alone 200,000 additional deaths will occur by the year 2050 because of reduced ozone, which filters out large amounts of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. High Rate of Melanoma</p>
        <p>Dr. Jaime Abarca is the only dermatologist for hundreds of miles around in an area of more than 200,000 people.</p>
        <p>He has been trying to study the effects of the ozone hole on the population here and is frustrated that he has been unable to find any organization willing to spend $15,000 for the computer and measuring instrument needed to begin basic research here.</p>
        <p>"The effect of excessive UV radiation is progressive and cumulative," he said. "It's going to advance slowly. But when you see the epidemic, it's too late."</p>
        <p>So far, Dr. Abarca said, the rate of skin cancer he sees, about 15 cases a year, is average and should remain so for a couple more years. But an oddity is that the incidence of the most malignant skin cancer, melanoma, is three times the rate it should be, or about 6 of the 15 cases.</p>
        <p>While basal and squamous skin cancers are associated with continual exposure to high rates of ultraviolet rays, melanoma is associated with short, intermittent peaks of high exposure, similar to what a resident of Punta Arenas might receive from the annual opening of the ozone hole. Still, a cautious Dr. Abarca said he could not yet attribute that to the effects of the ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>"You need time and study, which so far we don't have," he said. "This is the only place in the world where you really have a large enough population base to do such research."</p>
        <p>Some scientists are not overly concerned, arguing that ozone layers closer to the Equator are thinner than those in Punta Arenas. And they say the amount of thinning here to date has not reached the danger point.</p>
        <p>"The average resident in southern Chile is not subject to as much radiation as the beach bunny in Miami," said John Lynch, a geophysicist with the National Science Foundation in Washington.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lynch warned that this could change by next year. The volcanic ash that Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines is spewing into the stratosphere is so great, he said, that once it collects in the southern polar region, it could destroy enough ozone "to create some very serious depletion." Cataracts in Sheep</p>
        <p>But Rodolfo Mansilla, 45 years old, who owns a ranch on Tierra del Fuego, takes Mr. Magas's warnings about ozone depletion far more seriously. He is alarmed by the changes he has seen on his own ranch over the past three years.</p>
        <p>He says 50 of his sheep that grazed in higher pastures last season developed temporary cataracts. His pasture land, which normally produces a second growth period from October to December, was dormant during that time last year and produced the second growth in February.</p>
        <p>And he says that the wild guanacos, cousins of the Andean llama, that normally give birth in November and December, this year gave birth as late as March.</p>
        <p>Then there is the story about hunters near here who found 300 rabbits blinded by cataracts and needed only to pick them up by the ears to pursue their sport.</p>
        <p>"I've been working the camp for 40 years," Mr. Mansilla said. "There is always change, but this is the most disastrous change I have seen in my lifetime."</p>
