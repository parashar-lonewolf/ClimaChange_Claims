        <p>Guangdong and Fujian Provinces evacuated 487,000 people from coastal areas and ordered 67,000 ships and boats into harbors as a strong typhoon brushed past Hong Kong and headed for shore. With winds of 105 miles per hour, the typhoon is the strongest recorded over the South China Sea in May since the Hong Kong Observatory started keeping records in 1947. While scientists have warned that global warming could lengthen the typhoon season in the Pacific and the hurricane season in the Atlantic, the observatory warned against drawing conclusions from a single storm.</p>
