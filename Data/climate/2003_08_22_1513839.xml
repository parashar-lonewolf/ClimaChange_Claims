        <p>There are no white cliffs of Mars, scientists are reporting today, and that absence casts more doubt on the theory that Mars once had a warm, wet, Earth-like climate favorable for life.</p>
        <p>NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, in orbit around Mars, has been measuring the glow of infrared light from the rocks below, looking for patterns of colors that identify different minerals. In particular, scientists have been interested in minerals known as carbonates, which form only in the presence of liquid water. On Earth, the white cliffs of Dover in England are a notable example of carbonates.</p>
        <p>In today's issue of the journal Science, the researchers who run the infrared instrument report that Global Surveyor has detected small concentrations of carbonates in Martian dust, 2 percent to 5 percent by weight, but none of the large deposits that would probably form at the bottom of a lake or an ocean.</p>
        <p>''I would say it's extremely unlikely Mars had large bodies of warm, standing water that were exposed to the atmosphere for a long period of time,'' said Dr. Philip R. Christensen, a professor of geological sciences at Arizona State University and senior author of the article. ''It's reasonably unlikely that massive carbonates exist and we haven't seen them.''</p>
        <p>Many planetary geologists are now moving toward the view that Mars has been cold throughout its 4.5-billion-year history and that the considerable quantities of water known to exist there have been frozen almost all of that time.</p>
        <p>''There is a significant shift that has been going on in the last year or two,'' said Dr. Michael H. Carr of the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. ''I find it easy to believe early Mars was cold and it never got much above freezing. There are a lot of reasons for thinking that.''</p>
        <p>In this view, the early environment on Mars, when it did have a significant atmosphere, may have resembled Antarctica's. But if Mars has always been freezingly cold, that leaves scientists having to explain how a vast network of gullies, dry riverbeds and canyons formed.</p>
        <p>Those apparently water-worn features had led some to speculate that Mars long ago had a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide that trapped enough heat to create balmy conditions. Some even saw geological features that they interpreted as shorelines of an ancient ocean that covered much of Mars's northern hemisphere. Since then, scientists have found that realistic climate models do not generate that much global warming on Mars, and high-resolution photographs by Mars Global Surveyor have failed to convince most people that the features were actually shorelines.</p>
        <p>Instead of long-lived oceans, lakes and rivers, many scientists are now exploring whether the landscape was shaped by temporary wet periods like torrential boiling downpours after a meteor impact or the movement of liquid water underground.</p>
        <p>Dr. Victor R. Baker, chairman of the hydrology and water resources department at the University of Arizona, believes that periodic eruptions of Mars's volcanoes could have altered the climate enough that liquid water could have existed for hundreds to thousands of years, at least in some places.</p>
        <p>The new Global Surveyor data only ''argues against an Earth-like ocean,'' Dr. Baker said. ''Mars clearly had periods of ponded water of great extent on the surface.'' Because of the lack of plate tectonics on Mars, he believes carbonates seeped miles underground, out of view.</p>
