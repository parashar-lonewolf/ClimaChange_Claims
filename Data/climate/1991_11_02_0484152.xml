        <p>Shortly after the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986, FAINA YASHKINA, an elementary-school teacher in the nearby town of Gomel, suggested that her pupils deal with the feelings aroused by the catastrophe by writing a musical play.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, 24 of them, who have been visiting Queens since Oct. 6 under the auspices of the Peace Child Foundation and Public School 99 in Kew Gardens, will put on their play, "Earth Child," at the studio of the City Lights Youth Theater at City Center.</p>
        <p>"We decided that we had to do something so that the children could help improve the situation in the region," said VALENTINA SHCHARONOVA, a ninth-grade teacher from Gomel who accompanied the children, most of whom are 14 years old.</p>
        <p>The play is about Chernobyl, the Persian Gulf, the ozone layer and the Brazilian rain forest.</p>
        <p>Speaking in halting but heartfelt English, IRINA KUDRYASHEVA, one of the visiting students, said: "I think people can join all people together. Everybody can save our planet, but we must live in peace. Children can do a lot toward that. I think that grown-ups must listen to children."</p>
