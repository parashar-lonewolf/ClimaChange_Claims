        <p>CLAIMS AGAINST CHEVRON DROPPED -- The Interior Department has dropped claims that the Chevron Corporation systematically underpaid the government for natural gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico, a decision that could allow energy companies to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties. Shares of Chevron fell yesterday after crude-oil futures declined 3.9 percent to $58.36 a barrel. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>CHARGES OVER DELPHI RESULTS -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges yesterday against nine former executives at Delphi, the automotive parts supplier, accusing them of manipulating the company's finances to project a healthy facade while it descended into bankruptcy. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION PLUMMETS -- The circulation of the nation's daily newspapers plunged over the last year in one of its sharpest declines in recent history, according to data released yesterday. The slide continues a decades-long trend and adds to the woes of a mature industry already beset by layoffs and the potential sale of some of its flagships. [C1.]</p>
        <p>INSURERS SEEK U.S. RELIEF -- Even as profits on home insurance are soaring, some of the nation's big insurers are turning to Washington in a bid to gain protection against future catastrophic losses. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PENTAGON AND WEAPONS SALES -- The Pentagon runs a little-publicized giveaway and tag sale program to clean out its overstuffed attics and closets, which are bulging amid the greatest weapons buildup since the Reagan era. The Pentagon also uses the program to reward government friends and allies across the globe with equipment the Pentagon says it no longer needs. [C1.]</p>
        <p>OIL AND NORTH KOREA -- China cut off oil exports to North Korea in September during heightened tension over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, Chinese trade statistics show. [A12.]</p>
        <p>PERSONAL INCOMES RISE -- Americans' incomes rose last month at the quickest pace since June, but consumers did not respond by rushing out to splurge even as gasoline prices fell from their summer peak. [C5.]</p>
        <p>HOUSING SITE UNDER FIRE -- Zillow, the Web site that provides free home valuations, has been accused by a coalition of community activist groups of undervaluing the homes in black and Latino neighborhoods. [C7.]</p>
        <p>KFC TO REMOVE TRANS FAT -- Kentucky Fried Chicken said that it would remove trans fat, the artery clogging substance, from its fryers. [C3.]</p>
        <p>REPORT ON REFINERY EXPLOSION -- The oil company BP had ''significant knowledge'' years ago of the problems that caused the explosion at its Texas City refinery in March 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 180, a federal safety panel said. [C3.]</p>
        <p>HEDGE FUND TO CLOSE -- Archeus Capital, a highflying hedge fund that just a year ago had assets of $3 billion, informed its investors that it would close. [C3.]</p>
        <p>MERCK MAKES ACQUISITION -- Merck will pay $1.1 billion to acquire Sirna Therapeutics, one of the leading companies that is pursuing a gene technology known as RNA interference. [C3.]</p>
        <p>NEW TURN IN SHELTER CASE -- Federal prosecutors overseeing a huge tax-shelter case against former employees of the accounting firm KPMG are seeking to introduce evidence that some of the defendants received secret payments from three little-known investment boutiques. [C3.]</p>
        <p>VERIZON EARNINGS RISE 2.8% -- Verizon Communications said its earnings grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, driven largely by its mobile phone company, Verizon Wireless. But its shares fell as it reported a drop in local phone lines. [C5.]</p>
        <p>SHAPING AN INTERNET COMPANY -- The early efforts of Michael Jackson, programming president at IAC/InterActiveCorp, left, are now coming into view: He is thinking big by going small, investing in and starting targeted Internet sites built around humor, news and popular culture. [C1.]</p>
        <p>WARNING ON CLIMATE CHANGE -- Britain warned that failure to act swiftly on global warming would have a cataclysmic effect on the global economy. [A8.]</p>
        <p>NEW OUTLETS FOR NIKE -- Nike is expanding into nontraditional media as it introduces the next version of sneakers endorsed by the basketball star LeBron James. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C8.]</p>
        <p>BOTTLENECKS AT AIRPORTS -- The United States has relaxed its airplane liquids ban, but wine purchased outside the airport still cannot be carried on a plane. As a result, wine dealers, teachers and consultants have been forced to rethink how to get bottles to tastings and client meetings. [C6.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>RETIREMENT REPORT -- Bobbie Battista, an ex-CNN anchor, took a corporate buyout package. Now she and others are proving that a career switch in midlife is highly achievable. A special report is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>ADVERTISING SPOTLIGHT -- Stuart Elliott, a columnist, reports on advertising trends in a podcast at nytimes.com/podcasts.</p>
        <p>Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>THE ASSETS of F. David Radler, the former publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times, were recently frozen by a Canadian court at the request of Hollinger Inc., Conrad M. Black's former holding company. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
