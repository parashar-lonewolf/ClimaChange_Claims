        <p>New findings by scientists from Columbia University challenge a widespread theory that algae in the Antarctic Ocean played a major role in reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the last ice age.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1980's, scientists analyzing bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice during the last ice age discovered that the ice age was dustier and contained less atmospheric carbon dioxide than the earth had before the Industrial Revolution.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Martin, of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory in California, theorized that iron in the dust promoted the growth of large Antarctic algae blooms that absorbed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Dr. Martin has also suggested that one remedy for a predicted warming of the earth, which computer models project as a result of a buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, would be to seed the oceans with iron nutrients.</p>
        <p>To test Dr. Martin's theory, scientists at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory rammed a hollow 100-foot long pipe into sediment in the South Atlantic Ocean. They examined the sediment from 11 cores for the hard glass shells of microscopic algae called diatoms. The shells of diatoms provide a record of their productivity. Diatoms are the most common type of algae in the Antarctic today.</p>
        <p>Their findings suggest that the large blooms never occurred and that the diatoms were much less productive during ice ages. They reported their findings in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>"This doesn't absolutely refute Martin's theory," said Dr. Philip N. Froelich, a senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty. "We've only raised more questions."</p>
        <p>It is possible that blooms other than those in the Antarctic caused the carbon dioxide reduction, Dr. Froelich said. He added that the corrosive Antarctic waters dissolve the calcium carbonate shells of other types of algae. Those shells might have lent support to Dr. Martin's theory, he said.</p>
