        <p>LEAD: After a decade-long stalemate over clean-air legislation, the Senate passed a compromise bill tonight intended to reduce acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air. The vote was 89 to 11.</p>
        <p>After a decade-long stalemate over clean-air legislation, the Senate passed a compromise bill tonight intended to reduce acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air. The vote was 89 to 11.</p>
        <p>The bill, crafted in nearly a month of closed negotiations between White House aides and Senate leaders, met President Bush's demand for a less costly solution to the nation's clean air problems than the initial Senate plan.</p>
        <p>It came after the Senate narrowly beat back a number of challenges in recent days that would have toughened the measure and raised the cost of pollution control.</p>
        <p>The measure, the first attempt to toughen air pollution legislation since the 1970 Clean Air Act was amended in 1977, would require auto makers, chemical manufacturers and coal-fired power plants to make substantial investments in equipment and processes to lower pollution. The bill is likely to add more than $20 billion a year to the estimated $33 billion cost of meeting current pollution laws, according to Administration estimates.</p>
        <p>Senate Gave Way to Bush</p>
        <p>In arriving at the compromise, the Senate leadership acquiesced to Mr. Bush on several points. These included less stringent requirements for reducing tailpipe emissions and for controlling toxic chemicals in the air.</p>
        <p>The full House of Representatives has yet to take up a clean air bill. The one being drafted in committee would impose stricter controls than the Senate measure in some areas.</p>
        <p>Both industry and environmentalists remain dissatisfied with crucial elements of the Senate compromise.</p>
        <p>Industry contends that the costs are still too high and will result in lost business and jobs. Electric utilities say that scientists have not confirmed acid rain as the cause of serious damage and that rates charged to customers will soar as a result of the new requirements. Chemical companies have said huge costs will be borne to achieve relatively small advances in protecting public health. And car makers insist that the law will require technology that has not yet been developed.</p>
        <p>But by lowering the cost of the new clean air requirements, the compromise bill met some of the demands of industry, which had contended that the original Senate bill would have imposed excessive costs on their operations. The Bush Administration estimated that the initial Senate bill would have cost $42 billion, but Democratic and some Republican lawmakers said the estimate was too high.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists Not Satisfied</p>
        <p>Environmentalists complain that the changes in the law will be inadequate to protect public health and the environment. But the compromise retained many of the elements sought by them, including substantial reductions in the pollution that leads to acid rain.</p>
        <p>In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee is currently writing a somewhat different bill to amend the current law.</p>
        <p>Like the Senate bill, the House measure would also address acid rain, smog and toxic air pollution. But the legislation emerging from the House committee would be more stringent than the Senate version in several ways.</p>
        <p>For example, the House would require the Environmental Protection Agency to impose a plan for achieving air quality standards in areas where state governments are unable or unwilling to do so. This provision was part of the initial Senate proposal that was eliminated in the compromise between the Senate and the White House.</p>
        <p>The House committee may complete its work on the bill this week. House leaders say action on the floor could take place later this month or early next month. Once the House endorses its own clean air measure, the differences with the Senate will be worked out by House and Senate conferees.</p>
        <p>Mitchell Praises Measure</p>
        <p>The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, a leading Congressional advocate of a more stringent clean air measure for over a decade, said the bill passed today would be ''a dramatic expansion of current law.''</p>
        <p>''This is a very strong bill,'' Senator Mitchell said.</p>
        <p>Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a former Democratic leader, said that he voted against the bill because it did not include provisions for coal miners who would lose their jobs because of the measure's acid rain provisions. ''I cannot vote for legislation that can bring economic ruin to communities throughout the Appalachian region and the Midwest,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The debate in the Senate divided regions of the country that would be affected in different ways by changes in the law. Areas that would bear most of the burden of cleaning up acid rain, particularly in the Midwest and Appalachia, contended they were being unfairly asked to bear all the cost of solving a national problem. Areas with concentrations of chemical plants complained that the costs imposed by the new provisions would require some of those plants to close.</p>
        <p>While President Bush's commitment to a stronger clean air law opened a path out of the long legislative deadlock, his opposition to the original Senate bill as too expensive had threatened to undermine Congressional efforts. But White House aides and Senate leaders, headed by Mr. Mitchell, crafted a compromise agreement after nearly a month of intense negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Senate bill, like the legislation being drafted in the House, addresses the three unsolved problems that continue to afflict much of the nation: acid rain, smog, and toxic chemicals in the air.</p>
        <p>Acid Rain. The Senate bill would require 111 coal-fired power plants, most of them in the Midwest, to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by a total of 10 million tons in two stages. Sulfur dioxide is the principal component of acid rain. The requirement would cut current sulfur emissions by about 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Smog. More than 100 major cities are still not in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act of 1970 for reducing the pollution that causes urban smog. The original 1975 deadline for compliance has been extended twice by Congress.</p>
        <p>This legislation would again provide for an extension depending on the seriousness of the problem in the individual cities. Los Angeles, with the most extreme problem, would get an additional 20 years. New York, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Milwaukee, San Diego and Hartford would have 15 years to comply. Other areas would have 5 or 10 years.</p>
        <p>Cars in the most polluted cities would be required to burn reformulated gasoline that emits less pollution for each gallon used.</p>
        <p>In a change from the current law, cities would be required to make annual reductions in smog levels - 4 percent a year for the first six years and then 3 percent a year until they are compliance. But the compromise agreement with the White House would waive the 3 percent a year reduction indefinitely if the cost of achieving the levels was excessive.</p>
        <p>Airborne Chemicals. While the original bill required the Environmental Protection Agency to control toxic chemicals in the air so as not to pose a threat to public health, only seven such chemicals have been regulated in the last 20 years. The Senate bill would require all major sources of pollution of some 200 chemicals to install the ''maximum available control technology'' to reduce such pollution. If there is still a large health risk after the controls are installed, additional measures might be required.</p>
        <p>Among the other provisions of the Senate bill is a requirement that all use of chlorofluorcarbons, chemicals that scientists say are causing the destruction of ozone in the upper atmosphere be phased out by 2000. Atmospheric ozone protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. 11 Senators Voted No These are the Senators who voted against the legislation tonight:</p>
        <p>Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia</p>
        <p>Alan J. Dixon, Democrat of Illinois</p>
        <p>Jake Garn, Republican of Utah</p>
        <p>John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio</p>
        <p>Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina</p>
        <p>James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho</p>
        <p>Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma</p>
        <p>John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia</p>
        <p>Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois</p>
        <p>Steve Symms, Republican of Idaho</p>
        <p>Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming Fuel Efficiency Backed In a related development today, the Senate Commerce Committee approved by a 14 to 4 vote, a requirement to require all automobiles achieve a fuel efficiency of at least 40 miles a gallon by the end of the century as a means of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels is accumulating in the atmosphere and, many scientists say, will cause a substantial warming of the earth in the next century by absorbing radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>The fuel effiency provision had been removed from the Senate clean air bill in negotiations with the White House. Daniel Becker, a Washington representative of the Sierra Club, said before tonight's Senate vote that the provision was the most important immediate step that Congress could take to address global warming.</p>
        <p>David Hawkins, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Fund who was an assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Carter Administration, said before the vote that environmentalists were not asking Senators to vote for or against the clean air legislation. He complained that ''skilled vested interests'' had weakened the bill to the point where it would not meet the nation's air quality needs in the future. The best hope of adequate legislation would come on the floor of the House, Mr. Hawkins said.</p>
