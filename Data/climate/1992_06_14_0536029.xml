        <p>The Earth Summit, history's largest gathering of world leaders, is winding up after a fractious 12 days of diplomatic free-for-all among 178 nations. A few clear lessons may already be emerging from the fracas.</p>
        <p>One is the new-found prominence of the environment as an international issue, bidding to rank with economics and national security.</p>
        <p>After Rio, "You can't be treated as a world leader on any issue without being a player on the environment," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and advocacy organization.</p>
        <p>Many diplomats here remarked on the paradox that the Bush Administration, immobilized in placating the American right wing during an election year, is abdicating leadership of the worldwide environmental movement just as the issue is moving to center stage. 'Landmark in a Process'</p>
        <p>A second lesson is that blandness can sometimes prove a surprisingly effective bludgeon. The parcel of treaties signed here have been portrayed by disappointed advocates as pitiful gutless creatures with no bite. But they have hidden teeth that will develop in the right circumstances.</p>
        <p>That is why seasoned diplomats like Richard E. Benedick, the former State Department official who helped negotiate the ozone-layer treaty, said on the very first day, "The history books will refer back to this day as a landmark in a process that will save the planet from deterioration."</p>
        <p>The Earth Summit, he said, "should not be judged by the immediate results, but by the process it sets in motion."</p>
        <p>It might be years, he said, before the results are apparent.</p>
        <p>A case in point is the climate treaty which, at Washington's insistence, has no targets or timetables for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Yet it commits ratifying countries to control emissions so as to protect natural ecosystems.  Imperfect Treaties</p>
        <p>The treaty also has built-in flexibility allowing for stronger measures if the threat of global warming appears more serious than at present. The recent complete phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons was set off by just such a provision in the Montreal protocol governing protection of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>"This is a launching pad, not a quick fix," said Maurice Strong, the executive secretary of the conference.</p>
        <p>Everything depends on how well the principles enunciated and the bargains struck in Rio between rich and poor countries are put into force.</p>
        <p>The climate treaty, already signed by most of the 178 nations attending the conference, is now widely seen as a promising start to the arduous task of curbing the heat-trapping gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, that threaten to disrupt the earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Most countries, the United States being the chief exception, also signed a treaty aimed at better conserving the world's dwindling inventory of living species. The two treaties are far from perfect, but between them they set in motion a long-term process for dealing with the two most pressing environmental concerns. Guide for Issues</p>
        <p>By the end of the conference, despite early pessimism, an agreement emerged on basic principles for managing and conserving the world's forests. Of all the issues that divided north and south, haves and have-not countries, that was among the most contentious.</p>
        <p>The new accord enables the United Nations to start negotiations on an international forest treaty, a result fervently sought by the United States but flatly resisted by certain third-world countries jealous to preserve sovereignty over their forests. Environmentalists attacked the pact as hopelessly weak, even a step backward, but it appears to have put forest management firmly on the international agenda for the first time.</p>
        <p>Another important product of the Rio deliberations is a general statement of principles for sustainable development, along with a voluminous compendium of rather general recommendations, called Agenda 21, for nations to follow as a guide on virtually every known environmental issue. Probably no one has yet read or digested it all.</p>
        <p>On the debit side, the agreements all tend to run toward the lowest common denominator, perhaps an inevitable result when an entire planet's welter of interests clash on matters involving economics. Attention to Population</p>
        <p>Population, while it is addressed in Agenda 21, clearly received less attention than deserved even though, along with rich countries' wasteful consumption patterns, it lies at the root of the global environmental problem. A major world conference on population is scheduled for 1994.</p>
        <p>Still unsettled was the crucial question of mechanisms and commitments for transferring money from rich countries to poor ones to promote economic development compatible with protecting the environment. The delegates had also not agreed on the establishment of institutions to carry out the summit meeting's recommendations.</p>
        <p>On the scorecard of north versus south, the developing countries clearly succeeded in their goal of making economic development as important as environmental protection. While almost everyone agrees that economics and environment must go hand in hand, some environmentalists were disturbed that the Rio Declaration, the summit talks' over-all statement of principles, says explicitly that "human beings are at the center of concerns" for sustainable development.</p>
        <p>Putting humans at the center of things, with the implied right to dominate and exploit the rest of nature, is what has caused the problem in the first place, environmentalists contend.  Role of U.S. Election</p>
        <p>Many delegates say that the conference would have been more productive had the United States adopted a leadership stance instead of a "defensive crouch," in the words of Jessica Mathews, a vice president of the World Resources Institute.</p>
        <p>Had it done so, said Russell E. Train, chairman of the World Wildlife Fund in the United States, its specific objections on particular issues might have been taken more seriously. The United States stance is widely attributed to President Bush's need, in a three-way Presidential race, to shore up the Republicans' core conservative constituency.</p>
        <p>Tommy Koh of Singapore, the take-charge gavel wielder who was chairman of the conference's main working session, was heard to remark that "This will teach the United Nations not to hold a conference in an American election year."</p>
        <p>Delegates from many other countries readily agreed with Mr. Bush's assertion in his speech here yesterday that the United States domestic record on the environment is exemplary. But American allies expressed regret that he had brought so few international initiatives with him.</p>
        <p>The Americans challenged the allies to join in a doubling of international aid for protection of forests, sweetening the proposal with an initial down payment of $150 million a year. Europeans reacted with interest, but reserved judgment pending a further review of the proposal and their budgetary situations.</p>
        <p>"We've always been very happy to follow the American lead when we felt it was going in the right direction said Margaret Brusasco-Mackenzie, head of the European Commission's Division of the Environment. But the response she would now give to the President, she said, is that: "You've stopped somewhere down the road. We would like you to look outside instead of inside at the elections."</p>
        <p>Once what a country did in its own backyard was its own concern. After the Rio conference, the world is more likely to be watching.</p>
