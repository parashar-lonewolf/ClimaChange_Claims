        <p>Australia looks ready to become the first country to phase out incandescent light bulbs in favor of more energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs, as part of its drive to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The Australian environment minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said Tuesday that he would work with the states to get rid of incandescent bulbs by 2009 or 2010.</p>
        <p>''The most effective and immediate way we can reduce greenhouse-gas emissions is by using energy more efficiently,'' Mr. Turnbull said. ''Electric lighting is a vital part of our lives; globally, it generates emissions equal to 70 percent of those from all the world's passenger vehicles.''</p>
        <p>He pointed to International Energy Agency data showing that a worldwide switch to compact fluorescent lights could result in energy savings equivalent to five years of Australia's present electricity use by 2030.</p>
        <p>Australia already has minimum energy performance standards that apply to appliances, and a similar system will be put into effect for light bulbs. The standards would ultimately make it impossible to sell incandescent bulbs. Mr. Turnbull said the government would consider some exceptions, like medical lighting and low-power oven lights.</p>
        <p>Australia has used similar means to phase out high-volume toilet tanks and high-pressure shower heads.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Turnbull, Sarah Stock, said the first step would be to work with manufacturers, importers, wholesalers and retailers to encourage them to phase out incandescent bulbs and ensure that enough fluorescent bulbs were available.</p>
        <p>''Once the main players have removed those inefficient products,'' she said, ''that investment in better quality and more efficient products will be protected by regulation.''</p>
        <p>Australia would be the first country to carry out such a plan, although legislators in California proposed a similar measure last month.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, recently announced a drive to sell 100 million compact fluorescent bulbs a year by 2008, compared with 40 million in 2005. Philips has announced plans to stop making incandescent bulbs by 2016.</p>
        <p>The Australian initiative appears to face little political opposition. Environmental groups are pleased, particularly as the conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard was, until recently, unwilling to accept climate change as a reality.</p>
        <p>Australia will hold a general election this year, and opinion polls show that the environment is high on the list of voter concerns.</p>
        <p>The government's move on light bulbs is the latest push in an effort to seize the ecological initiative from the opposition Labor Party. Mr. Howard says that by 2015, when the plan is to be fully in place, Australia's greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by as much as four million tons a year, or 0.7 percent of its greenhouse gas output in 2004.</p>
        <p>Incandescent bulbs illuminate by passing electricity through a wire filament, but some 90 percent of the energy is converted to heat rather than light. Fluorescent bulbs work by passing an electrical current through a gas, typically argon, which emits ultraviolet light. This, in turn, causes a thin coating of phosphorous on the inside of the tube to glow.</p>
        <p>Fluorescent bulbs are not entirely benign. They contain some mercury -- perhaps a fifth of the amount used in a watch battery -- and in Europe the cost of each lamp includes a premium to allow for its safe disposal.</p>
        <p>The bulbs are also about four times as expensive as equivalent incandescent bulbs, but they use 20 percent or less of the energy to produce the same amount of light and last 5 to 10 times as long.</p>
        <p>Although the cost efficiency of compact fluorescent lights has made them popular with corporate customers, they have not been such a big hit with Australian consumers, some of whom say that the light is unflattering and that the bulbs do not fit many home lampshades.</p>
        <p>Jin Chew, who manages a hardware store in Sydney, said that incandescent bulbs outsold fluorescent ones in his shop by 5 to 1.</p>
        <p>But he said that the makers of fluorescent bulbs had improved the color of the light, making it less blue and less harsh.</p>
