        <p>ABC News executives are rethinking a decision to show an interview of President Clinton conducted by the screen star Leonardo DiCaprio amid internal debate over whether it is appropriate in the first place for the news division to use an interview conducted by a celebrity.</p>
        <p>The White House, a representative for Mr. DiCaprio and executives at ABC News each offered differing versions of events that led up to Mr. DiCaprio's interview of the president on Friday on the patio abutting the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Segments from the 20-minute interview were to be shown during an  ABC News special, ''Planet Earth 2000,'' on global warming, which is scheduled for broadcast later this month in connection with the 30th anniversary of Earth Day on April 22.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCaprio is chairman of the Earth Day 2000 celebration committee.</p>
        <p>No one involved with the interview disputed that plans had been discussed for weeks concerning some sort of videotaped talk about the environment between Mr. DiCaprio and President Clinton at the White House.</p>
        <p>The ABC News president, David Westin, said in an e-mail to his staff members, many of whom were irate about the interview, that on Friday he had been told that ''Mr. DiCaprio was visiting the White House (at the request of the White House).'' He said that it was his understanding that Mr. DiCaprio would ''be doing a walk-through taking a look at some of the things the White House has done internally with an environmental slant (things like recycling its trash and insulating)'' and that the president might appear during that walk-through.</p>
        <p>But, he said, when the crew and Mr. DiCaprio arrived at the White House on Friday, they were told that the president wanted to be interviewed by Mr. DiCaprio.</p>
        <p>''We did not send him to interview the president,'' Mr. Westin wrote. ''No one is that stupid.'' Considering that a formal interview did take place, he wrote, the interview might not be broadcast.</p>
        <p>After reviewing a copy of that e-mail yesterday, a White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said it was ''rife with inaccuracies'' and maintained it was ABC that requested the interview.</p>
        <p>''Because of the time and the schedule, we made it clear that we would actually do a sit-down interview instead, and that was perfectly clear, and they came prepared to ask questions,'' Mr. Siewert said.</p>
        <p>Ken Sunshine, a spokesman for Mr. DiCaprio, said the actor was fully prepared for an interview and whether it happened as a walk-through or a sit-down interview, he was anticipating the same discussion.</p>
        <p>''He was well prepared to engage in a serious discussion with the president about the issue of global warming,'' Mr. Sunshine said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sunshine said that Mr. DiCaprio approached ABC News executives about a special on the environment earlier in the winter and that the host of the special, Chris Cuomo, a ''20/20'' correspondent and son of the former New York governor, acted as a contact between Mr. DiCaprio and the news division.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCaprio's representatives originally pitched the idea for an Earth Day special to NBC Entertainment a year and a half ago, executives at NBC said.</p>
        <p>ABC News executives said that they agreed to work with Mr. DiCaprio because he is a popular face for the younger generation of viewers that every network news division has had a difficult time reaching, and that they were already discussing some sort of Earth Day special.</p>
        <p>An ABC News spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said Mr. Westin decided to consider whether or not to use the interview when he found out that it was, in fact, a sit-down interview. Concerning the differing versions of the story, Ms. Murphy said, ''I think we're just going to have to disagree on it.''</p>
        <p>But she said everybody in the Washington bureau ''was outraged'' about the interview, adding that they have calmed down now.</p>
        <p>One offended ABC News producer summed up his feelings this way: ''There is a line that has been crossed often in the past couple of years between entertainment and news. The line has been pushed and pushed, and I think this pushes it way too far beyond where it's been before.''</p>
