        <p>LEAD: A study prepared for the oil industry and released yesterday has cast doubt on a much-discussed method of fighting air pollution, concluding that requiring grain alcohol in gasoline will produce a minor reduction in carbon monoxide, but a large increase in smog. An amendment to the Clean Air Act approved by the Senate would mandate such a change.</p>
        <p>A study prepared for the oil industry and released yesterday has cast doubt on a much-discussed method of fighting air pollution, concluding that requiring grain alcohol in gasoline will produce a minor reduction in carbon monoxide, but a large increase in smog. An amendment to the Clean Air Act approved by the Senate would mandate such a change.</p>
        <p>The study was prepared by a California consulting firm that has done extensive work for the governments of eight Northeastern states and California. It concludes that ''gasohol,'' or gasoline with 10 percent grain alcohol, would cut carbon monoxide by 25 percent, but that nitrogen oxides, which cause smog and acid rain, would rise by 8 to 15 percent, and hydrocarbons would rise by 50 percent. That works out to 6 percent more smog.</p>
        <p>The grain-alcohol lobby immediately attacked the study. Government reaction to ethanol has been mixed. The Environmental Protection Agency says that other provisions of the Senate plan will help reduce pollution, but the two regional agencies that have led policy-making in cleaning up gasoline, the California Air Resources Board and the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, both say they are not sure if alcohol will help.</p>
        <p>All agree that alcohol would reduce carbon monoxide, which is primarily of concern as a direct poison. In addition, like hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide reacts in sunlight to form smog, or, more formally, ground-level ozone.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, a group representing alcohol producers, disputed the study because, he said, it used as a basis for tests a specially equipped car and a pure form of gasoline that is not commercially available. The spokesman, Eric Vaughn, said that use of that fuel and car could skew the results.</p>
        <p>Technical analysts are equivocal when it comes to the benefits of ethanol. ''The jury is still out,'' said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California board. ''We do know that there seems to be a reduction in carbon monoxide, but there seems to be some slight increase in nitrogen oxide. We have not determined as of yet which is the greater. We still are not certain whether there's a benefit or not.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, ethanol, which is made from corn, has strong backing from farm-state senators, including Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader.</p>
        <p>At the E.P.A., Richard D. Wilson, director of the Office of Mobile Sources, said the Senate proposal would improve air quality because it also calls for a 15 percent reduction in ozone, with no increase in nitrogen oxides. One way it would achieve this, Mr. Wilson said, is by cutting another component of gasoline called aromatics, heavy molecules that sometimes fail to burn completely. Another official at the California board, Thomas A. Cackette, said that ''if alcohol is used the way it is used today, the only conclusion you can have is that it hurts air quality.'' But he agreed with Mr. Wilson that the Senate plan would require other changes that would help air quality.</p>
        <p>'Paying More for Dirtier Air'</p>
        <p>One of the two authors of the study, Thomas C. Austin, former head of the California board, said in an interview that under the Senate plan ''motorists will end up paying more for dirtier air.''</p>
        <p>Gasoline with alcohol additives is already in common use in some parts of the country, as gasohol or ''oxygenated'' fuel. The ethanol portion of the fuel is about twice as expensive as the same amount of gasoline and delivers one-third less mileage per gallon. To stimulate sales, ethanol has been exempted from taxes, at a cost to the Federal Treasury since 1980 of $3.1 billion, and to state treasuries of $1.6 billion over the same period.</p>
        <p>Three-quarters of the ethanol is produced by a single company, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company of Decatur, Ill., an agricultural processor. The company referred all inquiries to the Renewable Fuels Association.</p>
        <p>The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's main trade association, said it did not fear competition from such fuels, because the corn from which the alcohol is made requires more oil and natural gas to produce than it displaces. For example, raising corn requires natural gas for the production of nitrogen fertilizer and diesel oil to run tractors.</p>
        <p>Higher Costs and Lower Sales</p>
        <p>However, requiring oxygenated fuels would raise costs and could depress sales, according to the oil industry, all for a net environmental loss. Refiners also fear that they would have to invest new capital to supply oxygenated fuels.</p>
        <p>Ethanol consumption last year, 840 million gallons, was a tiny fraction of gasoline consumption, which was more than 100 billion gallons.</p>
        <p>In early April the Senate approved an amendment by Thomas Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, that would require the use of fuel with a high oxygen content in nine cities with air problems. Those cities account for one-fourth of the gasoline market. Other cities could choose the same fuel in preference to other steps to control air pollution. The first nine are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, San Diego, Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Baltimore and the Hartford-New Haven area.</p>
        <p>Refiners say the amendment, combined with tax exemptions, heavily favors ethanol. Mr. Vaughn said the requirement might also be met by selling ethanol to refineries, which would turn it into an additive, ETBE, or with other oxygenated fuels, including MTBE and methanol.</p>
        <p>Parallel Amendment in House</p>
        <p>When the House takes up the Clean Air Act, it will consider a parallel amendment offered by Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, that covers 27 cities.</p>
        <p>Car engines produce carbon monoxide, which has one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, when they burn gasoline without enough oxygen present to make carbon dioxide, a molecule with two oxygen atoms. Putting alcohol in gasoline helps prevent the creation of carbon monoxide because the alcohol molecule incorporates an oxygen atom, along with two carbon atoms and six hydrogen atoms.</p>
        <p>Engineers say that if the fuel is 10 percent grain alcohol, the engine can burn it thoroughly with 4.1 percent less air than is required for a straight gasoline burn.</p>
        <p>But putting more oxygen into the cylinder raises the combustion temperature, which increases the creation of nitrogen oxides, which are formed with nitrogen pulled from the air. It also increases the tendency of gasoline to evaporate, a phenomenon that releases unburned hydrocarbons, another ingredient of smog, into the air.</p>
        <p>Several years ago California ordered gas reformulated to cut these evaporative emissions, and last year New York, New Jersey and the six New England states followed suit. Oil companies initially protested those steps bitterly, because it required them to remove some cheap, abundant components of gasoline, but more recently, several have voluntarily taken the same step in other parts of the country, as their contribution to cleaner air. The evaporations come from under the hood and from refueling.</p>
        <p>The Daschle amendment would partly exempt the oil companies that used ethanol from the anti-evaporation limits on gasoline.</p>
