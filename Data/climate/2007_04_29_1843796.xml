        <p>Washington is poised to offer a helping hand, as well as significant money, to assist Mayor Michael Bloomberg in his efforts to solve New York's traffic gridlock. But there is one bump in the road -- Albany, which must approve the city's proposed remedy before any money can begin to flow. And some legislators are balking.</p>
        <p>The federal Department of Transportation plans to make available $1.2 billion in grants, loans and other financing to metropolitan areas across the country to help them test strategies to relieve traffic congestion.</p>
        <p>New York is requesting a chunk of that money for its own pilot program, under which drivers would be charged fees to use the city's busiest streets. Similar programs have worked in London, Stockholm and Singapore.</p>
        <p>While money from Washington is not guaranteed, the Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, has praised the city's plan as ''the kind of bold thinking leaders across the country need to embrace if we hope to win the battle against traffic congestion.'' The assumption underlying Mr. Bloomberg's strategy as well as the federal aid program is that gridlock is bad for commerce and bad for public health.</p>
        <p>State legislators should also keep in mind that Mr. Bloomberg's plan accomplishes something they haven't -- creating revenues, perhaps as much as $500 million a year in fees, to improve public transportation. Opponents of the plan, particularly those in car-dependent Queens, are flat wrong in calling the fee a tax on the working class. With the additional investment in rapid bus routes, ferries and transit links, workers would benefit from more choices.</p>
        <p>Under the Bloomberg plan, cars would pay $8 and trucks $21 to enter Manhattan south of 86th Street during peak hours. There would be breaks for people living in the congestion zone and for drivers who pay tunnel or bridge tolls. But there would also be 100,00 fewer cars than the 800,000 that now jam the most congested areas.</p>
        <p>Congestion pricing is just one piece of the mayor's visionary agenda for sustaining New York. He is right to try to seize this moment to advance the idea. Like other reasonable people, New Yorkers are worried about global climate change, and they are further concerned about the quality of life in a city that is bound to grow.</p>
