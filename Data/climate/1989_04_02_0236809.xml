        <p>LEAD: A DECADE ago, concern about pollution from oil spills reached a crescendo with what remain the two biggest disasters so far: the wreck of the tanker Amoco Cadiz off the coast of France in 1978, spilling 68 million gallons of crude oil along the Brittany shoreline, and the blowout of the Ixtoc I oil well in the Gulf of Mexico a year later, pouring 140 million gallons into the sea.</p>
        <p>A DECADE ago, concern about pollution from oil spills reached a crescendo with what remain the two biggest disasters so far: the wreck of the tanker Amoco Cadiz off the coast of France in 1978, spilling 68 million gallons of crude oil along the Brittany shoreline, and the blowout of the Ixtoc I oil well in the Gulf of Mexico a year later, pouring 140 million gallons into the sea.</p>
        <p>But in the 1980's, the issue faded from public consciousness partly because a more cautious oil industry, stung by costs and criticism, succeeded in significantly reducing the number of large spills. The spotlight shifted elsewhere as other environmental issues like toxic waste took center stage.</p>
        <p>Now the grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound and the ecological and economic calamity caused by the escape of more than 10 million gallons of crude have brought the issue back to the forefront. But this time, the discussion has emerged amid increasing worry about the broader effects of fossil fuels on the environment.</p>
        <p>So far attention has focused on the immediate circumstances of the worst disaster of its kind in American history: the ship captain's drinking, the control of the tanker by an unlicensed helmsman, the delay by Exxon in trying to contain the spill.</p>
        <p>Some energy experts, looking beyond the immediate questions that are likely to be the subject of long and thorough investigation, say that the Exxon Valdez spill could be a warning of risks to come when, as is eventually bound to happen, world oil prices rise again and oil exploration expands into its last frontiers: the pristine, ecologically sensitive arctic and Antarctic regions where harsh conditions make it extremely difficult to deal with an oil spill, and where cold weather delays the natural decomposition of petroleum. Environmentalists are not only seizing on the Exxon Valdez incident to bolster their case against oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska; they are also holding it up as one more example, along with urban air pollution and the greenhouse effect, of the cost of continuing dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Since its peak in 1979, the amount of oil lost worldwide at sea and on land through spillage, fire and sinkings has plummeted from 328 million gallons to between 24 million and 55 million a year, according to the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena in Cambridge, Mass., which keeps track of oil spills. There was one exceptional year, 1983, when well blowouts in the Iran-Iraq war and a rash of large tanker accidents swelled the total to 242 million gallons.</p>
        <p>While the downward trend was being established, a study by the National Research Council found in 1985 that the most important source of oil pollution in the oceans was not well blowouts and tanker accidents but municipal and industrial runoff, the cleaning of ship bilges and other routine occurrences. The study also found that all the sources together posed less of an overall threat to the environment than many had thought.</p>
        <p>Still, the study found, ''petroleum can have a seriously adverse effect on local environments, persisting, in some cases unaltered, for decades.''</p>
        <p>Since large oil-spill disasters are ''low-probability events,'' the Exxon Valdez disaster will most likely turn out to be an aberration, not the start of a new upward trend, said Richard S. Golob, director of the Cambridge center and an expert on oil spills. The United States, he said, has been particularly fortunate in having no major incidents since 1976, when the tanker Argo Merchant grounded off southeastern Massachusetts, spilling 7.6 million gallons of crude.</p>
        <p>Still, these unlikely events are going to happen, he said, ''no matter how well you plan in advance.'' And ''in a massive spill situation, regardless of the degree of pre-planning, all hell breaks loose,'' he said. ''The reason is that it takes place so infrequently, and the resources are never available in a single location to deal effectively with it,'' he said. A Loss of Expertise</p>
        <p>One problem, in Mr. Golob's view, is that the decline in big accidents in the 1980's caused the Government to shift its attention toward hazardous waste and toxic chemicals. Funds for oil-spill response and research ''have decreased dramatically,'' he said, and the oil industry, in a wave of economy moves in the 1980's, has let many of its most experienced experts on spills retire early.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1980's, some environmentalists have been insisting that although oil spill disasters have declined, smaller spills are taking place all the time, with adverse effects on ecosystems and wildlife. It is a ''chronic problem,'' said Lisa Speer, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York. ''The only way to protect areas that are economically and ecologically valuable is to keep oil out,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Exxon Valdez incident is sure to provoke new argument about opening up more coastal areas, along with the Alaskan wildlife refuge, to oil exploration. Proponents of increased exploration say that failure to exploit those reserves will once again lay the United States open to the mercy of foreign producers. In 10 or 15 years, ''demand for oil will be high enough so that they can dictate the price again,'' said Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group. ''To choose not to develop the Alaskan refuge in the face of falling domestic production would be a big economic and political and security decision for this country,'' he said. A Senate committee has approved legislation opening the refuge to exploration, and President Bush favors it.</p>
        <p>But the big energy issue of the 1990's is not going to be the depletion of oil resources, said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''The environment is going to be the big theme,'' he said. Most new oil will be found ''in very tough and treacherous conditions'' in the far nothern and far southern latitudes, he said, where cold, icebergs and heavy seas increase the risk of oil spills and pollution.</p>
        <p>Although the world seems to have cast its lot with oil for the foreseeable future, some environmentalists are finding in the Exxon Valdez incident new justification for switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar power. The tragedy in Alaska has its roots in the dependence on fossil fuels, said Joseph Goffman, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, which is based in New York. But he said that oil spills, air pollution, acid rain and global warming caused by the greenhouse effect all come back to the same underlying problem. The use of fossil fuels, he said, ''is the central knot that's got to be untied.''  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
