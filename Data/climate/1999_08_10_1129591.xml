        <p>Amid the summer news doldrums, what could be more invigorating than a warning that physicists may be on the verge of destroying the world?</p>
        <p>Luckily, this and similar alarms can be taken with a large grain of salt, and viewed in the proper light, disaster warnings can be fun. The idea that human beings could actually obliterate their planet may be scary, but like a roller-coaster ride, it is thrilling. Even in the face of doomsday speculation, most reasonable people are pretty sure that the global roller coaster will stay on the track despite the hair-raising ride.</p>
        <p>Disaster forecasts have a peculiar appeal, particularly if human beings are the potential agents of destruction. Many of us may even feel a perverse sense of empowerment when told that the human race, ineffectual though it is in solving its biggest problems, might at least be capable of wiping itself out.</p>
        <p>Anyway, here is the latest bad, albeit entertaining, news for disaster fans:</p>
        <p>Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., has just finished a huge accelerator capable of smashing together the nuclei of very heavy atoms at nearly the speed of light. Builders of this machine hope that collisions of gold or other atoms will not only shatter the atoms' nuclei into their constituent protons and neutrons, but will pulverize the protons and neutrons themselves, leaving a ''plasma'' -- a kind of energy soup -- briefly consisting of loose quark and gluon particles. These building blocks of matter have never before been studied in such a state.</p>
        <p>But no one is quite sure what these collisions might spawn, and the uncertainty has encouraged some people to speculate that Brookhaven's new accelerator might turn out to be a doomsday machine.</p>
        <p>Last month, The Sunday Times of London informed readers that Brookhaven might have created a world-devouring monster. The British weekly commented that ''the men in white coats would send us, and them, into the oblivion of a black hole of their making.'' (In reality, accelerator physicists wear jeans and sport shirts, but never mind.)</p>
        <p>In one version of the supposed danger, a gold-to-gold collision might create ''strange'' quarks that would pair up as ''strangelets.'' These supposedly might go on to annihilate the ordinary matter around them, ending the world as we know it.</p>
        <p>Another idea mentioned by The Sunday Times and in letters from readers published in the July issue of Scientific American is that the high energy density of a gold-to-gold collision might nucleate a tiny black hole that would grow like a cancer, eventually devouring the earth.</p>
        <p>Mainstream physicists have cast cold water on such fears, but every time a new accelerator begins operating, dire warnings have ensued.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, when Fermilab's mighty Tevatron accelerator was under construction in Illinois, alarms were heard that when protons and antiprotons collided at a combined energy of two trillion electron volts, the result might be a microscopic tear in the fabric of space-time that extends throughout the universe -- a tear that could bring on the ultimate Armageddon.</p>
        <p>There had been speculation by Dr. Frank Wilczek of the Institute for Advanced Study and other physicists that the birth of the universe might have left it with a false floor -- one that we consider the absolute absence of energy: a kind of zero point.  But energy scales are relative; the zero point on one scale may not be zero on another. So some physicists wondered whether there might be a hidden floor with an energy even lower than that of the zero point familiar to us, and if so, what would happen if a hole should open in the false floor.</p>
        <p>One idea was that a tear in space-time, perhaps caused by one of the Tevatron's proton collisions, might bring on the collapse of the false vacuum, annihilating all matter in the path of its collapse. The collapse bubble would balloon outward at the speed of light, eventually destroying the universe.</p>
        <p>The trouble with this ingenious idea, physicists soon realized, was that if such a catastrophe could occur it would have happened long ago. The earth is constantly peppered by cosmic-ray particles, some of which have energies 100 million times greater than the energies of particles accelerated by the Tevatron or any other machine, and yet the universal vacuum floor is intact and we, the earth and the universe are still here. The Tevatron itself has been producing rich discoveries for years, without endangering anyone.</p>
        <p>Physics has provided more than its share of doomsday scenarios, real and imaginary.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, for instance, some scientists theorized that a nuclear war would be followed by a deadly ''nuclear winter.'' Fortunately, we have never tested that prediction.</p>
        <p>Nuclear weaponry from its inception has inspired horrifying speculation. Before the first nuclear explosion, the Trinity test in New Mexico on July 16, 1945, there were suggestions that a nuclear explosion might ignite the earth's atmosphere, destroying all life. The great Enrico Fermi was inspired to do some calculating just before the Trinity test and concluded that the atmosphere was in no real danger.</p>
        <p>After the blast, J. Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the Los Alamos bomb team, uttered one of the most often repeated -- and some would say, pretentious -- reactions of the day. Quoting the Hindu god Shiva, he said, ''Now I am become death, destroyer of worlds.''</p>
        <p>Doomsday speculation has also been sparked by chemists.</p>
        <p>In the early 1960's, an obscure Soviet chemist named Nikolai Fedyakin reported that water in thin glass tubes seemed to be transforming itself into a peculiar viscous form. A famous physical chemist, Boris V. Deryagin, announced that his own experiments confirmed Mr. Fedyakin's discovery of ''anomalous water,'' and dozens of scientists in Europe and the United States chimed in with additional confirmations.</p>
        <p>The stuff was dubbed ''polywater''-- ordinary water molecules chained together as a polymer -- and some scientists speculated that it might convert all the world's water to an unusable polymerized form, thereby killing off most life. It sounded all too similar to an imaginary high-temperature ice, ''Ice-9,'' a fictional invention of the novelist Kurt Vonnegut, who imagined the world being destroyed by the elimination of all liquid water.</p>
        <p>It took four years to dispel the polywater myth: scientists finally determined that polywater was nothing more than dirty water.</p>
        <p>But in place of the polywater menace we have seen a spate of warnings about asteroid impacts, gene-splicing mishaps that could turn the human race into centaurs, super earthquakes, and much more.</p>
        <p>It is worth remembering that there are plenty of serious threats to the planet resulting from human bungling, of course.</p>
        <p>There is the thinning ozone layer, a victim of chlorofluorocarbons released from refrigerators and other sources over the years. Large third-world nations still manufacture chlorofluorocarbons, despite a ban on their manufacture and use in industrial nations.</p>
        <p>Growing evidence shows that human use of carbon-based fuels is contributing to global warming.</p>
        <p>The habitats that nourish pandas, penguins, parrots and thousands of other animals and plants are disappearing because of human activity, and the diversity of life on earth faces disastrous impoverishment.</p>
        <p>So the trick will be sorting out the red herrings like accelerator disasters and polywater from the real dangers. While we're at it, we might quit basing self-esteem on the ability of the human race to commit collective suicide.</p>
