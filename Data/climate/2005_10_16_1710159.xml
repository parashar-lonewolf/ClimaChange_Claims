        <p>FALL arrives in Connecticut like a prom queen, draped in boastful reds, yellows and rusty browns, perfumed with wood smoke. It saunters through the Litchfield hills, then turns to the suburbs and cities, where one tree on one block can inspire an entire neighborhood's devotion.</p>
        <p>Fall is important here not only for the spectacle it creates, but also for the tourist economy it supports and the cultural symbol it represents; no season is more strongly identified with New England than fall. As far back as 150 years ago, Henry David Thoreau realized how special it was.</p>
        <p>''October is the month of painted leaves,'' Thoreau wrote in his 1862 essay ''Autumnal Tints.'' ''Their rich glow now flashes round the world.''</p>
        <p>But what if the glow wasn't so rich?</p>
        <p>That is a question some scientists have already begun to ask, and they don't think it is hypothetical. Already this year, throughout New England, the foliage has been late and, some say, unspectacular. Scientists at the University of New Hampshire project that shifts in the climate caused by global warming will progressively dull the leaves throughout southern New England over the next century. Maples will move north and the remaining oaks and hickories will change colors later and with less verve, they say. If the projections are correct, leaf-peepers may be forced as far north as Canada for their fix of foliage.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one scientist says autumn in Connecticut has already lost its brilliance.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had a really great display in the last 10 years,'' said Barrett Rock, a professor in natural resources and a researcher at the Complex Systems Research Center at the University of New Hampshire who has studied the effects of global warming on the local autumn landscape.</p>
        <p>This year, the problem has been intense heat in late summer and early fall, which delayed the changing of the leaves and may dull them, said Chris James, director of air planning at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. The average temperature in August was 73 degrees, nearly 4 degrees higher than the average since 1895, and the second-highest August average in that period, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The heat did not let up in September, when it was 3.7 degrees warmer than average. Precipitation was about one inch below average.</p>
        <p>But global warming is a gradual phenomenon, and one warm year does not mean that fall will be this warm every year. Indeed, this year's reduced rainfall appears to be an anomaly; trends in precipitation show the state becoming wetter in recent years, and computer models, set forth in a federally financed 2001 report, the New England Regional Assessment, project that that trend will continue.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, scientists like Dr. Rock say there is ample reason to worry. In the regional assessment report, Dr. Rock and fellow researchers at the University of New Hampshire and other universities in the region found that Connecticut's average temperature had increased by 1.4 degrees throughout the last century. The scientists used two different models to project what New England would look like over the next 100 years.</p>
        <p>Both models, Dr. Rock said in a telephone interview, are considered ''middle of the road,'' predicting gradual but not extreme warming trends. But both project that global warming will accelerate dramatically in New England. One forecasts an overall temperature increase of 6 degrees by 2090. That would leave Boston looking and feeling like Richmond, Va. The other model projected a climate like Atlanta's, a full 10 degrees warmer than Boston's.</p>
        <p>This year, a University of New Hampshire environmental scientist, Cameron P. Wake, issued a report in conjunction with Clean Air Cool Planet, a nonprofit group that studies climate change in the Northeast. Using different methods from the earlier study, the new report confirmed the warming trend in the Northeast throughout the 20th century, and showed it increasing over the last 30 years. The new report did not focus on foliage but found other significant effects to plants and trees, including progressively later bloom dates for lilac trees.</p>
        <p>The warming trends affect foliage in various ways, Dr. Rock said. As greenhouse gases accumulate and the earth warms, summer weather will linger into fall. That will delay the frosts that degrade chlorophyll and trigger leaves to change. It takes at least one frost in which temperatures fall to 30 degrees Fahrenheit or below to start the changes in the leaves. If those fall frosts are delayed, or the chlorophyll breaks down more gradually, leaf-peepers will not see the vibrant reds they have come to expect in Connecticut, Dr. Rock said.</p>
        <p>Last week, Marian Travis was decorating a lamp post near her house in Ossining, N.Y., with colorful fake leaves when she realized that something felt wrong though she was getting her neighborhood ready for fall, it felt more like summer. ''It didn't even fell like fall,'' she said. ''It is fall by the calendar, so you have to put the decorations up.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Travis said she thinks fall has changed since she was a girl. ''I remember in the fall, I'd walk home from school and there were so many leaves in the street and the gutter,'' she said. ''They don't have them anymore. I don't think the fall is like what we used to have way back.''</p>
        <p>Global warming will affect which tree species can survive in the state and which will move north to cooler climates, scientists say.</p>
        <p>Maples, with their stunning red, yellow and orange leaves, are New England's treasures in the fall. Thoreau positively gushed over them, writing that they seem to absorb ''all the sunny warmth of the season.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut is full of maples, but changes in temperature, air quality and rainfall, the 2001 climate report said, will change the mix of trees in state forests. Connecticut officials said they have already noticed this trend. ''Already we see a lot of the maple trees moving northward,'' said Gina McCarthy, the commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Protection. ''The species is migrating northward.''</p>
        <p>Birches and beeches, two other species known for their foliage, can also be expected to migrate north, according to the 2001 report.</p>
        <p>In their place, Ms. McCarthy said, leaf enthusiasts can expect to see more oak and hickory in Connecticut's 1.9 million acres of forests. Leaves from those two species are more muted in the fall, often turning brown or dull green.</p>
        <p>The 2001 report details other possible effects of global warming on foliage, including increases in plant diseases and insect outbreaks. Warming also increases ground-level ozone, which can damage leaves.</p>
        <p>But it is not just scientists who are concerned about the changing autumn landscape. The colors of fall are big business for the tourism industry. If the prom queen leaves town, and is replaced by a quiet unassuming friend in brown or dull green, will anyone come to see her? If the scientists' projections come true over the next century, will people seeking truly great foliage go all the way to Canada?</p>
        <p>Not so fast, said Connecticut tourism industry executives.</p>
        <p>''The general trend toward global warming is slow and almost imperceptible,'' said Jennifer Aniskovich, executive director of the Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism. Ms. Aniskovich said the state has had some of its most spectacular displays in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Others were more adamant.</p>
        <p>''Global warming has not in any way, shape or form come to this part of the country yet,'' said Pauline Simring, the owner of Pauline's Place, an antique and estate jewelry shop in Kent. ''If I was in Alaska, I would be concerned, but I am in beautiful northwest Connecticut. We willall be long dead if there is ever a change in this part of the country.''</p>
        <p>Janet Serra, director of the Northwest Connecticut Convention and Visitors Bureau, said people always seem to doubt the foliage. Nonetheless, the display in Litchfield County is consistently extraordinary, she said. Although she acknowledged that it is late this year, she still has hope for a beautiful fall.</p>
        <p>''Somehow, mother nature always comes through,'' Ms. Serra said.</p>
        <p>Three million to four million tourists come to Connecticut in the fall, which is close to 40 percent of the state's tourism, Ms. Aniskovich said. Early bookings this year are about the same as last year, she said.</p>
        <p>Businesses throughout the state depend on the foliage to draw tourists to the area.</p>
        <p>''We've always marketed fall foliage,'' said Marianne Vandenburgh, who owns the House on the Hill Bed and Breakfast in Waterbury. Ms. Vandenburgh said she looks forward every year to the leaves on the beech tree in her yard turning copper. So far this year, she said last week, the tree has not changed color.</p>
        <p>''The beech isn't changing,'' she said. ''The maples are just sort of playing at it.''</p>
        <p>Some see the foliage as New England's single most defining element.</p>
        <p>''Egypt has the Pyramids,'' Ms. Serra said. ''Paris has the Eiffel Tower. Every place in the world has something special. In New England, foliage and brilliant colors are very special.''</p>
        <p>Where would Connecticut be without its foliage? According to some historians, the state would be right back where it was 200 years ago.</p>
        <p>Brilliant fall foliage, it seems, was not always a given in this part of the country. Early colonists took intricate notes on the natural beauty they saw when they came to New England, but they made few mentions of the fall foliage, said Walter Woodward, an assistant professor in the history department at the University of Connecticut, and the official state historian. ''With all of the accounts of early settlers in New England, there's rarely any mention of the color of leaves in the fall,'' Dr. Woodward said. ''They describe nature in incredible detail, but we often ask 'Where's the fall?'''</p>
        <p>In ''Autumnal Tints,'' Thoreau himself lamented the lack of appreciation for the leaves, and the strange absence of essays and poems about them. ''The autumnal change of our woods has not made a deep impression on our own literature yet,'' he wrote. ''October has hardly tinged our poetry.''</p>
        <p>Kent C. Ryden, an associate professor of American and New England studies at the University of Southern Maine, tried to understand why that was in his book ''Landscape with Figures: Nature and Culture in New England'' (University of Iowa Press, 2001). Dr. Ryden argued that the foliage New Englanders see today was not always part of the collective consciousness of the Europeans who settled here. For many years, he said, it was not even part of the landscape.</p>
        <p>When colonists first arrived in New England, they clear-cut forests to make room for farming and grazing. While about 75 percent of New England is now covered with trees, only about 25 percent of the area was forested in the middle of the 19th century, Dr. Ryden said.</p>
        <p>''Up until the mid- to late-19th century, there wasn't really a whole lot of foliage to see, let alone to value as a tourist resource,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the mid-19th century, agriculture began to decline in New England, and hardwood forests slowly grew back, Dr. Ryden said. Still, foliage did not become integral to the region's identity until the 1920's and 1930's, when automobiles made it easier to reach New England. Color photography further enhanced the region's reputation, he said.</p>
        <p>But to treat fall foliage like a birthright or a constant cultural marker is not historically accurate, he said. The colorful autumns are as much a product of mythmaking as they are of chlorophyll, he said.</p>
        <p>If projections for global warming are accurate, the region could begin to look as it did 200 years ago. The irony is not lost on Dr. Ryden.</p>
        <p>''It could become another part of the romanticized New England past,'' he said. ''The good strong Yankee farmers and the foliage, the classic village green and the white church, that whole combination of landscape elements that people get on the bus to see every fall.''</p>
