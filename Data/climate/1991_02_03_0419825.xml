        <p>SCIENCE MATTERS Achieving Scientific Literacy. By Robert M. Hazen and James Trefil. Illustrated. 294 pp. New York: Doubleday. $19.95.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Hazen and James Trefil are worried. In a documentary film called "A Private Universe," 23 gowned graduates at a Harvard University commencement are asked the question, "Why is it hotter in summer than in winter?" Only two come up with the right answer. Obviously stunned, Mr. Hazen and Mr. Trefil, fellow professors at George Mason University (in geology and physics, respectively), conducted an informal survey of the seniors at their own school and discovered that fully half could not correctly answer the question, "What is the difference between an atom and a molecule?"</p>
        <p>So they've written "Science Matters," ambitiously subtitled "Achieving Scientific Literacy." After assailing our educational system (they maintain that schools, in teaching only one science at a time, fail to provide a broad science education) and explaining why we need to be scientifically literate (to avoid "political demagoguery" and the "decay of the entire democratic process," among other things), the authors set out to teach science -- all of it, by golly -- in less than 300 pages.</p>
        <p>They give it one heck of a try. Mr. Hazen and Mr. Trefil are the unofficial world champions of the homely example. To illustrate the laws of motion, they explain "why Newton would tell you to wear a seat belt." They state that the first law of thermodynamics is "the bane of dieters," because "the chemical energy or calories we take in as food must either be used to do work (exercise) or stored (as fat)." The second law of thermodynamics, they say, can be stated in this way: "A refrigerator won't work unless it's plugged in." They explain why FM radio stations fade out faster than AM stations as you drive out of town and illustrate electrostatic force by describing how a photocopier works. Chemical bonding is likened to Margee Hazen's recipe for Pennsylvania applesauce bread. The Earth is described as "really no different from a pot of boiling water on your stove," and Earth is later described as a "potful of soup," as opposed to Mars and Mercury, which are "mere spoonfuls." O.K., Noel Coward it isn't, but it's somewhat effective nonetheless.</p>
        <p>There is more than a pinch here and a dash there of cooking metaphors, designed, perhaps, to make readers hungry for science. But some may suffer indigestion. Either way, Mr. Hazen and Mr. Trefil are nothing if not unpretentious -- good, down-to-earth, we-can-explain-anything science teachers, the kind you wish you had but never did. (Could it be that all the good teachers are too busy writing books?)</p>
        <p>Despite the many virtues of "Science Matters" -- it includes, for example, a wonderfully simple and unmystical treatment of quantum mechanics -- this book is not the answer to science illiteracy.</p>
        <p>The authors have decided on what they call the "great ideas approach to science." The key to literacy, they insist, is knowing a little bit of all the sciences, rather than being well schooled in one. Their book, in their own words, is "something of a potpourri," because science tends to be "a little messy around the edges."</p>
        <p>Well, it's not supposed to be. But "Science Matters" is. In an early chapter, for instance, we learn about the atom. Not until Chapter 9, however, do we find out about the subatomic particles that make up atoms. Biologists and their ilk will no doubt be upset over the book's emphasis on the physical sciences over the life sciences. Mathematics, which serves as the language of science, is dismissed from the outset. And, inexplicably, artificial intelligence is discussed in the chapter on chemical bonding.</p>
        <p>Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in physics, once commented that his high school physics class was "the dullest course I'd ever taken" because it treated heat, light, mechanics, sound, electricity and magnetism as if they had nothing to do with one another. "Science Matters" evokes a similar response.</p>
        <p>Science is not a random assortment of arcane facts. There is a structure, a hierarchy (to use a loaded word) that gives meaning to the mountain of theories and data. It is this structure that Mr. Hazen and Mr. Trefil have carefully avoided. The sciences are built on simplicity. Physics is considered the primary science, because it deals with simple laws that apply to everything from subatomic particles to human beings to the entire cosmos. Chemistry is a rung up, because it depends upon the laws of physics. Biology deals with even larger systems, and depends both on chemistry and physics. And so on.</p>
        <p>Mathematics is at the heart of the sciences. All of them require mathematical formulas to express their various truths. As the saying goes, the physicists defer only to the mathematicians, and the mathematicians defer only to God. (Though one would be hard-pressed to find a mathematician that modest.)</p>
        <p>The authors' so-called great ideas approach, however, seems more influenced by current newspaper headlines than by logic. For example, such eternal stuff as "the clockwork universe," "the electromagnetic spectrum" and "the nature of light" are rightfully all given their own headings. But then so are such ephemeral phenomena as "ozone depletion," "acid rain" and, yes, "disposable diapers." In the peculiar structure of this work, Huggies achieve parity with Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hazen, whose books include "The Poetry of Geology" and "The Breakthrough," and Mr. Trefil, one of the authors of "The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy," are respected and able writers. But despite that, "Science Matters" has little to do with science literacy. Trying to learn science from this book is like trying to learn French by memorizing the definitions of the most-used nouns in the headlines of Le Figaro, with nary a care for grammar or syntax.</p>
        <p>And, frankly, the facts the authors serve up are difficult to remember in this little-bit-of-everything format. A few days after reading "Science Matters," I couldn't recall very much of it. Like reading the Cliffs Notes on "Madame Bovary," the details stay with you only through the mid-term.</p>
        <p>Well, Mr. Hazen and Mr. Trefil are right. Science education is a mess. Perhaps, though, the problem is poor teaching, or no teaching at all, rather than the one-science-at-a-time method the authors detest. The sciences all rely on the scientific method -- theory, experimentation, replication of experiment. So, a well-taught course -- whether in geology, biology or physics -- can train a mind to think in a rigorous, scientific manner. Doing science, with all the lab work and calculations, molds a mind more permanently than any crash memorization course. So educated, a mind, even one that isn't full of facts, can see through the spurious arguments of creationism and the other nonsensical ideas that the authors fear are eroding our society.</p>
        <p>By the way, it's hotter in summer than in winter because of the tilt of Earth with respect to the Sun; and molecules are different than atoms because they are made of them.</p>
