        <p>Acting to address the contentious subject of global climate change, the Senate passed an amendment to pending energy legislation on Tuesday calling for voluntary reductions in some emissions and spending money to promote technology to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>The measure, adopted by a vote of 66 to 29, was the least stringent of three competing amendments intended to address climate change.</p>
        <p>Its passage followed a setback for environmentalists late Monday night, when Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the energy committee, declined to support another amendment imposing mandatory reductions in fossil-fuel emissions that scientists link to global warming. Mr. Domenici explained that he favored the idea, but worried that opposition might scuttle the energy bill.</p>
        <p>The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on a third climate-change amendment sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. It is the strictest of the three, calling for steeper mandatory cuts in emissions, and it faces stiff opposition.</p>
        <p>Still, advocates of federal efforts to combat climate change by reducing pollution called the framing of the debate itself a victory.</p>
        <p>''This legislation represents a very significant shift in the consensus in the United States Senate toward taking significant steps toward dealing with global warming,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, a co-sponsor of the amendment that passed. He noted that the energy committee had announced plans for hearings on additional measures.</p>
        <p>Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the amendment that passed, though ''inadequate,'' signaled a ''shift from debating whether we should do something to what we intend to do'' about global warming.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the changing dynamics of the issue, some environmentalists pointed to support for that amendment from Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who previously called the idea of global warming a hoax.</p>
        <p>Repeating his arguments that ''there is not a relationship between manmade gases and climate change'' in a speech on the floor, Mr. Inhofe nonetheless praised the amendment for ''coming up with an approach that is measured and reasonable and will help convince a lot of the people that are right now participating in this religion called global warming to realize that maybe this is something that we shouldn't have to suffer economically for.''</p>
        <p>The provisions in the amendment, sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, are among several environmentally friendly measures in the Senate version of the energy bill. But it is headed for a collision with the version passed by the House and supported by the White House. The House bill emphasizes increasing the supply of carbon-based fuels like oil and gas instead.</p>
        <p>In addition to calling for businesses to voluntarily reduce the carbon-based emissions believed to contribute to global warming, Mr. Hagel's amendment authorizes loans and other forms of subsidies to promote new technologies that decrease pollution. It also directs the secretary of energy to adopt a ''national climate change strategy'' and authorizes the secretary of state to provide help to developing countries for technology to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
        <p>''We all agree on the need for a clean environment and a stable climate,'' Mr. Hagel said on the floor, arguing that the bill would create ''public-private partnerships'' to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>The Senate also approved an amendment to the bill on Tuesday to allow the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission to sue the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on antitrust grounds, a reaction to concern about oil prices now nearing $60 a barrel. It was sponsored by Senators Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domenici said the provision was unlikely to survive a House-Senate conference on energy legislation.</p>
