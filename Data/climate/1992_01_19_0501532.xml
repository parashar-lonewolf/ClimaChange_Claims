        <p>THE biotechnology industry has found New Jersey.

        <p>State officials and industry experts say that after a somewhat slow start, New Jersey is now emerging as a major site for biotechnology businesses -- a multibillion-dollar industry that holds out the promise of solving some of mankind's most pressing environmental and medical problems. In addition, they say, the state's enhanced presence in the biotechnology market will aid the state's economy by creating new industry and jobs.</p>
        <p>"We feel that New Jersey is becoming a leader in the biotech industry," said Brooke Hern, a spokesman for the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development.

        <p>THE biotechnology industry has found New Jersey. From bags of bugs to designer drugs, from cloned chrysanthemums to a substitute for human blood, an increasing number of New Jersey companies are creating and developing innovative products, using the sophisticated technology born of the biotechnology revolution.</p>
        <p>State officials and industry experts say that after a somewhat slow start, New Jersey is now emerging as a major site for biotechnology businesses -- a multibillion-dollar industry that holds out the promise of solving some of mankind's most pressing environmental and medical problems. In addition, they say, the state's enhanced presence in the biotechnology market will aid the state's economy by creating new industry and jobs.</p>
        <p>"We feel that New Jersey is becoming a leader in the biotech industry," said Brooke Hern, a spokesman for the State Department of Commerce and Economic Development. Mr. Hern said an informal survey of listings of biotechnology companies nationwide by the department had shown New Jersey to have 193 biotechnology companies -- second only to California with 365, and just ahead of Massachusetts with 183.</p>
        <p>"Up until a few years ago, there wasn't even an industry code for biotechnology," Mr. Hern said, referring to the way officials classify specific industries for statistical purposes.</p>
        <p>For purposes of the survey, Mr. Hern said, the biotechnology industry was broadly defined to include all companies involved in industrial microbiology, biology, chemistry or engineering that used genetic engineering, live microorganisms or cell cultures from other organisms to produce new products.</p>
        <p>Industry experts are not quite as enthusiastic as state officials are about the state's relative ranking; most believe that Massachusetts still ranks ahead of New Jersey and that New Jersey is something of a late bloomer. Nevertheless, they say, in recent years New Jersey has established itself as a major source of management expertise, scientific talent and venture capital -- the three ingredients necessary for any budding biotechnology venture.</p>
        <p>"New Jersey provides a nice opportunity for new bioscience firms because they can find quality people right outside their door," said Jack E. Stover, partner in charge of New Jersey high-technology practice in the Princeton office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the consulting and accounting firm.</p>
        <p>"It's a lot easier to steal someone from a Johnson &amp; Johnson and bring them on board than it is to go to Boston or San Jose and then have to relocate them," he said.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, the pharmaceutical companies provide a "role model" for the smaller bioscience companies and often provide necessary capital through joint venture arrangements. And when that money runs out, Mr. Stover said, there is a vast amount of public and private money available in the area.</p>
        <p>"We've got dozens of companies in New Jersey that have raised capital to continue their research and development efforts," he said.</p>
        <p>The growing appeal of the state as a center for high technology, Mr. Stover said, "provides a huge opportunity for the future of New Jersey, especially as it relates to spawning and developing new technologies and new applications for those technologies."</p>
        <p>J. Steven Burrill, international director for high technology in the San Francisco office of Ernst &amp; Young, the consulting and accounting firm, said the biotechnology industry began in the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960's and early 70's. Spawned by advances in biology that gave scientists the ability to manipulate an organism's genetic code, the industry has grown steadily over 20 years.</p>
        <p>"My estimate is that you're talking about a $50 billion industry before the end of the decade," Mr. Burrill said. "Only a handful" of biotechnology companies, he added, have gone bankrupt over the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>"Almost every company has developed enough technology that there is always a way that they can get value out or merge with somebody," Mr. Burrill said.</p>
        <p>Over the next several years, Mr. Burrill said, between 120 and 150 major products are expected to be approved by various regulatory agencies. To date, he said, only a few products have successfully navigated the arduous, expensive and time-consuming approval process and are actually being marketed.</p>
        <p>One such product has been developed by Enzon Inc., a South Plainfield company that was founded by two Rutgers University professors in 1983. The product, called Adagen, is a drug that is used to treat victims of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, commonly referred to as "bubble boy" disease.</p>
        <p>Victims of the disease are children whose bodies do not produce a necessary enzyme, said Glenn Kazo, vice president of corporate development for the company. Without the enzyme, Mr. Kazo said, the children's immune systems fail to develop, leaving them susceptible to infection and often forced to live in plastic "bubbles," isolated from others and the environment.</p>
        <p>Though the ability to manufacture the enzyme has existed for some time, he said, it must be administered to patients in frequent doses because the body quickly flushes it out of the bloodstream. Frequent use of the enzyme, however, would cause severe side effects. In fact, Mr. Kazo said, the raw enzyme was so toxic that it was never developed for use.  'Like a Stealth Protein'</p>
        <p>Enzon's founders solved that problem in the late 1970's while still at Rutgers by attaching an inert substance -- polyethylene glycol -- to the enzyme molecule.</p>
        <p>"It works by disguising the surface of the molecule," said Dr. Abraham Abuchowski, president and co-founder of the company, along with Dr. Frank F. Davis. "It's actually like a stealth protein," he said.</p>
        <p>The resulting Adagen compound was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 1990 and is now being supplied to 14 children who have the disease. Though the company makes no profit on the sale of the drug, the technology it has developed can be used to make other designer drugs, as they are commonly called in the industry.</p>
        <p>In fact, the company recently entered into an agreement with the California-based Genlabs Technologies Inc. to develop a modified form of a Genlabs drug called GLQ223 for the treatment of AIDS.</p>
        <p>Another potential use for the technology, Dr. Abuchowski said, is the production of hemoglobin -- the protein present in blood that is responsible for carrying oxygen. Quest Has Taken Years</p>
        <p>"This is probably one of the most unique pharmaceutical products ever created," Dr. Abuchowski said. "People have been trying to make artificial blood for years."</p>
        <p>The raw hemoglobin, which is obtained from cow blood and then "disguised" by attaching polyethylene glycol, could be used as a replacement for blood lost in an accident, during an operation or even by a soldier on a battlefield.</p>
        <p>The semi-synthetic hemoglobin, Dr. Abuchowski said, is now being tested on animals and should be ready for testing on humans by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Another New Jersey company that has produced marketable products is the DNA Plant Technology Corporation in Cinnaminson, one of the largest biotechnology companies in the United States.</p>
        <p>David Gilbert, DNA's manager of corporate communications, said the company had focused its research on five basic areas.</p>
        <p>Using gene splicing techniques, Mr. Gilbert said, the company has been able to create new vegetables, including a snacking pepper that tastes like a sweet red bell pepper but is the size of a small jalapeno chili pepper.</p>
        <p>The company has also developed a low-fat frying oil, a test kit to detect fungal diseases in grass, another test kit to detect petroleum contamination in soil and a biological additive that helps create "a higher quality artificial snow." Long-Lived Chrysanthemum</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbert said the company was also involved in a joint venture with a Dutch company to breed and market flowers with novel colors and patterns. One flower that the company has already created through genetic engineering is a white chrysanthemum with a long vase life.</p>
        <p>The new flower should sell well, Mr. Gilbert said. "This particular chrysanthemum is known as 'Moneymaker' in the profession because of its very desirable agronomic characteristics," he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, experts say, the robust health of the biotechnology industry itself, particularly in the area of drug research, is based upon the same principle that motivates the creation of a white chrysanthemum.</p>
        <p>"When you win, the win is enormous," said Bernard Tenenbaum, director of the George Rothman Institute of Entrepreneurial Studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison. "The biotech business is a waiting game. But the problems they're trying to solve are so big and so fundamental to society that the nurturing of the bioscience industry represents future investment returns on a tremendous scale." A Magnet for Capital</p>
        <p>The biotechnology industry, Mr. Tenenbaum said, has been a magnet for huge infusions of venture capital despite investor caution inspired by the current recession.</p>
        <p>"There are lots of venture people who love this business," he said.  "They might put a million or two million in for 30 percent of a company that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars."</p>
        <p>The increasing number of new biotechnology companies in New Jersey, Mr. Tenenbaum said, while partly a result of investor interest, is also a result of the high concentration of pharmaceutical companies in the state. Occasionally, he said, the "research" portion of a drug company's "research and development" suddenly becomes a new biotechnology company.</p>
        <p>One example, he said, is Celgene, a Warren-based biotechnology company that was created by the Celanese Corporation in 1986.</p>
        <p>"Celgene makes bags of bugs," Mr. Tenenbaum said. "They make microbes that scrub pollutants." Converting Hazardous Waste</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas B. Lewis, vice president of the company, said that while Celgene did not produce bugs in the conventional sense, the company had developed a system that used live microorganisms to convert hazardous industrial waste into harmless byproducts.</p>
        <p>"We have demonstrated a biological reactor system that converts methylene chloride, a suspected carcinogen, into carbon dioxide, water and salt," Dr. Lewis said, referring to a demonstration of the system conducted in cooperation with General Electric. About 400 million pounds of methylene chloride is produced and used by industry each year, D.r. Lewis said.</p>
        <p>The microorganisms in Celgene's biological reactor system, he said, are naturally occurring ones that have been selected to degrade the man-made chemical efficiently.</p>
        <p>The water produced by the system is so clean, Dr. Lewis said, that it could meet Federal drinking water standards. Another Approach on Waste</p>
        <p>Another company that is using genetic engineering to treat hazardous waste is Envirogen in Lawrenceville.  Unlike Celgene's biological reactor system, which treats hazardous waste before it leaves the factory, Envirogen's technology focuses on biologically degrading hazardous materials like chlorinated solvents and PCB's that have already entered the waste stream.</p>
        <p>Roger J. Colley, president of the two-year-old company, said Envirogen, in addition to working with natural organisms that will be introduced for commercial application this year, was using the common bacteria E. coli as a living factory to create genetically modified microorganisms. Those microorganisms, he said, are specifically designed to biodegrade certain toxic chemicals that have been introduced into the environment.</p>
        <p>The company, Mr. Colley said, like other young biotech companies in New Jersey and elsewhere, will spend a great deal of time, money and effort before it actually has a product it can sell.</p>
        <p>"It's a slow, cautious process before we get to the use of these organisms in the field," he said. "We don't know whether it's two years or 10 years down the road."</p>
