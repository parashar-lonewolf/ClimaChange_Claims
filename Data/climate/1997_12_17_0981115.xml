        <p>Following are excerpts from President Clinton's press conference at the State Department today, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private transcription company.</p>
        <p>On Aid to Other Countries</p>
        <p>Q. Three weeks ago, in Vancouver, you said that the economic chaos in Asia was just a glitch in the road. But the currency turmoil continues, and South Korea says that it needs a faster I.M.F. bailout. What -- how serious is this crisis for Americans? And will you go along with the additional funds that the I.M.F. says it needs?</p>
        <p>A. Well, first of all, the American economy is strong, and the new numbers on low inflation, coupled with the very high rate of business investments, show that we have a significant capacity to continue to grow from within.</p>
        <p>Now having said that, as I have repeatedly pointed out to our people, a significant part of our growth comes from our ability to sell to others around the world, including in Asia. And so it is very much in our interest to do what we can to support the Asian economies. . . .</p>
        <p>On the Middle East</p>
        <p>Q. How long are you willing to tolerate Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the United States and of the United Nations?</p>
        <p>A. Saddam Hussein has been in defiance of the United Nations since the end of the Gulf war. That's why we have a system of sanctions on him. And I am willing to maintain the sanctions as long as he does not comply with the resolutions.</p>
        <p>If you're asking me, are there other options that I might consider taking under certain circumstances, I wouldn't rule out anything. I never have, and I won't.</p>
        <p>But I think it's important that you remember, since the end of the Gulf war, the world community has known that he was interested in not only rebuilding his conventional military authority, but that he was interested in weapons of mass destruction, and a set of sanctions was imposed on him.</p>
        <p>There are those that would like to lift the sanctions. I am not among them. I am not in favor of lifting sanctions until he complies. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. As you pointed out, it seems like maybe about a half-hour or 45 minutes ago -- every time Saddam Hussein seems to be close to winning, perhaps getting the U.N. sanctions eased, he does something that might be considered less than rational. As the commander-in-chief who has to weigh options that will inevitably affect the lives of young Americans, how do you assess your opponent? How do you assess Saddam Hussein?  Is he less than rational? And not to put too fine a point on it, are you persuaded that he's not simply crazy?</p>
        <p>A. Well, if he is, he's clever crazy, on occasion, and then sometimes he does something that seems maddeningly stupid. In this case, I think he has made a calculated decision here that other countries wanted to do business with him; that he -- that he owed money to other countries from before the Gulf war that he couldn't pay and never would be able to pay unless he could do more business; that the war is fading into memory, you know, it's not eminent now; and that the burden of maintaining the sanctions had wearied many of those with responsibility for doing so; and that there might be a way to split the alliance here.</p>
        <p>I also think he knew that the suffering of the Iraqi people is something which has touched the hearts of the whole world, and he thought it was a card he could play. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. A few weeks ago, the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, was in the United States, and you and he were in Los Angeles at exactly the same time; in fact, your planes were both on the tarmac at LAX as you were getting ready to leave, but you refused to meet with him. He later said in an interview that you, in effect, were not only snubbing him, but you were humiliating or embarrassing the state of Israel, the people of Israel. . . .</p>
        <p>A. First of all, let's put the record straight here. Mr. Netanyahu has been in office only a year and a half, and we have had five meetings. I don't believe I have ever met with any other world leader five times within an 18-month period. So there can be no serious suggestion that the United States is not interested in the peace process or respectful of the people and Government of Israel. We have had five meetings. Secondly, I expect that we will have a meeting early next year, a sixth meeting, to discuss where we are and where we're going.</p>
        <p>Q. A question about Iran, you said this week you were looking forward to an honest dialogue with Iran. Can you tell us how and when that dialogue might begin? And also, given that the United States has not been able to enlist a single other country to help us in our effort to isolate Iran economically, to join in the embargo, do you still think that policy is effective, or are you willing to rethink it?</p>
        <p>A. Well, let me answer the questions in order, but in reverse order. On our embargo, I think it is the right thing to do. And it will have varying degrees of effectiveness, depending upon how much other people are willing to work with us.</p>
        <p>But I think that the voters in Iran, when they made the selection of the current president, seemed to be sending a signal that they wanted a more open society. And I was quite encouraged by his remarks. But -- so that I'm not sure you can say that our policy has been in error. I certainly think it is right, whether it is supported or not. . . .</p>
        <p>I have always said, from the beginning, that I thought it was tragic that the United States was separated from the people of Iran. It's a country with a great history that at various times has been quite close to the United States. We have had the privilege of educating a number of people from Iran over several decades, indeed, some people in the present Government were able to get some of their education in the United States.  And Americans have been greatly enriched by Iranian, by Persian culture, from the beginning of our country.</p>
        <p>We have three issues that we think have to be discussed in the context of any comprehensive discussion. The first relates to Iranian support of terrorist activities, with which we strongly disagree. The second relates to Iranian opposition to the peace process in the Middle East, with which we disagree. And the third relates to policies involving the development of weapons of mass destruction. . . .</p>
        <p>In terms of terrorism, I think the United States must maintain an uncompromising stand there. We would not expect any Islamic state in effect to say it had no opinions on issues involving what it would take to have a just and lasting peace settlement in the Middle East. We would never ask any country to give up its opinions on that. But we would ask every country to give up the support, the training, the arming, the financing of terrorism.</p>
        <p>On Bosnia</p>
        <p>Q. Will you care to share with us how will you characterize responsibilities of Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo in Bosnia, among Bosnians and Serbs and Croats, and responsibilities of your own and the international community?</p>
        <p>A. I think that all of us should support the Dayton accords, the Dayton process, and should do nothing to undermine it and do whatever we can to support it.</p>
        <p>Now, when the Croats, for example, supported the turning over of some Bosnian Croats who were indicted for war crimes recently, I thought that was a very positive thing. Now, they'll all have difficult moments when it comes to relocation of people into areas where they'll be the minority, and there are a lot of difficulties ahead.</p>
        <p>But Belgrade, Sarajevo and, of course, Zagreb, all of them have the responsibility to support Dayton. They said they'd support it. They signed off on it, and that's what they ought to do.</p>
        <p>On Race Relations</p>
        <p>Q. Reports from the front lines of your race initiative suggest that the initiative is in chaos, it is confused, the Akron Town Meeting was a little more than ''Presidential Oprah.'' Some people involved are beginning to ----</p>
        <p>A. That may be your editorial comment, that's not my reports. I've received scores of letters, including letters from ordinary people who said that they loved it and they thought it was important. So ----</p>
        <p>Q. Well, there ----</p>
        <p>A. If that's your opinion, state your opinion.  But ---- but ----</p>
        <p>Q. It's an opinion, sir, that I'm hearing from others who are beginning to question whether simply ----</p>
        <p>A. Who are they? Name one. Just one. Give me a name. I think all this ''other'' stuff -- you know, it's confusing to the American people when they hear all these anonymous sources ----</p>
        <p>Keep in mind, this is the first time -- as I said in my opening statement, this is the first time ever that our country has tried to deal with its racial divergence in the absence of a crisis. We don't have a civil war, we don't have the aftermath of civil war, we don't have big fights over Jim Crow, we don't have riots in the streets. We have a country that is emerging as an ever-more divergent, diverse democracy. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. As the national dialogue on race gains momentum, the one-year anniversary seems to near, and how are you going to pull apart the issue of race reconciliation and affirmative action that seems to be cross-tied? And will you extend the race initiative beyond this year to the end of your term?</p>
        <p>A. Well, in some senses, this whole initiative has been a part of my administration from the beginning, because it permeates so much else of what we tried to do and what we're trying to do. With regard to affirmative action, I think that's an ongoing process.</p>
        <p>My reading of the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the Court of Appeals ruling that the California vote abolishing affirmative action was in fact not unconstitutional, that it was permissible for the voters to vote in the way that they did under the Constitution, my reading of the Supreme Court's decision there is that they were saying that we're going to allow this matter to be resolved in the political process; that is that affirmative acts of discrimination are illegal. What should be done to root out the vestiges of discrimination are to create a society in which people have more or less the same chance to succeed without regard to their racial backgrounds, must be resolved in the political arena. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. The polls show that people support affirmative action, but not when it's known as racial preference. How do you get around this clash of language? And what do you think about the term racial preference?</p>
        <p>A. I agree -- I think people support affirmative action when you describe it. And then, if you call it racial preference they don't support it because it -- the way -- the words itself seem to inevitably mean that someone will get something, because of his or her race, for which he or she is not really qualified.</p>
        <p>Now, the problem, if you back off from it, is that we Americans believe in -- we believe in three things. We believe that the best qualified people ought to get what they're best qualified for. We believe everybody ought to have a chance. And we believe people that have had a hard time ought to have a hand up. If you took a survey, I believe over 80 percent of the people would say that: we believe that merit should prevail over pull, if you will, or privilege, we believe that everyone should have a chance, and we believe that people who have had a hard time ought to have a hand up. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. You touched on college admissions, and very early this year, you said you were quite concerned that some American universities, public universities in Texas and California in particular, were going to become resegregated. And you vowed to come up with some sort of plan to counter that. Have you come up with a plan? . . .</p>
        <p>A. What I said was that I wanted to look at what the alternatives were. I think that, you know, Texas has now adopted an alternative which I think will work apparently quite well for them for undergraduate schools, which is simply to say that the top 10 percent of every high school graduating class in Texas is eligible for admission to any public institution of higher education in Texas. But I think if you look at it, while I think it is an acceptable alternative, the critics will argue it's simply affirmative action in another form. But at least that's -- but it's a way of saying, ''Look, high schools are different, but the ability of children is not unevenly distributed. So we're going to -- we're going to give them a chance.'' . . .</p>
        <p>The other thing we're looking at is trying to support more college efforts and actually identifying young people in schools with the promise of going to college who have a difficult situation, and trying to work with them over a period of a few years to make sure that when they come to take the college exams, that they are fully prepared to do so and much more likely to succeed.</p>
        <p>On Taxes and the Economy</p>
        <p>Q. Speaking of what will happen in 1998, some lawmakers are talking about giving Americans a tax cut next year. But there is a separate issue of fundamental tax reform; that is changing the tax code to a flat tax or a national sales tax or a greatly simplified progressive tax. Do you believe that the time has come to seriously consider fundamental tax reform?</p>
        <p>A. You mentioned two things, so let me try to respond to both of them. First of all, on the whole tax-cut front, there has been some talk about that by some lawmakers who say that now we have a surplus, and therefore, we should spend it in part, at least, with a tax cut. And by that, they mean one of two things. They mean we have a projected surplus at the end of this budget period, or they mean that the deficit is lower now than it was projected to be last August, when I signed the balanced budget bill.</p>
        <p>But it's important that the American people understand we don't have a surplus yet; we have a deficit. It's over 90 percent smaller than it was when I took office. It was at 290 billion and now it's at 23 billion. That is not a surplus. This economy is the strongest it's been in a generation because of the discipline that we've been able to bring to the task of bringing the deficit down and getting our house in order. We should not lightly abandon that discipline . . . .</p>
        <p>On Vice President Al Gore</p>
        <p>Q. He apparently was your -- is your heir apparent, and he's been very loyal to you.  But he seems to the target of a nationally well-organized campaign, on the part of the Democrats and Republicans, to knock him out and fix it so that he will be so scandalized that he can't even run for President after you're gone. Now, what do you think about the way these people are acting, especially the Democrats?</p>
        <p>A. As for the Vice President himself, he needs no defense from me. I have simply said, and I will say again, what everyone knows. He's had the most full partnership with the President of any Vice President in history, and he has performed superbly; whether it was on the environment or on energy initiatives, or on helping us downsize the Government by 300,000 and increase the Government's output, or on the foreign-policy issues like Russia and South Africa.  He has done a superb job. . . .</p>
        <p>On the F.B.I. Director</p>
        <p>Q. The attorney general has rendered her judgment, and the F.B.I. has dissented from that judgment as to the appointment of a special counsel. On several occasions your spokesman has declined to express full confidence in the F.B.I. Director. Have you lost confidence in Director Freeh? Is it because of his dissent? And is that fair, sir?</p>
        <p>A. First of all, his decision to dissent in that case has no effect on whatever opinion I have of him. I think he should be -- I think that the attorney general runs the Justice Department the way I try to run the White House, which is I want to hear what people's opinions are.</p>
        <p>But on this confidence business, I think there's been too much back and forth on that, and I don't want to get into it. . . .</p>
        <p>On 1998 and Beyond</p>
        <p>A. When I came here, I was trying to just prove America could work again. I just wanted the country to work again. I wanted to get the economy going, I wanted to deal with social problems like crime and welfare, and I wanted to pull the country together. I want to see us spend the next three years fleshing out that agenda.</p>
        <p>But now is a time that we should be looking at the long-term problems of the country, the long-term challenges. That's why this environmental issue of climate change is so important. Every environmental challenge we have met in the last 30 years we have proved we could grow the economy and preserve the environment.  We've got to deal with it here.</p>
        <p>That's why the education issues and setting up excellence and lifetime learning are so important, because we will not be able to protect all Americans from the global changes that are taking place unless we do that. That's why it's important to deal with the entitlements challenge, because we have to honor the good that has been done by Social Security and Medicare for retirees, and let more people do more for their own retirement as well, and do it in a way that doesn't bankrupt their children when we baby boomers retire. . . .</p>
