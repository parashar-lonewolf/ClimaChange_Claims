        <p>Met Opera Gets $10 Million Gift  A $10 million gift to the Metropolitan Opera, announced yesterday, will enable the company to finance new productions in the next four years and support the appearance of world-renowned stars. Of the $10 million given by the Annenberg Foundation to meet the Met's artistic goals through the 2009-10 season, $7.4 million will go toward new productions; $1.6 million will be dedicated to the establishment of the Annenberg Principal Artists Fund to underwrite the performances of two to four singers during each of the four seasons beginning with 2006-7; and the rest will cover the production costs of the Met's 40th anniversary gala celebration, which took place on Tuesday to commemorate its tenure at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
        <p>Tribeca Festival  Former Vice President Al Gore, below, will serve as host when the 12-day Tribeca Film Festival opens on April 25 with seven short films presented under the auspices of S.O.S., the campaign behind the international Live Earth concerts scheduled for July 7 to draw attention to global warming. The short films also focus on the climate. The sixth annual Tribeca Film Festival will close on May 6 with ''The Gates,'' a documentary by Antonio Ferrera and Albert Maysles about the 26-year Jean-Claude and Christo project that ended in 2005 with the installation of 7,500 fabric-paneled gates in Central Park.</p>
        <p>Coke Protests Jesus Film  A protest by the Coca-Cola Company of a movie scene depicting Jesus drinking a can of Coke in the desert has prompted an Italian distributor to postpone the opening of the film, scheduled for today -- Good Friday, Variety.com reported. Starring Luca Ward, the film is ''7 KM da Gerusalemme'' (''Seven Kilometers From Jerusalem''), based on an Italian best seller about an ad executive from Milan whose midlife crisis sends him on a pilgrimage to the present-day Holy Land. There, in the desert near the biblical Emmaus, he gives Jesus a ride in his jeep, hands him a Coke and, while Jesus is alleviating his thirst, says, ''My God, what a testimonial!'' In a letter to the producers, Graziano Prota and Angelo Seconda, Coca-Cola demanded that the scene be cut, saying that it was likely to give Coca-Cola a negative image and that the use of the brand was unauthorized. ''We are not interested in this kind of product placement,'' said a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Italia. The distributor, Mediafilm, pulled the film, and Artika, which co-produced it with RAI Cinema, said that unless it can persuade Coca-Cola's lawyers to change their position, it will have to re-edit the film and be unable to release it until the end of the month.</p>
        <p>'Concert for Diana' Broadcasts  NBC and VH1 will broadcast the ''Concert for Diana,'' a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, scheduled to take place in London at the new Wembley Stadium on July 1, which would have been her 46th birthday, Reuters reported. Among the performers at the event, a benefit for charity, will be Elton John, above, and her favorite band, Duran Duran.</p>
        <p>Ensemble Studio Theater Has New Artistic Director  The Ensemble Studio Theater, the influential 25-year-old Off Off Broadway theater that was founded and run by Curt Dempster until his death in January, has named a new producing artistic director. He is William Carden, who was the artistic director of the HB Playwrights Foundation and Theater from 1994 to 2006 and acted in and directed plays at the Ensemble, where he was a member and served on the board until 1994. Kristin Chenoweth, Jane Krakowski, right, Marian Seldes, Tony Roberts and Huey Lewis are among the performers scheduled to appear at ''Don't Quit Your Night Job,'' an after-hours revue put together by Broadway actors, which will begin a run on April 26 at the Ha! Comedy Club at 163 West 46th Street in Times Square. Ron Livingston (of the film ''Office Space'' and the television series ''Standoff'') and Jason Patric (''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' on Broadway) will star in ''In a Dark Dark House,'' Neil LaBute's latest play for MCC Theater, scheduled to being performances at the Lucille Lortel Theater on May 16.</p>
        <p>Playboy Indonesia Editor Acquitted  An Indonesian court found the editor of Playboy Indonesia not guilty of indecency yesterday, angering conservative Muslims who have been fighting to shut down the magazine since its first appearance last year. The prosecution argued that Erwin Arnada, below, the magazine's editor, was guilty of indecency for selling pictures of women and sought a jail term of more than two years. But the presiding judge, Erfan Basuning, said the arguments did not hold up against laws passed in 1998 guaranteeing freedom of the press. ''This is not only a victory for Playboy, this is a victory for all of the press in Indonesia,'' said Mr. Arnada in an interview. The months-long trial highlighted growing divisions between a rising conservative movement and the majority moderate Muslim population. Hundreds of conservative Muslims, most of whom belong to the Islamic Defender's Front, a hard-line organization that has led the fight against Playboy, protested outside the courtroom during the verdict. Hundreds of police officers were stationed nearby. Playboy Indonesia, published monthly since last April, contains no nude photos, only scantily clad women and articles about Indonesian politics and culture. Far racier magazines are available in all of Indonesia's major cities.</p>
