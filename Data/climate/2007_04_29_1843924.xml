        <p>Public Service Electric and Gas has said it will lend nearly $100 million to customers to install solar panels over the next two years, hoping to reduce pollution and move residents across the state toward cleaner fuel.</p>
        <p>The initiative meets goals outlined in New Jersey's energy master plan and will be available to all P.S.E.&amp;G. customers by the end of this year, if the State Board of Public Utilities gives its approval.

        <p>Public Service Electric and Gas has said it will lend nearly $100 million to customers to install solar panels over the next two years, hoping to reduce pollution and move residents across the state toward cleaner fuel.</p>
        <p>The initiative meets goals outlined in New Jersey's energy master plan and will be available to all P.S.E.&amp;G. customers by the end of this year, if the State Board of Public Utilities gives its approval. The plan calls for 20 percent of the state's power to be fueled by renewable energy by 2020.</p>
        <p>New Jersey also provides incentives, including rebates and tax credits, for solar installations.</p>
        <p>P.S.E.&amp;G. said its program would most likely produce about 30 megawatts of solar power by 2010 -- enough energy to serve about 24,000 homes and, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to removing 3,700 cars from the road.</p>
        <p>''Climate change is a reality that needs to be addressed now,'' Ralph Izzo, the chairman of P.S.E.&amp;G., said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, P.S.E.&amp;G. would lend $100 million to solar panel installers, covering up to half of the cost of projects, which is to be repaid with interest over 15 years. The remaining cost of installation would be covered by homeowners, businesses or municipalities, who can receive a federal investment tax credit.</p>
        <p>''This represents the beginning of a new relationship between the renewable community and utilities,'' said Thomas Leyden, the president of the Mid-Atlantic Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.</p>
