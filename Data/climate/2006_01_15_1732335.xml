        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki has a plan to eliminate the state's $2 billion surplus. And then some.</p>
        <p>But as the governor prepares to unveil his 12th and final budget proposal on Tuesday, many lawmakers are asking whether he will offer a plan meant to score political points on a national stage or to provide a sound blueprint for managing New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, who is considering a long shot presidential run, faces an emboldened Legislature that increasingly views him as a lame duck.</p>
        <p>He is caught between the Republican Senate leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who has called for no new taxes of any kind in the budget, and the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who wants far more spending on public schools in New York City, to comply with a court order -- an order the governor has chosen to appeal.</p>
        <p>Both sides of the Legislature are likely to resist his plan, announced on Friday, to cut more than $1 billion in Medicaid costs. And a surplus, after years of deficits, gives lawmakers money to spend and to fight over.</p>
        <p>All sides, however, have something to gain in an election year from passing a second consecutive budget on time; decades of tardiness made the words ''Albany'' and ''dysfunction'' political synonyms.</p>
        <p>Further, Mr. Pataki appears to be shaping a budget with fewer controversial measures than in the past and with nuggets for all political stripes, buffing his résumé as the kind of Republican who can win over a heavily Democratic state.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mr. Pataki said on Jan. 4 in his State of the State address, his agenda will be ''a clear-cut, forward-looking approach to meeting some of our greatest challenges.''</p>
        <p>For conservatives, he is expected to propose at least $3 billion worth of tax cuts in a budget of roughly $110 billion, though much of the tab would be left to his successor.</p>
        <p>For instance, $1.1 billion worth of tax cuts aimed at businesses, proposed in recent days, would not fully phase in until the fiscal year that ends in March 2009. In the coming fiscal year, the business cuts would reduce state revenues by $176 million.</p>
        <p>His other tax plans include cuts of about $1.1 billion, through the elimination of the state's portion of the estate tax and the so-called marriage penalty. The structure of the tax code has many married couples with two incomes paying higher taxes than they would pay if they were not married.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki will also propose a $500 heating fuel tax credit for the elderly, a rebate on school property taxes and lower income taxes for middle-class families.</p>
        <p>On Medicaid, the largest single item in the budget at nearly $50 billion, Mr. Pataki's aides said he would propose $1.3 billion in cuts and new savings, along with a plan to attack rampant fraud in the program.</p>
        <p>The cuts include large items, like requiring hospitals and nursing homes to cover inflation, and smaller ones, like eliminating most of the $14.9 million the system spends on prescriptions for Viagra and other drugs taken for erectile dysfunction. The new prescription plan that is part of Medicare is expected to save the state nearly $250 million.</p>
        <p>But the proposed cuts are largely offset by an additional $1.1 billion the state must pay this year because of new caps on how much localities contribute to the Medicaid system.</p>
        <p>Many ideas will come from the Albany archives.</p>
        <p>Want to buy a bridge? As he did last year, Mr. Pataki is expected to propose privatizing the Tappan Zee Bridge in some form, to finance what will be a costly rebuilding project.</p>
        <p>The governor will also propose further conversion of nonprofit health insurers into profit-making companies, following the state's $4 billion windfall from the conversion of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>
        <p>To bolster his crime-fighting bona fides, Mr. Pataki is proposing a $130 million mental health detention center where some sex offenders could be housed after they finish their sentences.</p>
        <p>He also has a host of environmental and education proposals among billions of dollars of new spending, from money to encourage gas stations to offer alternative fuels, to free tuition for math and science students at public universities who agree to teach in the state.</p>
        <p>His environmental proposals are aimed at attacking oil consumption and global warming, topics that many Republican politicians shun.</p>
        <p>There is also financing for cultural institutions, including $15 million for the Lincoln Center's redevelopment plan along West 65th Street.</p>
        <p>To provide money for health care programs, Mr. Pataki will propose increasing the tax on a pack of cigarettes to $2.50 from $1.50 everywhere except in New York City, which already has a $3 tax because the city itself levies $1.50. The move is expected to bring the state $260 million more in tax proceeds.</p>
        <p>Policymakers on both sides of the aisle say that how much of Mr. Pataki's agenda is enacted depends on whether he wants to leave town fighting or hugging, and on the willingness of lawmakers to compromise.</p>
        <p>Referring to the proposals aired so far, Mr. Silver, one of the governor's sharpest critics, said in a statement, ''Is he laying the foundation for our future or for a campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire?''</p>
        <p>But a fellow Democratic assemblyman, Richard N. Gottfried, the co-chairman of a budget conference committee that last year dealt with Medicaid, said, ''I think there's a high likelihood of an on-time budget.''</p>
        <p>''It's in everyone's interests,'' Mr. Gottfried added. ''I expect the fiscal situation will be easier than it has been in most previous years, and I think we found last year that when we did the budget on time, things worked out very well.''</p>
        <p>Not that he, or others, likes the health care cuts.</p>
        <p>''This would be utterly devastating,'' said Jennifer Cunningham, an executive vice president of the health care workers' union S.E.I.U./1199, referring to proposals to cut $163 million in Medicaid funds from hospitals and $233 million from nursing homes, with the actual costs to the institutions higher because of the loss of matching funds.</p>
        <p>''There's no way many of them can absorb these and stay open,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Pataki, clearly the top priority is tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Critics on the left say that cuts like the estate tax are gifts to the well-to-do. E.J. McMahon, a budget expert at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group, said Mr. Pataki had made progress cutting taxes, but not enough.</p>
        <p>He cited figures from the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, showing that New York's combined state and local tax burden went from 13.7 percent of all income earned in the state in 1994, the highest among the states, to 12 percent last year, second highest.</p>
        <p>While there has been significant cutting, ''the bad news,'' Mr. McMahon said, ''is that we've plummeted all the way from one to two.''</p>
        <p>And the new cuts would be little more than symbolic proposals, he added, if they largely take effect after Mr. Pataki's term ends and lead to substantial shortfalls.</p>
        <p>John Cape, the state budget director, said on Friday that the budget proposal would not cause excessive deficits in coming years, calling the future gaps ''very manageable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno, the Senate leader, took a hard line this week, saying, ''There is simply no reason to propose any tax increases.''</p>
        <p>But a cigarette tax increase has its ardent advocates.</p>
        <p>Russell Sciandra, director of the Center for a Tobacco-Free New York, said it would push many people to quit smoking.</p>
        <p>''One dollar tax increase, $95 million for tobacco prevention programs,'' he said, mentioning another expected budget proposal. ''It's Christmas.''</p>
