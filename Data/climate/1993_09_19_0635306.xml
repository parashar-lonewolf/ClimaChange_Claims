        <p>21ST CENTURY CAPITALISM By Robert Heilbroner. 175 pp. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. $17.95.</p>
        <p>IN economics as in other disciplines there are Big Thinkers (as Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in the field, once called John Kenneth Galbraith in what was not interpreted as a flattering comment). The big thinkers are contrasted with the numerous ranks of plodding little thinkers, content to work at establishing small truths.</p>
        <p>Robert Heilbroner is a big thinker and I admire him for it. Early in his distinguished career -- 40 years ago now -- Mr. Heilbroner gave us "The Worldly Philosophers," a remarkable tour de force on big thinkers in the history of economics, Adam Smith, Malthus, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter. In "21st Century Capitalism," an expanded version of lectures he gave last year at Massey College, co-sponsored by the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Mr. Heilbroner applies some of those economists' perceptions, and his own, to the question of where we are and where we may be going in the post-Communist world.</p>
        <p>And, perhaps too rare among economists, the rendering of these perceptions is in a style largely penetrable and pleasing to ordinary mortals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heilbroner does not really presume to predict much of our future. His is the more modest ambition of understanding the system in which we live and the principles of its development. Capitalism, which now seems well on the way to dominating the entire world, remains one of many systems that have existed in history, he reminds us, one that has evolved over some centuries and may be expected to continue to evolve. Among its salient characteristics "from the mid-19th century on" is a "sense of immanent change," which goes along with the notion of progress: we have seen vast improvements, and we have come to expect things to continue to get better. The "feelings of dismay that are so much part of our contemporary frame of mind," like the growing social alienation and political disaffection in the United States today that Mr. Heilbroner addresses only generally, he attributes to the sudden sense that life is no longer getting better and that we are seeing the first generation that does not live better than its parents.</p>
        <p>Going back to Adam Smith and his "celebration of a Society of Perfect Liberty," Mr. Heilbroner identifies the separation of the economy and the state as central to capitalism and "the division of power between two realms" as indispensable to "the state of explicit political liberty we loosely call 'democracy.' " He also notes important failings of capitalism: its inability to guarantee jobs for all who want them or to handle "externalities" -- the effects of economic activities on those other than the people undertaking them, for example "the higher laundry bills and health costs of people living in Pittsburgh before the pollution of the steel mills was brought under control."</p>
        <p>"Negative externalities," particularly the pollution of our land, water and air by private enterprises operating by methods that entail the least cost to them, cry out for public, that is, government, intervention, whether in the form of taxes, subsidies or (at worst) regulation. But in arguing that global warming calls for major government planning over the next century, Mr. Heilbroner may inadvertently confirm the danger of government action. Many, such as the historian Paul Kennedy, whom Mr. Heilbroner cites at some length, do see "good reason to worry about global warming." But some leading economists, like Thomas Schelling, have denounced unfounded worry that could push politicians into costly misguided ventures. The scope, if not the existence, of the problem remains, after all, a matter of serious scientific inquiry. Global warming may be one of those issues that does now justify another study commission, but perhaps no further intervention in the market.</p>
        <p>As for full employment, Mr. Heilbroner explains why capitalism lacks a smoothly functioning automatic mechanism to guarantee it. In what was in a sense a fundamental, radical attack, Keynes rejected the classical notion that falling wages would lead employers to increase hiring or that lower interest rates would always generate enough business investment to keep the economy prosperous and provide for our future. Yet, as Mr. Heilbroner points out, in showing the way to solve the problem by government spending -- and, yes, budget deficits -- Keynes gave capitalism critical new support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heilbroner regrets the erosion of employment goals, which he relates to fear of inflation: public investment may increase employment, but it can raise prices as well. He is undoubtedly right that fear of inflation, particularly by powerful financial interests with the ear of the Federal Reserve, has inhibited Government action against unemployment. But it is a pity that Mr. Heilbroner seems to suggest that inflation is likely to prove a real problem that might properly limit Government action to create more jobs.</p>
        <p>THERE has, in fact, been little inflation in United States history, aside from wars and supply shocks like those related to oil prices, and they have little to do with government spending; we clearly have little or no inflation now. I doubt, too, that the demands of organized labor have had much to do with inflation in this country -- their membership now covers less than 20 percent of the work force. I doubt, further, that having union representatives sit on corporate boards, which Mr. Heilbroner suggests, would help promote noninflationary growth. And his recommended checks on inflationary tendencies -- increases in sales taxes and the introduction of value-added taxes -- would reduce real purchasing power. But they would certainly raise prices as they raise costs.</p>
        <p>In his thoughtful and provocative conclusion Mr. Heilbroner proposes that the collapse of the Soviet system, hailed as a victory for human freedom, was also a defeat for human aspirations. The idea that socialism offered an opportunity to guide society to still greater progress suffered a crushing blow, leaving many without any alternative path that could be considered "up." In his prognosis for the 21st century, Mr. Heilbroner argues that some form of socialism should still be considered a possibility. "If, as seems likely, there is a threshold of necessary acquisitiveness to maintain the system's elan vital, so there is also a limit beyond which acquisitiveness no longer serves, and may well disserve, the adaptability of the order," he writes. "There is also a limit beyond which indifference turns into a dysfunctional social injustice."</p>
        <p>Mr. Heilbroner laments the failure of the United States Government to account separately for investment spending, as do private industry and almost all other governments. As President Clinton has tried to explain, without clear success, all "spending" is not the same. The crux of Mr. Heilbroner's argument is then this: capitalism is likely to remain the dominant social order as we enter the next millennium, and public investment, presumably in education, training and basic research as well as in infrastructure, and financed by both taxes and prudent borrowing, is the key to its success. One would be foolish to dismiss either proposition.</p>
