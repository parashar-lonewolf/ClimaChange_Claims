        <p>LEAD: Across a mountain range where East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland meet lies the bitter fallout from industrial schemes conceived in the Kremlin four decades ago.</p>
        <p>Across a mountain range where East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland meet lies the bitter fallout from industrial schemes conceived in the Kremlin four decades ago.</p>
        <p>Barren plateaus stretch for miles, studded with the stumps and skeletons of pine trees. Under the snow lie thousands of acres of poisoned ground, where for centuries thick forests had grown.</p>
        <p>This is the heart of Europe, the sick heart of Europe, its people call it. Below these mountains, in a broad belt from Leipzig in East Germany to Cracow in southern Poland and across northern Czechoslovakia, are the bulk of Eastern Europe's heavy industries. A phalanx of power plants stands beside them, spewing smoke heavy with sulfur and soot as they drive steel and chemical works and heat homes.</p>
        <p>Clouds of Brown Smoke</p>
        <p>In the rush to compete with the West, the three countries have stoked these plants with millions of tons of lignite, a geologically younger coal that is dirty, cheap and abundant here. (Just 10 percent of the coal mined and burned in the United States is lignite.) The hunt for cheap energy has come back to haunt the planners: the brown coal smoke and other noxious emissions have wreaked havoc on buildings, penetrated people's lungs and poured acid rain over farmlands and forests.</p>
        <p>As post-Communist Eastern Europe is taking stock of the impact of callous industrial rampage, at least a dozen cities in this grime belt are vying for the title of being Europe's most polluted place.</p>
        <p>''Basically we are seeing an ecological catastrophe,'' said Frantisek Urban, director of nature conservation in Czechoslovakia's eight-week-old Ministry of Environment.</p>
        <p>Where Forests Disappear</p>
        <p>While acid rain damage to forests from car and industrial exhausts all over Western Europe has been reported for more than a decade, forestry experts meeting in Prague last week said no other place had such an extent of forest deaths in central Europe's industrial belt. They cited a stretch of some 350 miles where more than 300,000 acres of forest had disappeared and surviving trees were so sick their life span would be short.</p>
        <p>Winds churn the sulfurous air around this ''Bermuda Triangle of pollution,'' as the foresters dubbed it, and carry this over long distances.</p>
        <p>With prevailing winds blowing east, Czechs blame East Germans for half their pollution and Poles blame both neighbors for as much. Poland's fallout is also felt in the Ukraine and in Sweden.</p>
        <p>A trip along the crest of the Erz Mountains, at the Czechoslovak border with East Germany, and over the Riesen and Sudeten Mountains of southern Poland, illustrated the results of production pressures from Moscow. In village after village, foresters in Poland and Czechoslovakia said they had warned of the widespread deaths of trees for almost 20 years.</p>
        <p>Thick Brown Haze</p>
        <p>A thick brown haze hung over much of north Czechoslovakia, something people described as normal for eight months of the year. It took on the sting of tear gas between Usti and Chomutov on the edge of the vast brown coal basin of northern Bohemia. The basin maintains 10 power plants.</p>
        <p>In just the last few years, Czechs said the country had spent a fortune on Soviet desulfurization scrubbers. ''We were promised 80 percent efficiency, but they are continuously breaking down,'' Mr. Urban, in Prague, had lamented. ''When they work, they clean only 30 percent.''</p>
        <p>Usti, lying black in its own sticky soot, spews carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur and heavy metals from chemical, glass and cooking oil plants. Sulfur in the air here has been reported at 20 times the permissible level.</p>
        <p>Jaroslav Jirgle, who heads Usti's modest Research Institute for Forestry and Game Management, took a visitor through the region's bedraggled forests. These had been dense woods, known from the chronicles of the Napoleonic wars when Russian, French and Austrian armies clashed here.</p>
        <p>Pulling his coat against the winds of March, Mr. Jirgle pointed, mile after mile, to withered beeches, the thinned crowns of silver firs, stunted oaks, brush spruces and comb spruces looking ragged or nude.</p>
        <p>Conifers, exposed all year round, suffer most, said the forester, explaining that the emissions clog the pores of the needles, damage the wax, and interfere with their breathing. Trees that survived grew to less than a quarter of their healthy size and died early instead of living a normal 80 to 100 years.</p>
        <p>On top of the Erz Mountains, the undulating tablelands, now covered in snow, bore only stumps and barren stems as though a great fire had raged.</p>
        <p>Some experimental patches now bore seedlings of sitka spruce, a hardy North American type. ''Who knows if they can stand this,'' said Mr. Jirgle, explaining that down to the south were the plants of Litvinov and ahead lay Dresden and East Germany's industrial basin, which has 18 coal-fueled power plants.</p>
        <p>Beyond the forest death, the pollution has unchained a far more complex range of damage along the Erz, Riesen and Tatry Mountains.</p>
        <p>Alfred Shima, an agronomist at Usti, said soil in the region was extremely acid, with a pH between 4 and 3 - a point at which the aluminum trapped in the clay is released. Other specialists said the aluminum was poisoning the groundwater, killing tree and plant roots and filtering into drinking water.</p>
        <p>With the trees gone, birds of prey have disappeared, triggering a plague of mountain mice. The large mice are chewing up the seedlings.</p>
        <p>The harshest side effect, specialists said, is the near disastrous change in the water budget. In dense forests, the snow used to melt slowly and trickle into creeks and rivers. Now, on the barren sites and in balder forests, it melts with the first sunshine and rushes down in three weeks, causing erosion and flooding in spring and water shortages in the summer.</p>
        <p>No Longer a State Secret</p>
        <p>Experts at the Prague meeting, attended by foresters from six East European nations, said quantifying the damage was difficult. Forest resources for many years were treated as a state secret, they said. Dead forests have been entered into the records as grasslands, and researchers often depend on the memory of local people.</p>
        <p>Hungary reported the least damage, with 75 percent of its forests unaffected. In Bulgaria, more than half the forest was still completely healthy. East Germany reported the loss of more than 125,000 acres of woodlands as well as some damage in 35 percent of its forests and severe damage in 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Acid rain has killed as much forest in Poland as in East Germany, and almost 60 percent of the pine forests are affected. Czechoslovakia, Europe's worst case, reportedly lost more than 80,000 acres and suffers some pollution damage in 44 percent and more serious damage in close to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>The Czech Academy of Science says the famous forests of North Bohemia are more than 80 percent damaged.</p>
        <p>Jerzy Wawrzonizk of the Forest Reserves Institute in Warsaw, said Poland and the Central European countries should immediately reduce forest cutting, stop exporting altogether and plant new species because mixed forests are hardier.</p>
        <p>Even if emissions were to stop now, specialists say it will take years and millions of dollars to rehabilitate the soils and the woodlands. Czechoslovakia has been using helicopters to spray lime on its most acid soils, a technique others criticized as costly and too much of a shock therapy.</p>
        <p>''The acidification has built up over 25 years,'' said Karl Panzer of the West German Federal Research Center for Forestry, who has studied damage in the industrial belt. ''It will be hard to roll back. Rehabilitation has to start with plants that can survive in poisoned soil, and that is very difficult.''</p>
        <p>Some experts say it will be so costly to outfit the old power plants and industries with scrubbers that it is worth building new ones.</p>
        <p>Even the new environment-minded politicians say the emissions are likely to go on for 5 to 10 years until remedies or new and cleaner sources of energy are in place.</p>
        <p>''At least we can discuss it openly now,'' said Mr. Urban at the Prague Environment Ministry. ''For many years we could not publish that forests were dying. We could only say that some of it was in danger.''  UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST</p>
