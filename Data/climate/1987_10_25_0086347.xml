        <p>LEAD: Vermont's marijuana growers, stung by police raids and irked by hikers and hunters who pick their buds, are increasingly cultivating the illegal weed indoors or resorting to guerrilla farming tactics, according to the police and other experts.</p>
        <p>Vermont's marijuana growers, stung by police raids and irked by hikers and hunters who pick their buds, are increasingly cultivating the illegal weed indoors or resorting to guerrilla farming tactics, according to the police and other experts.</p>
        <p>The police say that some growers are using silent alarms, trip wires and videocameras around their plots and are planting their crops in random patterns to make them undetectable by air. Violence resulting from drug disputes is also said to be increasing.</p>
        <p>As a result, the authorities are confiscating fewer marijuana plants and arresting fewer growers.</p>
        <p>In 1985, the first year Vermont received a Federal grant for fighting marijuana farming, the police uprooted 26,953 plants and arrested 76 people. In 1986, the numbers dropped to 4,746 plants and 63 arrests. Through September of this year, state police officers and local sheriffs uprooted 2,725 plants and made 43 arrests. 'They Are Getting Wiser'</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Bitcon, the sheriff of Caledonia County and head of the state's Sheriff Marijuana Investigation Team Effort, said the growers ''are feeling our presence in the state to the point you won't find large fields of marijuana,''</p>
        <p>''They are growing it in small plots and hiding it,'' Sheriff Bitcon said. ''They plunk it all over the place. I think there is a certain amount of out-foxing being done. They are getting wiser to us.''</p>
        <p>Those on the other side of the law agree as well.</p>
        <p>Bram Frank, a Brattleboro resident who gives advice on growing marijuana in columns for the magazines High Times and Sinsemilla Tips, said growers in Vermont were panicked by the increasing number of flyovers by police airplanes and angry at the amount of marijuana stolen in the fields by people passing through. Eden Moves Indoors</p>
        <p>''Growers are moving indoors,'' Mr. Frank said. ''Probably in a couple of years, 80 percent of American cannabis will be grown indoors. Now it's between 25 and 50 percent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank, who said he grew marijuana in the past for research but does not grow it anymore, said the move indoors could bring bountiful harvests.</p>
        <p>''You walk into a grower's room and it's like 'Star Trek,' '' he said. Sensors tell the grower how much carbon dioxide is in the room, what nutrients are available and the range of acidity going into the plants. ''It's like a garden of Eden in these rooms,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Vermont's crackdown on marijuana growers three years ago followed similar efforts in Georgia and several western states. Vermont police officials and sheriffs say they were warned by their counterparts in the West to expect violence to rise correspondingly. Small Fraction Caught</p>
        <p>Deputy sheriffs, apparently mistaken for pilferers, were shot at this year in Greensboro; no one was hurt. A youth who tried to steal marijuana in Orleans County was held and beaten, according to the police. In the last three years, the authorities have seized 36 weapons in marijuana arrests.</p>
        <p>Despite the crackdown of the last three years, the authorities acknowledge that they are catching only a small fraction of the marijuana growers.</p>
        <p>And Jon Gettman, national director of the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws calls Vermont ''the jewel of the Northeast'' for marijuana growers because there is so much remote rural land available.</p>
        <p>''It's a cat and mouse game,'' Mr. Gettman said, ''and marijuana growers keep adjusting.''</p>
