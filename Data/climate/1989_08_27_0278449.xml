        <p>LEAD: F OUR PEOPLE GAZE at a steeple. A minister sees a religious monument. A mechanical engineer sees a balance of forces and materials. A psychoanalyst sees a Freudian symbol. The person who has to climb 70 steps to clean the belfry sees something else. The same object, but each observer has a different take, depending on his or her deformation professionelle.</p>
        <p>F OUR PEOPLE GAZE at a steeple. A minister sees a religious monument. A mechanical engineer sees a balance of forces and materials. A psychoanalyst sees a Freudian symbol. The person who has to climb 70 steps to clean the belfry sees something else. The same object, but each observer has a different take, depending on his or her deformation professionelle.</p>
        <p>Harrap's New Standard French and English Dictionary defines deformation professionnelle as ''professional idiosyncrasy; vocational bias.'' But Harrap's secondary definition - ''distortion of map projection, photographic image'' - hints at the term's broader meaning: a view of reality biased by one's profession.</p>
        <p>This phrase, which was brought to my attention by M. Picard of Montreal, is an example of foreign words, or a marriage of foreign and English words, that succinctly conjure up notions that would have required many more words if expressed only in English.</p>
        <p>Mangia-cake is an Italian-American hybrid for a person who, because of a privileged way of life, has no idea how tough life is for other people. Marie Antoinette is history's most celebrated mangia-cake.</p>
        <p>Jane Perkinson of White Plains learned about the word from a man who began his career as a high-school teacher and who rose through the ranks to become a vice president of a national vocational-education association. Exasperated by the humbugs and bureaucrats around him, he would exclaim: ''Those mangia-cakes! What do they know?''</p>
        <p>Just as a mangia-cake views the world through rose-tinted glasses, there is the type of person who knows only doom and gloom. According to the Hungarian-English Dictionary, sirvavigadas, for ''weeping-feasting,'' means ''taking one's pleasures tearfully.'' Robert K. Sarlos of Davis, Calif., a native speaker of Hungarian, says it is ''a characteristically Hungarian penchant for celebrating misery in an extravagant, nay spendthrift, manner.''</p>
        <p>If sirvavigadas is obvious, antsafa is a subtler ploy. Leonard Fox of Charleston, S. C., points out that Malagasy, the language spoken in Madagascar, has a word for a certain kind of verbal deception. Antsafa, according to A New Malagasy-English Dictionary, is the term for ''inquiries about things of which one is fully cognizant beforehand.''</p>
        <p>Every child recognizes this tactic when a parent asks what happened to the cookie jar. Spotting your spouse entering a motel with an affectionate stranger at 3 P.M., then casually asking over dinner how this afternoon's ''business meeting'' went, is antsafa. So is asking your competitor how sales are going when you know sales are bombing.</p>
        <p>The pleasure associated with displaying a new acquisition is one of the psychological pillars of the consumer society, yet there is no English equivalent of the Spanish word estrenar, which is inadequately translated as ''to premiere.''</p>
        <p>The Modern College Spanish and English Dictionary defines estrenar as to ''wear or use an item for the first time.'' Hollywood moguls premiere movies, Broadway playwrights premiere dramas, but when you finally purchase the car of your dreams and immediately drive to a friend's house, you are eager to estrenar it.</p>
        <p>''After learning the word and using it for several years in Latin America,'' writes Mary M. Stolzenbach of Vienna, Va., ''I missed it sorely.'' The word, she notes, is useful, because it ''leads into what we all want - admiration and congratulations. Here, we have to wait until someone (possibly) says, 'What a nice dress,' before we can preen ourselves.'' But in Latin America, one can say, ''I decided to estrenar this dress today,'' and people will know they are supposed to admire it.</p>
        <p>For a different angle on the human penchant for projecting delusions and declaring them real, consider the Russian word pokazukha, to describe the practice of boasting about nonexistent achievements. Although the word has not entered the Russian/English lexicon, the Manchester Guardian Weekly recently ran an article on the phenomenon. The author, Vitali Vitaliev, a Soviet journalist who clearly tests the boundaries of glasnost, cites pokazukha as ''one of the major causes of stagnation and social injustice.''</p>
        <p>The paradigm case of pokazukha, according to the Soviet journalist, is the collection of cardboard facades of nonexistent villages that Prince Grigory Potemkin built along the Volga to impress Catherine the Great. Mr. Vitaliev updated this history by describing the time Mikhail S. Gorbachev decided to visit the apartment of an ordinary Soviet citizen and was taken to one that looked comfortably plush.</p>
        <p>The Soviet leader was pleased to see the apparent prosperity of his hosts -until he finished his tea and saw the stamp of the Communist Party's Central Committee canteen on the bottom of his teacup. Incensed at this attempt at pokazukha, Mr. Gorbachev abruptly curtailed his visit. (A friend of Mr. Vitaliev's who lived in the same block later told him that the day before the Soviet leader's visit, he saw a truck deliver new furniture to the apartment; the day after the visit, the same truck removed the furniture.) Pokazukha is not limited to the Communist world. Cafes in London, Paris and New York are filled with self-described writers, artists and philosophers whose main activity is talking about the work they spend their time not doing. And politicians everywhere are notorious for proclaiming themselves champions of causes they didn't care about yesterday. The Cold and Warm</p>
        <p>Of It AMONG CLIMATOLO-gists, global warming is just one scenario for the unusual atmospheric changes that have been observed throughout the world. Those who accept the global-warming theory are said to take the warmist position.</p>
        <p>It is proper, as well, to speak of coldists. ''Earth's atmospheric temperature seemed to be cooling from the 1940's into the 1970's,'' explains Jesse H. Ausubel, an environmental scientist at New York's Rockefeller University. ''A number of climatologists suggested that the increasing emission of dust and particles into the atmosphere could lead to a new Ice Age. The coldists were in the ascendancy until the cooling trend reversed. In the 1980's, atmospheric temperature has been rising.''</p>
        <p>To complicate the issue, other climatologists believe both warmists and coldists fail to take into account the possibility that warming and cooling factors could balance each other, resulting in a more or less static climate. Asked whether these climatologists are known as staticists, Mr. Ausubel says that this camp does not yet have a name, but ''staticist is as good as any term.''</p>
        <p>Now, when someone inevitably raises the dog-days cliche ''Hot enough for you?'' you have a choice of possible replies, depending on whether you lean toward the warmist, coldist or staticist camp.</p>
