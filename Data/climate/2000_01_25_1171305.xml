        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton today compared the fund-raising tactics of Rudolph W. Giuliani to those of Senator Jesse Helms, and the New York mayor, in response, dared her to try to paint him as a right-wing extremist.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, the presumed candidates for the United States Senate, and their surrogates traded barbs throughout a day in which both of them passed through the state Capitol without crossing paths. For Mrs. Clinton, it was another chance to suggest that the mayor was too conservative for New York State.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, The New York Times reported that Mr. Giuliani's Senate  campaign had made extensive use of fund-raising mailings to conservatives in other states. The tone of the appeals was far more hostile toward Mrs. Clinton than were his mailings in New York State.</p>
        <p>''I think he's learned from people like Jesse Helms,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a morning appearance in White Plains, ''that you run some of these campaigns, these negative campaigns, out of state so that you can go around saying you're not doing it in- state and hope that nobody will catch you. That seems to be the pattern and it's been a pretty tried-and-true technique of the right-wing Republicans for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Asked about her comments here this evening, she said, ''I did not compare anyone to Jesse Helms,'' the North Carolina Republican. But then, citing press reports, she added that Mr. Giuliani was relying on mailing lists from ''far-right organizations'' and that the two-pronged mail campaign was ''a hallmark of what Senator Helms has done for years.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference with Gov. George E. Pataki, the mayor, laughing, said, ''She said it was part of a right-wing conspiracy, right?'' That was a reference to Mrs. Clinton's claim, early in the Lewinsky investigation, that there was a ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' against her husband.</p>
        <p>''You've got a right-wing conspiracy again,'' said Mr. Giuliani, who is generally regarded -- certainly by most Republicans -- as a moderate. ''That's going to be an interesting one to try to sell. Yogi Berra has an expression for that: 'deja vu all over again.' I'm a lot of things, but you're going to try to put that label on me, give it a try. We'll see if that one doesn't backfire.''</p>
        <p>The mayor was here for his annual remarks to the Legislature about the state budget, while Mrs. Clinton came at the invitation of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver for a private question-and-answer session with Democratic lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's fellow Republicans, the governor and Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, accused Mrs. Clinton of trying to upstage the mayor. ''There's no question in my mind that the fact that the first lady chose today to come is because she doesn't want people to hear the positive message of the successful record of Mayor Giuliani,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Silver had arranged the visit and said, ''At last count, I've been in upstate New York in the last six months more than 30 times, and I've never run into the mayor on any of those trips.''</p>
        <p>After her meeting, several Democratic legislators said they were gravely concerned about the state of her campaign, with Mrs. Clinton trailing in public opinion surveys and fund-raising. Some lawmakers from New York City, usually the most fertile ground for a Democrat, said they thought that the mayor would win their districts.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, at a restaurant in White Plains, Mrs. Clinton, a new resident of nearby Chappaqua, gave  the most detailed description to date of her environmental agenda, in a speech before a mostly sympathetic audience of 100 people invited by  groups including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.</p>
        <p>She said she would vote to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty calling for worldwide cuts in emissions of gases that are thought to cause global warming. The Clinton administration has signed the treaty, but the Senate refuses to ratify it. She also said she would push for legislation to curb acid rain.</p>
        <p>In a talk sprinkled with bits of New York geography, Mrs. Clinton pointed out specific environmental problems that she would address.</p>
        <p>''I've been studying the map,'' she said, eliciting chuckles. ''There are dozens of the most wonderful names, Indian names and other names, that are really evocative of what people first saw and what they experienced. There are places like Loon Hollow Pond, but there aren't any loons left. There's been many a year since any trout, which happens to be the New York State fish, were caught in Brook Trout Lake, for example.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani again tried to distance himself from the failings of the New York City schools system and disparaged ''the bureaucratic infrastructure that is so damaging, where job protection is put ahead of helping children.'' He reiterated his contention that he should be given direct control of the schools, telling a joint Assembly-Senate committee, ''Do away with the Board of Education.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said: ''It's appeared to me that the mayor's had control of the schools. He's hired and fired two chancellors.''</p>
