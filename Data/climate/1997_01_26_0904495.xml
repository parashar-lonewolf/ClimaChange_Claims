        <p>''Still Needed: A Cross-Island Bridge'' is akin to Lazarus rising from the dead. Unfortunately what is ''scarce and in imbalance'' is an understanding of the longtime resolved issues of his suggestion, even after 35 years of its repeated defeats.</p>
        <p>Since 1965, when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller killed an Oyster Bay location for a bridge, through 1973,  when the Legislature repealed bridge legislation, since no Suffolk County crossing to the northeast would be able ''to pay for itself,'' and in 1980, when Gov. Hugh L. Carey rejected a bridge crossing, since it would cost close to $2 billion, a Long Island Sound bridge crossing has been shown to be ill conceived.</p>
        <p>Governor Carey did, however, establish an Action Committee for Long Island, which looked at all the transportation and economic factors associated with the construction of a new Long Island Sound bridge and after one year of intensive study rejected it overwhelmingly due to the main fact that commercial and industrial productivity on Long Island would not be changed with a new crossing</p>
        <p>In my five years as a bridge administrator with the Coast Guard reviewing bridge-construction permits and environmental-impact assessments for bridges in six New England states, having reviewed some of the original planned Long Island Sound bridge-crossing proposals and over my last 20 years as an ecologist with the National Park Service, I have heard made every possible argument for the construction of a ''new L.I. Sound bridge crossing.''</p>
        <p>Nothing has changed the fact that any new bridge crossing the Long Island Sound would have significant negative impacts on all Long Islanders. To name just a few:</p>
        <p>(1) A new bridge crossing would cost an estimated $1.9 billion, with a $3 million to $4 million annual maintenance cost -- and that is in 1988 dollars.</p>
        <p>(2) Bridges draw more traffic! They accommodate existing traffic levels, since they are planned for a ''projected use,'' which ultimately becomes obsolete once a bridge is placed, due to increased use from the development, which is spurred on after the bridge is completed. Just look at Staten Island and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.</p>
        <p>(3) Bridge tolls in the past have slowed vehicles down, contributing to increased concentrations of air pollutants. Even with the E-Z Pass implementation, the volume of air-polluting vehicles, especially trucks, does not get less. Regional air-and noise-pollution impacts dramatically increase after a bridge is constructed. No bridge ever built reduced air-pollution or noise-pollution levels in its corridor.</p>
        <p>(4) Bridge right-of-ways divide communities, due to property acquisition for bridge approaches, ramps and maintenance facilities. The new bridge will attract more trucks, especially since it would be an interstate connection, thus more pollution concerns.</p>
        <p>(5) Bridges have significant impacts on waterways from hydrocarbon runoff, to paint and solvent discharges during maintenance to loss of wetlands from construction to potential dredging to maintain water navigation. The Long Island Sound Study does not include a bridge in its considerations for the restoration of the Sound.</p>
        <p>(6) Bridge construction produces ''short-term'' jobs, which would need to be shared between two states. Stable long-term jobs are derived from mass transit and its ridership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waldman identifies a host of factors contributing to the Long Island transportation peritonitis, and that this blockage can only be cured by his radical cure, a new bridge across Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>Many sites have been suggested for this crossing. Yet all have been defeated, not as Mr. Waldman would have you believe ''by a few bistate groups in local opposition,'' but rather by a diligent cadre of professional environmentalists who through experience know that any Long Island Sound bridge would be a pariah, not a panacea.</p>
        <p>These solutions are suggested to Mr. Waldman to place his future efforts:</p>
        <p>(1) Establish additional ferry services across Long Island Sound. They are less expensive and generate more revenues.</p>
        <p>(2) Put the same heart-felt enthusiastic fervor into petitioning greater expenditures and subsidization of the Long Island Rail Road. Improving mass transit has repeatedly increased ridership. Look at the progress made in the City of New York over the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>(3) With the merger of Brooklyn Union Gas with Lilco, there should be a movement to provide the incentives for greater reliance on gas-powered buses and minivan transportation links to help reduce our future demand on fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waldman's ''radical change'' is not so radical at all. It is moribund and uninformed and would lead Long Islanders to another dead end.</p>
