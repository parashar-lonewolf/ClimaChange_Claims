        <p>Re ''Bush, Pushing Energy Plan, Offers Scores of Proposals to Find New Power Sources'' (front page, May 18):</p>
        <p>The simple fact is that all our fossil fuel energy reserves are finite.  No matter what this administration does to open up new reserves, no matter the environmental destruction that this will cause, the crisis will not be solved.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, warnings were issued. Some took heed; the majority did not. Research into renewable energy began, but financing and effort were inadequate.</p>
        <p>Energy resources were squandered, and the squandering continues.</p>
        <p>No one presidential administration is to blame. In fact, ''we have met the enemy, and he is us'' applies to the whole world. Greed, lack of awareness and overpopulation all drive the issue. This was true yesterday and remains true today.</p>
