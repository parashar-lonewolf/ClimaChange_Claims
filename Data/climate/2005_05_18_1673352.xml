        <p>It isn't so much that everybody really did love Raymond. It's that ''Two and a Half Men,'' the sitcom which follows ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and which CBS hopes will takes its place in the ratings, is so hateful. Charlie Sheen as Charlie, a promiscuous Malibu bachelor, and Jon Cryer as his high-strung divorced brother, Alan, are ghastly on many levels. But the show's flaws do at least highlight why ''Raymond'' was both good and popular for so many years.</p>
        <p>Sitcoms are the television equivalent of the ozone layer: almost all indicators suggest that both are imperiled, yet there is just enough evidence to allow stubborn contrarians to hold out hope. In the mid-1980's, the success of ''The Cosby Show'' put a damper on the end-of-the-sitcom theory for a while, but the gloomy predictions regained momentum after ''Friends'' and ''Frasier'' went off the air last year, leaving ''Raymond'' as the only sitcom included in Nielsen's top 10 rated shows. ''Two and a Half Men'' is in the top 20, and it owes much of its success to its placement between ''Raymond'' and ''CSI Miami.'' Whether it will hold its own next season will provide the next big test of the genre's viability.</p>

        <p>It isn't so much that everybody really did love Raymond. It's that ''Two and a Half Men,'' the sitcom which follows ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and which CBS hopes will takes its place in the ratings, is so hateful. Charlie Sheen as Charlie, a promiscuous Malibu bachelor, and Jon Cryer as his high-strung divorced brother, Alan, are ghastly on many levels.

        <p>Sitcoms are the television equivalent of the ozone layer: almost all indicators suggest that both are imperiled, yet there is just enough evidence to allow stubborn contrarians to hold out hope. In the mid-1980's, the success of ''The Cosby Show'' put a damper on the end-of-the-sitcom theory for a while, but the gloomy predictions regained momentum after ''Friends'' and ''Frasier'' went off the air last year, leaving ''Raymond'' as the only sitcom included in Nielsen's top 10 rated shows. ''Two and a Half Men'' is in the top 20, and it owes much of its success to its placement between ''Raymond'' and ''CSI Miami.'' Whether it will hold its own next season will provide the next big test of the genre's viability.</p>
        <p>Both ''Raymond'' and ''Two and a Half Men'' are sardonic, jabbing at the 50's myth of happy ''Father Knows Best'' families. But at its best ''Raymond'' was a kind of suburban ''Seinfeld,'' focused on a loopy guy, built around Ray Romano's comic persona, and his bracingly weird neighbors -- though in Ray Barone's case, they were his wife and family. As Debra, Patricia Heaton used aggrieved eye-rolls and pursed-lip disapproval that barely masked a brash, Elaine-style nuttiness, while his parents, Marie (Doris Roberts) and Frank (Peter Boyle), were so uncivilized that they could well have doubled as George's parents. In the season finale on Monday, Ray needed to have his adenoids removed, prompting Frank to make crude jokes about his virility. ''Do you even know where adenoids are?'' Robert asks his father. ''Sure, around back with all the rest of the 'oids,'' Frank replies.</p>
        <p>''Two and a Half Men'' tries to be a modern twist on ''The Odd Couple,'' and the half refers to Alan's ill-behaved son, Jake (Angus T. Jones), who spends alternate weekends with his dad. But actually, the show is alarmingly anachronistic: it has been decades since a libidinous cad seemed harmless or endearing; in the age of H.I.V. and S.T.D.'s, Charlie's heedless promiscuity seems like a health risk, not a hobby. The character was largely based on Mr. Sheen's real-life reputation, and yet the actor is miscast in his own part: he is less an adorable scamp than a seedy middle-aged sleaze. If high-definition television also included scents, Charlie would reek of Drakkar Noir.</p>
        <p>And the show's misogynistic streak robs the rest of the characters of their charm. Holland Taylor is a wonderful character actress who has expertly played the brittle, haughty older woman in a number of shows (''The Naked Truth,'' ''Bosom Buddies''), but here, her role as Evelyn, the brothers' narcissistic, alcoholic mother, is more disturbing than amusing. Similarly, the humor of the zany next-door-stalker Rose (Melanie Lynskey) is drowned out by the depressing portraits of jilted bimbos and Alan's mean, neurotic ex-wife, Judith (Marin Hinkle). The two flawed brothers are supposed to be redeemed by their shared love for Jake, but the unsavory nastiness trumps sentiment every time.</p>
        <p>The opposite was true on ''Raymond.'' He and all his relatives bickered constantly, and Marie's contempt for Debra's housekeeping skills was a leitmotif that somehow never grew old. In the finale, Marie brought homemade minestrone to heal Ray, prompting Debra to snarl, ''Do you really think food is going to help Ray's adenoids?'' To which Marie replies sweetly, ''I think good food will.''</p>
        <p>The show's unexpected success in 1996 encouraged all kinds of imitations, and ''Raymond'' is often blamed for the glut of male-dominated sitcoms, from ''All About Jim'' on ABC to ''Yes, Dear,'' ''The King of Queens'' and ''Listen Up,'' CBS shows that improbably match fat, weak husbands to gorgeous, smart wives. ''Raymond'' could be just as prosaic and predictable, but it was always funnier.</p>
        <p>It is notoriously hard for writers to match fans' expectations in the final episode of a popular show; endings too often are hastily contrived, be it the denouement of ''The Fugitive'' in 1967 or last year's finale of ''Friends.'' The writers on ''Raymond'' were more delicate, using a minor complication in Ray's adenoid surgery (for a few minutes, he fails to wake up from his anesthesia) to allow his family to panic and suddenly imagine life without Raymond. That fleeting glimpse of sentiment was quickly covered up with sarcastic jokes and silly pratfalls, making it all the more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>Restraint was as much the secret to ''Raymond'' as skillful acting and writing, and that carefully calibrated ending made the opening joke of Monday's episode of ''Two and a Half Men'' all the flatter: Alan tries to pick up bikini-clad beach volleyball players by asking them if they worry about melanoma. Charlie says, ''No man has gotten into a woman's pants chit-chatting about skin cancer.''</p>
        <p>''Raymond'' got a lot farther with adenoids.</p>
