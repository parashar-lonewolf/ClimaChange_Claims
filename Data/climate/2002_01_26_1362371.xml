        <p>The Bush administration has done well militarily in Afghanistan, but it has badly fumbled the question of justice for its captives. It has failed to understand the power of the human rights ideal in today's world -- and America's stake in living up to that ideal.</p>
        <p>The failure has brought awkward international political consequences for the United States. The imprisonment of Taliban and Qaeda captives at Guantánamo, and their treatment there, have been questioned by some of America's closest allies.</p>
        <p>The European Union's external affairs commissioner, Chris Patten, said the perception that the captives are being mistreated -- or may be sentenced to death -- ''would be a way of losing international support and losing the moral high ground.'' The two leading British newspaper columnists, Hugo Young of The Guardian and Philip Stephens of The Financial Times, wrote critical columns.</p>
        <p>All this has put the Bush administration on the defensive. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld devoted an entire press briefing to defending the Guantánamo camp against what he called baseless critical ''hyperbole.''</p>
        <p>Most Americans probably reject the foreign criticism. What accounts for the stark difference on this issue between us and people abroad who are usually staunchly pro-American?</p>
        <p>America was the target of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Americans may understandably have stronger feelings against terrorists now. Britain, Spain and other European nations that have had much experience with terrorism do not feel so freshly vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Then there is the death penalty. All European countries have given it up, and leaders from politicians to the pope deplore what they regard as the savage survival of executions here.</p>
        <p>Underneath, the prisoner issue touches a profound resentment abroad at what many see as an American tendency to lecture others about international standards while refusing  to comply with those it urges.</p>
        <p>The human rights movement in the world got its main start in the United States. Thirty years ago Congress began imposing sanctions on countries that violate human rights. The United States pushed the United Nations to create the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Yet the Bush administration is trying to sabotage establishment of an international court for war crimes that all our allies support.</p>
        <p>The administration has also troubled some friendly governments by withdrawing from the Kyoto treaty on global warming and the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London research group, said the Guantánamo issue touches ''European concern that America doesn't believe . . . in submitting itself to rules, organizations or norms that limit its freedom of action.''</p>
        <p>European unease about the legal side of the American war on terrorism goes back before Guantánamo to President Bush's order calling for military tribunals to try non-American citizens involved in terrorism. Objections in Europe made it doubtful that we could win extradition orders for suspects arrested there.</p>
        <p>The tribunal order has turned out to be an embarrassment for the administration. It has used civilian courts for the first terrorist prosecutions, undermining its argument that they could not be trusted for such cases.</p>
        <p>In Guantánamo, too, the administration has created unnecessary complications. It has tried to justify its treatment of prisoners by arguing that they are not war prisoners but ''unlawful combatants.'' ''These people are committed terrorists,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. But whether they are is the very question that a legal process must decide. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 say they must be considered prisoners of war unless a ''competent tribunal'' finds otherwise.</p>
        <p>The handling of the prisoners in Camp X-Ray has given the United States a self-inflicted wound. Fencing around with legalistic reasons to deny them rights due prisoners of war convinces hardly anyone. The administration should have learned by now that the world may be with us in fighting terrorism, but it wants to hold us to our professed ideals.</p>
        <p>''Whatever the legal rights and wrongs,'' Philip Stephens of The Financial Times wrote, ''the politics of Camp X-Ray are terrible. . . . As it confronts the authors of Sept. 11, the United States must demonstrate at every turn that it is on the side of civilized values.''</p>
