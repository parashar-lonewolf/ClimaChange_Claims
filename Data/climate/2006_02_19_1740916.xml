        <p>The scene was familiar, not so much for what could be seen but what couldn't. For the farming village of Guinsaugon, tucked under a mountain in the Philippines, disappeared last week, obliterated by a huge mudslide that killed most of the 1,800 people who lived there.</p>
        <p>The disaster differed only in scale from most of the scores of landslides and mudslides that have occurred around the world in recent decades. The slides kill an average of about 1,000 people a year, according to a database maintained by the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.</p>

        <p>The scene was familiar, not so much for what could be seen but what couldn't. For the farming village of Guinsaugon, tucked under a mountain in the Philippines, disappeared last week, obliterated by a huge mudslide that killed most of the 1,800 people who lived there.</p>
        <p>The disaster differed only in scale from most of the scores of landslides and mudslides that have occurred around the world in recent decades. The slides kill an average of about 1,000 people a year, according to a database maintained by the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.</p>
        <p>Landslides may not be preventable -- the Guinsaugon disaster occurred after two weeks of heavy rain -- but aren't there ways to protect people from them?</p>
        <p>Yes, said Ralph Daley, director of the International Network on Water, Environment and Health, part of the United Nations University. But often, particularly in the developing world, there is a lack of political commitment and money to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley said the technology exists to provide better short-term weather forecasting and climate modeling ''to give governments and policymakers some idea of what's coming.'' And there is agreement that more can be done to keep people off vulnerable land.</p>
        <p>But even though landslides are the seventh-biggest killer among natural disasters , he said, ''it's difficult to get political action on it -- there's so many other things that governments have to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Already there are signs that major landslides are on the increase, the result of population growth and poverty, which have forced more and more people to occupy vulnerable land.</p>
        <p>At the same time, climate change is causing more severe weather events, like major storms and prolonged periods of rain, that set the stage for disasters. ''That's the really frightening thing,'' Mr. Daley said.</p>
