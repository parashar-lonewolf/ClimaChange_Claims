        <p>IN ''Zoolander,'' a 2001 spoof of haute couture and supermodels, the title character, played by Ben Stiller, appears in a television commercial for a fictional cosmetics brand. Dressed as a merman, Mr. Stiller stares intently into the camera and recites with a straight face the ad's tagline: ''Moisture is the essence of wetness, and wetness is the essence of beauty.''</p>
        <p>In a sense, the line might not sound out of place as a slogan for Water Blushers, a line of cosmetics sticks from Shu Uemura, a Japanese brand owned by the L'Oréal Group of France. Water Blushers straddle the line between cosmetics and cosmeceuticals -- products intended to improve one's complexion, not just conceal it -- by promising both to restore color to a user's cheeks and to rehydrate the skin.</p>
        <p>The Water Blushers' active ingredient is Shu Uemura's trademarked Depsea Water. The company says that the water comes from melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica. After flowing into the sea, this denser water is caught in high-pressure currents that the company says trap it at a depth of 1,000 feet and carry it to Japan's southern coast, as well as to sites near Norway and Hawaii. Since 1989, the government of Kochi prefecture in Japan has operated a laboratory that pumps this water to the surface, where it can be analyzed.</p>
        <p>''With no sunlight, there's very little photosynthesis taking place by the plankton,'' said Reiko Imai, a Shu Uemura product manager. ''So there are all the nutrients that would normally be eaten up by the plankton -- nitrogen, phosphates and a lot of minerals.''</p>
        <p>The government's scientists have theorized that this abundance of nutrients may help farmers grow larger, healthier crops. Shu Uemura's researchers, however, are more enamored of the water's potential for countering the ravages of heat and pollution -- at least on those areas of the human body where makeup is applied.</p>
        <p>Shu Uemura's namesake founder first sampled the glacial water soon after the Kochi lab opened. ''When he applied it on his skin, he really found that he was amazed by the softness,'' Ms. Imai said. ''He's quite sensitive to texture.''</p>
        <p>Large amounts of the water were shipped to Mr. Uemura's laboratory in Tokyo, where his chemists measured its effects on the skin. They concluded that the deep-sea water was several times as effective as sterilized tap water in stimulating the body's production of a group of enzymes called transglutaminases, at least one of which appears to play a role in skin health. (Others are used to add creaminess to dairy products and to hold sausages together.)</p>
        <p>The Depsea Water ingredient, which also contains a touch of fermented seaweed extract, was first included in a 1998 product, a fragrant spray that was a hit worldwide. It was not until last year, however, that Shu Uemura began adding the water to makeup; the three Water Blushers sticks -- which come in peach, pink and mauve -- were introduced last month. Because the company says they rehydrate as well as beautify, the new cosmetics products can be marketed in two ways: as blemish-obscuring makeup or as skin-reviving elixir.</p>
        <p>As befits a product with such a rarefied main ingredient, the Water Blushers are priced for the luxury market: $20 per 0.12-ounce stick, available at Shu Uemura's two American boutiques -- in San Francisco and in SoHo in Manhattan -- and at a handful of retailers, including Barneys, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus.</p>
        <p>Could the product become even more expensive? Global warming may be melting the ice caps, and it's natural to assume that Shu Uemura's supply chain may therefore be threatened.</p>
        <p>Ms. Imai, however, said that there was plenty of Depsea Water to go around. ''Some of the water may have been circulating for 2,000 years'' before it was pumped to the surface, she said, predicting that there will be no dearth of glacial water off the coast of Kochi prefecture for at least the next century. Those who subscribe to the ''Zoolander'' theory of beauty can rest easy.</p>
