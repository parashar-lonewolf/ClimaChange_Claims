        <p>COAL</p>
        <p>A Human History.</p>
        <p>By Barbara Freese.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 308 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:</p>
        <p>Perseus Publishing. $25.</p>
        <p>WHEN I was a boy growing up in West Virginia, I would lie in bed at night listening to a small AM radio, eager to hear ''Joy to the World'' (the Three Dog Night song, not the carol -- hey, I was 10) or straining to stay awake for Roberto Clemente's next at-bat in the Pirates game. In the course of these pursuits, I also became familiar with a ritual announcement that hit the air every night around 10 o'clock, and that I can still repeat verbatim. ''The following operations of Consolidation Coal will work the midnight shift: the Arkwright Mine, the Osage Mine, the Humphrey Mine, the Pursglove Mine. . . .''</p>
        <p>Be assured that no other trade enjoyed the benefit of having its work shifts announced on the local airwaves. But that's how omnipresent ''king coal,'' as the mineral is sometimes called, was. My family didn't count on it for a living directly, but everyone did indirectly: during a long wintertime miners' strike in the 1970's, the schools (along with many businesses) actually closed for a while because they ran out of coal to fire the furnaces. Coal determined the pace of life, the health of the economy and the intensity of politics. When the United Mine Workers' reform presidential candidate, Jock Yablonski, was savagely executed -- with his wife and daughter -- on New Year's Eve in 1969 by thugs hired by the corrupt union president, Tony Boyle, the event registered in our household on the same scale as the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Such responses were not options in a place where coal was sovereign; they were facts of life.</p>
        <p>As Barbara Freese makes abundantly clear in her engrossing and sometimes stunning ''Coal: A Human History,'' man's relationship to coal has ever been thus. Coal is not merely a big employer, like Wal-Mart or Costco, only grimier; wherever it has been discovered and mined, it has become that place's metaphor and stipulated its destiny. And its power has not been merely regional. ''The industrial age,'' Freese writes, ''emerged literally in a haze of coal smoke, and in that smoke we can read much of the history of the modern world.''</p>
        <p>Overstatement? It's impossible to think so after reading this strongly argued and thoroughly researched book. London became the modern world's first great metropolis because of coal: Britons agreed by the late 1500's that coal heated homes and workplaces much better than wood, which London was fast running out of anyway. And coal's plenitude in Britain produced the wealth -- and the reliable warmth that cold-weather societies had not theretofore known -- that made the building of a muscular city possible. Shipbuilding technology advanced rapidly because of coal, since moving it from Newcastle and Wales to London was most easily accomplished on the seas and rivers. (Roads, then, were a nightmare. Freese offers an illuminating and spirited disquisition, of which there are so many in this lively book, on the problem of mud in 18th-century society; the ruts in the road from London to Birmingham, carved by thousands of wagon wheels over many years, were 12 to 14 feet deep in places.) Canals were built chiefly to move coal. Ditto railroads -- the world's first fully locomotive-driven public one, running between Liverpool and Manchester, was constructed more with a bituminous cargo in mind than a human one. James Watt's steam engine -- the Industrial Revolution's beating heart -- was invented chiefly ''to solve the novel problems posed by having to delve ever deeper into the earth for what had become a life-sustaining daily necessity.''</p>
        <p>Freese wants readers to be clear about just how vital coal has been to our era of human development because she hopes to persuade us that it's time to enter a new one. As an assistant attorney general of Minnesota for more than a dozen years, she was charged with enforcing that state's stringent environmental laws. When the state began a legal proceeding to try to quantify the effect of Minnesotans' electricity use (most of which is coal-powered) on global warming, the hearings touched an ''exquisitely sensitive'' nerve, she writes. Her curiosity was piqued about why, and ''Coal'' is the wide-ranging result of that curiosity having been satisfied.</p>
        <p>Given this polemical aim, ''Coal,'' while it fairly acknowledges what the substance has done for people, devotes its more swashbuckling passages to describing what it has done to them. Pollution was obvious from the start -- the first commissions set up in London to study coal's impact on air quality date to 1285 (indeed, coal use was banned in England for some 200 years, from the 1300's to the 1500's, until the wood shortage became so acute that the ban was lifted). Freese's descriptions, from firsthand sources, of the black, befouled air of London and Pittsburgh -- which turned white clothing a saturated gray in a few hours' time, could limit visibility to a few yards and surely caused uncountable deaths -- are ghastly; Anthony Trollope, visiting Pittsburgh as a Londoner who couldn't have scared easily on the subject of air quality, paid sarcastic tribute to ''the filth and wondrous blackness of the place.'' And, of course, there's the rather large matter of social class -- as surely as coal created wealth, it created its opposite. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, miners, including many children, worked in unspeakable conditions and were ''commonly referred to as a separate race of humans.''</p>
        <p>Surely these horrors are things of the past, right? Freese agrees that many of them are. But one thing isn't -- carbon and sulfur are still carbon and sulfur and, when spit into the air out of a smokestack, they're still bad for you, and bad for the planet. Increasing scientific agreement on these facts, Freese suggests, has the potential to create a noose around the coal industry's neck that should, some inevitable day, render coal burning a thing of the past. But to coal operators, that day is anything but inevitable; hence their ardent opposition to the Kyoto Protocols -- the international pact on global warming -- and their rhapsodic embrace of the candidate George W. Bush, who in 2000 won my home state's five electoral votes, and thus the presidency, largely on the basis of his pro-coal promises. Bush was the first non-incumbent Republican presidential candidate to carry West Virginia since Herbert Hoover did it in 1928.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the industry perspective does not receive luxurious treatment in ''Coal.'' Readers who desire a disinterested assessment of coal's benefits and curses, and the economic consequences of shifting to a post-coal economy, will need to seek out other sources. But disinterested assessments are not Freese's purpose. She wants, yes, to convince us that coal's minuses outweigh its pluses; but much more than that, she wants to prompt us to think broadly -- and specifically -- about our relationship to the physical material of the world, the startling history that has brought us to this point and the chain of human and economic events that is set in motion when we flip on a light switch. On these questions, ''Coal,'' to borrow a phrase, is king.</p>
