        <p>THE FOURTH DISCONTINUITY The Co-Evolution of Humans and Machines. By Bruce Mazlish. Illustrated. 272 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $30. METAMAN The Merging of Humans and Machines Into a Global Superorganism. By Gregory Stock. Illustrated. 365 pp. New York:  Simon &amp; Schuster. $24.</p>
        <p>HUMAN beings seem to have wandered off the evolutionary map. Unlike any species that came before us, we have surrounded ourselves with artifacts that radically transform our environment. Our adaptations are overwhelmingly produced by our own invention. Biology moves too slowly for us; why wait generations for natural selection to eliminate myopia and smallpox when we can grind corrective lenses and develop vaccines? And now, with recent advances in biological science and computer technology, we are on the verge of producing machines that can evolve.</p>
        <p>Could human creations eventually claim equality with us? Would we regard them as partners? More than 100 years ago, Samuel Butler had a character in his novel "Erewhon" utter a startling prophecy: "There is no security against the ultimate development of mechanical consciousness." Yet, as the authors of two new books proclaim, we need not wait for indisputably intelligent machines to close out the age of biological autonomy. According to "The Fourth Discontinuity" and "Metaman," the barrier between humans and machines has already evaporated.</p>
        <p>Most people would tend to question that conclusion, even as they concede the hopelessness of vanquishing a decent computer chess program running at its highest level. But Bruce Mazlish, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thinks there is compelling evidence that not only the functioning of our societies but also our very identities hinge on our symbiotic relationship with machines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mazlish calls this idea "the fourth discontinuity," the most recent of a series of rude comeuppances to mankind's pretensions of superiority. Freud identified the first three: Copernicus informed us that we were not special in the cosmos; Darwin included us in the animal kingdom; and Freud himself disallowed the notion that we were even in control of ourselves, contending that "the ego . . . is not even master in its own house, but must content itself with scanty information of what is going on unconsciously in the mind." Now here is Mr. Mazlish saying we can no longer justify the self-flattering notion that we dominate the machines we have created. "Such a need satisfies important psychological and social purposes," he says, "yet is a crutch that is best discarded, in order to move closer to reality and away from disabling fantasy."</p>
        <p>Most of "The Fourth Discontinuity" is a colorful consideration of man's long, fearful contemplation of the human-machine continuum. There are solid analyses of the usual suspects: Rene (Mind-Body) Descartes, of course, is prominent, as are Mary (Frankenstein) Shelley, Karel (Robot) Capek and Charles (Difference Engine) Babbage. Darwin and Freud loom large, too. There are also illuminating sections on T. H. Huxley, Samuel Butler and Julien Offray de La Mettrie, a Prussian physician and libertine who thought of humans as essentially no different from animals or machines. A perceptive critic, Mr. Mazlish expertly uses the writings of such thinkers to demonstrate that as technology becomes more formidable, it transforms our image of ourselves. But when he attempts his own synthesis, in two concluding chapters (one was not enough, he explains), he rambles, giving a sketchy overview of current technological advances and mixing it with a halfhearted attempt to tackle the big questions of human motivation.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, his book degenerates into movie criticism. "Star Wars," he proclaims, is "a 20th-century counterpart to the epic accounts of Homer." There's nothing wrong with George Lucas, but Mr. Mazlish should have spent more time with John von Neumann, the conceptual father of machine reproduction, who gets only a footnote in "The Fourth Discontinuity."</p>
        <p>Sketchiness is not a failing of "Metaman," a compact book bloated by a numbing 702 footnotes. In it, Gregory Stock, a biophysicist with a business degree from Harvard University, who is best known for "The Book of Questions," gathers a wealth of factoids, observations and conclusions from scientific studies to bolster his claim that human beings and machines have "co-evolved" into a collective superorganism: a beehive of flesh and fiber optics. This is metaman, endowed with a metabolism and even a consciousness of its own. We are but cogs in its intricate scaffolding, playing the role of single cells in a complex animal like ourselves.</p>
        <p>If you find this disturbing, trouble not! Mr. Stock, who acts as sort of a self-appointed public relations officer for metaman, promises us that his client is on the brink of solving all our problems.</p>
        <p>"Humankind," he writes, "has before it a long and vital future in a world where the natural environment will be managed, where the nation-state will lose its dominance in world affairs, where technology will penetrate virtually every aspect of human life, where human reproduction will be managed, and where local cultural traditions will merge into a rich global culture."</p>
        <p>Still, the part of me not yet pureed into global consciousness bridles at some of the rosy predictions in "Metaman." Mr. Stock thinks that the loss of individual privacy and of local cultural differences are small prices to pay for the privilege of being wired into the superorganism. Positing that population control (and not transitory annoyances like the loss of the ozone layer and the extinction of species) is metaman's most vexing concern, Mr. Stock suggests, apparently without irony, a solution: "the obvious possibility that some contagious, flulike infection might be created and released, rendering large numbers of people less able to conceive children."</p>
        <p>One only wishes that the farsighted philosophers Mr. Mazlish conjured had lived to ponder Mr. Stock's scary Panglossian optimism about metaman.  Steven Levy's most recent book is "Artificial Life."</p>
