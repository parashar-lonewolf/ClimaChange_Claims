        <p>FIGHTING RISKY LOANS A case in Illinois raises issues about what lawmakers and regulators can do when trying to keep consumers from entering into risky and expensive mortgage loans. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>APPLE TAKES ON MICROSOFT Apple, showing its willingness to compete with Microsoft's desktop computing monopoly, is making its Safari Web browser available for Windows-based PCs. Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said Safari would outperform Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer. Wall Street, however, was unimpressed. [C3.]</p>
        <p>QUESTIONING YAHOO The last 18 months have not been easy for Yahoo, which holds its annual meeting today. Now some shareholders are questioning the salary of its chief executive, Terry S. Semel. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A LESSON IN CANCER CARE Two years ago, the federal government made an effort to reduce to reduce Medicare payments to doctors for certain procedures. Those payments fell, but Medicare costs for cancer treatment rose over all, proving how hard it may be to control health care spending without changing the way doctors are paid. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A RUSSIAN BET ON NUCLEAR POWER Russia is wagering that the world is on the verge of a boom in construction of nuclear power plants, which it intends to build in smaller countries that are trying to end their dependence on fossil fuels. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PLIGHT OF A URANIUM PROCESSOR The only company in the United States that enriches uranium is struggling to survive, worrying specialists that its failure would leave Russia as the world's major uranium processor. [C4.]</p>
        <p>NICE PAYDAY IF YOU CAN GET IT Financial data in a filing shows that the two co-founders of the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, will earn $2.33 billion and keep 28 percent of the company after an initial public offering. Both earned hundreds of millions in salary in 2006. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NOT A GOOD DAY FOR FLYING When an air traffic control computer failed in Atlanta last Friday, the ripple effect delayed flights up and down the East Coast. On the Road: Joe Sharkey. [C1.]</p>
        <p>AN EFFORT TO BREAK OIL'S GRIP In the wake of its failure on immigration reform, Congress is embarking on another controversial subject: reducing America's seemingly endless desire for oil. The effort is sparking a lobbying battle involving car and oil companies, electric utilities, coal producers and corn farmers. [A14.]</p>
        <p>RULING AGAINST NURSES AIDES The Supreme Court has ruled that a home-care aide from Queens -- and the nation's 1.4 million other home-care aides -- are exempt from federal minimum wage and overtime protections. [B3.]</p>
        <p>WAS IT THE VACCINATIONS? Arguments have begun in the first of several test cases that may help decide whether the government should pay millions of dollars to parents of autistic children who are claiming the shots caused their children's illness. [A21.]</p>
        <p>MAKEOVERS FOR RADIO STATIONS American radio corporations are working to halt the flow of listeners to iPods, podcasts and other sources for entertainment by trying to merge their over-the-air music and D.J. chatter with the Web while adding online streams of their broadcasts and features already found on many independent Web-based stations. [E1.]</p>
        <p>SCARED OF A LITTLE TURBULENCE? Don't be. While it can be disconcerting, airliners are built to withstand it and the chief cause of injuries in bad turbulence is from passengers failing to fasten their seatbelts. [C10.]</p>
        <p>A PHILATELIST SELLS William H. Gross, the bond investor and chief investment officer of Pimco, auctioned his collection of 19th- and early 20th-century British stamps in New York for $9.1 million, donating the proceeds to Doctors Without Borders. [C2.]</p>
        <p>DRUG MAKER PLEADS GUILTY The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb has pleaded guilty to making false statements to a federal agency, ending an unusual criminal case involving its blockbuster blood-thinning drug Plavix. [C3.]</p>
        <p>QUITTING EADS Jean-Paul Gut, below, the chief operating officer of EADS, the parent of the European airline company Airbus, has resigned over what he referred to as disagreements over policy and strategy. The departure adds more upheaval in EADS top management one week before the Paris air show. EADS has endured criticism about production delays at Airbus and severance payments to its departing co-chief executive amid an insider-trading investigation. [C2.]</p>
        <p>INSURER SUED OVER KATRINA CLAIMS Jim Hood, Mississippi's attorney general, has sued State Farm Fire and Casualty, saying the company failed to honor an agreement for a mass settlement of claims over Hurricane Katrina damage. [C2.]</p>
        <p>QWEST CHIEF RESIGNING In an announcement that surprised analysts, Richard C. Notebaert said that he planned to resign as chief executive and chairman of Qwest Communications, which he brought back from an accounting scandal and the verge of bankruptcy. [C3.]</p>
