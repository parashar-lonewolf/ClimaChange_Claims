        <p>Just four years ago, a senior General Motors executive from Detroit appalled a roomful of diplomats and trade negotiators at an embassy dinner in Washington by loudly arguing that the nation's capital did not really matter because it did not manufacture anything.</p>
        <p>That attitude, once common at the nation's biggest company, is now fading quickly. As the auto maker builds new factories in Poland, Thailand and Argentina, and as the rising dollar has helped propel sales of foreign cars in America, the General Motors Corporation is becoming much more active on public policy issues.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the dollar's ascent has underscored G.M.'s change of heart.  This winter, G.M. executives were among the first to warn about the bruising effects of the dollar's rise on American manufacturers and to lead efforts to convince Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin that the dollar is too high in currency markets. A dozen years ago, when the dollar was also soaring, G.M. was one of the last big manufacturers to push for Government relief.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Louis R. Hughes, the president of G.M.'s international operations, has become an outspoken critic of plans for a single European currency, because he fears it could initially squeeze profits and slow economic growth. The auto maker's Washington office has stepped up its lobbying on issues like global warming, because of worries that new controls could be placed on the worldwide auto industry. And G.M.'s board has just added two directors known for their outspoken but different views on international trade.</p>
        <p>Even John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive and a businessman who remains visibly uncomfortable discussing public policy issues, now says that the company will inevitably take more public positions as it expands overseas. There is ''no doubt that will happen,'' he said, pointing out that G.M. strongly favored the United States's renewal last year of China's most favored nation status.</p>
        <p>One reason is that G.M. is rapidly expanding its operations in many Asian and Latin American markets where overcoming trade restrictions and winning Government approval for factories are often crucial for  success. So G.M. has been turning to Washington for the same support that foreign auto makers have long sought from their home governments.</p>
        <p>It is impossible for G.M. to run its worldwide operations ''without assuming some responsibility for being a well-informed participant in public policy debates and issues,'' said Harry J. Pearce, G.M.'s vice chairman.</p>
        <p>Current and former G.M. executives cite several other reasons the auto maker is no longer the corporate wallflower on policy issues that it used to be. One simple reason is that G.M. has recovered from its management crisis in the early 1990's, so its executives have more time to spend on longer-term issues.</p>
        <p>Another reason is that G.M.'s public policy decision making has shifted away from the financial staff in New York City, where a laissez-faire ethos has long been strong. Decisions are increasingly being made instead in Detroit by Mr. Pearce, a lawyer who made his reputation handling product liability issues in Washington and in courtrooms around the country.</p>
        <p>During the mid-1980's, the ambivalence of the New York operations on dollar policy created tensions within G.M. ''Back in those days, some of the operating people felt we should have been more vocal than we were,'' Lloyd E. Reuss, G.M.'s retired president, said.</p>
        <p>Marina Whitman, the vice president and group executive for public affairs during much of the 1980's, said that G.M. had lobbied the Reagan Administration vigorously for a weaker dollar after Caterpillar Inc. had begun doing so. But she added,  ''We may have been a little slow -- I think with 20/20 hindsight, if I had to do it all over again, we might have waded in sooner.''</p>
        <p>The question now is whether G.M.'s next step will be to seek any restrictions on auto imports. Any such move would break a long corporate tradition of support for free trade.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's, G.M. declined to participate in an attempt by the Ford Motor Company to win protection from Japanese imports, effectively dooming the effort. As recently as February 1993, G.M. pulled out of lawsuit preparations by Ford and the Chrysler Corporation, which wanted billions of dollars in tariffs imposed on Japanese cars allegedly being dumped at unfairly low prices in the United States. Because of G.M.'s action, the lawsuit was never filed.</p>
        <p>G.M. has just added two directors with very different views on trade. One of the new directors, George M. C. Fisher, the chairman, chief executive and president of the Eastman Kodak Company, has made repeated use of unilateral American trade laws in trying to break open the Japanese market and restrict the sale of supposedly underpriced Japanese goods in the United States.</p>
        <p>While cautioning that he was still learning about the auto industry and had not joined G.M.'s board to be a trade specialist, Mr. Fisher said that he saw some parallels between trade issues facing Kodak and G.M. He contended that the Japanese film market is sufficiently closed to foreign companies that producers there can collect high profits and use the money to buy market share elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the same arguments apply to the auto business,'' he said in his first interview after being named to the G.M. board.</p>
        <p>Percy Barnevik, the chairman and chief executive of ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a Zurich-based engineering giant, was also recently named to the G.M. board and is outspoken on trade policy, but with a different emphasis. Having spent his career as a businessman in Switzerland and Sweden, countries with small markets and little ability to threaten trade sanctions, he has strongly supported international limits on unilateral trade laws.</p>
