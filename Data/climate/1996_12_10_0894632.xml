        <p>NITROGEN, more plentiful in the air than oxygen and as down to earth as the fertilizer it becomes when applied to a lawn or farm field, has long been taken for granted as an almost wholly benign element.</p>
        <p>No longer. Scientists say synthetic fertilizers, farm crops and the burning of coal and oil have doubled the rate at which inert atmospheric nitrogen is ''fixed'' -- that is, converted to forms that can be used by living things. Those are also the forms of nitrogen that can affect the atmosphere. As a result, the experts say, environmental disruption caused by a planetary overload of nitrogen is emerging as a new global concern.</p>
        <p>Among environmental hazards, nitrogen has the dubious distinction of posing a triple threat.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide emitted by the burning of fossil fuels can warm the earth's atmosphere. Man-made chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons can damage the earth's protective stratospheric ozone layer. Destruction of habitat by changes in land use can make living things vanish.</p>
        <p>Too much fixed nitrogen can do all three to some degree or other. And scientists are beginning to identify and measure a number of negative results from what they say is a relatively recent excess of nitrogen, an excess that is still growing. The negative effects include these:</p>
        <p>*Oxygen deprivation, toxic algae blooms and biological degradation in some coastal waters and estuaries, where many commercial fish breed.</p>
        <p>*Possible local extinction of some terrestrial plant species, as well as the animals and microbes that depend on them.</p>
        <p>*Increasing and potentially serious atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide, which is both a long-lived and potent heat-trapping greenhouse gas and a destroyer of protective stratospheric ozone.</p>
        <p>*A weakening of the ability of plant communities to remove heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air and store it.</p>
        <p>*Growing atmospheric concentrations of nitric oxide, a major contributor to both smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>There are many uncertainties and gaps in data, and much is unclear about the effects of the excess nitrogen. Nevertheless, the excess ''is causing serious and long-term environmental consequences across large regions of the earth,'' a panel of nine experts says in a peer-reviewed report to be published next month, with the imprimatur of the Ecological Society of America, in the journal Ecological Issues.</p>
        <p>And in the case of nitrogen, the experts say, humans are playing an unmistakably large role. People have had as much effect on the global nitrogen cycle as natural factors, ''and that's an enormous effect on a global cycle,'' said Dr. William H. Schlesinger of Duke University, a biogeochemist who is an author of the report. By contrast, he said, humans have perturbed the carbon cycle, with all its implications for increases in carbon dioxide, and consequent global warming, by only 5 to 10 percent.</p>
        <p>All this from a chemical as important as it is ubiquitous. Nitrogen is essential for plant nutrition, and thus for animal life as well. It ranks fourth as the most common chemical in living tissues, behind oxygen, carbon and hydrogen. In fertilizer form, it has made modern agriculture possible. In some places, even an excess of nitrogen can be good for farms, grazing lands and trees. It is, in fact,  nitrogen's extraordinary usefulness to life that is at the heart of the damage it can cause. An especially revealing experiment, reported in the current issue of the journal Science, illustrates what too much of a good thing can mean.</p>
        <p>Two ecologists, Dr. David A. Wedin of the University of Toronto and Dr. David Tilman of the University of Minnesota, measured the response of 162 plots of Minnesota grassland to various levels of nitrogen loading while carefully controlling moisture and other soil nutrients. The varying amounts of nitrogen added to various plots corresponded to actual levels measured at a variety of American and European localities.</p>
        <p>After 12 years, the researchers made three major discoveries. First, they found that some plant species disappeared, driven out by others better adapted to a high-nitrogen environment; the result was a net loss of biological diversity, with ''weedy'' species of grass from abroad becoming dominant and the ecosystem as a whole becoming biologically poorer.</p>
        <p>Second, they found that when these newly dominant species died and decomposed, their higher nitrogen content allowed more nitrate to leak into the soil. Nitrate is highly soluble, and propagates through the soil into ground water and surface runoff.  This, the scientists say, could contribute to harmful blooms of algae and impair water quality. High enough nitrate levels in aquifers would be toxic to those who drink their water.</p>
        <p>Third, the researchers discovered that because the newly dominant plants were so rich in nitrogen, bacteria and fungi that feed on nitrogen decomposed them more quickly. And because they decomposed faster, the plant community stored no more carbon than before. This was an important finding, since a number of scientists had hoped that by promoting plant growth, higher nitrogen levels would cause terrestrial plants to absorb more carbon dioxide from the air and lock it up as carbon, thereby helping to reduce the threat of global warming.</p>
        <p>Describing the research as ''a beautiful piece of work,'' Dr. David Schimel of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., an expert on biogeochemical cycles, said the work showed that while more nitrogen might be beneficial at first, in the long term it created ''imbalances in biogeochemical cycles'' that ''begin to have negative consequences.''</p>
        <p>He said the effects found by Dr. Tilman and Dr. Wedin were also likely to occur in forests, although Dr. Tilman was quick to point out that this had not yet been established. And in fact, some scientists contend that forests have a great potential for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilman is a also member of the nine-member panel that produced the paper to be published in Ecological Issues.</p>
        <p>Although 78 percent of the atmosphere is nitrogen gas, plants cannot absorb it directly from the air as they can oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Instead, they must wait until it somehow becomes fixed -- bonded with hydrogen or oxygen -- to form usable nutrients like ammonium and nitrate. In nature, there are two ways this happens: A small number of algae and soil bacteria have enzymes that enable them to convert nitrogen gas directly into usable form. And lightning transforms the gas into nitrates, which then rain onto soil.</p>
        <p>Scientists estimate that before humans began altering the nitrogen cycle, these natural processes fixed from 90 million to 150 million metric tons of nitrogen a year. Today, they estimate, human activity adds 132 million to 153 million metric tons. Of this, 80 million metric tons is accounted for by manufactured fertilizer.</p>
        <p>Crops like peas, beans and alfalfa, which carry their own nitrogen-fixing bacteria on root nodules, account for 32 million to 53 million metric tons. The burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil by power plants, factories and motor vehicles adds another 20 million tons. An estimated 70 million tons is released by burning forests and grasslands, draining wetlands and clearing land for crops.</p>
        <p>The buildup has been rapid. For instance, half of all the industrial nitrogen fertilizer used in human history has been applied since 1984,  according to an estimate by Dr. Peter M. Vitousek, an ecologist at Stanford University who headed the nine-member panel.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the effect of Federal legislation on the situation has been mixed, scientists say. The Clean Water Act, for all its success in cleaning up many of America's rivers, ''hasn't taken a bite'' out of the nitrogen problem, said Dr. Robert W. Howarth of Cornell University, another member of the panel.  This is because nitrogen in runoff from farm fields and in the effluent of sewage treatment plants is not a target of the act. On the other hand, said Dr. Howarth, the Clean Air Act ''has probably helped.'' For instance, emissions of heat-trapping nitrous oxide from American industry have ''probably been stable for the last 10 years,'' while global emissions have grown.</p>
        <p>Of particular concern is the impact of nitrogen overload on aquatic ecosystems, especially coastal ones.  Scientists know that excess nitrogen promotes the growth of microscopic plants that form the base of the aquatic food chain. While they live, these organisms can cloud the water, shutting off the supply of sunlight to larger aquatic plants. When they die, they are consumed by bacteria, which proliferate and drain the water of oxygen. Nitrogen can also stimulate the growth of toxic algae that kill fish.</p>
        <p>Excess fixed nitrogen washing off farm fields, spewed into rivers by sewage treatment plants and emitted to the air by fossil-fuel burning and a variety of other processes ends up in creeks, rivers and estuaries, flowing to the continental shelves.</p>
        <p>Human activity also moves existing fixed nitrogen around ecosystems in surprising ways. One of the biggest sources of nitrogen in the Northeastern United States is agricultural products from the Midwest, according to a recent report in the journal BioScience by two research ecologists, Dr. Thomas E. Jordan and Dr. Donald E. Weller of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center at Edgewater, Md. Human biology then enters the picture. When Northeasterners eat those agricultural products, much of the nitrogen in them ends up in the region's waterways by way of treated sewage.</p>
        <p>On a grander scale, more than 50 scientists from 12 countries have joined under the auspices of the International Council of Scientific Unions to study the human impact on the North Atlantic basin and its watershed. They reported recently that nitrogen was being deposited on the basin at five times the pre-industrial rate. In the Northeastern United States and northern Europe, they found, 10 to 20 times more nitrogen than in pre-industrial times may now be carried to the coast by rivers.  They also discovered that atmospheric deposition was the biggest single source of human-derived nitrogen in the Eastern United States coastal watershed.</p>
        <p>Much is unknown about where the nitrogen goes. ''We don't know what's happening to most of this stuff that we're adding to the land,'' Dr. Jordan said. ''We're having a big effect, but we don't know what it is.''</p>
        <p>Still, there are some signs. Ill effects are being detected in a number of American estuaries, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration reported last week in the first of a series of new studies on the effects of nutrients like nitrogen on American coastal waters. The effects so far are limited, however, said Dr. Suzanne Bricker, a main author of the study. While blooms of toxic algae are increasing in frequency and duration along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, she said, oxygen depletion affecting about half the estuaries covers a small area and is limited to the summer months. She also said sea grasses had died back in some areas.</p>
        <p>In the long term, Dr. Schlesinger said, the threat to estuaries is ''very serious,'' not least because they are ''the most productive fisheries in the world.''</p>
        <p>One exception to the limited extent of coastal oxygen depletion is what scientists call ''the dead zone,'' a 7,000-square-mile area off the Louisiana coast where in the summer there is too little oxygen on the sea floor to sustain life.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe it has been created mainly by the runoff of fertilizer from Midwestern farms in the upper Mississippi River drainage. The dead zone grew substantially after the pulse of runoff caused by the 1993 Mississippi floods. But sediment records indicate that the problem has also become worse since the 1950's, said Dr. Don Boesch, a coastal ecologist with the University of Maryland. While data on the problem are inadequate, he said, scientists believe it has probably depressed valuable shrimp populations.</p>
        <p>The report to be published in Ecological Issues says that about 30 million metric tons of nitric oxide are emitted into the atmosphere each  year by the burning of fossil fuels and forests and by conversion from fertilizer by soil microbes. The result in many regions, it says, is increased smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>The paper also says that atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas and destroyer of ozone, are increasing by 2 to 3 percent a decade as a result of several ''human driven'' sources, including manufacturing and forest burning. Dr. Schimel said any ''massive increase'' in nitrous oxide was ''something we should be nervous about in the future,'' not least because it persists in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Presently, he said, nitrous oxide contributes about a quarter as much to global warming as carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The pace of nitrogen buildup is likely to accelerate, the study says. If it does, some scientists fear, many ecosystems could become saturated with nitrogen, increasing environmental damage, and nitrous oxide could move to the fore as a cause of planetary warming.</p>
        <p>What might be done? The problem is so newly appreciated, said Dr. Howarth, that attention has yet to focus on solutions. More efficient use of fertilizer might help, he said, as might more efficient combustion engines. At least one company, Monsanto, is investigating the possibility of genetically engineering crops that use less fertilizer.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure,'' Dr. Howarth said, ''that there are thousands more creative things'' that can be done, adding: ''If we get the best agricultural scientists and engineers focusing on the problem, I'm sure we can do better.''</p>
