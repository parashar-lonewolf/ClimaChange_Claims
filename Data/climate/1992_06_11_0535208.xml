        <p>Although Americans put a high priority on environmental issues, they are skeptical about whether President Bush will accomplish much at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week.</p>
        <p>Only 9 percent of those surveyed in a CBS News poll conducted from May 27 to May 30 said they expected the meeting to produce substantial results to help solve the world's environmental problems.

        <p>Although Americans put a high priority on environmental issues, they are skeptical about whether President Bush will accomplish much at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week.</p>
        <p>Only 9 percent of those surveyed in a CBS News poll conducted from May 27 to May 30 said they expected the meeting to produce substantial results to help solve the world's environmental problems. Forty-seven percent expected the meeting would help a little, but 35 percent said they felt the session would have little or no effect.</p>
        <p>This attitude appeared to be linked to Mr. Bush's low ratings on environmental issues, with 31 percent saying they approved of the President's policies and 55 percent saying they disapproved.</p>
        <p>"I do not think that Bush plans to be an active participant at the summit," Ruby Cannon, a Federal employee in Portsmouth, Va., said in a follow-up interview after the survey. "I think he is just going for political reasons." Upset Over Treaty Opposition</p>
        <p>Cindy Dowdy, an accountant in Lansdale, Pa., expressed a similar view. "I think international conferences are mostly for show," she said. "Bush did nothing on the environmental issue until it became popular again with the anniversary of Earth Day."</p>
        <p>Ms. Dowdy also said she was upset that the United States had refused to sign a treaty to preserve living species.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has said it opposes the pact, the biodiversity treaty, because it would interfere with American patent law protections and biological research.</p>
        <p>But only 28 percent of those surveyed said they thought the treaty would give other countries too much say in the domestic policies of the United States, as against 47 percent who said they would not. More Talk Than Progress</p>
        <p>The nationwide survey, conducted by telephone, involved 1,347 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The skepticism about the Earth Summit aside, the survey found that concern for environmental issues remained high despite the nation's lingering economic problems.</p>
        <p>Asked if protecting the environment was so important that requirements and standards should be set regardless of cost, 67 percent responded in the affirmative. This is down from a peak of 80 percent reached just after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 but well above the 45 percent approval rating recorded when The New York Times/CBS News Poll first asked the question in 1981.</p>
        <p>A sizable majority of those surveyed said they felt that Mr. Bush talked more about protecting the environment than he had accomplished. Seventy percent said the President had been insincere in his expression of support for environmental issues, as against 19 percent who said they believed he had made progress.</p>
        <p>This represents an erosion of Mr. Bush's already low standing on the environment from early in 1990, when 24 percent of those surveyed said they felt progress had been made, while 62 percent said he had just talked about the issue but had done little or nothing about it.</p>
        <p>"I do not think Bush has an environmental policy," said Karen Steigerwald of Auburn, N.Y., who works at the state prison there. "We need to do things things to stop the emission of greenhouse gasses and stop polluting the oceans. Acid rain, for example, is a big problem around here."  THE EARTH SUMMIT</p>
