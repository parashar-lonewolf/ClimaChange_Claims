        <p>Maybe Jackie Mason should worry. After all, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate seems to enjoy using Yiddish words like ''chutzpah'' and Jewish-style phrases that have not often been heard on the national campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Just this morning, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman was asked by Tim Russert on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' what would happen if the Gore-Lieberman ticket won the presidency. The inauguration date is Jan. 20, 2001, a Saturday. As an Orthodox Jew, Mr. Lieberman strictly observes the Sabbath, from sundown on Fridays to sundown on Saturdays, which ostensibly prohibits working, riding in vehicles and other activities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman smiled. ''Well, as my mother would say, Tim, if she were here, 'Sweetheart, we should have such a problem.' ''</p>
        <p>He went on to say that he would probably stay near the Capitol on Friday night, to avoid having to travel by car. And, if the Secret Service agreed, he would walk from the Capitol to the White House to participate in the events.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said that he has driven on the Sabbath in the past if important issues were at stake.</p>
        <p>The senator has talked about his religious roots and convictions repeatedly -- an issue intertwined with his negative views about Hollywood morality and what he has termed the avalanche of films, television and music that are excessively violent or sexual.</p>
        <p>Today, the senator said he would not back down on those views, even though many Hollywood executives and performers are Democrats and are contributing heavily to the campaign.</p>
        <p>Privately, several prominent Democrats in the entertainment industry have said that contributors like Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, two of the owners of the film company DreamWorks, have been called by Vice President Al Gore, who is sensitive to Hollywood's uneasiness with Mr. Lieberman, and asked their opinion of his running mate and that they not publicly criticize the choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore got what he wanted. Criticisms have been muted. The moguls got what they wanted. A call from the presidential candidate asking for a favor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's Jewish roots, of course, are the talk of Hollywood. At a fund-raiser on Saturday night, the comedian Red Buttons came onstage to the music of ''Hava Nagilla.'' Mr. Buttons grinned, calling the song, ''The Democratic Party's new campaign song.''</p>
        <p>And the Clintons Hung On</p>
        <p>It was not a Bill Clinton record for partying late, but it came close.</p>
        <p>The president who loves Hollywood did not leave a Brentwood fund-raiser top heavy with the B list -- Cher, Paul Anka, Milton Berle, Diana Ross, Michael Bolton -- until 1:45  this morning, and did not get back to his hotel until 2:10 a.m.</p>
        <p>Maybe that was because the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, was having a good time sitting at dinner next to Brad Pitt, who came with his new wife, Jennifer Aniston.</p>
        <p>Or maybe it was because Mr. Clinton was intent on clinging to every moment of his waning presidency.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking how quickly it all passed and what an absolute joy it was,'' the president told the 1,400 people who raised, depending on the estimate, from $1 million to $4 million for his wife's Senate campaign and the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>The president added: ''I used to tell people in some of the dark days, when they'd say, don't you sometimes regret that you ever got into this -- I'd say, Lord, no. Just a few twists in the road and I could be home doing real estate transactions in a musty loft.''</p>
        <p>Hollywood, which also billed the event as a ''gala salute to William Jefferson Clinton,'' fell over itself with sometimes bizarre accolades.</p>
        <p>From Stan Lee, the Marvel Comic books publishing tycoon, the creator of Spider-Man and a host of the party: ''I'm a guy who's dealt with super heroes most of my life, and sir, you have great potential. I think you would learn to climb the side of buildings and wear spandex tights. I think I could make you famous.''</p>
        <p>From John Travolta, who, in the movie ''Primary Colors,'' played a Clinton-like president: ''If I were hungry, you'd sit right down and eat a cheeseburger with me, not even suggesting holding the fries. But now, if I were president, what would I miss? Well I would miss flying around in that classic 707. Now, I happen to own one of those puppies. And if you and the missis ever need a ride.''</p>
        <p>It was not until the very end of the party -- held under the lemon and grapefruit trees on the estate of Ken Roberts, a radio and real estate magnate -- that anyone even got around to mentioning the name of the Democratic presidential nominee. And that had to come from the president himself. ''He understands the future,'' Mr. Clinton said of Vice President Al Gore. ''He was talking about global warming when we ran in '92, and people were still making fun of him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton got teary-eyed several times during the evening, but tried to reassure the audience: ''I'm not going anywhere except to a different line of work. I'll try to be a useful citizen and I'll try to hang around.''</p>
        <p>A Republican in the Crowd</p>
        <p>Democratic revelers at the Century Plaza Hotel, the convention home for the New York delegation, were somewhat startled to see Bruce J. Teitelbaum turn up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum, a Republican, was the aggressive Senate campaign manager for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani until the mayor withdrew from the race in May and left him unemployed.</p>
        <p>So just what was he doing at the hotel? Gathering intelligence, perhaps?</p>
        <p>''I'm going to relax a little bit,'' said Mr. Teitelbaum, whose wife, Suri Kasirer, a Democrat, is a Gore fund-raiser and a delegate from New York. Ms. Kasirer was staying at the Century Plaza, Mr. Teitelbaum said, while he was staying at the Peninsula.</p>
        <p>''She has her hotel, I have mine,'' he said. ''We visit each other.''</p>
        <p>For Connecticut, Star Power</p>
        <p>The Connecticut delegation suddenly finds itself with new cachet and the selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has suddenly infused the small state's Democratic delegates with star power.</p>
        <p>Connecticut Democrats allowed that their state does not exactly have a reputation for Bacchanalian revelry. Nobody comes to Trumbull for Mardi Gras, as one delegate dryly noted. And until a week ago, the only official event the delegation had scheduled in Los Angeles was a reception last night sponsored by the natural gas industry.</p>
        <p>Now, however, all people and things connected to Connecticut are in demand, and the gas party was something of a hot ticket, though Mr.  Lieberman was not arriving in town until Monday night.</p>
        <p>''People have been calling me wondering how to get into it,'' said William Curry, a onetime gubernatorial candidate and former White House official, who sat next to Mr. Lieberman in the State Senate years ago. ''I would flatly say, the number of inquiries I would normally receive for something like this would be close to zero.''</p>
        <p>''If such things could run to negative numbers, chances are I'd be getting calls from delegates saying, 'How can I get out of this?' ''</p>
