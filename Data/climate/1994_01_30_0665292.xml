        <p>ARTIST AS CRITIC  Two artists from different generations, sharing a singular passion for righting the wrongs of society with humor and compassion, are joined in an exhibition opening on Tuesday at the Nardin Galleries in Somers. It will remain on view through March 14.</p>
        <p>One of the artists is William Gropper, whose satirical cartoons influenced popular perceptions of American life from the 1920's to his death in 1977 at the age of 80, and posthumously in collections, books and exhibitions like this one. More than 40 drawings, cartoons and several oils, including a self-portrait, form a retrospective of his long career. Among the many honors he received was election to the National Institute of Arts and Letters.</p>
        <p>The co-exhibitor is Bill Mutter, 39, whose lifesize ceramic cowboys tackle the issue of violence. Seemingly hale, hearty and heroic, glazed in colorful Western garb, the sculptures reveal, on closer inspection, the frustration and fear that result when human communication is reduced to mayhem. "The Bully," "Death of the Poet," "Horse and Rider" and "Comin' Round the Corner" are some of the titles.</p>
        <p>Nardin Galleries is a quarter of a mile north of the Elephant Hotel on Route 202, open Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Call 276-8485 for more information. ROCK AND REGGAE</p>
        <p>Where Italian opera once reigned in the 68-year-old hall at 7 Willow Street in Port Chester, the beat of the 90's now prevails. Open from 9 P.M. to 4 A.M. and serving nothing but music and drinks, the nightspot named for its address is open Thursdays through Saturdays and on a random schedule the rest of the week.</p>
        <p>This Friday's bill features the Sons, a classic rock group that has established a reputation in Manhattan at Wetlands, Tramps, Lone Star Roadhouse and other downtown venues. Bret Reilly is the leader, singer and songwriter; his brother Parker is the keyboardist; Stephen Murphy plays the guitar, and the percussion section is in the hands of Nick Varchaver and Peter Wilson.</p>
        <p>Ripton Hylton, better known as Eek-a-Mouse, will be on stage Saturday night, performing reggae but with an imprimatur as off-the-wall as his name, which he took from a race horse. He draws inspiration from a childhood spent in Kingston, Jamaica, threading through his music an inexhaustible supply of personal and fanciful stories.</p>
        <p>He manipulates his voice into improbable ranges and inhuman sounds, frequently decked out in get-ups as un-reggae as gladiator, pirate, coolie, Mexican bandit or Robin Hood.</p>
        <p>The cover charge on Friday will be $7; on Saturday it will be $10 in advance, $12 at the door. For reservations or an information tape about performances other than those on Thursday through Saturday, call 939-1474. TOPICAL TALKS</p>
        <p>Marcia Ann Gillespie, editor in chief of Ms. Magazine and former editor in chief of Essence magazine, will give a talk about "Racism and Sexism in the Media" at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers on Tuesday at 1:30 P.M. She is now serving as project coordinator and editor of a United Nations publication on the global impact of AIDS. The program will be held in Reisinger Auditorium, and admission is free.</p>
        <p>Another free lecture, to be held in Titsworth Hall on Thursday at 8 P.M., is titled "1994 Challenges to Environmentalism: Science and Regulations." The speaker will be Frederic D. Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, based in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krupp and his team of scientists, engineers, economists and lawyers seek solutions to the problems of global warming, ozone depletion, degradation of the tropical rain forests and the impact of acid rain and toxic chemicals on the water supply.</p>
        <p>For more information, call 395-2411 or 395-2220. HEALING POWER OF BEES</p>
        <p>The medicinal and therapeutic benefits of honeybees and the products obtained from them have not been proved within the American scientific community, but they are used widely in China and by some practitioners here. An introduction to the subject will be offered in a program titled "Honeybees and Health," to be conducted at the Greenburgh Nature Center on Saturday at 2 P.M. by Dr. Theo Cherbuliez. The center is on Dromore Road off Central Avenue.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cherbuliez is a Scarsdale psychiatrist and master beekeeper who has employed bee-sting therapy on an experimental basis as a treatment for symptoms of arthritis and multiple sclerosis. The treatments have been in progress for two years, sometimes in conjunction with bee pollen and royal jelly.</p>
        <p>Last year, he and his wife, Susan, who will assist in Saturday's program, visited China, attending an international Apimondia Conference in Beijing and an Asian bee-therapy conference in Nanjing. They also observed the use of beeswax in the treatment of burn victims at a burn clinic in Beijing. About 300,000 patients have apparently benefited.</p>
        <p>Slides will accompany Dr. Cherbuliez's talk, and he will have samples of beeswax, bee glue (a waxy substance collected from buds of certain trees by bees), royal jelly and bee venom (which is contained in ampules).</p>
        <p>Admission will be $3 and includes access to all the center's exhibitions. Call 723-3470 for more information. ILLUMINATING PHRASES</p>
        <p>"Translucent Writings," opening today at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, spans 30 years of that particular form of art in which words and language are combined with video and/or light. It was organized by the museum and Grita Insam, owner of Grita Insam Galleries in Vienna. It continues through April 3.</p>
        <p>The 19 artists in the show represent 12 countries, including the United States, and each work is focused on words as art in conjunction with light beams, flashes, projections and neon. Complex meanings, symbols and philosophies inherent in the pieces may be lost on the viewer who is accustomed to straightforward oils and watercolors, but exploration of this new territory continues to expand.</p>
        <p>One of the installations is by Peter Weibel, Austrian contributor to the 1993 Venice Biennale. Titled "Cultural Exodus From Austria," it consists of screens inscribed with the names of Austria's artists and intellectuals who fled the country during Nazi occupation.</p>
        <p>Jenny Holzer, an American artist, uses words in lights, usually ironies or platitudes about sex and politics. Viewed as isolated moving signs, they assume a sudden importance.</p>
        <p>The museum is on the campus of Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road. Visiting hours are Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is free. The number to call is 251-6100. ELEANOR CHARLES</p>
