        <p>LEAD: George Bush insisted during the Presidential campaign that he was an environmentalist. Skeptics saw little proof in his record. But his word may be easier to accept now that he has nominated William Reilly to head the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>George Bush insisted during the Presidential campaign that he was an environmentalist. Skeptics saw little proof in his record. But his word may be easier to accept now that he has nominated William Reilly to head the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush packaged the E.P.A. job with his choice of Representative Manuel Lujan, a New Mexico Republican, to be Secretary of the Interior. Mr. Lujan's environmental credentials are far less strong. But together, the two nominees promise more than environmentalists have been used to under Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly, a lawyer, has devoted his career to protecting the environment. He is president of the World Wildlife Fund and of the Conservation Foundation, a research group respected for its careful views and undogmatic reports. When efforts to clean up abandoned toxic dumps bogged down in litigation, he helped break the impasse by founding Clean Sites, a group that mediates cleanup settlements between polluters and the Government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly has long been interested in pollution problems abroad, and is well prepared to address issues of international reach, like the greenhouse effect and the threat to the ozone layer. ''The country faces an array of environmental effects even more daunting than pollution crises of the past generation,'' he wrote in his foundation's latest ''State of the Environment'' report. He will now have a well-earned chance to frame the solutions.</p>
        <p>Lee Thomas, whom he succeeds, administered the E.P.A. with distinction. Within the limits set by the White House, Mr. Thomas made notable strides rebuilding the agency from the ruins left by Anne Burford, Mr. Reagan's first Administrator. His successes include banning uses of asbestos and helping secure the international treaty to protect the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Republicans are heirs to two traditions that often compete. Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot expressed the Eastern establishment's noblesse oblige commitment to protecting the environment. Mr. Reagan embodied the Western enterprisers who put development first. But his appointees, Mrs. Burford at E.P.A. and James Watt at Interior, wrenched their agencies full tilt toward exploiting the environment, leaving an indelible blot on Mr. Reagan's record.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has shown greater care and sensitivity in blending the two traditions. Mr. Lujan, formerly senior Republican on the House Interior Committee, has voted in favor of development projects like oil drilling in the Arctic wilderness. Yet there's no sign he shares the extremism of Reagan appointees like James Watt. By picking him and Mr. Reilly, Mr. Bush has made a sound start on keeping his environmental promises.</p>
