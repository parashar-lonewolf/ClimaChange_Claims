        <p>To the Editor: ''36 Hours: Whistler'' (Nov. 19) by David Laskin was written by someone who clearly lucked out and got there on a rare good day. I live just over the American border, and for years I made the four-hour trip to Whistler and Blackcomb with family and friends, once or twice every season. No longer.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, what we suspect to be global warming has deteriorated the condition of the slopes, with the result that skiing there is no longer worth it on a day-to-day basis. The reality is, Whistler is not located within a continental climate, and is thus prone to the increasingly wet, warm winds that pummel the rest of the Pacific Northwest each winter. With the costly lift tickets and accommodations that people must pay to ski at resorts, few people I know are willing to gamble their once- or twice-a-season ski holiday on the potentially poor conditions at Whistler.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: ''36 Hours: Whistler'' (Nov. 19) by David Laskin was written by someone who clearly lucked out and got there on a rare good day. I live just over the American border, and for years I made the four-hour trip to Whistler and Blackcomb with family and friends, once or twice every season. No longer.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, what we suspect to be global warming has deteriorated the condition of the slopes, with the result that skiing there is no longer worth it on a day-to-day basis. The reality is, Whistler is not located within a continental climate, and is thus prone to the increasingly wet, warm winds that pummel the rest of the Pacific Northwest each winter. With the costly lift tickets and accommodations that people must pay to ski at resorts, few people I know are willing to gamble their once- or twice-a-season ski holiday on the potentially poor conditions at Whistler.</p>
        <p>The last three times I was there, the snow was consistently slushy, the blowers were on constantly, and there was no skiing at all on the lower half of the mountain. On two of those days, it was raining at the top of Blackcomb, which is roughly 8,000 feet high.</p>
        <p>I agree with your writer that the food is great and the village ambience is fun. The views at the top are incredible. I wish the resort well, and I do sympathize with its possible problems staging the 2010 Winter Olympics if the weather during the Games turns rainy. For me, I now go to one of the many less-hyped ski areas a hundred miles or more east of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

        <p>Christina Moore, a spokeswoman for Whistler Blackcomb, replies: Whistler Blackcomb's location in the Coast Range brings an average of 33 feet of snow each season from pounding coastal storms. Around two-thirds, or 5,500 acres, of Whistler Blackcomb terrain is in an alpine microclimate, so visitors will find snowy conditions on most of the terrain they ski on a stormy day. It is extremely rare for the mountain peaks to receive rain in winter; it's unfortunate that your reader experienced it more than once. The resort's snowmaking infrastructure features 225 guns working to cover the lower slopes.</p>
