        <p>THE HUDSON</p>
        <p>A History.</p>
        <p>By Tom Lewis.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 340 pp. Yale University Press. $30.</p>
        <p>A thing about rivers as described by humans -- or maybe a thing about the humans that describe them -- is that each river is often like no other; particular streams are graded above others, even through rivers are, apologies to Heraclitus, in their always differentness always the same. The Columbia is the hydrological powerhouse, the Colorado the great Western irrigator. The Mississippi is the country-crossing stream that is most often read like a gentle poem through the heartland, even when it swells and destroys. The Hudson -- not particularly long, not notably central vis-Ã -vis the modern United States, not a great hydropower source -- is depicted in ''The Hudson: A History,'' by Tom Lewis, as the great national theater, America's staging ground, and, like most rivers, as special, even if it isn't really. ''From the beginning the water and the land, the flora and the fauna, the geography and the geology, the light and even the smells, have combined to make the Hudson River valley a unique place in America,'' Lewis writes. ''The natural river and the valley through which it flows have served as a vast stage on which we have acted out our ambitions and desires, however noble or ignoble they might be. And always the Hudson's rich landscape has helped to shape our actions.''</p>
        <p>If Robert H. Boyle's classic, ''The Hudson River,'' is about the natural nuts and bolts of the river, then Lewis's book presents the river's great dramatis personae, and Lewis tells us what people have been thinking when they were thinking Hudson over the years -- one of the earliest ideas being that, like the rest of what cartographers were calling America in the 17th century, the river was a way point, a short cut, just a rest stop on the road to Cathay. In 1609, Henry Hudson, the notoriously nasty English captain, was not even supposed to go there. The Dutch hired him to go north. After a month headed toward Greenland, he sailed west under the threat of mutiny by the crew of the Half Moon -- a cramped ship jammed with Dutch and English sailors who did not like one another -- and then ran into a mast-toppling storm that forced him to land in Maine, where the crew repaired the boat and ''behave[d] badly'' among the Native Americans; i.e., killed 12 people. A few days south, they spotted ''a very good Land to fall with, and a pleasant Land to see,'' anchored off Manhattan and proceeded to sail north again. At each bend in the river, they expected China.</p>
        <p>The shortcut idea bankrupt, the Dutch sent out Hendrick Christiaensen a year or so later to investigate Hudson's find. (Hudson sailed north again and was set adrift without supplies by what would be his last unhappy crew.) The new theme of the river for the Dutch became rodent -- specifically beaver, another word for guilder. The Dutch West India Company, a quasi-military, state-sponsored corporation (think Halliburton), took over the valley, the corporate board calling itself ''the Nineteen.'' In hopes of picking up the pace of development and pelt procurement, the Nineteen offered huge plots along the Hudson to the first patroons, who got land in perpetuity and the power to appoint judges and administer civil and criminal justice. Thus was begun a long line of landowners that can be traced from Robert Livingston, a secretary who married his old Dutch patroon's wife (''No, no, send him away,'' Nicholaes van Rensselaer said when Livingston visited his deathbed, ''he's going to marry my widow''), to famous Hudson Valley names like Schuyler, Van Cortlandt, Beekman, Philipse and Roosevelt. After a picnic with the king and queen of England on the banks of his Hudson in 1939, Roosevelt was chided for serving hot dogs. He responded that his family had lived on the Hudson longer than the Windsors had been in England. ''All that is in me goes back to the Hudson,'' Roosevelt often said.</p>
        <p>The patroons squabbled under various directors. Dutch governors came and left, and after the Treaty of Westminster, in 1674, British governors came and left. ''However well the affairs of those living in the Hudson Valley went, the condition of their lives -- the clothes they wore, the money they made, the liquor they drank, the places where they worshiped, the land that they rented or owned -- was bound, always, to the words and deeds and caprices of monarchs and ministers in London and Paris,'' Lewis writes. During the Revolutionary War, the Hudson was central to the military strategy of both sides: control of the Hudson would split the colonies in half or cut off access between British troops in New York and British troops in Canada. George Washington ordered a chain stretched across the Hudson at West Point to thwart British shipping (a chain, Lewis reports, that, according to recent computer modeling, would have easily snapped if tested). Coming south from Canada was Gen. John Burgoyne, a k a Gentleman Johnny, a British commander so confident he burned bridges in his rear. His long supply line cut off in the woods, he watched as his entire army was taken, the insurgent colonials trapping him in a crease in the Hudson Valley at Saratoga. ''I am glad to see you,'' the American commander, Gen. Horatio Gates, said to Burgoyne. ''I am not glad to see you,'' Gentleman Johnny replied. ''It is my fortune, sir, and not my fault that I am here.''</p>
        <p>A fter the war, the center of government in the colonies moved to Philadelphia, then Washington, but the financial capital was the Hudson's deep-water port. New York City was a part of the so-called Cotton Triangle: ships carrying cotton sailed from New Orleans to Liverpool (or, later, straight to New York) and then returned to New York with European goods, the port handling lucrative freight and shipping and insurance charges. Slavery had been banned in 1827 in New York, but the city still relied on it. ''At the same time that Philadelphians were cultivating good works and Bostonians were professing abolitionist ideals,'' Lewis says, ''New Yorkers busied themselves with commerce without much concern for conscience.'' All along the Hudson, people cheered when Abraham Lincoln visited just after his election. In New York, at Astor House, Walt Whitman happened to see Lincoln arrive as the crowd stood silent: ''not a voice -- not a sound.''</p>
        <p>Beginning in the 1800's, two Hudsons existed simultaneously -- the Hudson of utility, the provider of riches; and the beautiful Hudson, the Hudson of the imagination. Around the time Cornelius Vanderbilt was making a killing with the steamboats on the Hudson, Washington Irving was becoming famous for his fictional history of the river, for characters like Rip Van Winkle, who sees from the hills, in Irving's words, ''the lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging bark here and there sleeping in its glassy bosom, and at last losing itself in the blue highlands.'' Hudson River School painters like Thomas Cole took up where Irving left off, painting the wildness at a time when American painters were selling tranquil European landscapes, vistas with falling-down villas. William Cullen Bryant said that nature as his friend Cole painted it ''was fresher from the hand of Him who made it.'' These radically savage scenes were what Lewis calls the ''distinctly American landscape'' in which young America thought it saw God and thought it saw God nodding: a scenic exceptionalism that, in addition to sparking tourism, fanned the flames of Manifest Destiny and all the various exceptionalisms that continue today.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the woods the Hudson River Painters painted were being raped. In the 1820's, for instance, Zadock Pratt built the world's largest tannery at Schohariekill, not far from Thomas Cole's house. Pratt tanned 60,000 hides a year, using 6,000 cords of hemlock bark and giving his workers ''1,000 years of labor at $14 per month,'' in addition to homes, schools and churches -- until 1845, when parts of the Catskills looked lunar, all the hemlock trees gone, a scene from ''The Lorax.'' Pratt closed the tannery, won a seat in Congress, championed the Washington Monument, then moved back to Schohariekill, renamed Prattsville, where he paid farmers to allow him to set their barns on fire -- another kind of landscape artistry. Cole described Pratt's ilk as ''unconscious of the harmony of creation.'' Cole's romanticism made him unable to see the particular utilitarian beauty of the river valley that Pratt saw.</p>
        <p>''The Hudson'' has a happy ending. ''In the seventh decade of the 20th century, the river became central to a new chapter in America's history, one that emphasized the importance of the environment,'' Lewis writes. The patroons finally let go of their land, turning it over as parks, inviting over the neighbors, by now employees of I.B.M., for lawn parties. Toxic dumping -- rampant by the 1960's -- was stopped, thanks to citizens' groups like Scenic Hudson, volunteer river patrols by Riverkeeper and the Clearwater, a modern Dutch sloop, which seemed crazy when Pete Seeger first dreamed it but is now a standard feature of the current version of the river. Lewis writes: ''The future of the Hudson holds great promise.'' In parts of it, you can even swim.</p>
        <p>But that happiness masks our conflicting ideas about the Hudson and about rivers everywhere: the difference between the river that we think of as wannabe environmentalists, as aesthetic (or just touristic) descendants of Cole and Bryant, and the river that we use (mostly unconsciously) as drivers spewing chemicals, as consumers of chemically treated farm products, as flushers and down-the-drainers and accidental acid rain promoters. Bigger than Big Brother, more powerful than pantheism, watersheds are everywhere, and we still have to find a way to reconcile the way we dream of a river and the way we live with it.</p>
