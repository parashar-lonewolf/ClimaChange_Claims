        <p>LEAD: Robert Redford has been a godfather to the American independent film movement of the 1980's, energizing it with his money and his prestige. Now the actor is looking beyond the borders of the United States.</p>
        <p>Robert Redford has been a godfather to the American independent film movement of the 1980's, energizing it with his money and his prestige. Now the actor is looking beyond the borders of the United States.</p>
        <p>A year ago he talked the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez into visiting his Sundance Institute. The outcome was ''Dangerous Loves,'' a series of six movies - from Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, Mexico and Spain - based on original stories by Mr. Garcia Marquez. Although Sundance did not finance the movies, it spotlighted them and their directors at the United States Film Festival the institute sponsored here last week.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Redford was standing in the snow in his blue and gold ski vest surrounded by the six directors, who had asked for a photograph.</p>
        <p>In his drive for cultural exchange, Mr. Redford also presented ''Solovki Power,'' a harrowing documentary about one of the most notorious of Stalin's camps for political prisoners. Marina Goldovskaya, the director and cinematographer of ''Solovki Power,'' told a festival audience: ''To make this documentary would have been absolutely impossible before Gorbachev. I had no belief it would ever reach the screen. My mother said, 'You are committing suicide.' ''</p>
        <p>Instead, Ms. Goldovskaya said, the movie is scheduled to play throughout the Soviet Union this spring. ''The authorities told me it should be seen by every child.'' The Utah Redford</p>
        <p>Reticent and elusive on the streets of New York or in the restaurants of Los Angeles, Mr. Redford seems another person in Utah, his legal residence, where he retreats to the mountains six months a year. Unruffled, he allows himself to be surrounded by crowds after screenings and seminars.</p>
        <p>''It does delay your day,'' he said good-naturedly.</p>
        <p>In recent years the star of ''The Sting'' and ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' has become the director and producer of ''Ordinary People,'' for which he won an Academy Award, and ''The Milagro Beanfield War.'' This year he plans to direct ''The Dark Wind,'' the first of a series of low-budget films based on the mystery novels of Tony Hillerman. Just as he was drawn to ''Milagro,'' he said, because ''it dealt with the mystical aspects of New Mexico culture,'' he is interested in the Hillerman novels partly because the heroes are Navajo policemen. ''These pictures are meant to show the Indian culture, but not in a breast-beating way,'' he said. #2 Acres Become 5,000 Mr. Redford came to Utah in 1961 ''as an alternative to urban life.'' He bought two acres of land near Mount Timpanogus in the Wasatch Range. It was all he could afford at the time, and he built his house himself.</p>
        <p>''Whenever I could afford it, I bought another 5 acres here, another 10 acres there,'' he said. In skiing, he found something he describes as ''either poetry and danger mixed'' or ''some form of music.'' He said: ''There's a lot of physical and emotional freedom, and sometimes spiritual freedom. No run down the hill is ever the same.''</p>
        <p>He now owns 5,000 acres. He has turned a small ski area he bought in 1968 into a resort with 200 bedrooms, 2 restaurants, 35 ski runs, 18,000 square feet of banquet facilities and a fast-food cafeteria on top of the mountain. The general store sells jewelry and rugs made by Navajo, Hopi and Zuni Indians.</p>
        <p>The profits from the resort help support his nonprofit Sundance Institute for independent film makers, which he calls the Lab, even though ''that sounds like a lot of mice running around in a cage.''</p>
        <p>There is also a second nonprofit foundation, his Institute for Resource Management, which will hold a conference on global warming this spring.</p>
        <p>He describes the Sundance Institute, which he founded in 1980, as ''a rehearsal workshop for film makers,'' his model being the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. ''It's difficult to treat films as theater because of the cost of the equipment,'' he said. Education Through Work</p>
        <p>''I'm not very objective about it,'' he added. ''But Sundance created an opportunity of education through work that didn't exist before. I believe in the importance of diversity in film. The institute contributes to keeping diversity alive.''</p>
        <p>Sundance, which has a yearly budget of $2 million, much of it from grants, invites independent film makers to work with well-known cinematographers, writers, editors and directors in summer workshops. Out of 600 scripts submitted, perhaps a dozen are chosen to be developed at the workshops. In the summer, Mr. Redford rides his motorcycle or one of his horses down to the institute from his house a few miles away. In the winter, he is more apt to ski down.</p>
        <p>Of the 17 feature films in competition at last week's film festival, only ''84 Charlie Mopic,'' the story of a Vietnam patrol that goes horribly wrong, was developed at Sundance. The festival also presented the first film Sundance has produced, ''Yosemite: The Fate of Heaven.'' A documentary about the conflict between preservation and public enjoyment, ''Yosemite'' was narrated by Mr. Redford and directed by Jon Else, the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation award. Mr. Redford sees it as the first in a series of Sundance documentaries about America's heritage.</p>
        <p>The festival, which Sundance has sponsored since 1985, is a way of letting independent film makers exhibit their work. But it got out of hand last year, the actor says. There were too many Hollywood guests and too much Hollywood hype.</p>
        <p>''We deliberately pulled back on celebrities and premieres this year,'' he said. ''The more celebrity-oriented the festival is, the greater danger of losing the feeling of scale. This year, the film maker was the star.''</p>
