        <p>ANYONE who suspects that it is close to impossible to feel paternal about atomic particles hasn't done time -- in a college classroom, a Senate hearing room, a nuclear laboratory -- with the father of heavy ion science, Dr. D. Allan Bromley, Yale's avuncular, bow-tied, rarely tongue-tied dean of engineering.</p>
        <p>Yes, he heaped normal fatherly attention on his two children, but Dr. Bromley, a widower and three times a grandfather, can't help wax paternal about his enduring relationship with the atom, the thing he has spent decades smashing, studying and, much as he did with his mother's sewing machine when he was a boy, taking apart just to see what's inside.</p>
        <p>And he is so bullish about Yale's need to keep pushing the envelope on atomic research and engineering that he has spent six years convincing colleagues and benefactors that a $500 million expansion of the science and engineering departments, announced last week, is crucial to the university's ability to recruit and graduate the leading players of the 21st century. Dr. Bromley hopes to observe the construction from the window of his clubby corner office.</p>
        <p>Next month Dr. Bromley, who holds no grudge about the rejection letter Yale sent him when he applied to graduate school in 1948, celebrates his 40th anniversary on the faculty, a long leap for a Canadian boy who got into college on the merits of a tuition-winning essay called ''The Evils of Alcohol.'' He was so beholden to the scholarship's sponsor, the Women's Canadian Temperance Foundation, that he swore off alcohol for the entirety of his undergraduate career at Queen's University.</p>
        <p>''I made up for it later,'' Dr. Bromley admits. When he wasn't busy in his atomic bunker at Yale, he says, he was souping up his home stereo system to two kilowatts. ''It shook the leaves on the trees outside.''</p>
        <p>There has always been a tinge of the nutty professor lurking beneath his Savile Row splendor (he owns more than a thousand bow ties) and Mr. Chips orations. (He cut his lecturing teeth as an amateur preacher at St. Andrew's Presbyterian in his hometown, Westmeath, Ontario.)</p>
        <p>''Of course, as a nuclear scientist, you do your research and calculations with care, but sometimes,'' he confesses, sitting ramrod straight in an office armchair as he fends off a case of winter flu with the nonnuclear remedy of hot tea and a carrot muffin, ''you have to have your adventures.'' Don't tell his life insurance company, but he has had a few.</p>
        <p>About 30 years ago he jumped inside the balky accelerator he had built at Yale, slammed the door and had his assistants turn it on and rev it up ''to two atmospheres'' to see why it wasn't combusting. ''For all I knew it could have blown a lightning bolt right through me.'' In 1970, again for a good cause (''I love knowing how things work.''), he risked vaporization to see a simulated triggering of a genuine H-bomb in ''the nuclear flats'' north of Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''It was ingenious as all hell,'' recounts the scientist, who claims he ran the risk ''of being shot and buried when they realized I wasn't an American citizen and wasn't supposed to see the deepest, darkest secret known to the U.S at that time.''</p>
        <p>ARE there darker secrets now? Dr. Bromley, who was quickly sworn in as a United States citizen that day in a roadside ceremony attended by a judge and some tumbleweeds, isn't disclosing any. The same goes for his unofficial role advising presidential hopeful George W. Bush on the science and technology issues best suited to a successful election campaign.</p>
        <p>Now 73 but decidedly nongeriatric even after a series of open heart surgeries and, as of last May, a fascinated recipient of nuclear medicine in the form of a radioactive seed implant for prostate cancer (''It works, it works!''), the man is a consummate atom-smasher from back when nuclear physicists were curiosities rather than cultivators of the future.</p>
        <p>A fire-and-brimstone scientist (intonations like his usually emit from pulpits) with a 22-page resume, Dr. Bromley has a Rolodex that hard-wires him to the captains of industrial technology as well as to the policy makers of Capitol Hill. He has long believed that ''engineering is the interface between the new technology that's pouring out of the research labs and the needs of society.'' Once Yale forged into this expensive expansion, his reputation for atomic research and atomic-powered grant-getting figured large as collateral.</p>
        <p>He is, if he does say so himself -- and likes to -- widely regarded as the father of modern heavy ion science. Which means he has spent the last four decades in atomic research, give or take a few years when he went to the White House as science and technology adviser to President George Bush (Yale '48), a perk of which was his heated debate about global warming with Al Gore, then a senator. (''I would like to think he can't become president.'') And don't get him going on homeopathic medicine: ''I'm trying to kill it!''</p>
        <p>Mostly he has spent life probing atomic nuclei with a series of precision instruments, the latest a one-of-a-kind, $60-million, 25-million-volt Extended Stretched Trans Uranium accelerator. Fluoride in toothpaste, titanium nitride in prostheses and the irradiation of pancreatic cancers are all positive fallout from that type of research, he says.</p>
        <p>He came by his devotion to scientific technology the hard way, growing up on a hardscrabble cattle farm on the northernmost border of Ontario, where conveniences like electricity and indoor plumbing were figments of the future. For him, cold fusion meant 60-degrees-below-zero winters. He attended a one-room school, most years in a class of one.</p>
        <p>In some ways, he still is.  PUBLIC LIVES</p>
