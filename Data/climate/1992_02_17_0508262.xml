        <p>Last night's fourth Democratic Presidential debate fell short in its most special characteristic. The event, broadcast by the Cable News Network, was plenty Democratic and plenty Presidential; all five contenders assailed George Bush with relish. There was plenty of debate as they repeatedly challenged one another. The missing dimension turned on the word</p>
        <p>fourth.</p>
        <p>CNN added some appealing further innovations to the debate format, building on those of the three previous debates in the last two months. Variety was created by using different formats. In the first segment, for instance, the interviewers focused on one candidate at a time.</p>
        <p>The problem lay in the questions, often basic and repetitive, posed as though the candidates had not been put through virtually the same hoops only 16 days ago. The whole idea of repeated appearances offers a valuable benefit: giving the candidates time to elaborate and explain, building from one debate to the next. Dutifully to repeat a litany of basic questions on defense, trade, health and taxes vitiates that potential -- and risks making the candidates' positions sound dog-eared and dull.</p>
        <p>For instance, at least three of the five continued to talk grandly, and vapidly, about industrial policy without being pressed to say what they meant.  Likewise, fanciful questions (like, How would you spend $10 billion, to help Russia or to help American workers?) can elicit interesting answers, if followed up.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this debate was the absence of any word about Gov. Bill Clinton's personal life, even though Bernard Shaw, the moderator, offered an opening by asking what qualities the country needs. Jerry Brown, quick-witted debater, turned the question on Paul Tsongas, deriding him as a conservative. The other four turned it on President Bush for, among other things, his lack of core (Tsongas) and his 10-year denial of social problems (Clinton).</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas sported glasses that transformed his formerly mournful mien. He and Senator Kerrey spoke with conviction about global warming, and Governor Clinton seized an opportunity to speak for all five men in urging Mr. Bush to act against it this week. Senator Tom Harkin again was given to manly metaphors, and talked directly to New Hampshire by describing his proposed moratorium on home foreclosures.</p>
        <p>There's not likely to be a fifth debate involving all five men. New Hampshire voters will most likely thin out the field sharply on Tuesday. Thus, when 90 minutes no longer must be divided five ways, there will be more time to delve for depth. Even so, the lesson from Sunday night remains: Better deep than dutiful.</p>
