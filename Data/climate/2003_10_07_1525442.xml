        <p>Testing a broad region across Texas, Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas, scientists have measured high levels of gases that react with sunlight to create smog. In many spots, concentrations of the gases exceeded levels typical of cities like Los Angeles, Houston and New York. In this week's online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers, from the University of California at Irvine, said the gases, including methane, butane and propane, were released by oil and natural gas refineries. The researchers estimated that several million tons of methane were released this way each year. Besides contributing to smog, methane is a heat-trapping gas linked to global warming.</p>
