        <p>It is so refreshing to see an environmentalist like Nicholas D. Kristof being sensible about nuclear power.</p>
        <p>There really isn't any need to fight over these issues. No one wants air pollution. No one wants to fill the air with carbon dioxide. But there isn't any sensible way around coal except to go with nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have scared themselves to death on this issue. Or they listen to blather about covering whole states with biofuel crops and windmills just so we don't have to build a few nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>It's even better than Mr. Kristof says. Once we get a nuclear fleet up, we can start running cars on electricity or hydrogen from electricity. Then we can kiss our oil dependency goodbye as well.</p>
