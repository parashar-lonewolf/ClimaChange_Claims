        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Abolish the White House Lawn" (Op-Ed, May 5) perpetuates the myths and unfounded assertions that healthy lawn maintenance contrib utes to water pollution via runoff and leaching of fertilizers and pesticides. Michael Pollan seems to suggest he is advocating an "environmentally correct" approach when he says "the lawn is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our relationship to the land."</p>
        <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. In addition to providing meaningful esthetic value, a healthy lawn fulfills an important role in the environment. The turf grass releases oxygen into the environment, purifies the air by absorbing sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide and controls the largest water pollutant: sediment from soil erosion.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that an acre of turf will have the cooling effect of a 70-ton air conditioner: why doesn't Mr. Pollan advocate removal of the White House air-conditioning unit instead?</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollan claims that because the White House lawn is a "lush, supergreen and weed-free carpet," it therefore is "being maintained with frequent, heavy doses of poison." This is absurd logic. The more likely explanation, though less demagogic: The lawn looks good because the correct rates of fertilizer and pest controls are being used.</p>
        <p>Well-maintained turf yields a number of benefits Mr. Pollan left out, and his position that the lawn serves only a cosmetic purpose demonstrates he lacks breadth of view on the subject.  KEITH GUTHRIE Marietta, Ga., May 7, 1991</p>
