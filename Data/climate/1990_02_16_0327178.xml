        <p>LEAD: It's no secret that John Sununu and William Reilly clash on environmental issues, but it's also no scandal. Disagreement between the White House chief of staff and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency provides a constructive way to help President Bush make policy.</p>
        <p>It's no secret that John Sununu and William Reilly clash on environmental issues, but it's also no scandal. Disagreement between the White House chief of staff and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency provides a constructive way to help President Bush make policy.</p>
        <p>Many environmentalists see Mr. Sununu as their adversary and Mr. Reilly as their champion. Mr. Sununu was trained as a mechanical engineer; as Governor of New Hampshire he supported the nuclear power plant at Seabrook. But that's a one-sided reason for disputing someone's environmental credentials. Nuclear power plants produce neither acid rain nor greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly is obviously a committed environmentalist. But the Conservation Foundation, which he headed, is among the more moderate environmental groups; in dealing with industry, it prefers mediation to confrontation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu can be heavy-handed, as in his recent editing of a speech that prevented Mr. Reilly from putting the best face on the Administration's approach to greenhouse warming. But balancing and managing politics is a legitimate, indeed central duty of a White House chief of staff. And when he has brought his special expertise to bear, as in criticizing the still-fuzzy computer programs that forecast global warming, his engineer's practical sense has been salubrious.</p>
        <p>The test of the Reilly-Sununu relationship is the quality of the environmental program that emerges. Mr. Reilly has given the President a strong position on clean air legislation, but Mr. Sununu has questioned what he feels might be a premature commitment to alternative fuels. Mr. Reilly is vigorously protecting wetlands. Mr. Sununu intervened to spare Alaska from an unduly heavy burden.</p>
        <p>The jousting between Mr. Sununu and Mr. Reilly may yield the progressive but not excessive environmental policy Mr. Bush says he wants. But the final arbiter is the President himself.</p>
