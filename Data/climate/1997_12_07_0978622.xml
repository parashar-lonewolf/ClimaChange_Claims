        <p>WHAT ever happened to global Kumbaya  the we-are-the-world cooperative spirit that seemed only yesterday to have replaced the cold war?</p>
        <p>Look at the headlines of the last few weeks:</p>
        <p>* Most of America's closest allies refused to consider military action to force Saddam Hussein to admit United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq.</p>
        <p>* Congress refused to give President Clinton the authority to negotiate trade agreements with the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>* Efforts to reduce global warming are mired in disagreements large and small at a big summit meeting in Japan.</p>
        <p>* The United States, China and Russia, big producers of land mines, refused to join 120 other nations signing a treaty in Ottawa banning the deadliest of the devices.</p>
        <p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. Early in the 1990's, dozens of countries joined the American-led military coalition to oust President Hussein's forces from Kuwait. The North American Free Trade Agreement and the enlargement of the world's trading system promised to topple trade barriers east and west, north and south. The United States and other developed nations set ambitious goals to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases at an environmental summit meeting in Brazil. And disarmament of all sorts was de rigeur.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that all the New Age collegiality was fleeting, or maybe just overstated. It was an afterglow of the end of the cold war, not the light of the future. Appearances to the contrary, countries had not redefined self-interest to mean the greatest global good.</p>
        <p>''The United States had won the cold war and was at the pinnacle of its power, so all the policies and preferences of the United States were translated into international politics,'' said Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of Foreign Affairs. ''That was a momentary peak.''</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that there are not forces -- trade and technology, for example -- driving countries slowly but surely toward greater integration and cooperation. It is just that an interplay of old national interests and new centers of power has made the process much more complex and unpredictable.</p>
        <p>Among the players beyond governmental control these days are nonprofit organizations armed not with weapons but with new technologies to pursue their agendas. The land-mine treaty, for example, might never have happened without an intensive campaign by private groups using high-speed, inexpensive global communications via the Internet and E-mail. And so the United States and Russia, the powers pivotal to big weapons agreements of the recent past, were left on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>New Issues</p>
        <p>The absence of global military tensions has given both countries and peoples a range of new issues to choose from in defining national security. Jessica Mathews, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has written about the new search for ''human security'' emerging ''from the conditions of daily life -- food, shelter, employment, health, public safety -- rather than flowing downward from a country's foreign relations and military strength.''</p>
        <p>Finally, when it comes to the pursuit of national self-interest, it's hard to ignore the world's pre-eminent power. Some of the erosion of global goodwill can be attributed to annoyance over the United States' penchant for domestically driven economic sanctions -- against Cuba and Iran, for example -- and its refusal to compromise on smaller issues. If the United States had agreed to let a Frenchman head the southern command of NATO and had not tried to curb French investment in Iran, would France have been more amenable to military action against Iraq?</p>
        <p>'Transgovernmentalism'</p>
        <p>The dissipation of hopes for global amity has prompted an esoteric debate among academics and experts about what exactly is going on.</p>
        <p>In a recent article in Foreign Affairs titled ''The Real New World Order,'' Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Harvard law professor, argued that ''liberal internationalism'' -- under which institutions like the United Nations kept the peace after the cold war -- had been replaced by a ''new medievalism,'' with the nation-state in permanent decline. But actually something called ''transgovernmentalism'' is becoming ''the most widespread form of international governance,'' she wrote. By that she means not that the state is disappearing, but that government agencies, including courts, regulatory structures, even legislatures, are building global networks with their counterparts abroad.</p>
        <p>Joseph S. Nye, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, has launched a project called ''Visions of Governance for the 21st Century.'' He has gone mathematical, offering a nine-cell matrix to describe the factors at work in governmental decisions today: national, subnational and supranational forces intersecting with the private sector, governments and nonprofit groups.</p>
        <p>Despite all the messiness, the United States and the international community appear to have cooperated well in the new war against economic collapse -- most recently with the current plan to bail out South Korea. They have marshaled their forces and taken swift, dramatic action to prevent instability.</p>
        <p>''After the financial crisis in Mexico, there was talk about the principle of regional responsibility and leaving it to the United States,'' said Lawrence S. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. ''Now, with the Korean crisis, there is a general recognition of the principles of global responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the more than $60 billion in loans to bail out South Korea will have to come from the world's taxpayers, so there is only so much patience for this sort of financial rescue.</p>
        <p>There are other examples of New Age cooperation. NATO is drawing up plans that would keep NATO troops in Bosnia when their mandate runs out next June. And NATO's addition of three members from the former Warsaw Pact is proceeding better than expected.</p>
        <p>''Obviously there are some things in which the international community is working in a collective fashion and some in which it is struggling,'' said Robert Zoellick, an Under Secretary of State during the Bush Administration. ''It's not all or nothing.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Zoellick, Mr. Zakaria and other foreign policy experts faulted the Clinton Administration for failing to develop long-term strategies for some of the world's thorniest problems, like Persian Gulf security.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of effort to maintain the world,'' said Mr. Zakaria. ''But the Adminsitration hasn't prioritized. You can't keep saying, 'I want your cooperation on everything.' ''</p>
