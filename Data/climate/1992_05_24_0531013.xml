        <p>The Bush Administration has drawn sharp criticism for weakening the global warming treaty that will be signed at the United Nations environmental summit in Brazil next month. The treaty will set no firm targets and timetables for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases that could alter world climate. It will simply require countries to adopt greenhouse-reduction programs.</p>
        <p>But the Administration's opposition to mandatory limits was on solid ground -- the need is not yet proved and the cost could be high. The Administration's real failure is more fundamental. Even by its own "no regrets" policy, the Administration is doing far too little to curb emissions.</p>

        <p>The Bush Administration has drawn sharp criticism for weakening the global warming treaty that will be signed at the United Nations environmental summit in Brazil next month. The treaty will set no firm targets and timetables for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases that could alter world climate. It will simply require countries to adopt greenhouse-reduction programs.</p>
        <p>But the Administration's opposition to mandatory limits was on solid ground -- the need is not yet proved and the cost could be high. The Administration's real failure is more fundamental. Even by its own "no regrets" policy, the Administration is doing far too little to curb emissions.</p>
        <p>Global warming remains perplexing because, despite years of study, there are enormous uncertainties. All experts agree that certain gases put into the atmosphere by human activities -- notably carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- trap heat and cause average temperatures to rise. But no one knows how much or how fast temperatures will rise and whether the increase will make much difference.</p>
        <p>The most authoritative estimate, by scientists assembled under U.N. auspices, projects that average global temperatures will rise about 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. That would probably not mean record-setting temperatures but rather more hot days or fewer frosty nights.</p>
        <p>Should it occur, such a change could cause serious damage. Sea level might rise about two feet, due to thermal expansion of the water and melting of ice, threatening low-lying areas. Hurricanes might become more forceful. Weather changes might disrupt agriculture.</p>
        <p>Cataclysmic change, though unlikely, is at least conceivable, perhaps a sudden shift of ocean currents that now warm or cool some regions, or breakup of the huge West Antarctic Ice Sheet, boosting sea levels by 15 feet.</p>
        <p>Still, the evidence remains murky. Average world temperatures rose 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past century, but whether greenhouse gases or other factors were responsible isn't known. Disconcertingly, temperatures flattened or fell from 1940 to 1970 just as greenhouse emissions were soaring, perhaps because other pollutants cooled the earth by blocking sunlight. This year, after a string of hot years, temperatures are expected to fall again because of particles from a volcanic eruption. It could take a decade or two for scientists to square the conflicting signals.</p>
        <p>Despite all these uncertainties, most authorities agree that the risk is great enough to justify preventive steps. The Administration's approach, reasonable in principle, is to adopt multi-purpose measures that enhance the environment or energy security while also reducing greenhouse emissions. That way there will be "no regrets" even if global warming proves a false alarm.</p>
        <p>But in practice, the Administration is doing far less than it should. Its policies will reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions below 1990 levels and will slow the growth in emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, leaving levels in the year 2000 about 5 to 8 percent above 1990 levels. But then, carbon dioxide emissions will rise sharply.</p>
        <p>This need not happen as fast, or perhaps at all, if the Administration pursues its policy more vigorously. Its failure to propose a "no regrets" carbon tax, the strongest weapon available, shows more commitment to rhetoric than results.</p>
