        <p>The couple had enjoyed a Saturday afternoon of shopping at a mall in Wayne, but all that changed suddenly. As a young man was helping his fiance into his car, something whizzed by her head and splattered against the car window, leaving a pinkish paint splotch.</p>
        <p>A paintball rifle had been fired from a car passing about 20 feet away, and the incident was another of a growing number of assaults and acts of vandalism involving paintball guns that are being reported to police departments statewide.</p>
        <p>The woman and her fiance were not injured in the assault, which took place Nov. 14 at the Wayne Towne Center near the  Willowbrook Mall, but it left them unsettled.</p>
        <p>''It just missed her face,'' said Capt. Donald Stouthamer, commander of the investigative division of the Wayne police department. ''They think it's funny, because it's not going to kill anybody. They don't realize it could strike an eye and they could inflict some real pain.''</p>
        <p>Paintball guns cost from $50 to $1,200 and are legal as used in mock war games. They employ carbon dioxide canisters that fire gelatin balls filled with paint. A gun's hopper can hold anywhere from 40 to 300 paintballs.</p>
        <p>Paintball has been a popular game for almost two decades, providing the 9-to-5-workbound a chance to take their aggressions out in the woods or on special courses. Participants wear protective goggles and clothing and fire at other combatants in mock battles.</p>
        <p>But now the guns are turning up in other circumstances. Most of the problems reported in New Jersey have been property crimes, vandalism of cars, houses, windows and, as in a case of Lacey Township earlier this month, a basketball backboard.</p>
        <p>From a distance, the guns can be mistaken for real weapons, but under a New Jersey court ruling, they are not considered firearms and are not illegal; and the State Police do not keep records on their improper use.</p>
        <p>''We do not have statistics that tell us how many of these types of weapons, quote-unquote, are being utilized for purposes other than their intended use,'' said John Hagerty, a State Police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Officials in the International Association of Chiefs of Police and its counterpart in New Jersey say they have received no complaints of the guns' misuse from members.</p>
        <p>''I havent't heard of a new epidemic arising,'' said Robert DelCore, manager of training and education for the International Association.</p>
        <p>But officers on the front line like Captain Stouthamer have noted an increase. In Wayne alone, there have been at least 20 incidents since mid-October, mostly vandalism. And incidents have been reported in East Amwell, Edison, Keyport and Parsippany to name a few communities.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Carol Renda-Whalen, supervisor of the junvenile division of the Edison Police Department, said she had seen ''more cases lately where paintball guns are involved in criminal mischief.''</p>
        <p>''There's all of a sudden this popularity among younger kids,'' said Lieutenant Renda-Whalen. ''I guess it's a step up from 'tagging.' While graffiti remains a problem, this is something to compound it.''</p>
        <p>In one case earlier this month, five juveniles were arrested for firing at a house on Parker Road in Edison as they drove by. When the owner came out to complain, they shot at him, too.</p>
        <p>The same day of the assault at the Wayne mall, Captain Stouthamer said, four homes on Church Lane and Berdan Avenue were splattered with paintballs. One hit with such force it cracked the vinyl siding of one house.</p>
        <p>The previous night, Friday, Nov. 13, a car parked on Valley Road across from the police station was bombarded with paintballs.</p>
        <p>The most recent incident occurred last Sunday at 3:45 P.M., Captain Stouthamer said. A woman walking her dog heard ''three or four loud pops'' and felt something hit her suede coat. She was not injured, but the coat was covered with greenish-yellow paint. A suspect has been identified.</p>
        <p>On Halloween in 1997, two Wayne residents were injured in drive-by paint shootings, one an 11-year old boy who sustained painful welts on the arms and legs.</p>
        <p>Many incidents this year occurred around Halloween. In East Amwell, the night before Halloween, the State Police reported arresting five youths for firing a paint gun.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to say why this is happening,'' said Captain Stouthamer. ''There may be something exciting and glamorous about emulating drive-by shootings,'' he said. ''And these things are very menacing-looking. They make you look like Rambo. It may be more of a macho thing. These kids think they're not going to hurt anyone but gauge their success if they can hit some person.''</p>
        <p>Rob Pavlick, an owner of ET Paintball Supplies in Garfield, said the industry was also concerned about the growing number of incidents. ''I think it's horrible for the sport aside from the people it's happening to,'' Mr. Pavlick said.</p>
        <p>Because they are not classified as firearms, some questions have arisen over what charges to bring in the incidents. In the  shooting at the Wayne mall, the victims were able to get the license plate of the car. The police traced it and arrested a 19-year old Wayne man, Walter Quiroga.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quiroga, who is free on $10,000 bail, was charged with aggravated assault, an indictable offense, punishable with a five-year sentence.</p>
        <p>In Edison, charges have yet to be brought, but could include possession of a weapon, which by New Jersey law is defined as anything that is capable of inflicting bodily injury. A paintball gun becomes a weapon when used in illicit circumstances not intended for its use, according to the State Attorney General's office.</p>
        <p>Using a paintball gun under this definition would probably be a fourth-degree offense, punishable by up to 18 months. Other charges that could be brought include criminal mischief and the lesser disorderly persons violations.</p>
        <p>''These are very fact-sensitive cases that have to be determined on a case to case basis,'' said Stephen D. Moore, the Cape May County prosecutor who is president of the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Captain Stouthamer would like to see a law specific to the misuse of the guns.</p>
        <p>''We are taking it seriously,'' Captain Stouthamer said. ''We're hoping that the courts will take it seriously or legislators will come up with new laws to cover this new fad so that we'll have something better to deal with these people without having to use more severe charges like aggravated assault.''</p>
