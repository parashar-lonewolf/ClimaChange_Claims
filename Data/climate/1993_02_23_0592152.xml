        <p>Melting the Ice</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>If the polar ice caps were to melt completely, what would happen to the ocean level? How much dry land would be lost?</p>
        <p>A. Scientists have estimated how much the sea level would rise, but the exact amount of land lost would require a very complicated worldwide coastal survey. "Perhaps only the military knows," said Dr. Richard B. Alley, a glaciologist in the department of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University.</p>
        <p>Dr. Donald D. Blankenship of the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Texas at Austin said that melting the East Antarctic Ice Sheet would raise sea levels about 60 meters worldwide, or about 200 feet, while melting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would raise the level about 6 meters, or just under 20 feet.</p>
        <p>Greenland would also make a contribution, though it is viewed as being more stable than either of the halves of Antarctica, Dr. Blankenship said. The official estimates for the effect of a Greenland meltoff are between 7.1 meters and 7.4 meters, something less than 24 feet, Dr. Alley said.</p>
        <p>The potential total would thus be approximately 244 feet.</p>
        <p>If the ice at the North Pole melted, it would not affect sea levels much at all, Dr. Blankenship said, because it is frozen sea water itself, a giant ice cube of ocean that occupies just a few meters on the top. The concern is freshwater ice, he said, which comes from preciptation on the continents; if it melted, it could create a pulse of fresh water into the ocean.</p>
        <p>A wild guess of acreage lost would be based on figuring out how much of the ever-changing coastline, with an estimated slope of one foot in a thousand, would be below the new sea level, said Dr. Alley.</p>
        <p>Scientists would also have to account for continental rebound after the load from the Antarctic ice mass went away, Dr. Blankenship said. The weight has kept the continent below sea level, and if the load were removed, the mantle of the earth would move in to compensate. "Scandinavia is actually still rising from the ice load that left it about 10,000 years ago," he said. Fast Track for Ants</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>In the novel "Theophilus</p>
        <p>North," Thornton Wilder wrote, in regard to New York City, that "it has been reported by entomologists that even ants walk more quickly in this area." Is this true? A friend told me the cockroaches were more sluggish in Washington, D.C. If that is so, is it a climate difference or a species difference?</p>
        <p>A.  There are no absolute, cut-and-dried answers to such questions, said Dr. Betty Faber, an entomologist and staff scientist at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, N.J., but there may be reasons for insects to move more quickly in New York City than in some other cities.</p>
        <p>In parts of New York, especially in the summer, things may move faster than elsewhere because of the greater vibration of the ground, she said. "Certainly if the temperature is high and there's a lot of pavement, things may move more quickly," she suggested.</p>
        <p>If cockroaches are said to move faster, said Dr. Faber, a cockroach specialist, it is probably because of a species difference. "The German cockroach tends, at least up here, to move faster than the oriental roach, one of those commonly found in Washington, D.C.," she said.</p>
