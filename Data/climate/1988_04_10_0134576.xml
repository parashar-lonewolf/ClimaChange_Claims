        <p>LEAD: The article March 6 about the rise in tipping fees at resource recovery facilities (''Towns Facing Bigger Bills for Trash'') misses an opportunity to look at some larger issues of the solid-waste problem.</p>
        <p>The article March 6 about the rise in tipping fees at resource recovery facilities (''Towns Facing Bigger Bills for Trash'') misses an opportunity to look at some larger issues of the solid-waste problem.</p>
        <p>The average person in Connecticut produces about 0.8 tons of trash per year, or 3.2 tons for a family of four. If 25 percent is recycled, as state law will require, 2.4 tons will go to a trash-to-energy facility - with a tipping cost of $196.80 at the Windham facility.</p>
        <p>In an era when that same family can easily spend $20 for one meal at a fast-food restaurant, less than $200 per year to get rid of 2.4 tons of mixed waste seems like a bargain.</p>
        <p>That waste could contain disposable diapers, paint and pesticide containers, Styrofoam packaging, food waste, dog and cat feces, papers printed with toxic heavy metal inks and assorted other items.</p>
        <p>It is a wonder that trash disposal is so cheap. It is no wonder that many people are concerned about the ash and smoke produced by burning such a mixture.</p>
        <p>It is relevant to note that another family of four, which grows much of its food organically, composts its yard waste, faithfully recycles paper, bottles and cans, uses cloth diapers and largely avoids buying disposable items, excess packaging and toxic items, will have the same proportion of its taxes go for waste disposal as the family above.</p>
        <p>Transportation from home to the facility is another expense, although it is not frequently cited. Does anyone believe that we won't have a steep rise in the cost of transportation sometime in the 20-year planned life of these facilities?</p>
        <p>It also seems obvious that as taxpayers in Connecticut we could subsidize recycling industries up to $41 per ton and still save 50 percent on our waste disposal costs in addition to the enormous savings in energy and environmental costs that are realized by using recycled materials.</p>
        <p>Such subsidies might be grants to cities and schools to pay a higher price for recycled paper if it is more expensive, or low-interest loans to new recycling industries, or salary for an expert to identify all the state-and Federal-level disincentives to using recycled materials.</p>
        <p>Many of the materials that end up at the waste disposal facility already have a large dose of public subsidy and environmental degradation built into them. The plastic foam lunch tray used by thousands of Connecticut schoolchildren provides an illustration of this.</p>
        <p>Using our dwindling supply of oil for this short-term convenience has been encouraged by tax advantages and military support for oil producers. The chemicals used in its production may be destroying our protective ozone layer and nearly every step from the taking of the oil through the production of the foam to the burning of the trash produces some degradation of our air or water. All this is for only 5 to 10 minutes' use.</p>
        <p>Resource recovery facilities are like dinosaurs, demanding a wasteful society to satisfy their large 20-year appetite, exhaling foul breath and defecating heavy metal ashes. Although expensive, their real cost is that they keep us from looking at the larger environmental and tax subsidy questions.</p>
        <p>The true solution is to end economic incentives for the production of toxic products and wasteful packaging, and to include the environment, our common capital resource, in all economic equations.  BILL DUESING</p>
