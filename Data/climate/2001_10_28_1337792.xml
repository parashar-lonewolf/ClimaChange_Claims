        <p>''TALK to a dozen garlic growers,'' David Stern said, ''and they'll describe 12 different methods for growing garlic.'' Mr. Stern, a farmer whose Garlic Seed Foundation, an organization devoted to ''promotion, production, consumption of garlic,'' has heard them all. ''And most of them work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern's devotion to garlic started in the early 1980's when Cornell University asked him to research viable minor commercial crops for regional farmers. That was when he first realized that despite what many people might think, garlic is well suited to New England soils. The glacial soil's minerals combine with acid rain and build up in the bulbs of garlic, Allium sativum, compounding its gastronomic and medicinal punch.</p>
        <p>When he's not laboring in the fields of his Rose Valley Farm in Rose, N.Y., he'll gladly describe everything from the history of garlic (originally part of Marco Polo's booty) to its native region (for Allium sativum var. ophioscorodon, the hardneck garlic, that would be the valleys amid the Ural Mountains).</p>
        <p>And, despite the fact that the garlic in grocery stores is primarily produced as far away as California, Mexico or Argentina, the Garlic Seed Foundation has helped to position garlic as an important commercial crop for small local farmers.</p>
        <p>Consider the numbers: the Hudson Valley Garlic Festival, held in Saugerties, N.Y., the last full weekend each September, was attended by 42,000 this year, having swelled from 120 brave aficionados in 1989. Sixty growers from all over the Northeast, as well as Canada and Ohio, were selling their crops.</p>
        <p>Pat Reppert began the festival in 1989, and still is its host with the Saugerties Kiwanis Club. Mrs. Reppert lives and breathes garlic. She wrote ''Mad for Garlic'' (Quixote Press, Wever, Iowa, 1997) a cookbook composed of ''98 pages of heavy-duty garlic recipes, I mean serious in the sense that every recipe uses six to eight cloves and even the desserts have garlic,'' she said, citing garlic-frosted carrot cake.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Reppert's husband, Edmund, a cardiologist, said he planted more than six varieties of garlic in eight 30-foot rows to flavor the garlic ice cream and garlic fudge the family craves. Like many other growers, the Repperts buy reinforcements for planting at the festival.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to timing. Every grower has a method of cultivation, but nobody argues about planting dates. The planting cloves, or seed garlic, must get into the ground now if you hope to be enjoying garlic taffy next autumn. A sunny location is essential and good drainage is a plus. The finest, fattest bulbs are saved for planting to increase the bounty. Seeds are not an option, since garlic produces sterile flowers.</p>
        <p>Lee Bristol, a farmer from New Milford, Conn., grows 8,000 bulbs on a quarter acre. Mr. Bristol says it's futile to plant cloves from the grocery store, because it is treated with a growth inhibitor to prolong shelf life. And Mr. Stern says 99.9 percent of the garlic sold in supermarkets is softneck garlic (Allium sativum var. sativum), at which many garlic lovers turn up their noses.</p>
        <p>Softneck garlic forms those pearly bulbs that you find braided in the supermarket. Some would say the ability to be braided is its only virtue.  Diana Bristol, Lee's wife, was polite about it: because softneck garlic has small cloves and is mild, it's great for pressing and eating raw or sprinkling with basil on goat cheese.</p>
        <p>But according to aficionados, purists eat hardneck garlic, which can make your eyes water if eaten raw.  Its flavor is described as strong, complex and capable of all sorts of gastronomic feats and medicinal benefits that have been attributed to garlic since antiquity. Hardneck garlic is also hardier in cold climates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bristol had just plowed the field for garlic when I visited his Bloomingfields Farm the second week in October. He was marking out a grid of rows six inches apart. He buries each clove an inch deep and mulches it immediately with a thin layer of compost. Mr. Bristol admits that planting depth is a matter of debate. And David Stern maintains that a two- to three-inch planting depth works better for him, with no mulch. But then, his farm is not far from Lake Ontario with average snowfall higher than 14 feet.</p>
        <p>The important thing is to get plenty of root growth but no top sprouting before the ground freezes. ''And then go on vacation,'' suggested Mr. Stern, because nothing happens again until early spring when the bulbs sprout. That's when he suggests applying compost and watering if the season is dry. In May, the sterile flower scapes must be snapped off the hardneck varieties.  Watering, weeding and feeding should be done before June 21. ''Because on June 22, garlic begins to wind down,'' Mr. Stern explains. The foliage begins withering, and all the plant's energy goes into the bulb, which swells until mid-July. Then it's time to dig.</p>
        <p>Lee Bristol digs his garlic when all but five and a half leaves have browned. David Stern judges harvest time by digging and checking the plumpness of the bulbs -- if they're swollen and healthy, fine, dig. If they've pulled away from the central stem, the harvest will be prone to rot.  After digging, the garlic is bunched and hung upside down in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place for two weeks.</p>
        <p>Then it can be stored in any cool, well-ventilated place (Pat Reppert suggested a hanging wire basket in the pantry) until planting time. Refrigerators are anathema because of their humidity.</p>
        <p>Finally, a year after planting, the garlic is ready for the table (you can use it before then, but the flavor will not be as intense). But first, the crop is sorted. The best bulbs are used as ''seed.'' The rest is poised for shrimp scampi.</p>
