        <p>CALIFORNIA may be suddenly awash in electric power, and prices of oil and natural gas  may have fallen, but the solar electric power industry is still booming.</p>
        <p>Unlike fuel cells or microturbines, solar power is a proven technology, and it is becoming cheaper to produce. And AstroPower, a maker of solar cells, modules and panels, is a rarity in the sector: a profitable, stand-alone, publicly traded company. It can meet only about 60 percent of demand for its rooftop systems and is adding manufacturing capacity as fast as it can.</p>
        <p>''Our consumers know we are getting a little respite right now, but they really want to have control over their energy,'' said Allen M. Barnett, an electrical engineer who is the founder and chief executive of AstroPower, based in Newark, Del.</p>
        <p>Solar energy has been promoted as a clean solution ever since the energy crisis of the 1970's. But as prices of gas and oil fell and generally stayed low through the late 1990's, the solar alternative found only limited use.</p>
        <p>But a confluence of forces has expanded the market for solar power in the last two years, and various companies are pushing ahead, sensing the dawn of a big business. Solar divisions of multinational companies like BP, Siemens and Kyocera as well as smaller players like AstroPower and Evergreen Solar of Waltham, Mass., are vying to to reduce manufacturing costs for solar components and to supply businesses and consumers at competitive rates. Solar electric power was a $2.5 billion market last year, according to Clean Edge, a market research and consulting firm; it expects the market to grow to $23.5 billion by 2010.</p>
        <p>The biggest markets are in Germany and Japan, where government subsidies and public concern about global warming have promoted renewable energy sources. More than three-quarters of AstroPower's sales are overseas.</p>
        <p>And in the United States, the recent improvement in California's power supply has not alleviated some consumers' concerns about energy shortages and rising prices.  Some are seeking back-up energy sources for their homes, motivated in part by some government subsidies for using alternative power.</p>
        <p>In recent months, AstroPower has struck deals with three California home builders to include solar panels in new homes. Formed in 1989 out of the solar cell program at the University of Delaware, AstroPower went public in 1998 and has been profitable in all but one quarter since then.</p>
        <p>As a group, the stocks of companies offering ''clean'' energy technologies like wind, fuel cells and microturbines, as well as solar power, have been poor performers. On average, shares of 17 power technology companies tracked by CIBC WorldMarkets are off 63 percent from their peak on Sept. 15, 2000,compared with a 47 percent decline in the Nasdaq over the same period. In part, that is because of disappointing earnings reported earlier this month by two companies -- Active Power, a maker of flywheel-based power storage systems, and Capstone Turbine, a maker of microturbine systems, said Hugh Holman, executive director of research at CIBC.</p>
        <p>ASTROPOWER'S stock, now trading at $45.04, is off 26 percent from its high on Oct. 16, 2000.. Still, the stock is not cheap: according to the average earnings estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call, AstroPower has a price-to-earnings ratio of 48.95, based on predicted 2002 earnings. That is far above the 20.52 of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, but below the multiple of some other fast-growing technology companies tracked by CIBC, Mr. Holman said.</p>
        <p>AstroPower is to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts expect its profit to rise to 11 cents a share from 8 cents in the first quarter; for the full year, they predict earnings of 53 cents a share, up from 27 cents a share in 2000. Analysts also expect its earnings to grow 47 percent a year, on average, for the next three to five years.</p>
        <p>''This is a real growth company, and it's a company that's been able to sustain growth for many years,'' said Eric Prouty, an analyst at Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston.</p>
