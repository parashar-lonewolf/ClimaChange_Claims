        <p>Until last Monday, President Clinton had planned to use the international economic summit meeting here this weekend strictly to advance his vision of 21st-century global harmony strengthened by security pacts, environmental treaties and commercial ties.</p>
        <p>Then India set off five nuclear tests and Indonesia went into political convulsions.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Clinton and his allies scrambled to respond, his yearned-for web of closer international relations appeared by week's end to be still a poor match for competition among national interests and pressure from domestic politics.</p>
        <p>Today the President sounded almost plaintive as he kept up his drumbeat of criticism of India for conducting its tests, in hopes of dissuading Pakistan from following suit. ''We have an opportunity to leave behind the darkest moments of the 20th century,'' he said in his weekly radio broadcast, ''and embrace the most brilliant possibilities of the 21st.''</p>
        <p>Despite the many commercial and diplomatic ties among the eight nations represented here, Mr. Clinton has so far had little success in persuading his allies to follow his lead and impose economic sanctions on India. He had to lobby hard over dinner Friday night to incorporate the word ''condemn'' in a joint statement about the tests, his aides said.</p>
        <p>For its part, the Indian Government, enjoying a surge of domestic support, has not shown much concern for international criticism.</p>
        <p>Asked today if the joint statement criticizing India would be enough without sanctions to stop Pakistan from following India's example, Mr. Clinton paused. ''I don't know,'' he said, ''but I hope so.''</p>
        <p>Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, predicted that if Pakistan forgoes testing nuclear weapons, Congress would be likely to resolve a dispute over F-16 jet fighters that Pakistan purchased years ago. Because of Pakistan's nuclear program, the United States has blocked delivery of the planes and refused to return about half a billion dollars paid by Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger said he hoped that the Pakistanis ''will decide that their national interest is better served by not testing than by testing.''</p>
        <p>On Friday night, the leaders here also called for ''political as well as economic reform'' in Indonesia. But Mr. Clinton said the leaders, from the Group of Seven major industrial nations and Russia, informally known as the Group of Eight, could not much influence Jakarta.</p>
        <p>''In terms of who should govern Indonesia, that is a question for the Indonesians to decide, not the G-8,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>This afternoon the eight leaders retreated for more than two hours to a rural estate near Birmingham to discuss their official agenda -- and Mr. Clinton's preferred one -- of longer-range solutions to problems like climate change, worker retraining and international crime. Shucking their ties for a studied image of down-to-business informality, the leaders were all smiles as they vanished into a 17th century house on the 1,000-acre estate, called Weston Park, in the improbably named village of Weston-under-Lizard.</p>
        <p>But the tensions in India, Indonesia and Pakistan continued to frame the talks. In his radio address, Mr. Clinton maintained the balancing act he has kept up all week, criticizing India and praising it in almost the same breath.</p>
        <p>Without broader international participation in the sanctions, American companies doing business there run the risk of being replaced by foreign competitors, and the President has seemed reluctant to alienate India.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said India had ''the world's largest middle class and 50 years of vibrant democracy to its credit,'' and praised the contributions of Indian immigrants to the United States.</p>
        <p>''For all these reasons the United States and India should be close friends and partners for the 21st century,'' he said. ''And they make it all the more unfortunate that India has pursued this course at a time when most nations are working hard to leave the terror of the nuclear age behind.''</p>
        <p>In other cases, international pressure is forcing the United States to back away from imposing sanctions on nations it considers renegades. For example, Washington is expected to announce soon that it will waive sanctions against French, Russian and Malaysian energy companies doing business in Iran. Although American law calls for sanctions to be imposed to isolate Iran, the United States has found itself isolated on the issue, and under pressure from the European Union to back down.</p>
