        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Tom Wicker, in "Time for Action," an Oct. 24 column on global warming theories, states that Richard Lindzen "told a group of scientists in Washington that he had 'withdrawn' the complex hypothesis that was an important element of his skepticism." Mr. Wicker's conclusion that my "changed position" seems to "justify a heightened urgency in responding to threatening atmospheric developments" is unwarranted.</p>
        <p>The technical issue referred to was never an important element in my scientific objections to suggestions of pronounced anomalous greenhouse warming. Senator Albert Gore claimed it was and apparently released extracts of hearings that purported to indicate I had withdrawn my scientific objections. Mr. Wicker was misled. The full hearings indicate my objections to the warming scenario and the Senator's views.</p>
        <p>My main points: (1) No current model would predict large warming in response to increasing carbon dioxide without strong positive (destabilizing) feedback from water vapor; (2) such feedback depends crucially on the behavior of water vapor from 6 to 16 kilometers; (3) in current models, the behavior of water vapor in this altitude range is largely determined by identifiable computational errors, and (4) even if these computational errors were corrected, we do not adequately know the physical processes that must be incorporated for the models to determine water vapor at these levels.</p>
        <p>These are technical points. But computation errors hardly constitute a sound basis for economically profound policy.  RICHARD S. LINDZEN Alfred P. Sloan Prof. of Meteorology, Massachusetts Inst. of Technology Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 13, 1991</p>
