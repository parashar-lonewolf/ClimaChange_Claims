        <p>Between them, Jim Morrison and Lou Reed influenced some of the worst, most pompous rock of the last decade. But admiring them isn't necessarily fatal; add some humor, imagination and personal spark and the music can still make the simplest riffs speak of love and terror, of exaltation and despair. Julian Cope, who emerged from the Liverpool band the Teardrop Explodes for a solo career in the 1980's, has never denied his debts to Mr. Morrison, Mr. Reed, Iggy Pop and Pink Floyd's founder, Syd Barrett. Yet in a rare New York performance on Wednesday night at the Marquee, he turned out to be as much an oddball and individualist as any of his idols.</p>
        <p>On stage at the Marquee, wearing the basic black (loose shirt, tight tights) of collegiate rock, he was a protean figure, prancing and capering in one song, darkly introspective in another, howling a rocker or, between songs, staring into the crowd with the addled but sly grin of Harpo Marx while fans yelled their affection. Some songs would give way to dramatic monologues as the band vamped -- including the finale, where Mr. Cope acted out hara-kiri -- but most were trim and terse.</p>

        <p>Between them, Jim Morrison and Lou Reed influenced some of the worst, most pompous rock of the last decade. But admiring them isn't necessarily fatal; add some humor, imagination and personal spark and the music can still make the simplest riffs speak of love and terror, of exaltation and despair. Julian Cope, who emerged from the Liverpool band the Teardrop Explodes for a solo career in the 1980's, has never denied his debts to Mr. Morrison, Mr. Reed, Iggy Pop and Pink Floyd's founder, Syd Barrett. Yet in a rare New York performance on Wednesday night at the Marquee, he turned out to be as much an oddball and individualist as any of his idols.</p>
        <p>On stage at the Marquee, wearing the basic black (loose shirt, tight tights) of collegiate rock, he was a protean figure, prancing and capering in one song, darkly introspective in another, howling a rocker or, between songs, staring into the crowd with the addled but sly grin of Harpo Marx while fans yelled their affection. Some songs would give way to dramatic monologues as the band vamped -- including the finale, where Mr. Cope acted out hara-kiri -- but most were trim and terse.</p>
        <p>Through the 1980's, Mr. Cope's music circled from punk-pop concision to arrangements with booming drumbeats and gleaming synthesizer and guitar lines and now is back to the homier, informal garage-band arrangements of his new album, "Peggy Suicide" ( Island ). Songs from that album, which made up the bulk of the concert, embrace everything from New Orleans funk to Velvet Underground drones to sustained Pink Floyd-like elegies. Mr. Cope has also moved most of his vocal lines up from a portentous baritone, Mr. Morrison's range, to a more conversational register.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cope can sum up complex relationships in simple words: "Pristeen" calmly asks someone, "How much can you take?" and adds, "Your major mistake was trusting me." But he isn't a depressive, self-involved mope-rocker; he also worries about global warming, wishes for transcendence (in "Beautiful Love") or cheerfully announces "I can feel my head exploding now."</p>
        <p>The liner notes to "Peggy Suicide" say that Mr. Cope used to take risky amounts of LSD, and some of his lyrics, especially in older songs like "Sunspots" or "Unisex Cathedral," toss off the whimsical non sequiturs that were also part of 1960's acid-rock; others, like "Promised Land," are stark and direct.</p>
        <p>It is easy to hear what music Mr. Cope draws from, song by song. But while the sources are recognizable, Mr. Cope brings something of his own to them -- not a prefabricated persona or an unwavering strategy, but a gift for clear, off-the-wall insights.</p>
