        <p>WOULD offering a bird-feeder coax people into dumping the electric company they've known all their lives for one they've never heard of? How about a spruce sapling? Or a claim that the new company's power is ''greener''?</p>
        <p>Several power companies think so, resorting to such marketing ploys in a pilot program in New Hampshire that has allowed 15,000 families and businesses to choose their supplier since May 1996. And judging by the success new competitors have had in luring customers away from established utilities, the gimmicks, advertised in mailings and on radio, may be working.</p>
        <p>New Hampshire's experience may be a taste of the future for much of the country, as states dismantle the nearly century-old system of electric monopolies. Several states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, will phase in utility deregulation during the next several years, and several others, including Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut, are expected to follow soon after.</p>
        <p>For the first time, regional utilities will be able to cross each other's borders and vie for each other's customers. Power wholesalers are expected to begin entering retail markets, taking on the utilities that have been their customers. And new retail companies will probably form around the country, promising to link consumers to the cheapest, cleanest or most reliable power available.</p>
        <p>Caution: Confusion Ahead</p>
        <p>Policymakers hope this new competition will translate into lower prices, much as it did in the long-distance telephone market. But the long-distance experience offers some cautionary tales. Breaking AT&amp;T's grip on the market has led to lower rates, but at times has also led to less reliable service and a barrage of competing claims about price and service that are all but impossible for most consumers to gauge.</p>
        <p>''I don't think most people have a clue whether they're really getting the best deal on long distance, and I'm afraid that's where we might be headed with electric competition,'' said Susan K. Weinstock, chief utilities analyst with the American Association of Retired Persons. ''In New Hampshire, companies were touting green power that turned out to be no greener than the next guy's power.''</p>
        <p>Another lesson from the long-distance wars is this: most people have stayed with AT&amp;T, perhaps because in the end the three major competitors' prices don't vary much. Similarly, many analysts believe that in the face of bewildering offers by rival utilities, consumers will opt for the devil they know rather than choose, say, Enron or Sithe, giant energy companies that want to become retailers but are relatively unknown to the general public.</p>
        <p>''I think it's very difficult to predict what will happen,'' said John F. O'Mara, chairman of New York's Public Service Commission, which plans to phase in competition over the next four to five years. But, he added, ''a lot of people will want to stay where they're comfortable.''</p>
        <p>In the New Hampshire experiment, however, 70 percent of customers switched in the first six months. That may be because the old  utilities were small and did not carry the brand-name power of a Consolidated Edison. Or it may be because new entrants seriously undercut the old monopoly prices (competition eventually forced rates down about 20 percent). Or it may be that a lot of energy companies were eager to use New Hampshire as a test case and pushed harder there than they will elsewhere. Or it may be none of the above.</p>
        <p>''One thing we've learned here is that you can sit around and talk about these things endlessly but until you try competition, you really have no idea what it's going to look like,'' said Robert J. Frank, a lawyer with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission. ''The only thing you can be sure of is confusion.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are encouraged that many of the companies' pitches in New Hampshire focused on claims, some of them well-founded, that the power they were offering was generated with less pollution than their competitors'.</p>
        <p>''The choice of a power supplier could turn out to be the single most important environmental decision an individual consumer can make,'' said Ralph C. Cavanagh, energy program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Power plants, the group says, produce two-thirds of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions, one-third of the carbon dioxide and one-third of the nitrogen oxide, making them leading contributors to acid rain, smog and the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavanagh predicted that many consumers would jump at the chance to choose cleaner power sources, even if it meant paying a bit more, and that power companies would be quick to take advantage of that fact.</p>
        <p>New Wrinkles</p>
        <p>Another new wrinkle could have electric companies, like long-distance providers, offering lower rates at off-peak hours, when it is cheaper for them to supply power. Few homes and businesses have meters that can track usage by the hour, but the promise of lower rates could make it worthwhile to install such meters.</p>
        <p>While some consumer advocates fear the confusion that competition will bring, others fear there will not be enough competition.</p>
        <p>In the long-distance business, nearly all the cost to the provider is in equipment that is already in place. Actually supplying the service -- connecting the calls -- costs almost nothing. As a result, it's possible to make a fairly healthy profit on each new customer, making it worthwhile to pursue that customer aggressively.</p>
        <p>Supplying electricity is expensive by comparison. Each additional customer means, in most cases, burning more fuel. And most analysts believe competition will mean slim profit margins, leaving little money for chasing customers. ''In the electric market, the individual residential customer is not going to be that attractive to the power companies,'' Ms. Weinstock said. ''They may decide it's only worth it to go after the big commercial customers.''</p>
        <p>New Players</p>
        <p>That's when another new player, a company called an aggregator, could enter the market. An aggregator would sign up consumers, promising to find them the best rates for a small fee. Then it would bundle them in groups of hundreds or thousands, and offer their business to power companies.</p>
        <p>But so far that is no more than a prediction. In New Hampshire, aggregators failed to find a niche because so many companies wanted to compete directly for small customers.</p>
        <p>For now, all eyes are on California. On Nov. 1, 70 percent of the state's residents and businesses will be free to choose their electric supplier for service starting Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>''No one is quite sure what is going to happen here,'' said Mr. Cavanagh, who is based in San Francisco. ''But it's going to be interesting.''</p>
