        <p>Shea Stadium, the aging home of the Mets, requires at least $11 million in structural, electrical, mechanical and plumbing repairs, according to a city engineering report.</p>
        <p>The report, which was prepared in March for the city's Department of Design and Construction, said that a wide range of repairs needed to be made ''in time for safe occupancy by the public for the 2002 baseball season,'' which began in April.</p>
        <p>The 38-year-old concrete and steel ballpark is in generally good condition, the report said, but it is showing its age, with corroding and cracked concrete walls and ramps, leaks, loose wiring, sagging ceilings, overloaded electrical systems, rusted center-field bleacher supports and dim exterior lighting.</p>
        <p>Of particular concern is the extensive cracking of the supports for the field seats, and the rusting in the reinforcements for those supports. Noting the corrosion of supports to third-base seating, the report said, ''The steel under both sets of fixed seats has in all probability never been painted since the time of construction,'' in 1964.</p>
        <p>The lighting and field seat repairs are expected to begin in July.</p>
        <p>The report, which was first detailed yesterday by The Daily News, is issued as part of the annual inspections at Shea and Yankee Stadiums. They are owned by the city, which is responsible for repairs and capital improvements. The effort to fix problems before conditions become dangerous took on greater urgency four years ago, when a 500-pound slab of steel crashed into the empty upper deck at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that none of the conditions were dangerous. ''You have to remember just how many people go through Shea Stadium in the course of a year,'' he said. ''It's a phenomenally well-used facility. And it has its normal wear and tear.''</p>
        <p>According to the report, some repairs scheduled for past years have been deferred. And not all the repairs called for in the report will be budgeted for the 2003 fiscal year, which begins in July.</p>
        <p>The city's need to keep Shea and Yankee Stadiums safe and functional has become even more important since Mayor Bloomberg chose not to embrace a plan to build new stadiums negotiated by the man he succeeded, Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Dave Howard, a senior vice president of the Mets, said: ''Naturally, we're the tenant and we want things done immediately. We have an ongoing dialogue with the Parks Department because they are responsible for maintenance and capital repairs. We have to make sure the stadium is up to the standards of the lease.''</p>
        <p>He said there were no hazardous conditions at the stadium, but he would not say which of the needed repairs were the most urgent.</p>
        <p>STV Inc., a Manhattan engineering firm that prepared the report, cited 16 items that require ''immediate corrective action,'' including the poor lighting that rings the stadium and barely helps fans navigate in the evening, and buckling asphalt on the exterior of the stadium. The installation of new supports under the field boxes and the replacement of the center field stands were listed as lesser priorities.</p>
        <p>STV also said that when it inspected the stadium in November, nearly 100 uncovered carbon dioxide tanks that had been there since 1999 were found at street level. The report did not say what the carbon dioxide was used for at Shea, nor did it specify the danger the tanks posed.</p>
        <p>STV also said the stadium needed to provide the handicapped with access to toilets, as federal law requires.</p>
        <p>A memo by Surtreat Northeast, a company that treats corroded concrete, that was included in the report said, ''It was explained to us that Shea Stadium needed a program for extending the service life for another 10 to 15 years, this being the result of monetary spending shifts from stadiums to the ground zero rebuilding.'' The memo also said, ''Every ramp and every section of every ramp has evidence of corrosion.''</p>
        <p>It added that the field seats, where the supports showed huge cracks, needed repairs urgently.</p>
        <p>Patchwork done in the past did nothing to arrest the corrosion, according to the memo. It recommended treating 268,545 square feet of rotted and corroded concrete throughout the stadium.</p>
