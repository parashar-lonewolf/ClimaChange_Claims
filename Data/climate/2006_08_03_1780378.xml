        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''City Dims Lights as Heat Strains the Power Grid'' (front page, Aug. 2):</p>
        <p>If Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is serious about energy conservation by businesses during the heat wave, he should take a walk around Midtown. He might be surprised at the number of stores with their doors flung wide open while an icy blast of air-conditioning cools the sidewalks.</p>
        <p>I roughly paced the distance at one store on 34th Street on Tuesday afternoon and reckon that the air-conditioning was shooting a good 15 feet from the entrance.</p>
        <p>This is nothing new; I notice it every summer as I walk around the city, from Midtown to lower Fifth Avenue to Broadway in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>It's one thing to keep your own customers cool, but to try to cool off the outdoors must result in an incredible waste of energy.</p>
        <p>John Shea  Brooklyn, Aug. 2, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's heat emergency plan should take the additional step of disallowing motor vehicles from Central Park and Prospect Park.</p>
        <p>Just as city pools and cooling centers provide relief to thousands of New Yorkers, so should our flagship parks offer respite from the heat, fumes and pollutants generated by cars on these desperately hot days.</p>
        <p>Hannah Borgeson  New York, Aug. 2, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Large Clients Cut Extras, Easing Strain on Con Ed'' (news article, Aug. 1) left me confused. Why is energy conservation something that happens only in an energy emergency (or after price increases)? Why isn't it part of daily life in America?</p>
        <p>Yael Dresdner  Weehawken, N.J., Aug. 2, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Taking the Temperature of Heat Waves'' (editorial, Aug. 1) reminds me that our civilization may be nearing the point of no return on answering the bell about global warming.</p>
        <p>Even that terminology now reads and sounds more comforting than critically dangerous. At the least, we should term it ''global heating,'' bringing some sense of urgency.</p>
        <p>Americans are reacting more slowly than non-Americans, as this administration drags its feet.</p>
        <p>It's time to pull out the hurricane-fighters' adage: ''When in doubt, pick the course of least regret.'' That means choose the path for which you'll have the least regret if you're wrong.</p>
        <p>Evacuate, for example, when you feel that you should. If we act too swiftly on global heating, we can suffer the criticism and expense; if we act too late  we may lose a civilization. Ours.</p>
        <p>Bob VanWagoner  Sarasota, Fla., Aug. 1, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Here I sit in southern Arizona and think to myself: Finally -- unfortunately -- the rest of the country is finding out what living in the Southwest is really like. It gets just as hot here every June, July and August as you are experiencing right now.</p>
        <p>In June, we get heat and humidity with no rain; in July and August, we get rain, heat and humidity.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Arizona, you learn what to do and what not to do.</p>
        <p>Luckily, our power companies have kept up with the demand, and we don't worry much about loss of power from melting wires and such.</p>
        <p>Folks, this is just the beginning on global warming. We have already seen changes in our weather patterns in the Southwest. This is what your summers are no doubt going to be like from now on. I hope that you can adapt -- and soon.</p>
