        <p>LEAD: Question: How do you tell the difference between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress? Answer: That is just what the Democrats would like to figure out.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Question: How do you tell the difference between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress? Answer: That is just what the Democrats would like to figure out.</p>
        <p>Question: How do you tell the difference between President Bush and the Democrats in Congress? Answer: That is just what the Democrats would like to figure out.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are becoming increasingly aggravated by their inability to draw distinctions between themselves and Mr. Bush. Part of the reason for this is that the Democrats can't agree on who they are. But equally important is that even when they do take a firm stand on something, Mr. Bush usually closes right in to say he shares their concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has proven to be quite effective at the politics of empathy. Education. The Environment. Civil Rights. Child Care. These are all issues of potential weakness for a Republican President. They are also issues on which Mr. Bush has expressed his concern.</p>
        <p>The next step for the Democrats is to say concern is not enough; we need action. Mr. Bush is ready there, too. The week after he said that bigotry must end, the Democrats (joined by a few Republicans) introduced legislation to shore up civil rights laws that had been curtailed by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The Administration had said no legislation was needed. Within hours after the bill was introduced, the Justice Department reversed the stand. The Administration would support legislation, although not as sweeping as the Democrats' bill.</p>
        <p>A central goal of Mr. Bush's domestic agenda seems to be to prevent substantial political space from opening up between him and the Democrats. It is the exact opposite of the Reagan approach.</p>
        <p>Where President Reagan resisted civil rights measures, Mr. Bush says he is for them. Where Mr. Reagan proclaimed his opposition to abortion, Mr. Bush talks about how the big tent of the Republican Party can shelter various views.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have been searching for new issues to define themselves. They planned to make ''economic competitiveness'' a watchword. But before the ink was dry on their speeches, the President was visiting high-tech laboratories.</p>
        <p>The Democrats protest that the details are crucial and that Mr. Bush's rhetoric does not match reality. You can't be an education president and call for only a 2 percent increase in education spending, Speaker Tom Foley declared after Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message.</p>
        <p>But from a distance, which is how most Americans view politics, it looks like all those Washington insiders are just haggling over the fine points, with Democrats wanting to spend more, and everyone remembers Mr. Bush's warning to Congress that voters did not ''send us here to bicker.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the Democrats would be doing well were the public even to notice that they are bickering with the President. When Republicans organized two focus groups in Chicago to gather impressions of the President and his Message, not one of the 24 people knew that the Democrats had responded to the address. Nor did anyone know who Tom Foley is.</p>
        <p>In the short run, Mr. Bush's approach has helped to keep his popularity at the ionospheric levels he achieved at the end of his first year. But more than that: He and his strategists are beginning to think like leaders of a majority party, and are trying to assemble the broad and disparate coalitions that used to be both bane and benefit of the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>The difficulties were apparent the other day when Mr. Bush gave a speech about global warming, although he never used the phrase. Writing the speech was a struggle, as the White House sought to demonstrate concern without frightening manufacturers and utilities with plans to require costly controls.</p>
        <p>Inside Washington there was great fascination with the internal Administration feuds over this speech. But outside, all that people know is Mr. Bush wants to help. ''So he wants to plant a billion trees,'' said Tony Podesta, a Democratic political consultant, capsulizing the Democrats' frustration. ''The Democrats are left with: 'Should we try to plant a billion and a half?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Podesta also described both the frustration and grudging admiration Democrats have these days for the strategists of the Bush Administration: ''I think they're really underestimated. They have a bumbling schedule and a clumsy attitude toward intra-party politics. There's no soaring rhetoric. But they've tended to occupy two-thirds of the political space. If you continue to blunt whatever argument your opponent can offer against you, you create a situation in which it becomes impossible to attack you.''</p>
