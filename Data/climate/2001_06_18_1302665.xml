      <block class="full_text">
        <p>General Motors is taking a stand against efforts to raise federal fuel-economy standards.</p>
        <p>G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said on Friday that the company would oppose not only any move to increase fuel-economy standards for automobiles, but also any effort to tighten the definition under which vehicles are considered light trucks, which qualify for more lenient gas-mileage standards than cars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner said in an interview with reporters that federal regulation of automotive fuel economy had been a failure and should be scrapped, not reworked. ''Suffice it to say, it hasn't worked and, in our view, it won't work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He argued that Americans would not want fuel-efficient vehicles as long as gasoline prices remain very low in the United States, at least by international standards.</p>
        <p>The fuel-economy rules are receiving considerable attention in Congress now because gasoline prices rose during the spring, although they have fallen back slightly the last two weeks and still remain far below the $5 or more a gallon charged in Europe. Automobiles also emit large quantities of global-warming gases with each gallon of gasoline they burn, so their efficiency has become controversial as President Bush has sought to redefine American policy on global warming.</p>
        <p>The fuel efficiency of all the cars sold by each automaker must average at least 27.5 miles a gallon. But the standard is 20.7 miles a gallon for light trucks, a category that includes minivans, pickup trucks and traditional sport utility vehicles, which are based on pickup truck underbodies instead of car designs.</p>
        <p>Because automakers are classifying more and more vehicles as light trucks, the overall fuel economy of vehicles on the road has fallen to 24.5 miles a gallon, the lowest level since 1980, after peaking at 26.2 miles a gallon in 1987. Moreover, all of these averages are calculated using special rules that allow automakers to add an extra 18 percent to the actual mileage figures that appear on window stickers.</p>
        <p>Crossover utility vehicles, which are mostly high-roofed, all-wheel-drive vehicles that use the mechanical underpinnings of cars, are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with sales more than doubling in the first five months of this year, to 6 percent of the auto market. They include models like the Toyota Highlander, Ford Escape and Chrysler PT Cruiser, and virtually all of them are classified as light trucks by the automakers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagoner made his remarks about fuel economy after saying that sales of crossover vehicles will continue to grow rapidly and will draw people who have been buying cars until now, rather than people who have been buying pickup trucks or traditional sport utilities.</p>
        <p>Automakers have enormous discretion to decide what is a car and what is a light truck under rules issued in 1977 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation. Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, a liberal advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, was the safety agency's administrator when the rules were issued. She said in a telephone interview that when her staff drafted the lengthy definition of a light truck, it was intended for commercial vehicles, not passenger vehicles.</p>
        <p>It would be politically easier now, she said, to narrow the definition of a light truck than to raise the mileage standard for all light trucks to 27.5 miles a gallon, as some in Congress have proposed.</p>
        <p>''That is clearly something I think the agency has the authority to change,'' she said. ''It would be harder for the industry to fight and it might be the shrewdest way to push up standards.''</p>
