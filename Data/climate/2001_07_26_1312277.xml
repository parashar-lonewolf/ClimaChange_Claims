        <p>The United States today rejected an international accord aimed at enforcing a 1972 treaty banning germ weapons but said it would continue looking for ways to salvage the proposal.</p>
        <p>The American decision appeared to effectively scuttle an attempt to strengthen the original United Nations treaty that prohibits developing, producing or possessing biological weapons. The agreement, or protocol, that was rejected by the Bush administration today was aimed at providing compliance provisions that were lacking in the treaty.</p>
        <p>''We don't think it can achieve its objectives, nor can it be fixed,'' said the chief negotiator for the United States, Donald A. Mahley, referring to the proposed accord.</p>
        <p>His remarks ended weeks of speculation about American opposition to an effort that sought to thwart germ warfare while at the same time allowing legitimate commercial use of biological materials.</p>
        <p>The United States announced its decision during the final session of negotiations by 56 nations. Reading his statement to a hushed crowd at the United Nations European headquarters, Mr. Mahley said, ''In our assessment, the draft protocol would put national security and confidential business information at risk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahley, who has been the top American negotiator on the biological pact since 1993, said the administration still supported the germ warfare treaty, but he appeared to close the door on any incremental changes in the draft enforcement pact to win Washington's support. He argued that the current effort would not improve ''confidence in compliance and will do little to deter those countries seeking to develop biological weapons.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, a senior administration official said that at least 37 items in the proposal made it ''unacceptable'' and that the Clinton administration had also had the same concerns that the Bush administration now has.</p>
        <p>But Elisa Harris, a former Clinton administration official who worked to strengthen the germ treaty, said the Clinton administration would most probably have worked with European and Asian allies to ''achieve a draft protocol that met all of our requirements.''</p>
        <p>Barbara H. Rosenberg, spokesman for the Federation of American Scientists, agreed, saying the current protocol, despite its flaws, was the ''most effective way to strengthen the treaty.''</p>
        <p>The alternatives being considered by the Bush administration drew mixed reviews from arms control advocates. Michael L. Moodie, a former arms control negotiator, said that while he supported the administration's rejection of the draft protocol, the administration would not find much international support for the alternatives it had discussed so far.</p>
        <p>He called proposals to strengthen export controls and criminalize violations of the treaty ''not really alternatives to an international framework.''</p>
        <p>Amy Smithson, an arms control expert with the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, called the protocol a ''lemon.''</p>
        <p>''The wheels would have fallen off the car before it got off the lot,'' she said. ''But it is incumbent upon the administration to get back to the negotiating table soon with realistic proposals to strengthen the treaty.''</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said that was what the White House intended. ''Give us a chance,'' he said, emphasizing President Bush's commitment to bolstering the treaty, but through innovative approaches. ''This is not a temper tantrum,'' the official said. ''We're not walking out.''</p>
        <p>He said the administration knew that negotiators in Geneva had to decide what they should report to the conference that will take up the protocol in November. ''We have a stake in that outcome,'' he said. ''But biological arms control requires new ways of thinking about how to stop the spread of these unique weapons.''</p>
        <p>Turning its back on the proposed accord is the latest in Bush administration policy positions that have run counter to European thinking. Washington has already upset its allies by threatening to abandon the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and rebuffing a treaty on climate change known as the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, most of the countries that took part in the seven years of negotiations on biological weapons verification appeared resigned to the American withdrawal from the agreement.</p>
        <p>''It's not worth having without the Americans signing up,'' said Elizabeth March, spokesman for the British disarmament negotiating team, which has been a leading supporter of the draft pact. ''It wouldn't be worth the paper it's written on.''</p>
