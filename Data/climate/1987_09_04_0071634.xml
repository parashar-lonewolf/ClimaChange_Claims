        <p>LEAD: Although belligerent forces in the Persian Gulf have been attacking ships at a rate of about four a day during the last week, relatively few tankers have sustained heavy damage. Experts say the reason is that neither Iran nor Iraq can afford frequent use of the expensive munitions needed to destroy large tankers.</p>
        <p>Although belligerent forces in the Persian Gulf have been attacking ships at a rate of about four a day during the last week, relatively few tankers have sustained heavy damage. Experts say the reason is that neither Iran nor Iraq can afford frequent use of the expensive munitions needed to destroy large tankers.</p>
        <p>Despite the battering inflicted on gulf shipping by machine-gun fire, small cannon and rockets, crew casualties have been comparatively light, and most damage has been easily repaired.</p>
        <p>A Defense Department spokesman said intelligence officials had been unable in most cases to determine which missiles were used in the attacks. But other military informants noted that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is essentially a guerrilla organization, and that its small boats, armed with light guns and infantry anti-tank missiles, were unsuited to naval warfare except for harassing operations.</p>
        <p>Iran is believed to have about three American-made Harpoon anti-ship missiles, as well as an unknown number of Chinese-made HY-2 (Silkworm) adaptations of the Soviet SS-N-2 Styx anti-ship missile. Iraq is fairly well supplied with Soviet missiles and the potent French-built Exocet AM-39. These missiles are all devastating. The Exocet, for instance, can ram a 400-pound explosive warhead deep inside a ship just above the waterline before exploding. Difficult to Shoot Down</p>
        <p>An anti-ship missile can be launched by an airplane, helicopter, small vessel or shore installation from distances up to about 40 miles from their targets. Flying a few feet above the ocean surface at nearly the speed of sound, they track their targets with radar and are very difficult to evade or shoot down.</p>
        <p>But anti-ship missiles of this class are costly and difficult for the gulf antagonists to acquire. A single Harpoon missile, for instance, costs well over $1 million, and industry experts say the price of an Exocet is probably about $250,000. Moreover, even the battle-tested Exocet - it was the missile used against the American warship Stark in the gulf in May - can easily fail to destroy a large tanker, experts say.</p>
        <p>Naval architects and shipping officials who asked that they not be identified said a typical 1,000-foot tanker was not easy to sink; in some respects, it may be even less vulnerable to attack than a warship.</p>
        <p>The steel plating covering the hull of such a ship varies in thickness from 22 millimeters on the sides to 26 millimeters along the bottom, a little under and a little over one inch, which is ample for stopping most machine-gun bullets. Rockets of any caliber can easily penetrate such plates, but a missile explosion inside a tanker is muffled by the crude oil that fills cargo compartments, and crude oil is unlikely to catch fire, even when exposed to a warhead explosion.</p>
        <p>If a missile should blow a huge hole in a 1,000-foot tanker's hull, the effect, a Coast Guard expert said, would be to flood one of up to 17 cargo compartments. This would merely lower the ship in the water without putting it in danger of sinking. Weapons Relatively Cheap</p>
        <p>But although the use of anti-ship missiles in the Persian Gulf has been rare, attacks using small missiles, including infantry anti-tank rockets, have occurred often. Such missiles can cause extensive damage to a merchant ship's bridge or crew quarters, and the weapons are relatively cheap. An American Light Antitank Weapon (LAW), a shoulder-fired missile, costs $348, and a Soviet equivalent, the ''rocket-propelled grenade,'' is believed to carry a comparable price tag.</p>
        <p>Iran's hit-and-run naval forces are also believed to carry some American missiles with greater ranges and striking power, including the Dragon and the TOW, both wire-guided missiles designed to penetrate tank armor. (The TOW figured in American efforts to bargain for the release of hostages held by Iranian-backed terrorists in Lebanon.) The TOW, with a warhead six inches in diameter, can be fired at targets up to two miles away.</p>
        <p>Industry experts acknowledge that in some cases, tankers could face mortal danger from even small missiles.</p>
        <p>''I'd hate to be on a gasoline tanker if a missile hit an empty compartment,'' one said. Such a compartment, he explained, might contain an explosive mixture of gasoline fumes and air, and even a small missile might set it off. Some gasoline is still being shipped through the gulf, he said, although most tankers transport crude oil.</p>
        <p>Under international law, tankers of more than 40,000 tons net displacement are required to flush oxygen from empty crude oil compartments, thereby eliminating the explosion hazard. This is done by sending exhaust gas from diesel engines, rich in fire-quenching carbon dioxide, into the empty oil tanks. Double Hulls for Liquid Gas</p>
        <p>Tankers carrying liquid petroleum gas, which is very flammable, must be built with double hulls, in which the inner hull is separated from outer hull plating by up to two feet. This separation, experts say, would probably reduce the explosion hazard posed by a missile's impact.</p>
        <p>In common with other ships, tankers are vulnerable to hits on their engine rooms and stern steering machinery. Although these areas are relatively difficult for gunners to hit, they are essential to a ship's operation.</p>
        <p>In any case, operators of oil tankers are profoundly worried by the situation in the gulf.</p>
        <p>''A lot of us have discussed options for strengthening the defenses of tankers against missiles and projectiles,'' one said, ''but in the end, we haven't come up with anything practical. The main consolation is that a tanker is in the danger zone for only two or three days. We all just keep hoping to continue to squeak through.''</p>
