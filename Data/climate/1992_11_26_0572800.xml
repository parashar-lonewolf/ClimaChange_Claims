        <p>A member of Congress and his environmental allies have reached an agreement with the Bush Administration that settles a lawsuit over delays in putting parts of the Clean Air Act of 1990 into effect, lawyers in the case said Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The agreement imposes a new schedule on the Environmental Protection Agency to issue 15 air-quality regulations, this time under supervision by the Federal District Court in Washington.</p>
        <p>They will be issued over the next year and a half and will control toxic air pollution by manufacturers and businesses, reduce emissions from incinerators, set new formulas for gasoline for clean-burning fuel, impose new exhaust emission standards on buses, reduce acid rain and protect the earth's protective layer of ozone, steps that were supposed to have been taken as long as a year ago.</p>
        <p>Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who has fought the Administration for two years over its implementation of the Clean Air Act, said the agreement repudiated "backdoor White House efforts to trample our environmental laws."</p>
        <p>Mr. Waxman had joined with Public Citizen, an organization founded by Ralph Nader, and with other environmental groups to sue the E.P.A. It was the first time that a member of Congress has joined as plaintiff in a lawsuit under the act's provisions allowing ordinary citizens to sue the Government to meet the law's deadlines.</p>
        <p>John Kasper, an E.P.A. spokesman, said part of the reason for the delay was that the agency had been overwhelmed by the complexity of the Clean Air Act, which calls for dozens of regulations to be written. "The air people have done an astounding job of getting out what they got out," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kasper said most of the rules covered by the settlement had been drafted. The agency has already published many final rules called for by the law, like those governing utilities' emissions of chemicals that cause acid rain. Impact of Election</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said the outcome of the Presidential election somewhat lessened the importance of the court case. President-elect Bill Clinton has said he would do a better job than the Bush Administration in meeting the requirements of the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>But the environmentalists said the agreement would nevertheless force the executive branch to carry out the wishes of Congress as called for in the act.</p>
        <p>The settlement also showed how members of the public could thwart the kind of regulatory delaying tactics that in the past two years have been adopted by the White House and two of its offices that supervised Federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget and the Council on Competitiveness.</p>
        <p>The settlement does not affect other disputes in which environmental groups are suing the E.P.A. for issuing rules under the Clean Air Act that the groups contend do not adequately protect air quality.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. would adopt the new rules after a monthlong period for public comment. Some regulations would have to be issued within a few days of their adoption; others would not go into effect until 1994.</p>
        <p>Originally, most of the regulations were to have been issued by November 1991 or May 1992.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Waxman said the most important regulations covered by the agreement were probably those dealing with toxic air pollution. They will govern how states issue permits governing polluters and will provide other guidance for states. Under the agreement, the permit rules must be proposed by mid-1993 and made final no later than May 1994.</p>
        <p>Another important rule involves gasoline formulas. The Administration, reversing its initial position, said this summer that it would allow ethanol blends, made partly with grain alcohol, to be used as a cleaner-burning fuel. But it never actually issued the change to its proposed rule. Under the agreement, the E.P.A. has until next March to say whether it will indeed alter the initial proposal.</p>
