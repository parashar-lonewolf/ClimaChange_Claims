        <p>The United States heads into important environmental negotiations today with a heavy burden to overcome -- the perception that it is unwilling to join the rest of the industrialized world in trying to reduce the threat of global warming.</p>
        <p>Several European countries and Japan have proposed that all nations agree to cap their emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief gas implicated in the "greenhouse" effect that traps heat in the atmosphere. All five Democratic Presidential candidates support a cap. But the Bush Administration is balking, leaving the impression that America shrinks from doing its part.</p>
        <p>Today, delegates will meet in New York City in one of the final negotiating sessions before a United Nations conference in June on a global climate treaty. With the departure of John Sununu, the skeptical White House chief of staff, there may now be new flexibility. Its good faith in question, the U.S. needs to show its commitment on a problem most experts deem potentially serious.</p>
        <p>The Administration has contended that the U.S. is already pursuing strategies that will cap or reduce its combined emissions of all greenhouse gases -- while allowing carbon dioxide emissions to increase.</p>
        <p>Most of this reduction was to come from phasing out chlorofluorocarbons, the gases that have been eating up the ozone shield and also happen to be greenhouse gases. But new findings suggest that chlorofluorocarbons cause as much cooling, by eliminating ozone, as warming.</p>
        <p>If the Administration hopes to stabilize or reduce greenhouse emissions, it needs to do more. But how much? Even after years of study, no one knows how much warming will occur and whether it is dangerous. Even so, experts consider it prudent to minimize the danger, assuming no huge cost.</p>
        <p>The U.S. could readily provide more aid to developing countries to curb global warming activities. Such aid might help China, for example, adopt efficient technologies for mining and burning its vast reserves of coal. An American contribution of, say, $50 to $100 million a year to an international fund would seem a cost-effective way of reducing the world's risk.</p>
        <p>Imposing firm caps on carbon dioxide emissions poses a more difficult issue. Other nations propose to hold their emissions in the year 2000 to 1990 levels. But Administration officials rightly warn that focusing on carbon dioxide alone could drive up energy costs and divert attention from other greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Even so, setting targets and timetables for carbon dioxide would send a beneficial signal to all nations and all industries that the U.S. is serious. Why does the Administration hesitate?</p>
        <p>One reason: a deep-seated suspicion that other countries are glibly endorsing caps without embarking on programs capable of achieving them. Another reason: potential cost. Though the Environmental Protection Agency believes it would be manageable, the Energy Department says it would be severe.</p>
        <p>On such an important issue, the Administration needs to open its cost estimates to public scrutiny. If the cost seems tolerable, it would do well to sign on to common global goals. Goals, after all, can be defined as just that, targets subject to change if the cost becomes exorbitant.</p>
        <p>Unless the Bush Administration quickly adopts a more reasonable course, it will cast the U.S. as an environmental pariah more concerned with its own comfort than with the well-being of the earth.</p>
