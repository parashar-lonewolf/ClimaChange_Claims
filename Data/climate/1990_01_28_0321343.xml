        <p>LEAD: I was interested to read your article ''North Salem May Ban Foam Cups'' [Jan. 14] . Your readers might be interested to note that Legislator Patricia V.

        <p>I was interested to read your article ''North Salem May Ban Foam Cups'' [Jan. 14] . Your readers might be interested to note that Legislator Patricia V. Hotchkiss and I have introduced legislation before the Westchester County Board of Legislators that would ban styrofoam countywide.</p>
        <p>Styrofoam poses a threat to the environment. Its production involves the use of chlorofluorocarbons that break up when released and contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer, allowing harmful ultraviolet rays to penetrate the earth's surface. If depletion of the ozone layer is not halted, life on our planet will be threatened. In addition, styrofoam does not decompose when placed in landfills and it gives off harmful chemicals when incinerated.</p>
        <p>I believe that no retail food establishment in Westchester should be allowed to sell or convey food to consumers unless such food is placed in biodegradable packaging. And, I have also proposed that no retail food establishment in Westchester County shall sell, give or provide eating utensils or food containers to any consumers if such utensils or food containers are composed of styrofoam.</p>
        <p>Thousands of Westchester residents have already signed petitions being circulated by my office and the Westchester Environmental Coalition advocating countywide legislation. These petitions have and will continue to be forwarded to the members of the Board of Legislators. I expect countywide legislation to be forwarded out of committee sometime this year.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, hats off to North Salem for leading the way</p>
        <p>PAUL FEINER</p>
        <p>Legislator, 12th District</p>
