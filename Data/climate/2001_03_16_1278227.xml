        <p>Finally, we have a president who knows how to run the government like a business.</p>
        <p>Presuming the business is Pets .com.</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney sat George W. Bush down this week and explained that even though Mr. Bush had promised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, he didn't really mean it.</p>
        <p>The vice president is in charge of the president's energy task force, when he is not occupied with foreign policy, negotiating with Congress and undergoing life-saving hospital procedures. So it's pretty remarkable that he's already had time to determine that whatever the nation's energy policy is going to be, it will not involve doing anything whatsoever about carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>This was useful information for Mr. Bush, who signed off on a letter disavowing his former position and went off to inspect another faith-based initiative.</p>
        <p>''I was responding to reality,'' Mr. Bush said, explaining why he had repudiated his promise, humiliated the head of his Environmental Protection Agency and made it pretty much impossible for the United States to do anything about global warming for the next four years.</p>
        <p>That was pretty good for just a few hours' work. But this is an efficient administration, led by an M.B.A. from Harvard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush arrived in the White House just as the nation was plunging into a stock market dive and the California utility crisis. Since he is a guy known for setting priorities, nobody was surprised when he immediately honed in on taxes and energy. Then we began noticing that while the country needed to quickly stimulate consumer spending, Mr. Bush was fixated on eliminating taxes on the wealthy in 2011. The California crisis is mainly about natural gas, and Mr. Bush keeps talking about drilling for oil in a wildlife preserve.</p>
        <p>The president seems to be governing some other country. Maybe Belgium is the place that needs to eliminate the estate tax.</p>
        <p>And then there was the matter of air pollution. I don't know if this nation is ready for a charming president who can't keep his word.</p>
        <p>Most people think reducing carbon dioxide emissions will help control global warming. But Mr. Bush lumps global warming in the same category of questionable theories where he puts evolution. So it surprised people when he made a speech in Michigan last September, saying that if he was elected, he would require power plants to reduce emissions of four dangerous pollutants, one of them carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>This was not something that aides could ascribe to Mr. Bush's well-known habit of articulating sentences in which only the nouns reflect his actual thought. (''He meant to say we'll reduce emissions from plants.'')</p>
        <p>It was a read-off-the-teleprompter policy address, and it was a pretty big deal. There are no mandatory emission standards on carbon dioxide right now, and even Al Gore was afraid to demand any. In fact, in his speech, Mr. Bush practically called the vice president an environmental wimp. ''My opponent calls for voluntary reductions in such emissions. In Texas we've done better -- with mandatory reductions, and I believe the nation can do better,'' he said. (Who knows how many environmentally conscious suburban voters in Florida this helped sway?)</p>
        <p>This week, however, the administration decided that Mr. Bush had been reading the wrong words. The speechwriter misspoke. ''A campaign document that was not well written,'' shrugged a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>Further spinning suggested that Mr. Bush thought carbon dioxide emissions are already covered under federal law, and only intended to promise to regulate things that are already regulated.</p>
        <p>By yesterday, the administration was saying that Mr. Bush had simply changed his mind after intense consultations with Mr. Cheney and several senators who would not know global warming from a gas grill. Then he informed Christie Whitman of the E.P.A., who's theoretically in charge of the policy, that there had been a change in direction -- in fact a veritable U-turn.</p>
        <p>It all goes to show, his supporters said, that the guy is a great manager. Knows when to hold, knows when to fold. ''I don't think you should hold a president to a campaign pledge that is not a good pledge,'' said Senator Rick Santorum.</p>
        <p>Read my lips -- no new emissions.</p>
