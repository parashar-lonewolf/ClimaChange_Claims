        <p>Anyone who has dealt with waterlogged books or shorted-out computers after a fire knows that dousing flames can be as damaging as the conflagration itself.</p>
        <p>But now Tyco International claims that it has a fire suppression system that will make the cleanup a snap. The system, called Sapphire, relies on Novec 1230, a fluorine-based chemical made by 3M. The National Fire Protection Association, association that writes and publishes national fire standards, has deemed Novec to be as effective as existing chemical and gas fire suppressants, without contributing to global warming or depletion of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>In a demonstration last week at the Library Hotel in Manhattan, Richard A. Pelton, marketing director for the fire suppression business at Tyco Fire and Security, tried to show that the system could outdo water, too.</p>
        <p>He dipped a book into Novec 1230 -- it dried in minutes, ink and bindings intact. He immersed a cellphone in the chemical -- and grinned when it rang. He soaked a shirt and passed it around the room -- by the time it came back to the front, it was dry.</p>
        <p>The live show did not demonstrate Sapphire actually putting out a blaze, not even a candle flame (Mr. Pelton cited safety concerns). A videotape showed the system dousing a fire.</p>
        <p>So far, no potential customers in the United States have had a chance to try Sapphire. Tyco says Sapphire is already in use in Europe but did not respond to repeated requests for names of European users.</p>
        <p>Still, Tyco's no-harm-done claims for Sapphire, which pairs 3M's chemical with Tyco's monitoring and delivery systems, pique interest. According to the company, Sapphire monitors can detect ''particles of combustion'' and neutralize them before they burst into flame. Even after flames erupt, Novec, which is stored as a liquid in pressurized containers but converts to a gas as soon as it hits the air, can chemically extinguish them and quickly evaporate, Tyco says. The chemical does not react with and tie up oxygen, as carbon dioxide and other gaseous fire suppressants do, so there is no danger to people if it is accidentally released.</p>
        <p>After five days or so, even trace molecular residue of Novec is gone from the air, the company claims. Most conventional chemically based fire prevention systems can leave detectable molecules in the air for more than 30 years. Unlike Halon, which has long been the most common chemical fire suppressant, Novec is not a threat to the stratospheric ozone layer. The Environmental Protection Agency has outlawed the manufacture of Halon, but many Halon systems are still in place, and many who rely on those systems worry about what to do when they eventually need replacing.</p>
        <p>Tyco says a Sapphire system adequate to protect a 2,000-square-foot room would cost about $60,000, more than twice as much as a new water-based sprinkler system, and more than many other existing chemical or gas-based fire suppression systems. Fire protection experts say businesses are unlikely to pay that much to protect whole buildings, but they might well use a system like Sapphire to safeguard archives or essential equipment.</p>
        <p>''A county library isn't going to put Sapphire into its local history room,'' said Tina Mason Seetoo, preservation education officer of the Southeastern Library Network, a nonprofit membership network of libraries. ''But if Sapphire is as good as Tyco says, it is worth looking at for protecting special collections.''</p>
        <p>It is also ''extremely intriguing'' for protecting computer and telecommunications equipment, said Garry L. Briese, executive director of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. ''Water or chemical residues can kill a telephone switching station or computer room,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tyco is unlikely to have the field to itself for long. Twelve other products have passed the E.P.A.'s toxicity tests, said Mark Conroy, a senior engineer with the National Fire Protection Association. And, if it catches on, the biggest beneficiary may be 3M, because Tyco is using Novec under a nonexclusive agreement.</p>
        <p>''Tyco is the first out of the starting gate,'' Mr. Conroy said. ''But if it does well, I have no doubt that a lot of other companies are going to be contacting 3M about this chemical.''</p>
