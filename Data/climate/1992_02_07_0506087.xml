        <p>International A3-11  TAKING AIM AT HUSSEIN</p>
        <p>President Bush has sent the Director of Central Intelligence on an unpublicized mission to talk with leaders in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The goal: hasten the downfall of the Iraqi President.  A1  FOREIGN POLICY DOUGHNUT</p>
        <p>Containment of Communism was the guiding principle of United States foreign policy for more than 40 years. Now, with the cold war over, there is no core issue, prompting one expert to compare United States foreign policy to a doughnut -- "lots of peripheral interests, but nothing at the center." A1  PREACHING, NOT PRACTICING</p>
        <p>The United States urges Japan and other countries to open their markets to American goods, but at the same time it puts up many barriers to imports.  A1  A WARNING FROM YELTSIN</p>
        <p>The President of Russia, appealing for Western aid on a visit to France, said dictatorship would return to Russia if his economic program did not succeed.  A8  Prices have increased in Moscow but supplies haven't.  A8  Four former Soviet republics give details on disarmament.  A9  The United States names ambassadors to five former republics.  A9  CROATIA SAYS YES TO U.N.</p>
        <p>The President of Croatia agreed to accept a United Nations peace plan, but the leader of a Serbian enclave rejects the proposal.  A3  BOUNCING BACK IN CARACAS</p>
        <p>Laughing heartily despite the bullet holes in the window behind his desk, the President of Venezuela appears to have quickly recovered from a coup attempt.  A3  TOUGH TALK FOR ISRAEL</p>
        <p>A key Democratic Senator says he supports the Bush Administration's plan to make a halt to new Israeli settlement building in the occupied territories a condition for loan guarantees.  A11  MORE MISERY IN BANGLADESH</p>
        <p>A nation that endures chronic poverty and deadly cyclones is being swamped by a tide of Muslim refugees from Myanmar.  A6  IRELAND'S NEW LEADER</p>
        <p>Albert Reynolds, a former Finance Minister, became Prime Minister-designate after a majority of his party chose him to replace Charles J. Haughey, who is resigning.  A7  National A12-17  WHITE HOUSE REVERSAL ON OZONE</p>
        <p>With the backing of an Administration that had previously opposed it, a proposal that calls for speeding the phase-out of chemicals that damage the earth's ozone layer cleared the Senate, 96 to 0.  A1  THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE PLAN</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush became the last of the major Presidential candidates to join the national debate on health care, formally proposing several tax incentives and other changes that he said would make quality care affordable to every American.  A1  News analysis: The gaps in the President's proposal.  A15  A NEW HEADACHE FOR CLINTON</p>
        <p>A report in The Wall Street Journal suggested that as a young man, Governor Clinton manipulated the military draft process to avoid serving during the Vietnam War. The Governor denied the account, but the issue dogged him during a day of campaigning in New Hampshire.  A16  Senator Harkin, the populist with a piece of the pie.  A16  Political Memo: The candidates' ads are a snapshot of strategy.  A16  PLANE CRASHES INTO MOTEL</p>
        <p>At least 16 people were killed in Evansville, Ind., when an Air National Guard transport plane crashed into a motel filled with visitors attending a convention.  A12  BADLANDS ON THE BORDER</p>
        <p>The Big Bend of the Rio Grande has been outlaw country for a long time, and now it is drug smugglers who increasingly find the terrain a useful ally.  A12  REPORT ON C.I.A. ANALYSES</p>
        <p>A C.I.A. task force appointed in the aftermath of Robert M. Gates's grueling confirmation hearings last fall has rejected the assertion that the agency systematically slanted intelligence over the years. The findings, included in a classified report recently submitted to Mr. Gates for his approval, largely blame poor management and the inexperience of some analysts for allowing the perception of purposely slanted intelligence to flourish.  A13  IN A WORD, UNEXPECTED</p>
        <p>Washington at Work: When Bob Woodward set out last year to learn everything he could about Vice President Quayle, the Capital awaited bombshells. But there weren't any when The Washington Post last month published the resulting series on Mr. Quayle, by Mr. Woodward and David Broder. The ensuingcriticism from journalists left Mr. Woodward puzzled and the Vice President's aides gleeful.  A14  Washington Talk: Of tax writing, cynicism and special pleading.  A13  Pittsburgh Journal: The emergence of a horror-film capital.  A12  Law Page B6  The legal profession steps up recruitment of homosexual lawyers.</p>
        <p>New research on the reliability of DNA fingerprinting.</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Digest, B1 HOMELESS AND HOTELS</p>
        <p>As New York struggles toward new ways of sheltering the homeless, a failed tourist hotel near Kennedy International Airport is about to re-open as a homeless hotel -- a revival of what critics called the worst of the old ways.  A1  HARD TIMES, NASTY SCHEMES</p>
        <p>Fueled by a lingering recession that has made credit tight and people desperate, loan frauds that dangle the prospect of quick cash for an upfront fee are the fastest-growing category of consumer complaints throughout the metropolitan area, consumer agency officials said.
