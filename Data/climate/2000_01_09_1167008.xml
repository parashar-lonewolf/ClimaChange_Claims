        <p>Errata: An Examined Life</p>
        <p>By George Steiner. Yale University, $11.95.</p>
        <p>In this memoir, the scholar, author and literary critic portrays himself as a polyglot polymath who has rarely received the respect he deserves. ''Steiner worships smartness,'' Anthony Gottlieb wrote here in 1998. ''The book is primarily a tour of ideas, not of places or people.''</p>
        <p>The Tesseract</p>
        <p>By Alex Garland. Riverhead, $13.</p>
        <p>The author's follow-up to his hugely popular first novel, ''The Beach,'' is a four-part narrative mosaic, set in the Philippines, that unfolds through the points of view of many unrelated characters, including a young, paranoid Englishman, a murderous gangster, his driver and an innocent family stung hard by sudden disaster. All of them are haunted by events they can't see coming that utterly change their lives. Last year our reviewer, Elizabeth Schmidt, called this a ''complex, virtuosic'' book highlighted by ''cinematic, poetic, terrifyingly precise'' passages.</p>
        <p>Dancing Naked in the Mind Field</p>
        <p>By Kary Mullis. Vintage, $13.</p>
        <p>The eccentric winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry chronicles his invention of ''DNA fingerprinting'' and his unorthodox theories about the ozone layer, H.I.V., global warming and other issues. ''This is a darkly joyous work, an autobiography of the nervous system of an extraordinary chemist,'' Dick Teresi wrote here in 1998. In What Remains to Be Discovered: Mapping the Secrets of the Universe, the Origins of Life, and the Future of the Human Race, by John Maddox (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $15), the former editor in chief of the British journal Nature reviews the major scientific breakthroughs so far and sets forth an agenda for mathematics, physics, climate research and other fields. ''Maddox makes a persuasive case that science has far to go,'' Paul Raeburn said here last year.</p>
        <p>The Intuitionist</p>
        <p>By Colson Whitehead. Anchor, $11.95.</p>
        <p>In a skewed parallel universe, two rival factions struggle for control of the Department of Elevator Inspectors: the Empiricists and the Intuitionists, who sense psychic vibrations rather than examine machines. Last year our reviewer, Gary Krist, called this a ''starkly original first novel'' and ''an ambitious, wide-ranging exploration of racial struggle and the dynamics of social progress.''</p>
        <p>Johannes Brahms: A Biography</p>
        <p>By Jan Swafford. Vintage, $18.</p>
        <p>This meticulous portrait shows Brahms (1833-97) as the first (and perhaps last) truly bourgeois composer and the first Western composer to feel humbled by the achievements of those before him. ''Swafford retains the genre's requisite wonder . . . tempered with a skeptical imagination,'' Edward Rothstein wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Shadow of Kilimanjaro: On Foot Across East Africa</p>
        <p>By Rick Ridgeway. Owl/Holt, $14.</p>
        <p>A celebrated adventurer chronicles his three-week, 300-mile trek from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro through Kenya to the Indian Ocean. ''Ridgeway is a graceful and engaging companion, and East Africa . . . teems with danger, challenge and excitement,'' Bill Bryson wrote in these pages in 1998. In addition, he ''deftly weaves compact and absorbing interludes'' about the history of conservation, big-game hunting and colonialism. Silent Thunder: In the Presence of Elephants, by Katy Payne (Penguin, $13.95), describes a different kind of journey, that of a scientist into the world of elephant communication. Her research among the free-ranging herds of Africa awakened her to the animals' rich lives and to the horrors of ''culling'' populations. ''Payne offers the opportunity for a rare experience . . . that will change our view of ourselves, elephants and all living things,'' Roger Fouts said here in 1998.</p>
        <p>Hunger: A Novella and Stories</p>
        <p>By Lan Samantha Chang. Penguin, $12.95.</p>
        <p>This graceful collection tracks the mixed fortunes of Chinese-American families from Iowa to Brooklyn. The result is ''a delicately calculated balance sheet of the losses and gains of immigrants whose lives are stretched between two radically different cultures,'' Claire Messud wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>Triage</p>
        <p>By Scott Anderson. Scribner, $12.</p>
        <p>This first novel explores the unlikely bond between an American war-zone journalist paralyzed by guilt and his girlfriend's grandfather, who worked for Franco during the Spanish Civil War. ''It is a story of war, the photographers who cover it and the people they leave behind,'' Christopher Dickey wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Silent Duchess</p>
        <p>By Dacia Maraini.</p>
        <p>Feminist Press/City University of New York, $14.95.</p>
        <p>Set in 18th-century Sicily, this novel revolves around an aristocrat's daughter who is rendered deaf and mute by a childhood rape. The result is ''a story of grace and endurance,'' Kathryn Harrison wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>An American Killing</p>
        <p>By Mary-Ann Tirone Smith. Fawcett Crest, $6.99.</p>
        <p>This thriller about a true-crime writer investigating the death of a congressman with whom she was having an affair probes the chilling neighborliness of modern evil. ''Smith paces herself perfectly and takes the time to ferret beneath the surface of character and incident,'' Ellen Feldman wrote here in 1998.</p>
