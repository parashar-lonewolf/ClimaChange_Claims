        <p>THERE are working stiffs and there are working stiffs, but there is no one in the county quite like Stan, the Quarter Million Dollar Man. Stan works at the Cochran School of Nursing at St. John's Riverside Hospital in Yonkers. The 406-bed hospital, which opened in 1869, decided last year that they wanted to provide students at the nursing school, founded in 1894, with a most modern teaching aid. It's one that can help students learn in a way that goes beyond patient rounds or book studies.</p>
        <p>Enter Stan, wheeled in on a stretcher.</p>
        <p>Stan, who cost $250,000, is a souped-up mannequin. But he is no dummy. Stan breathes, bleeds, urinates and is the proud possessor of a pulse and a heart that beats. In fact, right down to his tongue, which has the capacity to swell, Stan mimics human physiology in almost every way.</p>
        <p>''I can even kill him,'' said Eleanor Fitzpatrick, nursing lab coordinator and the person in charge of Stan. ''And if I kill him, I might even get lucky and be able to defibrillate him and revive him.''</p>
        <p>Stan, whose name derives from the phrase Standard Man, is a human patient simulator. He was made by Medical Education Technologies Inc. and was bought through a combination of grant and hospital money. Hospital officials say he is the first of his kind in the county and one of the few in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>''Stan is not 100 percent real,'' said Dr. Kathy Dirschel, vice president of education for the hospital and director of the nursing school, ''but he's so much better than alternatives like videos. Students can see how organs and body rhythms respond in so many different scenarios. Stan will really help them learn to think critically.''</p>
        <p>Stan is hooked up to a tanks of compressed air, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide as well as a computer system that controls everything from his blinking to the way in which he responds to medication and procedures like cardiopulmonary resuscitation and catheterization.</p>
        <p>Though Stan, who is six feet tall, is built to the specifications of a 30-something white male, his identity is anything but static. Stan comes complete with a wig and interchangeable sexual parts and can be programmed to be everything from a trucker who is overweight and smokes to a healthy 62-year-old to a 90-year-old grandmother. Identity in hand, Stan can, with a click of a mouse, begin to suffer from one of dozens of conditions: from seven minutes of fresh-water submersion to arterial fibrillation to a collapsed lung.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Fitzpatrick said that medically, Stan's flexibility was astounding, but aesthetically, he could be a sight. ''In the wig,'' she noted, ''he looks like something from the W.W.F.''</p>
        <p>The medicine Stan is given is actually sterile water, but as it is delivered, Stan recognizes its bar code and reacts accordingly. Stan's vital signs are monitored in the same way as a human patient's, and Mrs. Fitzpatrick can set up crisis situations and go over them repeatedly, pulling Stan back from the dead more times than Peggy Lee.</p>
        <p>After Stan is treated, those working on him can review logs of how his condition reacted -- and failed to react -- to the drugs and procedures he was given.</p>
        <p>Stan arrived at the hospital last spring. Mrs. Fitzpatrick spent the summer healing and killing him in preparation for school, which opened last week. School officials expect Stan to become a centerpiece of the curriculum and, eventually, a practice aid for the hospital's emergency workers and doctors. From time to time, as money permits, the software for Stan will be updated so that students will be able to try out different treatments on Stan. For instance, there is one available that will show how to treat victims of a chemical warfare attack.</p>
        <p>For years, the school has had a roomful of low-tech dummies in various sizes. But with those dummies, one can only practice certain rudimentary skills, like dressing wounds and colostomy care.</p>
        <p>Stan offers more.</p>
        <p>''He's an important step between practice and the bedside of patients,'' said Dr. Dirschel, who added that it will be important to impress upon students that Stan is only an approximation of the real thing. ''There is nothing as uncontrollable as working on a real human,'' she said. ''Patients have fear and anxiety and no two are the same.''</p>
        <p>Stan, of course, has no emotions.</p>
        <p>But the students do. Mrs. Fitzpatrick plans to give them a lot of leeway in treating Stan, with a caveat. ''Psychologically,'' she said, ''it's not so good to kill Stan.''</p>
