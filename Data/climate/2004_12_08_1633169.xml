        <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 - In an attempt to break a deadlock on energy policy, a diverse group of environmentalists, academics and former government officials will publish a report on Wednesday that presents strategies for making the country cleaner, more competitive and less vulnerable to energy shocks.</p>

        <p>In an attempt to break a deadlock on energy policy, a diverse group of environmentalists, academics and former government officials will publish a report on Wednesday that presents strategies for making the country cleaner, more competitive and less vulnerable to energy shocks.</p>
        <p>The strategies, intended to be the basis for action by Congress, include policies that are generally anathema to at least some of the constituencies represented by members of the group.</p>
        <p>It says the government should force increases in efficiency in cars and electrical equipment, stimulate global oil production, regulate greenhouse gas emissions with a trading system, rapidly expand a new method of burning coal and explore a revival of nuclear power.</p>
        <p>The $5 million, two-year private study, titled ''Ending the Energy Stalemate,'' is intended to be a package-deal blueprint, akin to a Ford Foundation report 30 years ago that first suggested vehicle mileage standards and a national petroleum reserve.</p>
        <p>''There are people in this group who would not have endorsed one part if not for corresponding parts,'' said William K. Reilly, a co-chairman of the study and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President George Bush in the late 1980's and early 90's. ''I'm a lifelong conservationist,'' Mr. Reilly said, ''and 10 or 12 years ago would not have imagined myself advancing the future of coal.''</p>
        <p>The group, the National Commission on Energy Policy, was financed by the Hewlett Foundation and other private sources. John P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard and also a co-chairman, said that with the pressures of the presidential election over, the combination of high prices for oil and natural gas and ''the way things evolved in Iraq'' might make the country ''more ready in principle for this sort of package.''</p>
        <p>The third co-chairman was John W. Rowe, chairman of Exelon, a big power company; members of the group included R. James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence, and Martin B. Zimmerman, a vice president of Ford.</p>
        <p>The group's report suggests sharp increases in fuel economy requirements, and letting automakers buy and sell mileage credits in much the same way utilities now trade the right to emit pollution. It calls for a similar cap-and-trade system for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, with a price limit on the value of a ton of emissions, to avoid stunting economic growth.</p>
        <p>The group advocates spending $2 billion to build one or two sample nuclear reactors using advanced technology. It also supports building electricity plants that cook coal to produce combustible gases, which are then burned in turbines like those used at natural gas plants. This approach leaves open the possibility that carbon dioxide can be captured to prevent global warming.</p>
        <p>The study gives short shrift to several perennial ideas on energy. Hydrogen, championed by the current President Bush in the 2003 State of the Union speech, fails on at least two of the four criteria the commission said a new technology should have: being compatible with the existing distribution infrastructure, and being competitive with gasoline by 2020. The commission cited an estimate by the National Academy of Sciences that full development of hydrogen technology is 50 years away.</p>
        <p>It was not enthusiastic about corn ethanol, because its potential to replace gasoline is limited and the reduction of carbon dioxide is modest. And it costs twice what gasoline does, the report said. Another possibility, the authors said, was an emerging technology, ethanol made from the woody part of plants.</p>
        <p>The report also did not stress ordering electric companies to buy more power from solar and wind plants and other renewable sources. Eighteen states have renewable energy standards, specifying a quotas for such sources; Colorado voters approved one in last month's election.</p>
