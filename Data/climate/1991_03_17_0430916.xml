        <p>IT makes a jubilant image: a colorful sweep of helium-filled balloons soaring into the air, then fading into tiny dots against a blue sky.</p>
        <p>But for 10-year-old Mandy Williams, the founder of Stop Harming Our Animal Friends, an environmental club at Turkey Hill Elementary School in Orange, this pretty picture has another side. Last spring, Mandy and several of her classmates told members of Connecticut's General Assembly that balloon launchings can harm animals, which have been known to mistake the deflated remnants for food and eat them.</p>
        <p>The children's testimony was aimed at persuading the lawmakers to vote for a bill advocated by the Cetacean Society International, based in Wethersfield, to restrict the launchings. As part of an all-school project that combined lessons in civics, science and writing, students wrote to the legislators, and some spoke at the bill's hearing. Students from Charter Oaks Elementary School in Hartford also testified.</p>
        <p>State Representative Mary M. Mushinsky, a Democrat from Wallingford and co-chairwoman of the Environment Committee, said that largely because of the children's efforts, the bill passed, making Connecticut the second state to restrict balloon launchings. (Florida was first.) The law, which went into effect on Oct. 1, prohibits individuals, businesses or state agencies from releasing more than nine lighter-than-air balloons a day. Meanwhile, the Turkey Hill students have continued to apply what they have learned in the classroom, said Eugene Zandri, a math and computer teacher. The children recently initiated a recycling drive and raised $7,000 from returnable bottles and cans that went toward building a new town playground.</p>
        <p>Prompted in part by recent recycling laws and an environmental education program distributed by the state, a growing number of schools across Connecticut are teaching children of all ages to become environmentally conscious. Hundreds of teachers have worked environmental themes into their curriculums, not only in science courses but also in social studies, English, math and other subjects. Educators said they hoped that future generations will be more environmentally responsible. Though teaching children about ecological topics is not new, the educators said the subject has been approached more seriously in the past two years.</p>
        <p>"More and more teachers are trying to help children understand that caring for their environment should be an everyday part of their lives," said the president of the Connecticut Outdoor Environmental Education Association, Susan Craig. "Since they'll be inheriting so many of the problems, they unfortunately aren't going to have much of a choice."</p>
        <p>Students learn about endangered species in science, while geography lessons note the importance of preserving rain forests. They learn about pollution by testing the acidity of their drinking water and discover the concept of land management by designing a town that contains rivers, farms, factories and condominiums.</p>
        <p>Teachers said their efforts are encouraged by the State Department of Environmental Protection, which began offering programs on wildlife, forestry and aquatic life in 1988. Last year, 2,000 teachers completed seminars on how to use the programs, up from 1,200 in 1989, said Diane Joy, the curriculum coordinator for the department's environmental services section.  'Embracing the Idea'</p>
        <p>In 1985, Wisconsin became the first state to require public schools to integrate ecology into the curriculum, and other states are considering similar measures. Legislation to make environmental studies mandatory in Connecticut failed in the 1970's, and the high cost of implementing such a law has prevented renewed legislative efforts, educators said, adding that such measures may not be necessary.</p>
        <p>"We don't have to sell environmental education in Connecticut," said Ms. Joy. "Teachers and students all over the state are already embracing the idea."</p>
        <p>At Park City Magnet School in Bridgeport, students from kindergarten to the eighth grade took part in planting a fruit orchard last fall, and classes frequently go outdoors to study the plant and animal life on the school grounds, said the principal, Ralph Counsil.</p>
        <p>The school is also involved in the Mountain to the Sea project sponsored by the City of Bridgeport and designed to give students from coastal cities and inland suburbs a chance to explore each other's natural environments. "Not only do we share our different ecological resources," said Mr. Counsil, "it's also a wonderful way for city kids and suburban kids to get to know each other." To raise the $30 needed to adopt two whales through the Whale Adoption Agency of the International Wildlife Coalition, third graders in Vita Torres's class at A. W. Cox Elementary School in Guilford, created a newspaper called A Whale of a Paper. The children sold copies for 25 cents apiece to parents, teachers and children, then donated the surplus of $4.80 to the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
        <p>Environment clubs have also sprung up around the state. At Amity Junior High School in Orange, students recently formed a group called Group Action Environmental Awareness, which will work to replace disposal trays and utensils used in the school cafeteria with washable plastic, said Jesse Irwin, an eighth grader and secretary of the organization. Members will also try to find ways to recycle paper from school classrooms, he said.</p>
        <p>Sandee Brown, a first-grade teacher at Hebron Elementary School, said she has made environmental studies a top priority since 1981. During that time, she said, she has received grants from educational resource agencies around the state to create a series of nature trails on the school's property. Now completed, the Hebron Elementary School Nature Trails serve as an outdoor classroom for plant and wildlife studies. Ms. Brown, who last year won the Conservation Teacher of the Year awards from the soil and water conservation districts for Connecticut and the entire Northeast, has also developed a 36-page nature trail guide for students and teachers.</p>
        <p>More recently, she designed a program that pairs sixth graders with first graders. In a unit on owl habitat, for example, sixth graders examined rodent bones and fur to find out how much food owls consume. The students then helped the first graders reconstruct the rodent skeletons as a basic lesson in anatomy. Ms. Brown also incorporated literature and math into the unit by having students read folklore on owls and study the geometry of how the bird turns its head.</p>
        <p>To show how environmental actions can affect businesses, sixth graders then staged a debate over the issue of preserving forests in the Northwest, where the endangered spotted owl nests, versus saving jobs in the timber industry.</p>
        <p>By incorporating ecology into the classwork, "even the slower learners get excited by writing, reading and calculating," said Ms. Brown. "Applying what you observe outdoors to the classroom is an excellent way to meet all academic abilities." Programs From Nature Centers</p>
        <p>Since the early 70's, several ecology organizations have also helped to supplement school curriculums. In 1971, Fairfield's elementary schools adopted a program in which river basin systems were explained to students in grades three to six by trained volunteers from the Mill River Wetlands Committee, a local environmental education group.</p>
        <p>Schools have also taken advantage of outdoor education programs offered by some 58 nature centers in the state, many of which were created in the 1960's. And thousands of youngsters have been introduced to issues like endangered species, acid rain and waste management through the Connecticut Audubon Society's environmental awareness education program created in 1981. Virginia Stevenson, an environmental educator for the society, said she talks to children about everything from pollution to poachers and is often accompanied by her menagerie of ferrets, turtles, owls and snakes.</p>
        <p>"It starts with getting them excited about all of these marvelous animals," said Ms. Stevenson who traveled to 200 schools last year. "Then the older they get, the more I talk about how all life on earth is interconnected, and that we have to be careful not to disturb the balance."</p>
        <p>Parents said their children helped family members to be environmentally responsible by reminding them to carry a bag to the grocery store and to separate the trash.</p>
        <p>"Kids are beginning to realize that if we're going to change the planet, they're the ones who are going to have to take action," said Jesse Irwin's mother, Denise Mirto.</p>
        <p>Educators and parents said that since children will bear the brunt of the earth's current problems, it is never too early to prepare them for what lies ahead.</p>
        <p>"At this point, it's our responsibility to plant those seeds," said Ms. Stevenson of the Audubon Society. "They may not root and grow for a long time, but at least they've been sown."</p>
