        <p>As the Coca-Cola Company tries to regain its footing in Europe after a contamination scare that caused the biggest product recall in the company's 113-year history, executives have made a rare admission: mistakes were made in manufacturing.</p>
        <p>Such humility is far from routine for the soft-drink giant, renowned as it is for superb marketing and a corporate structure that is well oiled from top to bottom. But the crisis in Europe, in which hundreds of people said they felt sick after drinking Cokes, has revealed a different Coca-Cola, one that stumbled repeatedly, making an unfortunate situation even worse.</p>
        <p>When the outbreak began, Coke executives took several days to make the matter a high priority. An apology to consumers came more than a week after the first public reports that people had fallen ill. It was not until June 18 -- 10 days after the first schoolboy became dizzy and nauseated after drinking a Coke -- that top company officials arrived in Belgium. And when Coke did begin to respond, it tried to minimize the reports of illness.</p>
        <p>''I am genuinely amazed that they have reacted like this, and I don't know what has gone on inside the company to make them react like this,'' said David Arnold, a Harvard Business School marketing professor who has studied Coke for years.</p>
        <p>The cardinal rule of consumer-products marketing is that the customers' perceptions -- often divorced from the facts -- are what count, he said, adding that a company like Coke, which has built an $18.8 billion business out of sugar water, should know that better than anyone. ''They should have said yes, there appears to be a problem, instead of  arguing the facts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It will be weeks before the damage to Coca-Cola can be fully assessed. Analysts have already knocked a few pennies a share off earnings estimates for the current quarter for both Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke's bottler in Belgium. And it is clear that in Europe, which accounts for about 26 percent of Coca-Cola's profits, Coke must take aggressive steps to restore its image.</p>
        <p>Philippe L'Enfant, a senior executive with Coca-Cola Enterprises in Belgium, told a Belgian television station on Sunday that the company ''perhaps lost control of the situation to a certain extent.'' While the company had a crisis management strategy, he said, ''The crisis was bigger than any worst-case scenario we could have imagined.''</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola's muted initial approach to its problems appears to have backfired. In a news conference in Brussels last week, M. Douglas Ivester, the company's chairman, said he had chosen to ''take a lower profile on this'' at the request of the Belgian Minister of Health, Luc van den Brossche, and other officials of the Government.</p>
        <p>Yet Coke had taken a low profile well before any ministers took charge. A bar owner near Antwerp reported on May 12 that four people felt sick after drinking bottles of Coke that smelled strange. That incident did not lead to public safety warnings, although samples were tested, and no mention was made of it after other incidents were reported, beginning on June 8, because, a Coca-Cola spokesman said, there was no clear connection.</p>
        <p>Officials in Belgium and France complained repeatedly about Coca-Cola's apparent inability to tell them, in timely fashion, what it knew. ''You can say that since the beginning, Coca-Cola has presented real contradictions,'' said one French official involved in the investigation.</p>
        <p>Some of those contradictions were evident within Coke itself. One spokesman said this week that the May 12 incident was widely known, since it had been ''extensively covered in the Belgian press.'' Another spokesman said minutes earlier that he had never heard of it.</p>
        <p>When the first reports of illness were made on June 8, executives of Coca-Cola Enterprises in Belgium were called in. That day, a Tuesday, schoolchildren in Bornem who had been sold Coke in 200-centiliter glass bottles by their schools experienced dizziness, nausea and other symptoms that led to 42 of them being sent to hospitals over the next 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Odilon Hermans, the director of the St. Mary school in Bornem, a well-to-do suburb of Brussels, got in touch with the Coca-Cola bottling plant in Antwerp that day. He said several managers visited the school and the hospital before nightfall.</p>
        <p>While a Belgian health official said the bottler had recalled several batches of suspect Coke on June 8, Mr. Hermans said it was not until June 10 that unopened bottles at the school were taken away. ''It was after we had to push them a little bit in the beginning,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Government decided to get deeply involved on June 10, after eight children from Bruges, outside Brussels, had to be hospitalized, said Susan Grognard, an assistant to Mr. van den Brossche. They said they felt sick after drinking cans of Coca-Cola and Fanta, a fruit-flavored brand owned by Coke.</p>
        <p>''From that moment, we began following it very closely,'' said the health official. Coke executives were summoned to Mr. van den Brossche's offices for a meeting the following day.</p>
        <p>The meeting took place at noon. About four hours later, the ministry learned that 13 more children had been hospitalized in Harelbeke.</p>
        <p>The news came at a sensitive time. Belgian elections were only two days away. Two ministers had already lost their jobs as a result of an earlier, unrelated scare in which animal feed contaminated with dioxin, a substance that can cause cancer, was found across Belgium.</p>
        <p>That evening, the Belgian Government informed the European Commission and French officials of the steps it had taken. The Belgians also set up a call center to field questions about Coke. It received more than 200 calls by June 14. That day, 42 children were taken to the hospital in Lochristi. Eight more were hospitalized in Kortrijk the next day.</p>
        <p>As more illness was reported, the Government ordered Coke to remove its products from schools. Coke's compliance was not a perfect process.</p>
        <p>''There was a situation where there was a vending machine in a school and the building was locked, and we couldn't get to it over the weekend,'' said Randy Donaldson, a Coca-Cola spokesman.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, voters removed the Prime Minister from office, and on Monday, the Belgian Government ordered all Coke products off the market. Luxembourg enacted its own ban the next day. The Government of the Netherlands banned Coke products shipped through Belgium. And health authorities in France asked Coca-Cola to shut down its plant in Dunkirk, near the Belgian border, after Coke said that a substance had been found on some cans shipped from Dunkirk that was not normally used by the company.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola executives said that a tainted supply of carbon dioxide, the gas that produces the bubbles in a carbonated soft drink, probably caused the smell some of the Belgian children reported. And the substance on the cans, para-chloro-meta-cresol, was traced to wooden pallets used to transport them from the Dunkirk plant. The pallets, ordered from a Dutch company, had been washed with the solvent although it did not meet Coke's specifications, said Robert Pagani, senior vice president for operations at Coca-Cola Enterprises.</p>
        <p>As the bans spread in Europe, Coca-Cola resolutely insisted that its products were not bad for anyone. ''It may make you feel sick, but it is not harmful,'' said Rob Baskin, a spokesman at company headquarters in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>On June 16, in a statement issued at 10:30 P.M. Brussels time, Mr. Ivester, the chairman of Coca-Cola, issued a terse apology from Atlanta. ''We deeply regret any problems experienced by our European consumers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That day, German officials emptied store shelves of Coke products bottled in France or Belgium. Consumer groups in Germany and elsewhere said the company had been less than direct and was unreassuring in its public explanations, which included assertions that the drinks were safe even though people had become sick after drinking them.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola executives displayed a curious indifference to the political and social concerns, from fears of dioxin to trade squabbles over bananas, that were already part of the climate in Europe. In such an atmosphere, ''this would be quite scary to a consumer, because you would assume that Coca-Cola, which is a totally artificial, manufactured product would not have any problems,'' Mr. Arnold said.</p>
        <p>''Meat or fruit might be a risk, but not something like Coca-Cola,.'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivester arrived in Brussels for the first time on June 18. At one point that day he telephoned James E. Burke, who had been the chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson during the Tylenol tampering crisis in the 1980's, and talked ''at great length,'' according to Mr. Burke's assistant.</p>
        <p>As he did so, health authorities in Spain were recalling thousands of cases of Coke products, and Germany warned consumers to be sure their Cokes were made in Germany. There were no reports of illness from Germany or Spain, and none from Luxembourg or the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>As the bans on Coke products continued into June 21, Mr. Ivester issued a memo to all of his company's 28,000 employees. The subject was the ''Belgian issue,'' and it said, among other things, that the company's ''quality control processes in Belgium faltered.'' He added: ''I have personally tasted the products and held the packages involved with no adverse reaction.''</p>
        <p>Full-page newspaper advertisements appeared that day in French newspapers, asserting the safety of Coke products and listing a toll-free number for people to call with any safety questions.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Coke circulated a toxicologist's report it had commissioned, which concluded that substances found in the products in question were in amounts too small to have caused the symptoms people reported. It fanned rumors, reported in European newspapers, that people who said they got sick were actually experiencing ''psychosomatic'' illnesses.</p>
        <p>Coke ran an advertisement in Belgian newspapers on June 22 that offered a more contrite apology, topped by a photograph of a smiling Mr. Ivester. ''I should have spoken to you earlier, and I apologize for that,'' the ad read. ''Over the past several days in Belgium, we allowed two breakdowns to occur in fulfilling the promise of Coca-Cola.''</p>
        <p>The next day, June 23, Belgium lifted the ban on Coke's bottled and canned soft drinks. Mr. van den Brossche said Coke had agreed to conditions, including tighter quality controls, that he had set.</p>
        <p>By Friday, all other countries had followed suit, and complaints of illness had, for the moment at least, ceased. An investigation continues in France, focused on the Dunkirk plant. Vending machines remain shut down in Belgium until the authorities check all 11,000 of them.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the company announced a recall in Poland, this time of its Bonaqua bottled water. Mold was found growing at the bottom of 1,500 bottles, according to Coke officials, who said it was not dangerous, although Polish health officials said it could cause digestive problems.</p>
