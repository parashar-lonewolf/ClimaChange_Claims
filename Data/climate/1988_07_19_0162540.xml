        <p>LEAD: Momentum toward a global warming caused by the greenhouse effect is now so great that there is no way to avoid a significant rise in temperature in the coming century, many scientists around the world now agree.</p>
        <p>Momentum toward a global warming caused by the greenhouse effect is now so great that there is no way to avoid a significant rise in temperature in the coming century, many scientists around the world now agree.</p>
        <p>Even draconian measures to reduce the air pollution that is responsible for the global warming can only buy time to adjust to a warmer world and put a ceiling on the ultimate warming, these scientists say.</p>
        <p>It is already time, they warn, to begin planning how to cope with the consequences of the increasing temperature and the associated changes in weather patterns, a rising sea level and other effects.</p>
        <p>Yet strong measures to slow emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and reduce the ultimate temperature increase are also crucial, many experts believe. Without preventive action, they say, the pace of change will be so rapid that nature and human society will be seriously disrupted.</p>
        <p>''What I fear most is rapid change,'' said Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist for the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. The faster the changes, the more ''surprises and imbalances,'' he said. ''The effects on forests, and of sea level change, will be more damaging.''</p>
        <p>''But if the change is slow enough you can study the problems, determine what the regional impacts will be and learn how to adjust,'' Dr. Schneider said. ''For example, you could develop seeds that will be able to take advantage of a longer but drier growing season.''</p>
        <p>Some Government officials and scientists are skeptical about the human ability and will to make the kinds of broad adjustments necessary to make a substantial reduction in the pace of global warming. Making the political case for painful countermeasures is hard because scientists still cannot say exactly what and where the disruptions would be.</p>
        <p>And some serious conflicts of interest arise. How would curbs in energy use be divided, for example, among rich countries, which now burn the bulk of the world's fuels, and poor countries desperate to develop? Should countries seek to revive faltering nuclear power, which does not produce the carbon dioxide chiefly involved in the greenhouse effect, or should they subsidize conservation and solar energy? Will improvements in energy efficiency meet the need, or must ways of life be altered?</p>
        <p>Given the costs of preventive action and the uncertainties about the benefits, some scientists and officials, including members of the Reagan Administration, argue that it makes sense to await more scientific knowledge before implementing expensive measures. There seems to be growing consensus, however, that the dangers of inaction outweigh the risks and costs of acting in face of scientific uncertainty.</p>
        <p>One thing, at least, now appears clear to most atmospheric scientists. If the temperature increase is to be held to a minimum, there is no alternative to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is chief among the gases emitted by human activity. The gases absorb infrared radiation from the sun that would otherwise be reflected back into the upper atmosphere, thus causing a gradual warming of the lower atmosphere and earth's surface. And among fossil fuels, coal, which is the most plentiful and the cheapest is the worst culprit. Gaining a given amount of heat from coal releases double the carbon dioxide than from natural gas, and a quarter more than from oil.</p>
        <p>Other ''greenhouse gases'' include chlorofluorocarbons and halons -widely used industrial chemicals that many nations have agreed to reduce because they also damage the upper atmosphere's ozone layer - as well as methane from agriculture and waste dumps and nitrous oxides from motor vehicles, industry and fertilizers.</p>
        <p>Some experts, including Dr. Irving M. Mintzer, a scientist for the World Resources Institute, a Washington research group, believe that the necessary adjustments can be made with relatively little pain if officials move quickly and aggressively.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mintzer said the cuts in carbon dioxide emissions could be achieved by measures that would be desirable even without a global warming problem. They include cars that can would get at least 40 miles a gallon as against the United States average of 20 miles a gallon, more efficient light bulbs and electric appliances, urban planning that reduces traffic congestion, better insulated homes, and a halt to the rapid deforestation of the tropics. The clearing of tropical forests contributes to the problem because the giant old trees contain large amounts of carbon that are released when the trees rot or burn.</p>
        <p>Other experts, including Lester B. Lave, an economist and environmental expert at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, do not think it will be so easy to slow the global trend.</p>
        <p>''If anybody says they have an ice cream syrup recipe for doing it they are pulling our legs,'' he said. 'Less of a Throwaway Society'</p>
        <p>Dr. Lave said that with a growing population and expanding economies, the world will need to consume more energy, even if it is used more efficiently. Realistically, he contended, that will require either burning more fossil fuel or a major expansion of nuclear energy.</p>
        <p>Major changes in daily life would be necessary, he said. ''We get to drive and fly less, and use a lot less fuel for space conditioning,'' he said. ''Our houses can't be as warm in winter or as cool in summer. A lot of materials we use such as plastics and aluminum are really congealed energy. We are going to have to be less of a throwaway society.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lave said that before people will be willing to make such sacrifices, scientists will need to convince them that they will suffer as a result of the global warming.</p>
        <p>''If you really want me to give up my car or my air conditioner, you better prove to me first the earth would otherwise be uninhabitable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most difficult obstacle, in the view of many experts, would be reconciling global curbs in fossil fuels with efforts by poor countries to develop their industry and economies. Many of the countries, including China, the world's most populous, plan to base their economic growth on the expanding use of coal. #3 to 9 Degrees Higher Delegates to a recent conference on world climate change, convened in Toronto by the Canadian Government, recently called for a 20 percent cut in global emissions of carbon dioxide by the year 2005, with the ultimate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent. The world's population is now sending about 5.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, about half of which is absorbed by the oceans and forests. Thus a 50 percent cut in emissions would roughly stabilize the amount of the gas in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>But achieving such a cut in fuel burning in a world with even more people demanding ever better lives would be an awesome undertaking.</p>
        <p>In the last century, as the industrial revolution exploded in Europe and North America largely through an exponential increase in the use of coal and oil, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose to about 350 parts per million from about 274 parts per million. According to several mathmatical models prepared by scientists, when the amount of carbon dioxide reaches about 550 parts per million, about double that of the pre-industrial era, the average annual temperature will be 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it would otherwise be. Such an increase would be outside the experience of human history.</p>
        <p>At the current level of fossil fuel use, the doubling of carbon dioxide would be reached sometime around 2060 to 2070, according to several estimates. At the same time, other gases contributing to the greenhouse effect are also increasing, so the 3-to-9-degree warming may occur as early as 2030 by some estimates.</p>
        <p>Such a rapid warming, by melting glaciers and causing thermal expansion of oceans, would raise the sea level by one to four feet. It would also cause disruptive shifts in weather patterns. So far, however, the global computer models cannot predict with confidence what those shifts will be. Best and Worst Cases</p>
        <p>Dr. Mintzer has prepared several different models for global warming based on different policies for using fossil fuels. If current trends in fuel use continue, he found, fossil fuel burning would be two and a half times its 1986 level by the year 2075, and average global temperatures would rise 5 to 15 degrees.</p>
        <p>In the worst case model, in which the use of coal and other fossil fuels increases fivefold by 2075, global temperatures would rise 10 to 30 degrees.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mintzer's best case model, which would entail substantially improved efficiency in the use of energy by industry, motor vehicles and houses, rapid introduction of solar and other renewable energy sources and a global commitment to restoring forests, shows temperatures rising 3 to 8 degrees by 2075.</p>
        <p>Policies to reduce carbon dioxide would not be intended ''to return to levels of a prehistoric environment but to influence climate change so it can be managed with minimum disruption of human society,'' Dr. Mintzer said.</p>
        <p>Slowing down the rate of warming is crucial because it would give scientists time to find out what the problems will be and what responses are feasible and allow governments industry and individuals time to carry out those responses, Dr. Mintzer contended.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chauncey Starr, president emeritus of the Electric Power Research Institute, an arm of the electric utility industry, said he doubted that the goals of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the middle of the next century could be achieved. 'World Has No Choice'</p>
        <p>''Certainly everyone using fossil fuels should use them as efficiently as possible to reduce effluents into the atmosphere,'' he said, ''but the reality is that most of the world has no choice but to use fossil fuels.''</p>
        <p>While the amitious goals set in Toronto may not be achievable, the rate of carbon dioxide emissions could be slowed by increasing use of energy sources that do not release carbon, such as solar, hydroelectric and nuclear power, Dr. Starr said. Changes in technology, like substituting electric cars for gasoline-powered vehicles in urban areas could also help, he said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Starr also suggested that some of the adjustments needed to reduce the pace and scope of global warming might not be worth the cost. Reducing the carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants in the United States by 50 percent would buy ''a year or two of time'' in delaying the onset of the greenhouse effect, he said, adding, ''What would you be willing to pay for that?''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said the response to global warming should be based ''not on economic judgments alone but on strategic considerations,'' similar to expenditures on national defense. Because of all the scientific unknowns, it is not feasible to apply cost-benefit analysis to the problem, he said. ''But in my value system,'' he added, ''prudence means slowing it down.''</p>
        <p>At the recent Toronto conference, Michael B. McElroy, chairman of Harvard University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said, ''We face an immediate and important challenge: to understand and predict the consequences of our actions, and to bring this knowledge to bear on policy so as to preserve the viability of the planet for ourselves and for generations yet unborn.''</p>
        <p>''It is an awesome responsibility,'' he said.</p>
