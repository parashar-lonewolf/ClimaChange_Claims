        <p>RAIN at a monitoring station in central Pennsylvania registered the highest acid content of 131 sites in 46 states, according to a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit group, which is based in Washington, has lobbied for sharp reductions in pollutants that cause acid rain, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In the new report, which was based on Federal monitoring data from 1987, Pennsylvania held the No. 1 ranking for acidic rainfall.</p>
        <p>The council said the rain that was the most acidic was recorded at the Leading Ridge in Huntingdon County, in central Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Rain there had an average pH of 4.08, which is 33 times more acidic than unpolluted rain, the council said.</p>
        <p>The pH scale measures acidity, with 7 being neutral. The lower the number, the more acidic the rain. Unpolluted rain is slightly acidic, with a pH of 5.6.</p>
        <p>Many pollutants are emitted by coal-fired power plants, factories and cars. The materials are thought to undergo changes in the atmosphere and fall to Earth as acid rain, snow, sleet, fog and dry particles.</p>
