        <p>LEAD: The people who gathered in Crystal City, Va., last weekend to exhibit their work at the annual Inventors Expo came from all walks of life.

        <p>The people who gathered in Crystal City, Va., last weekend to exhibit their work at the annual Inventors Expo came from all walks of life. Among the more than 50 who promoted their achievements were an opera singer, two pediatricians, an electrical engineer and a Federal official.</p>
        <p>But they brought no high technology to the event, which is sponsored by the Patent and Trademark Office. Instead, most displayed home-built devices: a hammer that prevents the inadvertent smashing of a thumb; an automatic transmission for bicycles; a baby walker that will not collide with walls.</p>
        <p>James Hudson demonstrated what he said was a better mousetrap. Shaped like a box, the device was invented by Andrew Pratscher and Phillip Andres. Mice are lured into a chamber with bait. Once in, the mouse trips a sensor that causes the chamber to lift up and dump the rodent into a plastic bag. A pump then replaces the oxygen in the bag with carbon dioxide, suffocating the rodent in 3 minutes. Mr. Hudson formed Hudson Devices Inc. of Carol Stream, Ill., to market the invention. Mr. Pratscher and Mr. Andres received patent 4,741,121.</p>
