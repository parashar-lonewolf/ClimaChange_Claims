        <p>INTERNATIONAL A2-8</p>
        <p>Report on Global Warming Offers Bleak Assessment  In a bleak and powerful report on the future of the planet, the leading international network of climate scientists has concluded for the first time that global warming is ''unequivocal'' and that human activity is the main driver, ''very likely'' causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950.  A1</p>
        <p>A Grim Forecast of Iraq's Future  The public part of a new National Intelligence Estimate about Iraq expresses deep doubts about the ability of Iraqi politicians and troops to secure the country within 18 months, leading to differing interpretations from the White House and its opponents.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said his party would unite to block Senate debate next week on a bipartisan resolution opposing President Bush's troop buildup in Iraq unless Democrats allow votes on at least two Republican alternatives.  A7</p>
        <p>An American Apache attack helicopter was shot down just north of Baghdad and its two-member crew was killed, an American military official said. A7</p>
        <p>Taliban Captures Afghan Town  Taliban militants overran the Afghan town of Musa Qala just three months after NATO troops had withdrawn and handed over control to a tribal council, officials said.  A7</p>
        <p>Violence Worsens in Gaza  In some of the worst internal Palestinian fighting to date, Fatah security force members stormed the Hamas-aligned Islamic University in Gaza City while rival factions battled throughout the Gaza Strip. At least 17 people were killed.  A3</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A9-12</p>
        <p>At Least 19 Are Killed By Tornadoes in Florida  Rescue workers searching for survivors combed through rubble in Central Florida after thunderstorms and tornadoes killed at least 19 people and flattened hundreds of homes. Though a tornado watch had been posted earlier, the National Weather Service issued warnings just minutes before the twisters hit.  A9</p>
        <p>Texas to Require HPV Vaccine  Gov. Rick Perry signed an order making Texas the first state to require all 11- and 12-year-old girls entering the sixth grade to be vaccinated against a sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer.  A9</p>
        <p>Record Pentagon Budget  The Bush administration is seeking a record military budget of $622 billion for the 2008 fiscal year, including more than $140 billion for war-related costs. The administration is also seeking an additional $93 billion in the current fiscal year to pay for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, officials said.  A11</p>
        <p>Same-Sex Benefits Denied  Same-sex domestic partners are not entitled to health benefits from public-sector jobs under the State Constitution's two-year-old marriage amendment, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled.  A10</p>
        <p>Katrina Victims Can Sue Corps  Residents of several New Orleans-area neighborhoods that were hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina can sue the Army Corps of Engineers over their claims that a government-built navigation channel was largely to blame for flooding, a federal judge ruled.

        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-5</p>
        <p>Stop-and-Frisk Numbers Up Sharply Since 2002  The New York Police Department released new information showing that police officers stopped 508,540 people on New York City streets last year -- an average of 1,393 stops per day -- and in many cases searched them for illegal weapons. The number was up from 97,296 in 2002, the last time the department divulged 12 months worth of data.  A1</p>
        <p>A Groundhog's Prediction  Groundhog Day has been part of the Western calendar since around the 5th century A.D. But whether it will survive in an age of global warming was one question raised by the coincidence of Groundhog Day 2007 falling on the same day a report was released saying that global warming was an ''unequivocal'' fact likely to keep summers hotter and winters warmer.

        <p>Where Bus Woes May Lead  When Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein hired the consulting firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal, one provision of the $15.8 million contract was to lower the cost of getting children to school.
