        <p>SURE-FOOTED and armed with a tool that looks like a small, highly modified hair dryer, the entomologist Ary Farajollahi descended the crusty, rusted slope of a gully and vanished into the trickling mouth of a storm drain. A mechanical hum droned from deep inside, and, several minutes later, Mr. Farajollahi emerged with his quarry -- 30 or so mosquitoes clinging to the sides of a vacuum canister, their bellies engorged with black morsels of blood.</p>
        <p>''I look for the shine off the mosquitoes resting,'' he said. ''They have a gleam to them. And you see the shadows on the walls.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farajollahi, a graduate student in the department of entomology at Rutgers University's Cook College, is one of six full-time mosquito hunters hired by the state to track the deadly mosquito-borne West Nile virus. On this day, early last month, Mr. Farajollahi, an identification specialist, was following a report of a dead crow discovered in downtown Kenilworth, one of several found in Union County in preceding days. He suspected the virus was near.</p>
        <p>In a sign of how seriously New Jersey is taking West Nile virus, officials have doubled the state's mosquito surveillance program this year, from 5,000 pools to 10,000. A pool is a group of up to 50 of the same species of mosquitoes that are trapped and tested together. The state's broad network of county mosquito control commissions gathers about two-thirds of the insects, with Rutgers handling the other third.</p>
        <p>The season of West Nile is upon us. The first human case of the year was reported on July 9 in a 78-year-old Louisiana man, and experts say a handful of New Jerseyans should begin coming down with the disease within a month. July and August is the peak of the mosquito breeding season in the Northeast, a time when female mosquitoes seek blood meals to nourish their eggs.</p>
        <p>The virus, which mainly infects birds, horses and people, has already begun to show itself. Crows, which are highly sensitive to the disease, have been found with the virus in Atlantic, Bergen, Burlington, Camden, Hunterdon, Mercer, Monmouth, Middlesex, Morris, Ocean and Passaic Counties. Positive mosquitoes have been found in Camden, Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset Counties.</p>
        <p>''West Nile has definitely become endemic in the Northeast, and it will probably continue to spread,'' Mr. Farajollahi said. ''We're not going to have the same numbers that we did in the initial outbreak. But I don't think any of us can sit here and predict when the next major outbreak is going to be.''</p>
        <p>The disease has sickened 152 Americans and killed 18 since 1999, when it first arrived in New York from the Middle East, it is thought. Since then, it has spread west to Texas, north to Maine and south to Florida. In New Jersey, 18 people have been infected and 2 have died. There were 12 cases last year, double the previous year.</p>
        <p>Most people do not feel its characteristic flulike symptoms, and only about 1 percent of its victims die from encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. But the exotic-sounding disease has generated widespread fear.</p>
        <p>''It is a significant health problem,'' said Eddy A. Bresnitz, the state epidemiologist and chairman of the state's interagency West Nile Virus Working Group. ''We've had more West Nile virus cases in New Jersey and more deaths than we've had from anthrax.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey's $3.1-billion-a-year horse breeding industry has been particularly hard hit. It has faced export restrictions and millions of dollars of lost revenue in canceled events, said Dr. Nancy Halpern, assistant director of the Division of Animal Health in the state Department of Agriculture. In all, 58 horses in the state have been infected and 21 have died. The sense of panic is over, however, thanks to a widely used horse vaccine that won conditional approval from the federal Center for Veterinary Biologics last year.</p>
        <p>Though health authorities have learned much about the virus since it began killing exotic zoo birds in New York in 1999, many mysteries remain.</p>
        <p>''One of the things we are interested in answering is, do mosquitoes give it to the crows, or do the crows give it to the mosquitoes?'' said Wayne Crans, the director of the mosquito research and control unit of the Department of Entomology at Cook College. ''No one knows how this virus passes through winter. People assume it is mosquitoes, but in fact we've tested a lot of mosquitoes in hibernation and none of them seem to have the virus.''</p>
        <p>A Long List of Suspects</p>
        <p>Scientists do not even know which kind of mosquito is responsible for transmitting the disease to humans. There are about 65 varieties of mosquito in the state, and 17 have been found with the virus.</p>
        <p>''Four are bird feeders and are probably not involved in the transmission to humans, and we have to sort through the remaining 13 to find out who should be directing most of control efforts against,'' Dr. Crans said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farajollahi thinks of the long-legged pests as beautiful. Like snowflakes, none are exactly the same, he says. Some are spotted, others banded. Some feed exclusively from birds, and others from cold-blooded animals. Some species can breed in soda cans and puddles; others require the vast expanse of salt marshes.</p>
        <p>''They are part of the web of life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the graduate student is a ruthless hunter and user of ingenious traps. One device mimics mosquitoes' prey by exuding carbon dioxide. A hunk of dry ice lures the insects toward a battery powered-fan, which draws the unlucky feeders into a net. Another entices pregnant females with ''stink water,'' fermented with grass and brewers yeast, to resemble the stagnant pools where mosquitoes lay their eggs, like little rye seeds, on the surface of the water.</p>
        <p>To try to centralize the surveillance data, the state Department of Health this year introduced a Web database that uses Geographical Information System technology to track infected birds, mosquitoes and people. So far, three counties have access to it and by next year, the remaining 18 should be trained to enter their results, Dr. Bresnitz said.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of advantages -- efficiency, automation and better turnaround,'' he said. ''Here is really our first effort in the infectious disease realm. There aren't too many states that have a G.I.S. system for communicable diseases.''</p>
        <p>Untouched in the State Budget</p>
        <p>The state government's $2.6 million West Nile budget was one of the few untouched by austerity measures in Trenton this year. The federal government, however, dropped its contribution from $2 million to $1 million largely because so many other states are competing for the funds as the disease spreads, Dr. Bresnitz said. Counties contribute about $20 million more to mosquito control, he said.</p>
        <p>''It is to the credit of our Legislature and our governor that they recognize this is a significant problem in New Jersey,'' Dr. Bresnitz said.</p>
        <p>The surge of cash and interest may be new for the state, but mosquito surveillance is definitely not. For at least 30 years, entomologists in New Jersey have been testing mosquitoes for two deadly relatives of West Nile -- Eastern Equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis. Both are present in New Jersey's wildlife, and both can sicken humans.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has one of the most highly developed systems of mosquito control in the nation because of the efforts of John B. Smith, a lawyer who became the state entomologist in 1889. He helped draft laws to mandate a mosquito control commission in every county charged with exterminating the pests.</p>
        <p>In Monmouth County, one of the hardest hit by West Nile last year with nine infected horses, the Monmouth County Mosquito Extermination Commission hires about 20 full-time employees, 40 in the summer. Biologists use three kinds of pesticide to kill mosquito larvae in thousands of ditches, catch basins, salt marshes and flooded lawns. The commission also stocks abandoned swimming pools, detention basins and other stagnant pools with larvae-eating fish in a joint program with the state Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>Four flocks of hens are posted at horse farms as sentinels for West Nile virus. The birds do not get ill from the disease but it shows up in blood tests.</p>
        <p>Because of the long-established control programs, Monmouth County has not resorted to aerial spraying to kill adult mosquitoes, an approach that New York was famously forced to take.</p>
        <p>''It's what we consider to be our last resort,'' Dr. Crans said. ''There are so many other ways to get the job done without using adult control.''</p>
        <p>The surest way for the average person to control mosquitoes is to drain standing water from areas around the home where they breed, he said.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Farajollahi, who doesn't use mosquito repellent when he does his rounds, hard work makes all the difference.</p>
        <p>''I know that we are on top of it, and as soon as we start to see activity, we're going to take control,'' he said. ''People need to realize that we are out there and we are trapping.''</p>
