        <p>LEAD: In H. G.

Now, bacteria are being embraced as potentially potent allies in a more realistic battle against a growing number of hazardous wastes in soil and water.</p>
        <p>In H. G. Wells's ''The War of the Worlds,'' invaders from Mars crushed the most powerful weapons the panicked human race could throw at them and were on the brink of total conquest when they were wiped out by the humblest of earthly organisms - bacteria. Now, bacteria are being embraced as potentially potent allies in a more realistic battle against a growing number of hazardous wastes in soil and water.</p>
        <p>Using bacteria and other microbial forms of life like fungi for cleanups -a technique known as bioremediation - is actually an old practice. Bacteria have been used to process sewage in municipal plants for nearly a century. Industrial plants and food processors have also used them in increasing quantities during the last 20 years to reduce the amount of organic pollutants they dump into rivers or sewer systems.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, however, an explosion in research on the astonishingly diverse world of microbes and a growing awareness of the costs and limitations of other waste-disposal technologies have nudged bioremediation beyond its historic niches.</p>
        <p>Devouring an Oil Spill</p>
        <p>In Alaska, fertilizers were applied to some beaches to encourage native microorganisms to devour the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez in March 1989. The Mega Borg accident in the Gulf of Mexico this month marked the first time laboratory-grown bacteria were applied to an oil spill. Alpha Environmental Inc., a five-year-old Austin, Tex., company that supplied the bacteria, says it is still awaiting word on the results.</p>
        <p>But the progress that most impresses waste engineers has been in more mundane cleanups. Bioremediation has been applied at numerous sites where petroleum products, pesticides, chemicals used to preserve wood and other toxic substances have dripped or been dumped.</p>
        <p>Bacteria are also used in oil wells to break up paraffins and other materials that clog production as wells age. Others are sold to restaurants to consume grease and substances that cause odors. Researchers have discovered that certain species of bacteria can even attack metals, inorganic chemicals and compounds containing chlorine - wastes once deemed impossible targets for bioremediation.</p>
        <p>''It has become accepted as a possible option for many problems,'' said Richard Sloan, manager of special projects for the ARCO Chemical Company. Mr. Sloan has overseen the French Ltd. project in Texas, the first program approved by the Environmental Protection Agency to demonstrate the ability of bacteria to cleanse a major hazardous-waste disposal site without removing soil or water.</p>
        <p>Revenues are still measured in the millions rather than tens of millions for most bioremediation companies, but industry participants estimate that more than 200 companies are in the business. That includes units of giant chemical concerns like Du Pont Environmental Services Inc., as well as a number of start-ups backed by venture capital.</p>
        <p>Industry participants say that bioremediation can be only one-tenth as expensive as incineration, which is regarded as the surest way to destroy most wastes. But bioremediation frequently has to be combined with other techniques, including incineration, vacuuming, chemical treatments, pumping and soil removal to clean a hazardous waste site completely. Simply determining what is at a site and how much can be done by bioremediation is a major challenge.</p>
        <p>'Easy to Make Claims'</p>
        <p>''This is a natural for the snake-oil salesmen,'' said Peter Johnson, who has studied bioremediation for the Office of Technology Assessment, an arm of Congress. ''It's easy to make claims and it's difficult to construct a scientific experiment good enough to prove or disprove them.''</p>
        <p>In the long run, microbes may be most widely used to prevent pollution. For example, there are widespread experiments with bacteria that absorb some of the sulfur in coal; they may provide a simple way to make coal cleaner before it is burned. Other bacteria convert coal into methane, which might provide a low-cost, albeit slow, way to produce an energy-rich gas. Both methods could reduce the risks of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Currently, though, the E.P.A. sees bioremediation as the best hope for cleaning up many hazardous waste sites without transporting material away from them. It may be an especially useful method for dealing with polluted ground water or land under buildings that remain in use. Nevertheless, regulators have moved slowly because of public fears about bioremediation.</p>
        <p>'Conflicting Messages'</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. sends very conflicting messages,'' said Keith Kaufman, president of the year-old Applied Biotreatment Association, a Washington trade group.</p>
        <p>The public fears stem in part from the connection between bioremediation and genetic engineering. The thought of releasing artificial bacteria has never been popular. Just that possibility was emphasized in the 1970's by highly publicized legal battles over whether new organisms created in a laboratory by gene splicing could be patented. The microbe at the center of the 1980 Supreme Court case that settled the issue in favor of patentability was a hydrocarbon-eating bacterium created by Ananda Chakrabarty, then a researcher for the General Electric Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chakrabarty's microbe performed too poorly to have any commercial value, so the question of releasing it never arose.</p>
        <p>The focus in bioremediation remains on naturally occurring microbes. The goal is to find those species that consume or break down undesirable substances and then to figure out how to make them flourish. Usually, that means finding ways to get more oxygen and nutrients to the microbes.</p>
        <p>Challenges Remain</p>
        <p>Microbes with a taste for toxic chemicals are surprisingly easy to find - most hazardous waste sites have plenty of them - but the next steps are often challenging. Bacterial populations can be disrupted by changes in weather, the chemical environment in which they live, and, because many live off byproducts created by other microbes, by changes in their neighbors.</p>
        <p>In contrast to public fears that bacteria will suddenly start consuming the wrong things or spread to consume oil supplies in addition to spills, the constant concern of those in the industry is that the bacterial populations deployed in cleanups will die out or work too slowly to be useful.</p>
        <p>Moreover, many of the hazardous wastes that are candidates for bioremediation are complicated. There are, for instance, more than 200 forms of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that were once widely used in the power industry, by manufacturers and by railroads. More than 100 types of PCB's show up mixed in a typical waste site, according to researchers at General Electric. PCB's are destroyed by both aerobic (oxygen-breathing) and anaerobic (not breathing oxygen) microbes, but in different ways and with different bacteria preferring different PCB's.</p>
        <p>Some Mysteries</p>
        <p>G.E., which has become a leader in bioremediation research, says many fundamental questions remain, including why the bacteria contain genes to make an enzyme that attacks PCB's. Unlike oil, PCB's are too new for bacteria to have evolved methods to utilize them for energy.</p>
        <p>The link between bioremediation and hydrocarbons is more natural but not necessarily more straightforward. ''Crude oil has over 30,000 molecules in it,'' said Dr. Michael Nelson, senior microbiologist for the Ecova Corporation, a Redmond, Wash., remediation company. ''That's a very complex matrix to attack.'' So far, cleanup companies have been far more successful in finding bacteria with a lusty appetite for light oil products, like diesel fuel, than for heavier oils. In most cases, even those bacteria that consume a range of hydrocarbons will go for the light oils first.</p>
