        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael Marissen's article reminded me of Samuel Butler's quote: ''Handel is so great and so simple that no one but a professional musician is unable to understand him.'' Misunderstanding only begins to describe the many faults of Mr. Marissen's analysis. His contention that Handel's work is anti-Semitic is a preposterous leap. Undoubtedly Jennens, an evangelical Christian, participated in the debate of his day between deists and Christians (as common as the debate over global warming today). It is an unsupportable stretch to conclude that because the word ''heathen'' was changed to ''nations,'' Jennens (and Handel) had the Jews in mind. It is much more likely that Jennens meant all of humanity and its sinfulness.</p>

        <p>Typology had nothing to do with it. Handel was concerned with his music and striving to find a way to reach a wide audience. It really was that simple.</p>
