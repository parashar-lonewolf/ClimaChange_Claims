        <p>Correction of Aug 23 article on climatologist Roger A Pielke Sr's resignation from panel advising Bush administration on temperature changes regarding his position on global warming</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Science Times last Tuesday about a climatologist's resignation from a panel advising the Bush administration on temperature changes in the atmosphere misstated his position on global warming. The scientist, Roger A. Pielke Sr. of Colorado State University, says warming is caused mainly by human activities; he does not disagree with that widely held view. Where he differs with many scientists is on the amount of warming from the accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide, as opposed to other factors; on the reliability of temperature measurements on the earth's surface; and on the value of computer projections that estimate future climate change.</p>
