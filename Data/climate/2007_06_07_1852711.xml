        <p>As leaders of wealthy nations converged Wednesday on a Baltic Sea resort for their annual meeting, the White House effectively derailed a climate change initiative backed by one of President Bush's strongest European allies, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.</p>
        <p>The White House said it would hold firm against concrete long-term targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a major priority for Mrs. Merkel, the host of the Group of 8 meeting.</p>
        <p>The meeting got off to a tense beginning, as several thousand protesters blocked roads and rail lines to Heiligendamm, the luxury resort town about 10 miles from here where the meeting was being held. Demonstrators in clown makeup and pink and yellow wigs danced outside a steel fence surrounding the meeting site, clashing with the police, who used tear gas to disperse them.</p>
        <p>The Group of 8 meeting is always one part substance and one part political theater, and Wednesday was no exception. The rock star Bono and the concert organizer Bob Geldof turned up, along with a Senegalese musician, to lobby heads of state, including Mr. Bush, to spend more money combating global poverty and AIDS in Africa.</p>
        <p>The real work of the meeting will get under way on Thursday, when Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia are to have a much-anticipated meeting. The two have been at odds over missile defense, although Mr. Bush told reporters on Wednesday that he saw no need for military action if Mr. Putin decided to again aim Russian missiles at Europe, as he has suggested he might.</p>
        <p>The theme of the meeting is ''growth and responsibility in the global economy,'' but by Wednesday, it was apparent that the biggest rift will revolve around climate change.</p>
        <p>After lunch with Mr. Bush, Mrs. Merkel seemed to concede -- without explicitly saying so -- that her plan was off the table.</p>
        <p>''There are a few areas here and there we will continue to work on,'' she said, standing side by side with the president outside an elegant white castle on the grounds of the Kempinski Grand Hotel. When Mr. Bush turned to her and said he has ''a strong desire to work with you'' on the issue, the chancellor pursed her lips.</p>
        <p>Specifically, Mrs. Merkel is pressing the Group of 8 to adopt a plan to cut emissions in half by 2050 and to limit the rise in global temperature to two degrees Celsius -- terms the president's chief environmental adviser, James L. Connaughton, said Wednesday the United States was not prepared to accept.</p>
        <p>Instead, he said, the final communiqué approved by the Group of 8 nations -- the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and Japan -- would probably reflect a merging of Mrs. Merkel's plan with a proposal by Mr. Bush. In a major speech on climate change last week, the president said he intended to convene major polluting nations, including China and India, in a series of meetings aimed at setting long-term goals by the end of 2008.</p>
        <p>''Here's a way to get China and India at the table,'' Mr. Bush said Wednesday, in a roundtable with reporters before his lunch with Mrs. Merkel.</p>
        <p>He said the United States ''can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal'' and ''those who are reluctant to participate in the dialogue.''</p>
        <p>The climate change issue, though, is a delicate one for Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Bush, who have forged a strong bond since she took office in November 2005. With Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain planning to leave office later this month, and the new French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, an unknown quantity to Mr. Bush, Mrs. Merkel may be the president's best friend in Europe, and he can ill afford to cause strain to the relationship.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Merkel, a former physicist who has made global warming her signature issue, has staked her reputation on making real and significant progress on the problem during this year's meeting. Experts agree that she has more at stake than Mr. Bush; if she appears to be caving in to the president's demands, she risks a backlash at home. But neither does she want a public dispute with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''She does not want to make this a public spat,'' said Julianne Smith, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''But she was elected in part because she's a scientist, she has a very strong position on this, and Germans are huge fans of any effort to cope with climate change. So for her own public, she has to show that she's being a bit forceful with the United States and she's putting her foot down.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Merkel's chief adviser on climate issues, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, said he expected no agreement on long-term targets for reducing emissions. But he said he was even more worried that the leaders would not agree to another part of the German proposal: a pledge to increase energy efficiency 20 percent by 2020.</p>
        <p>''It would be very disappointing if the energy efficiency issue is marginalized,'' Mr. Schellnhuber said in a telephone interview. ''It's a huge, low-hanging apple, which can be plucked now.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Connaughton said the White House believes efficiency goals should be set by individual nations. He sought to play down the notion of a rift between the United States and Germany, saying that in fact there was more agreement than disagreement, and any assertion to the contrary would be a ''gross distortion.''</p>
        <p>One question is what role Russia will play; a spokesman for Mr. Putin, Dmitri Peskov, said Wednesday that Mr. Putin found ''positive and pragmatic aspects'' in both the Bush and Merkel plans. Another question is how hard Mrs. Merkel will push Mr. Bush behind closed doors, and what kind of concessions -- if any -- she will be able to extract in the language of the final communiqué, to be issued Friday.</p>
        <p>''They may try to work out language in the final communiqué that might mention, for example, some targets and some numbers, but leaves it to individual states to decide whether or not to adhere to them,'' said Charles Kupchan, an expert on Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
        <p>''I would think she's going to push Bush hard for it, and she will have the backing of her European comrades, but I doubt it's going to be enough to turn Bush on the issue.''</p>
