        <p>If it had been a normal November, Daniel Jones would have stayed at Hunter College through the Thanksgiving break instead of heading home to Kalamazoo, Mich. ''There's a lot of stuff I want to do in New York City,'' said Mr. Jones, a 19-year-old sophomore who had never been to the city before last year.</p>
        <p>But this was no normal November. The fate of the planet was at stake, and Mr. Jones had a chance to jump in and try to save it.</p>
        <p>Months earlier, he had seen a bulletin from an environmental group inviting more than 200 college students to come to this Dutch city to help influence negotiators who were going to tussle for two weeks over the details of a proposed treaty to fight global warming.</p>
        <p>And now he was here, with an emergency cell phone number scribbled on his forearm in case he was arrested, with a pad full of notes on where Senator Larry Craig's aide was headed, when the reception put on by nuclear power lobbyists was scheduled, what restaurant the delegates from the United States frequented for breakfast.</p>
        <p>He was on the inside.</p>
        <p>''It's a beautiful thing,'' Mr. Jones said, cracking a shy, sly smile. ''It's just so great -- like college pranks, but with a difference.''</p>
        <p>Over the course of a week here, he and more than 220 students from dozens of states had the ultimate class in environmental education, some of it uplifting and some of it a sobering reality check.</p>
        <p>Their goal was to serve as a goad, a conscience, a jab in the ribs of the lobbyists and delegates from 170 countries, conveying the message that all the minutiae they were debating -- articles 3.14 and 4.8, the emissions targets, loopholes and disputed phrases marked by brackets -- really mattered to somebody.</p>
        <p>The treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was conceived in Japan in 1997 after a decade of debate on how to curb the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from cars and power plants and burning forests.</p>
        <p>A century-long buildup of these gases, mainly carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, was thought to be raising the planet's thermostat. If enacted, the treaty would require dozens of industrialized countries to cut emissions of warming gases by 2012 to at least 5 percent below where they stood in 1990.</p>
        <p>Until the meeting here, the Kyoto treaty was essentially a new, high-stakes sport, but with no rule book, no field boundaries, no penalties.</p>
        <p>Greenpeace USA, concerned that this was going to be another in a long line of inconsequential conclaves full of huddling dark-suited diplomats, decided to inject a big dose of adrenaline. And it wouldn't hurt to foster a new generation of activists, said John Passacantando, who became the group's executive director this fall.</p>
        <p>''The environmental movement these days is mainly a bunch of 30-somethings or 40-somethings,'' he explained as he assembled the students this week for a news conference and photo session with journalists from Bangladesh, Japan, Australia and a dozen other countries. ''We need a back bench.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones was one of about 1,000 students who sent in applications, replete with essay questions, for the 225 openings. He lacked money to cover the $400 airfare, and sent a letter to Hunter's dean of student affairs, Sylvia Fishman. ''Her only question was how much did I need?'' he said. ''She's amazing.''</p>
        <p>The students' days began at 8:30 a.m., as they roused groggily at the youth hostel near the city's central rail station.</p>
        <p>One morning early last week, dozens of dreadlocked, pierced, tie-dyed young people -- and a few in jackets and ties, including Mr. Jones -- gathered for a breakfast of nut-laced whole grain bread, granola and strong coffee and a dose of strategizing.</p>
        <p>Chris Ball, a Greenpeace official from Washington with the perky air of a camp counselor, strode to a podium and went over some of the highlights of the days ahead, which would include all manner of theatrics and gentle monkey wrenching. He then asked for ''quick downloads'' from participants about their experiences so far.</p>
        <p>A student from Northern California described how he and several others had presented a ''head in the sand'' award outside a news conference by Senator Craig, Republican of Idaho, and Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, who had just finished describing why they opposed the treaty. The award was five Barbie dolls buried upside down in a box of sand.</p>
        <p>Across the breakfast room, another student stood and described how he and more than 20 others had sat in on a presentation by a European organization called Young Generation in Nuclear, which was at the climate conference to promote nuclear power as an alternative energy source that produces no greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>The young Greenpeace campaigners did not share that view. ''We challenged them with question after question,'' the student said. ''It was kind of depressing that someone our age could be so backward.''</p>
        <p>A Greenpeace official told them that a delegation of eight representatives from Congress had arrived. ''Six out of eight got a zero'' on the League of Conservation Voters' report card ranking votes on environmental bills, the official said.</p>
        <p>''Hissssssssssssss,'' came the communal response.</p>
        <p>The students were divided into more than a dozen groups, each focused on a different task: attracting news media attention with catchy demonstrations, dogging the tracks of lobbyists for oil companies and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, talking with American negotiators, who were seen as seeking loopholes, or delegates from countries that had strong environmental policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones was in group 13. His task was ''research and dissemination,'' in other words, intelligence gathering and communicating the latest tactics to all the other groups.</p>
        <p>Every hour or so, in a basement room tucked away from the bustling action in the rest of the sprawling convention center, he and others convened to plot moves.</p>
        <p>They donned Santa Claus hats and handed out stockings full of coal -- the dirtiest of the fossil fuels -- taken by a Greenpeace team a week earlier from a freighter in the nearby harbor of Rotterdam.</p>
        <p>While doing so, they sang modified Christmas carols, including a greenhouse version of ''Jingle Bells'': ''Hot as hell, oceans swell, warmer every day, oh, what fun it is to fry in a world with climate change.''</p>
        <p>One night, Mr. Jones and Janet Sawin, a graduate student at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, jumped on a tram to head to the elegant Des Indies Hotel, where the International Nuclear Forum was the host of a reception for Republican congressmen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, playing the role of decoy, strode straight into the crowd of tailored business suits wearing his red suspenders and a half-dozen brightly colored pins with strident environmental messages.</p>
        <p>Displaying his sly smile, Mr. Jones was swiftly escorted away, but this created an opening for Ms. Sawin, who was wearing an elegant maroon dress and long scarf -- and who quickly cornered Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. Earlier in the day, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Science Committee, had blasted the treaty as a waste of time that would never be supported by Congress.</p>
        <p>Screwing up her courage, Ms. Sawin began peppering him with questions and criticisms of nuclear power and of Republican opposition to the treaty.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Sensenbrenner engaged in the debate, but he slowly realized this was a no-win situation and soon made for the exit. Ms. Sawin smiled.</p>
        <p>By late Wednesday night, with the negotiators making little progress, 80 of the students were starting to feel discouraged and decided to begin a fast that would take the place of the Thanksgiving feast they might otherwise be enjoying back home with friends and families.</p>
        <p>On Thanksgiving, they sat in the restaurants around the convention center staring at empty white plates, with armbands that read, ''Fasting: Ask Me Why.''</p>
        <p>Three of them sat at a table with two White House officials who picked self-consciously at their lunches but gamely conversed with the students.</p>
        <p>Amanda Long, a Wesleyan University student from Wappingers Falls, N.Y., said, ''The U.S. should really take the lead on these things.''</p>
        <p>John Gibson, a member of the American delegation, said that the negotiators were doing the best they could, but that they had to find some compromise that would protect the environment while satisfying the Senate, which must approve a treaty by a two-thirds majority.</p>
        <p>''It wouldn't do the environment much good to sign an agreement that will never be ratified,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Late Thanksgiving night, the students put on a performance of ''The Lorax,'' the environmental parable by Dr. Seuss. At the same time, an energy industry group held a reception in the basement, serving sliced turkey and cranberry sauce while a tape of Monday night's National Football League game between the Redskins and the Rams played on a projection television.</p>
        <p>Then it was time for one of the final crunch sessions, with the conference president calling a late-night  session to order.</p>
        <p>Around 1 a.m. today, as bleary delegates filed into the meeting, Mr. Jones, Ms. Sawin and a half-dozen other students joined a gantlet of campaigners and lobbyists handing out fliers pinpointing problems with the latest negotiating positions.</p>
        <p>The talks had developed a momentum that largely shrugged off their efforts. Most of the leaflets would end up on the floor.</p>
        <p>''The big issue here should be the environment,'' Ms. Sawin said, ''but it's at the bottom of the list.''</p>
        <p>Their 24-hour fast could have ended an hour earlier, but none of the students seemed to be thinking about food.</p>
