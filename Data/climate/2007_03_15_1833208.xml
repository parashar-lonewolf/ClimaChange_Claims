        <p>Last week, I attended my second TED conference, which stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. During the four-day conference, you hear 50 speakers, who are given 18 minutes each.</p>
        <p>They are the most compelling, passionate, informed speakers you've ever heard (all right, maybe 45 of them are). Some bring back reports from the edge of medicine, archaeology, nanotech, neurology, psychiatry or the Web. Some, like Paul Simon, Tracy Chapman, and They Might Be Giants, perform live.</p>

        <p>Last week, I attended my second TED conference, which stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. During the four-day conference, you hear 50 speakers, who are given 18 minutes each.</p>
        <p>They are the most compelling, passionate, informed speakers you've ever heard (all right, maybe 45 of them are). Some bring back reports from the edge of medicine, archaeology, nanotech, neurology, psychiatry or the Web. Some, like Paul Simon, Tracy Chapman, and They Might Be Giants, perform live.</p>
        <p>But a good number of them bring you face to face with some of the most upsetting realities of human existence. The horrors in sub-Saharan Africa. The viruses that are gaining on us. The increasing scarcity of drinkable water. And over and over and over again, climate change, presented with the most harrowing examples, measurements and projections.</p>
        <p>John Doerr, the famous venture capitalist whose firm bootstrapped such startups as Amazon and Google, began his climate-crisis talk with the words, "I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it"--and ended too choked up to speak.</p>
        <p>Another speaker this year actually used the term "species extinction," referring to ours.</p>
        <p>There are so many standing ovations, you're practically doing 18-minute calisthenics. And the cumulative effect of the conference is devastating. You can't return to the real world thinking the same thoughts you thought before; you just can't do it.</p>
        <p>Worse, you can't even explain to other people why the thing is so overwhelming. I had nine minutes to try in a "CBS News Sunday Morning" segment--and the result fell so far short at conveying the effect, they wound up posting it online instead of airing it on TV.</p>
        <p>Only 1,000 people can attend TED live (it's in Monterey, California). The auditorium holds only 500 people; the rest sit downstairs in a comfortable "simulcast lounge" and watch on flat-panel high-definition TV sets. (So why don't they hold the thing in a bigger theater? They tried. Last year, they held one afternoon's talks in a Broadway-style theater. It was a disaster. The enormous hall drained all sense of intimacy, humanity and urgency from the speakers.)</p>
        <p>Next year's conference is already sold out--at $6,000 a ticket, if you can believe that. (Speakers aren't paid, but get a free pass to the conference. This year, I was one of about 20 uncredited "three-minuters"--people who perform shorter, quirkier interstitial talks between the biggies--and was thus given a free conference ticket.)</p>
        <p>Fortunately, TED has begun posting high-quality videos of the talks--specifically re-edited for Web use--at ted.com/tedtalks. You can find 65 of them already online (mine from 2006 among them), ready to watch online or download to your iPod, and TED plans to make many more available.</p>
        <p>There's even talk of streaming the talks live to the Web in future years, which I think would be an awesome idea.</p>
        <p>Anyway, over the next few days, I'll be writing up some of the coolest, most interesting and entertaining talks I heard at TED last week on my blog at nytimes.com/pogue. I'll attempt to limit myself to tech-oriented topics, although with speakers that included Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, James Randi, Lawrence Lessig, Alan Kay, Philippe Starck, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and others, that might not be easy.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, here's your homework. Set aside an hour and watch three of the TED talks online back to back.</p>
        <p>Then check out these Web sites, whose creators were among the presenters this year:</p>
        <p>http://www.bumptop.com (a radical new concept for the computer desktop)</p>
        <p>http://www.wefeelfine.org (a visual, real-time emotion meter that depicts the Internet's bloggers)</p>
        <p>http://www.bmwworld.com/hydrogen/ (BMW's fleet of hydrogen-powered cars)</p>
