        <p>Voters' guides have gone theological. ''Voting God's Politics.'' ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics.'' ''Voting for the Common Good: A Practical Guide for Conscientious Catholics.'' ''Voting With a Clear Conscience.'' And more.</p>
        <p>These are not the familiar guides that line up candidates by their views or votes on a list of selected issues and that, in some cases, give them ratings, a practice that has migrated from lobbies like those on gun control, tax cuts and environmental regulation to religious groups like the Christian Coalition.</p>
        <p>No, the new voters' guides try to be mini-manuals of moral theology and church-state relations, offering voters a religious framework for making their choices, not endorsements of candidates or parties.</p>
        <p>Of course, it isn't that simple. The complex entanglement of theology and politics is made clear in the case of competing Roman Catholic guides, a matter of political import in view of the belief that Catholics constitute a swing vote, especially in what are considered swing states.</p>
        <p>For example, on the eve of every presidential election year since 1976, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops administrative board has issued a booklet raising questions for Catholics to consider as they carry out their political responsibilities. ''Faithful Citizenship,'' in its 2003 edition, emphasized that politics involved fundamental moral choices. While highlighting issues like abortion and euthanasia having to do with the protection of life, it also gave attention to other issues: warfare and terrorism and world poverty and health care, from marriage (''a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman'') and family life to job creation and racial discrimination.</p>
        <p>''Faithful Citizenship'' soon encountered competition, however, from a ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics'' prepared by a San Diego group now called Catholic Answers Action. It argued that Catholics should cast their votes based on candidates' positions on ''five nonnegotiable issues'': abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem-cell research, human cloning and same-sex marriage.</p>
        <p>Citing church documents, the pamphlet argued that unlike war or capital punishment, these issues involved actions that were ''intrinsically evil'' and ''must never be promoted by law.'' Ten million copies of the ''Voter's Guide for Serious Catholics'' were bought, reproduced and distributed during the 2004 presidential campaign, and a new version has been circulating for the November elections.</p>
        <p>Now the pamphlet for ''serious Catholics'' has a competitor of its own, a guide for ''conscientious Catholics.'' Just issued by a new group, Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, ''Voting for the Common Good'' rejects the idea that the question of how Catholics should vote can be answered ''by applying a simple 'litmus test' of a few selected issues.''</p>
        <p>Echoing the bishops' ''Faithful Citizenship,'' it lists seven major themes of Catholic social teaching and mentions 19 issues in alphabetical order, from abortion and the death penalty to war and workers' rights.</p>
        <p>There are yet more variations on these guides. ''Voting With a Clear Conscience'' originates from Priests for Life. It, too, takes the nonnegotiables stance, but with language equating abortion, for example, with terrorism: ''Suppose a candidate came forward and said, 'I support terrorism.' Would you say, 'I disagree with you on terrorism, but what's your health care plan?' ''</p>
        <p>According to the guide, ''Any candidate who says abortion should be kept legal disqualifies him/herself from public service.''</p>
        <p>''Voting God's Politics'' is very different. The product of Sojourners, a liberal monthly magazine with evangelical roots, this voters' guide gives seven brief headings like ''Compassion and Economic Justice'' or ''Peace and Restraint of Violence.'' Each is followed by a biblical passage and several recommended public policies. Some of these state general objectives (''develop clean, efficient and renewable energy sources''), and some get quite specific (''phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq that starts immediately'').</p>
        <p>The dueling guides from Catholic Answers Action and Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good directly challenge each other in the most interesting -- and, given their condensed formats, even the most thoughtful -- ways.</p>
        <p>Both, of course, urge active participation in the political process. Both lean on official church statements from the bishops and Rome.</p>
        <p>Both actually agree on what, after all, is the radioactive issue in this whole debate: the moral status of abortion. One guide highlights abortion among the five nonnegotiable issues; the other lists it among four ''affronts to human life''-- abortion, poverty, torture and war.</p>
        <p>And both recognize the inevitability of compromise in political life, which is where things get interesting.</p>
        <p>''Where all of the available candidates take morally unacceptable positions on one or more of the nonnegotiable issues,'' the Catholic Answers Action guide says, ''a citizen will be called upon to make tough choices.''</p>
        <p>The Catholics in Alliance guide says, ''Since we seldom, if ever, have the opportunity to vote for a candidate with the right positions on all the issues important to Catholics, we often must vote for some candidates who may hold the 'wrong' Catholic position on some issues in order to maximize the good our vote achieves in other areas.''</p>
        <p>At this point the two guides diverge.</p>
        <p>Catholic Answers Action demands that all ''tough choices'' be made within the limits of the five nonnegotiables. It would be legitimate, for example, to vote for a candidate favoring embryonic stem-cell research but at least opposing euthanasia and same-sex marriage. It would be illegitimate to support a candidate aggressive about combating global poverty or preventing genocide in Darfur but favoring embryonic stem-cell research.</p>
        <p>The Catholics in Alliance guide rejects this approach.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Catholic Answers Action guide always emphasizes candidates' positions. Legitimate compromise, it suggests, involves supporting a candidate with one or more disapproved public stances on central moral issues because he holds other, approved ones.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Catholics in Alliance guide says compromise can encompass political effectiveness as well. It compares, for example, candidates who support ending abortion but who ''don't produce results'' with ''candidates who don't believe in making abortions illegal'' but support measures that might reduce the number of abortions.</p>
        <p>At stake are contrasting responses to the reality of political compromise. In this case, one is focused on the preservation of moral principle, and the other on the moral claims of the practical.</p>
