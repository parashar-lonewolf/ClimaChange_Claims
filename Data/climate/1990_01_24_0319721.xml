        <p>LEAD: The Senate began debate today on legislation that would provide powerful new tools for removing pollution from the nation's skies.</p>
        <p>The Senate began debate today on legislation that would provide powerful new tools for removing pollution from the nation's skies.</p>
        <p>The bill would strengthen the existing Clean Air Act with new provisions for reducing acid rain, smog and toxic industrial chemicals that are spewed into the air.</p>
        <p>Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is a chief sponsor of the bill, said its passage would accomplish what was promised by the original Clean Air Act, which was passed 20 years ago: ''protecting public health by making sure that all Americans have clean air to breathe.''</p>
        <p>Although Congress has tried and failed for a decade to strengthen the law, its supporters said that this year the political signs point to success. Several Democratic lawmakers praised President Bush for providing leadership that they say is vital for assuring passage of clean-air legislation this year.</p>
        <p>National Consensus Is Seen</p>
        <p>''There is now a national, bipartisan consensus for tougher environmental protection,'' Mr. Baucus said, adding, ''The American people want us to clean up the air once and for all.''</p>
        <p>But the bill is not expected to sail smoothly through the Senate or through the House when that chamber takes up the legislation. Disputes over the costs of cleaning the air and who pays are expected to produce sharp disputes. Industry lobbyists have called the Senate bill excessively expensive. President Bush has said that he will not agree to legislation that is more costly than the proposal he submitted to Congress last year.</p>
        <p>The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said in statement issued at the outset of today's debate: ''If measured in dollars and cents, this bill should pass because the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of action. It costs the United States more in health care and lost productivity than it would to clean up pollution. This bill will save the American people money.</p>
        <p>''Second, the bill ought not to be measured solely in dollars and cents. That would exclude consideration of the most important of our values: human values.''</p>
        <p>Noting that the 500-page bill was complex, the Democrat from Maine agreed to put off votes on disputed issues until next week to give Senators time to study its provisions. But Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who is also a chief sponsor of the legislation, said that there have been more than 70 hearings on clean air in the Senate since 1981 and that this might be the most heavily studied bill in history.</p>
        <p>Both opponents and proponents of the bill agree that Mr. Bush's support makes it highly likely that Congress will send a clean-air bill to the White House before the year is out.</p>
        <p>The legislation would result in the most far-reaching changes in the clean air law since it was passed in 1970.</p>
        <p>In addition to dealing with acid rain, urban smog and toxic air pollution, the legislation would seek to ease two global pollution problems: a worldwide warming of the earth as a result of pollutants trapped in the atmosphere, and the loss of the atmosphere's ozone layer, which shields the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>The legislation would reduce acid rain by requiring that 107 big power plants in the Midwest make sharp reductions in their emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that cause the problem.</p>
