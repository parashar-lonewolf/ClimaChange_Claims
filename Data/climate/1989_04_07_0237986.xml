        <p>LEAD: Oil whipped by the wind to such a froth that it blows into the trees along the beaches. Oil directly in the path of a giant run of salmon. Oil - millions of gallons - blotting the wide blueness of Prince William Sound like an enormous, oozing shadow. The pictures of the Alaskan spill sickened all who saw them.</p>
        <p>Oil whipped by the wind to such a froth that it blows into the trees along the beaches. Oil directly in the path of a giant run of salmon. Oil - millions of gallons - blotting the wide blueness of Prince William Sound like an enormous, oozing shadow. The pictures of the Alaskan spill sickened all who saw them.</p>
        <p>But say that Capt. Joseph J. Hazelwood had steered his ship straight -say that his oil had reached its destination safely and had been burned in power plants and car engines.</p>
        <p>The 10 million gallons of oil lost in the wreck of the Exxon Valdez would have released into the atmosphere about 60 million pounds of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>It is the buildup of this carbon dioxide, more than any other factor, that scientists say will produce the greenhouse effect, raising the world's average temperature three to nine degrees in the next few generations.</p>
        <p>The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which by virtue of its molecular structure traps the sun's heat, is increasing at a rate of about 1.5 parts per million annually. Sometime in the next century, there will be twice as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there was before the Industrial Revolution. In other words, there is another oil slick. It spreads out above us every second of the day. And it threatens us just as surely as the leaking Exxon Valdez crude threatens the salmon.</p>
        <p>This carbon dioxide is not pollution in the normal sense of that word. We read in the newspaper the other day that after almost two decades of work, car makers have managed to make engines that remove 96 percent of the pollutants: carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen. (The last traces, the experts say, will be almost impossible to erase.) But such ''clean burning'' motors produce no less carbon dioxide than the engine on a Model T Ford. There is no way to burn oil (or coal or natural gas) without releasing carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Even steps that Los Angeles began to adopt last month in an effort to clear its air will not necessarily cut back on carbon dioxide emissions. Planners contemplate a day when cars won't burn gasoline. But while an electric car won't give off carbon dioxide, if it is charged up with juice from an oil-burning electric plant, then it still adds to the greenhouse effect. And if it is powered by a coal-fired generating station, it may make the problem worse, for coal gives off more carbon dioxide than oil.</p>
        <p>The greenhouse effect, in other words, is not the result of something going wrong. It doesn't stem from drunken sailors, inadequate emergency planning or a reef in the wrong place. It's harder to deal with than that because it's just a result of normal life.</p>
        <p>And it can't be cleaned up with absorbent booms or lasers or chemical dispersants or any of the other tools they're trying to use in Alaska.</p>
        <p>Once carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere, a large portion of it will stay for dozens of years, warming the earth. Only by using less energy, and quickly figuring out cleaner ways to generate it, can we help.</p>
        <p>When you look at pictures from Alaska, remember this: The ship that is our planet has a gaping hole in its side, too, and carbon dioxide is pouring out.</p>
