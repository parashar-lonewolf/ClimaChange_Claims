        <p>TOYOTA executives describe their Prius as a ''real car.'' While that might sound like damning a product with faint praise, it is actually a compliment for an alternative vehicle.</p>
        <p>And they are right. The Prius, a so-called hybrid that uses both gasoline and electric power, avoids most of the drawbacks and inconveniences of other vehicles that are designed to be clean and fuel-efficient. Its emissions are among the lowest of any car on the road, and its fuel economy -- 48 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving -- is second only to that of the Honda Insight, another hybrid.</p>
        <p>While the $20,450 price is high compared with conventional gasoline cars of similar size, the Prius is still, to my mind, the first truly practical and affordable family car that uses, at least in part, electric power.</p>
        <p>As such, the Prius, which went on sale in the United States this summer, is a forerunner of a whole breed of hybrid gas-electric vehicles due to appear from virtually all carmakers in the next few years.</p>
        <p>Until now, much of the effort to cut automobile emissions, particularly in California, has centered on fully electric vehicles. While such cars have no tailpipe emissions, they can cost $20,000 more to manufacture than a like-sized gasoline car. And they can travel only 50 to 100 miles or so before the batteries need a lengthy recharging.</p>
        <p>Drivers of hybrids like the Prius and Insight do not have to recharge the batteries because that is done automatically as the car is in motion, with power drawn from the gasoline engine and from recapturing the energy of braking, which would otherwise be wasted as friction.</p>
        <p>When the car is stopped at a traffic signal, the gas engine shuts down, conserving fuel. And at low speeds, when gas engines are inefficient, the battery does the work. But when the car speeds up, the gas engine takes over. When the car accelerates, the battery kicks in to give the gas engine a boost. (In contrast, the Insight relies mostly on its gas engine, with the electric motor providing a boost when needed.)</p>
        <p>Since most of the fuel is saved when the car is idling or moving slowly, the Prius is unusual in that it gets better mileage in the city (52 m.p.g.) than on the highway (45 m.p.g.), according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The Prius, which is pronounced PREE-us and comes from the Latin meaning ''to go before,'' was the world's first mass-produced hybrid vehicle; it has been sold in Japan since 1997. But Honda beat Toyota to the American market with its Insight, which also sells for around $20,000.</p>
        <p>The Insight achieves an eye-popping mileage rating of 61 m.p.g. in town and 68 on the highway, but it has limitations. For now, it comes only with a manual transmission and two seats. And it has a tapered, space-age look that draws stares, for better or worse.</p>
        <p>The Prius, which is made in Japan but was re-engineered for American driving conditions, sacrifices some fuel economy for practicality. It has an automatic transmission that is continuously variable, rather than having a discrete number of gears. Four adults and a five-year-old in a child seat fit reasonably comfortably. And from the outside, the Prius looks pretty much like a normal subcompact.</p>
        <p>One drawback is that the batteries reduce cargo space. The trunk barely held a child's bicycle with training wheels. Also, acceleration is a bit sluggish. The Prius, which has a 1.5-liter engine, goes from 0 to 60 in a little over 12 seconds, compared with about 10 seconds for a Toyota Echo, which also has a 1.5-liter engine (but no electric backup).</p>
        <p>Then there is the price. Toyota has lost money on each Prius it has sold, although executives now say the company is breaking even. Even so, the Prius sells for about $4,000 more than a Corolla and at least $6,000 more than the Echo.</p>
        <p>Don't count on making up for that in lower gasoline bills. Fuel costs for the Prius will run only about $200 a year less than for the Corolla and Echo, according to the E.P.A. At that rate, it would take decades to recoup the higher purchase price.</p>
        <p>This calculation, of course, does not take into account the savings to society from less air pollution -- and the tax breaks intended to reward buyers of cars like this. Prius owners could be eligible for a federal deduction of up to a $2,000 from their gross income, Toyota says.</p>
        <p>Driving the Prius is like driving a regular car: just press the pedal and the car goes. The switch from electric to gasoline power is virtually seamless and imperceptible. The one difference is the gas engine's shutting off at a red light, leading novice drivers to conclude, instinctively, that the engine has stalled. It hasn't, of course, and when the accelerator is depressed the car immediately starts up and begins moving.</p>
        <p>Then there is the dashboard. The shift lever protrudes somewhat oddly from the dash to the right of the steering wheel. This takes some getting used to, and I found the lever obscured my view of the radio controls.</p>
        <p>More important is a small touch screen that displays how the power is flowing within the car, using arrows and pictures of the gas engine, the wheels, the battery and the motor. The arrows change as the vehicle shifts from electric to gas power, and from draining to recharging the battery.</p>
        <p>The display can also show a bar graph of the most recent fuel economy, though I wonder how reliable the figures are. On one trip along a major boulevard here, I recorded 35 m.p.g. for one 5-minute segment and 100 m.p.g. for the next.</p>
        <p>In Southern California's bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic, I also registered as much as 100 m.p.g. because the car was operating mainly on the battery. But after about 10 minutes of this, the battery was half-depleted and the gas engine kicked in.</p>
        <p>Over all, according to the car's calculation, I averaged 43.5 m.p.g. in about 300 miles of mixed highway and city driving, somewhat below the E.P.A. rating.</p>
        <p>Although they welcome hybrids, environmentalists say the ultimate goal should be zero-emission vehicles. Hybrids, after all, drive as well as gasoline cars because they are, in the main, gasoline cars, and they still emit some pollution.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. estimates that a Prius driven 15,000 miles a year will emit 4 tons of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide. While that is well below the 5.5 tons a year, or more, from small gasoline cars like the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, it is still not zero. As for smog-causing emissions like nitrogen oxides, the Prius is a super-ultra-low-emission vehicle, or SULEV, under California rules. That is the best rating short of zero, and it means the Prius's emissions are a tiny fraction of those from most cars. But the SULEV rating has also been achieved by special versions of the gasoline-only Honda Accord EX and Nissan Sentra CA.</p>
        <p>Automakers say it is more effective to use hybrids to get a modest reduction in pollutants across a wide range of vehicles than to strive for zero-emission vehicles that no one will buy. The Prius is a case in point. Toyota expects to easily meet its target of 12,000 sales in the first year; orders are already backed up for months. That is several times the total number of fully electric vehicles sold or leased over several years.</p>
        <p>The California Air Resources Board, after a summer of intense lobbying, decided to stick with its mandate requiring zero emissions from 10 percent of the cars sold by major manufacturers in the state in 2003. Some hybrids would get partial credit toward that goal, but 4 percent of sales would have to be of true zero-emission cars.</p>
        <p>Still, while the Prius may not be the ultimate pollution solution, for those wanting to make a contribution here and now, it is the most practical way to go.</p>
