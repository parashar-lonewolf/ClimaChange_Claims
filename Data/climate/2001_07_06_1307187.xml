        <p>The chairman of a United Nations conference negotiating a climate treaty said on Thursday that he was willing to delay the target date that countries would have to start cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases. His offer of such a compromise was widely seen as a bid to gain Japan's support for the treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        <p>The proposal came during a speech to the Dutch Parliament by the chairman, Jan Pronk, who heads the negotiations and is the Dutch environmental minister.</p>
        <p>He outlined a way to soften the treaty's rules that might make it easier for a country like Japan, facing a recession, to participate.</p>
        <p>The current language of the treaty would require 38 industrialized countries to reduce their annual emissions, averaged between 2008 and 2012, to more than 5 percent below where they stood in 1990.</p>
        <p>''I can imagine that it would be possible to postpone the date of 2008 by two years, to 2010,'' Mr. Pronk said, according to The Associated Press and European wire services.</p>
        <p>Until now, European officials have uniformly resisted any change in the timetable or targets of the proposal.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, many experts on the treaty predicted that Mr. Pronk's move was too little, too late -- with the only chance of American support evaporating after European negotiators rejected proposals from the Clinton administration last November.</p>
        <p>The treaty was negotiated in Kyoto in 1997 and signed by the Clinton administration and 167 other governments, but countries remain deeply divided over its fine print and no large industrialized country has ratified it.</p>
        <p>The treaty has been rejected by President Bush as ''fatally flawed'' because it excuses developing nations from obligatory emissions cuts and could, according to the Bush administration, harm the economy.</p>
        <p>But it could still take effect if countries responsible for more than half of the industrialized world's 1990 emissions of warming gases support it.</p>
        <p>The European Union has said it would push to ratify the treaty without the United States. But without the support of Japan, a large source of emissions, it would be nearly impossible to reach the threshold for enactment.</p>
