        <p>First there was the epochal battle over Shoreham, in which Suffolk County residents took on their power company and politicians and kept them from opening a $5.5 billion nuclear power plant after it was built.</p>
        <p>Now a new conflict is brewing on the East End of Long Island, where concerned residents are speaking out once again against a plan to generate electricity. This time, though, the focus of their concern is not a nuclear reactor. It is three windmills.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Power Authority wants to build the windmills on a windswept bluff here on the island's easternmost point as part of a $500,000 pilot program to test alternative energy sources. The power generated by the turbines would be used to light the Montauk Lighthouse, the lighthouse museum and a few nearby residences. The concession stand would get solar panels.</p>
        <p>There is a hitch, though. The site the power authority would like to use, the Camp Hero section of Montauk Point State Park, is a former military base that the federal government gave to New York State two decades ago for recreational and parks purposes. A generation of East Enders have fought to preserve the swath of open space, and veterans of that battle say they do not want it marred by three 80-foot-tall towers with whirring blades.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, the power authority chairman, said he was somewhat taken aback by the opposition  the project has engendered. ''If we can't get support for windmills,'' he said, ''what can we get support for?''</p>
        <p>Opponents say they are all for alternative energy sources -- just not at Camp Hero.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of support for windmills,'' said Richard Kahn, a director of Concerned Citizens of Montauk, a group that was formed to preserve open space on Montauk Point. ''But to put it in a state park -- to put any kind of power-generating facility in a state park -- is just not right.''</p>
        <p>A public meeting that was held in the Montauk Fire House tonight to discuss the windmills was filled with strange bedfellows and unlikely opponents.</p>
        <p>The power authority -- created by the state in 1997 to replace the old Long Island Lighting Company, which was done in partly by the Shoreham power plant fiasco -- found itself supported by anti-nuclear groups like Standing for Truth About Radiation. And the meeting  pitted environmentalists who were eager to explore alternatives to fossil fuels as a source of power against environmentalists who wanted to preserve the dramatic bluffs surrounding the Montauk Lighthouse.</p>
        <p>As they made the case for the windmills, power authority officials stressed that they had no plans to install hundreds more in giant wind farms along Montauk.</p>
        <p>They said that the windmills were not believed to pose a threat to birds and that they would not be noisy -- emitting 68 to 70 decibels at the base (a little louder than a conversation) but virtually inaudible 2,100 feet away at the lighthouse, where the sound would be drowned out by the  wind rustling through the trees. And the windmills would require only three 20-foot-by-20-foot bases, leaving the rest of the 415 acres free.</p>
        <p>But those who oppose the windmills at Camp Hero see them in much the same way that Don Quixote saw the windmills of La Mancha -- as monstrous. They worry that the sound will disturb hikers and the towers will ruin the vista from the lighthouse.</p>
        <p>The park is not exactly pristine. Some of the abandoned military buildings left standing there are contaminated with asbestos, and the site is polluted with other chemicals that the Army Corps of Engineers is working to clean up. And it is not as if the views from the lighthouse are totally unspoiled, either: a five-story radar tower, a relic of the cold war, sticks up above the trees at Camp Hero. There is even an organization, the Montauk Radar Preservation Group, fighting to preserve the tower.</p>
        <p>But residents of Montauk have been advocating a park there for years. They successfully fought off plans to sell the tract to developers; then, once it was owned by the state, they helped quash other plans to build a golf course and cabins on it.</p>
        <p>''For 25 years the residents have been fighting to retain the integrity of this parkland,'' said Lisa Grenci, the chairwoman of the Montauk Citizens Advisory Committee. ''We enjoy it, and the rest of the state has the right to enjoy it, as open space. That's what you come to Montauk, to the end of Long Island, for.''</p>
        <p>This week the United States Department of the Interior sent a letter to state parks officials, reminding them that they were given the property on the condition that it be used ''exclusively for public park and recreational purposes in perpetuity.'' (A spokesman for the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Randall Sawyer, said the windmill plan was under review.)</p>
        <p>As the meeting broke up, a committee was formed to explore alternative sites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel, the power authority chairman, warned that Long Island was in danger of running out of electricity. The power authority, he said, will have to build new power plants, run a new cable under the Long Island Sound to carry power from Connecticut, place new emphasis on conservation and use alternative energy sources like solar and wind power. And while the three windmills would not make a huge difference by themselves, he said, the authority has to begin somewhere.</p>
        <p>''The issue is really not whether we do windmills or not,'' he said. ''It is: If we don't do windmills, what are we going to do?''</p>
