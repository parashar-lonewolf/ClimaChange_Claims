        <p>Just a few years ago, before the vast wetlands dried up, the season the locals call The Winds of 120 Days was a period of relative bliss in this remote corner of Iran.</p>
        <p>Instead of today's sweltering summers, the villagers relaxed in the cooling breezes wafting off Lake Hamoun in their quaint mud-brick houses shaped like loaves of bread with tilted chimneys.</p>
        <p>The villagers inhabited a bucolic paradise, growing melons and small, intensely sweet ruby grapes; they fished, wove reed mats and let their cows roam free to lap up water along the lake shore. Children swam in the shallows or went out with their fathers to hunt some of the 100 species of migratory birds.</p>
        <p>No longer. Lake Hamoun, the country's largest body of fresh water and one of the largest in the world, is desert. The worst drought in 30 years is slowly strangling the region, along with much of Iran.</p>
        <p>The winds still blow, of course, but they now bring 120 days of accursed misery. Howling gales -- no longer slowed by the surface of the water -- pick up the fine sand that once sat on the bottom of the lake and hurl it with ferocious intensity across the region. Almost 100 villages are slowly disappearing beneath nascent dunes. The fish are all dead, the livestock dying and the migratory birds no longer stop.</p>
        <p>''Life used to be so pleasant,'' said one villager, Gollbibi Chari, 60, shouting over the wind. Her grandchildren stagger around at her feet, rubbing their bloodshot eyes continuously with small knotted fists in a fruitless attempt to dislodge the sand. ''But there is no life here anymore, only dust and sand.''</p>
        <p>Sistan-Baluchistan Province, home to the lake, remains the worst affected area in Iran, with rainfall this year 78 percent below average. But almost all 28 provinces in Iran are living through the third straight year of drastically low rainfall.</p>
        <p>On average they are getting just half the rain that falls in a normal year, although some areas are oddly getting more, causing freak flash floods and hundreds of deaths.</p>
        <p>A United Nations report on the drought pegs losses for the first six months of this year at $2.6 billion. It said the drought last year forced Iran, with more than 70 million people, to become the world's largest importer of wheat -- seven million tons -- and the situation is still worse this year.</p>
        <p>The drought has exacerbated problems caused by poor water management, climate change and rapid population growth. Drinking water is rationed in more than 30 big cities.</p>
        <p>Tehran, the capital with 10 million people, has been divided into six districts with the water turned off in each for at least 12 hours one day per week. In Isfahan, the ancient capital, the Zayandeh River dried up for the first time in memory.</p>
        <p>Abbas Jazayeri, director of the Natural Disaster Task Force at the Interior Ministry, reels off the estimated agricultural losses from the drought: The production from nearly 12.4 million acres of farmland ruined entirely, as well as additional land devoted to crops and orchards.</p>
        <p>Of 80 million head of livestock, nearly 1 million have died or been deliberately slaughtered because of the lack of forage and water. In addition, temperatures have been unusually high.</p>
        <p>''The past three years have been unprecedented in the history of our country, especially because it happened on such a large scale,'' said Mr. Jazayeri.</p>
        <p>Water experts say that Iran can no longer be cavalier about its water resources, shrugging off the dry years in anticipation that rain will come.</p>
        <p>''From now on we have to be more strict about water usage,'' said Prof. Mohammad Mahdavi, a hydrologist who teaches at Tehran University. ''There is enough water, but not the way we use it.'' Agriculture creates the biggest waste with 70 percent of the water used for irrigation lost through poor pipes and inadequate drainage. One problem is that Iranians just use more water than most people. Average use in Tehran, for example, is 63 gallons per person per day, compared to about 32 gallons in Western Europe, according to United Nations statistics.</p>
        <p>The government, already under fire for hard economic conditions, apparently is anxious to avoid annoying people further by forcing them to use less water. Conservation measures are limited. One public service announcement on television shows a woman veiled in a traditional chador wielding a wrench to arrest a dripping bathroom tap.</p>
        <p>But around Tehran, residents hose down the streets in front of their homes or wash their cars with impunity, and gardeners in the public parks can be seen flooding them at midday.</p>
        <p>''The government tries to tell the population that drought is an exception, that they just need to save water for two or three months and then everything will be O.K.,'' said Hossein Jafari, a program officer with the United Nations Development Fund. ''But the reality is that drought is a rule in Iran.''</p>
        <p>The drought is regional, affecting most of South and Central Asia. And so the disappearance of Lake Hamoun is due partly to Iran's poor relations with Afghanistan, which is also suffering. The Taliban government there controls a major dam on the Hirmand River, whose source of water is most of the water in Lake Hamoun. Although a 30-year-old agreement specifies that some water flow even in dry years, they completely severed the flow.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, fisherman pulled around 12,000 tons of fish from the lake, last year just 400 tons.</p>
        <p>As the water receded, locals say great piles of carp and other fish died, flopping in the mud. Hundreds of thousands of migratory birds -- flamingos and ducks, egrets and pelicans -- staggered around, disoriented by the lack of fish or water and then flew off elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''Life depended on the waters of the lake,'' said Dr. Aboqassem Mukhtari, who represents the area in Parliament. ''Without the lake, people's lives are in danger. Many are considering migrating elsewhere.''</p>
