        <p>While New York City says that it will not have to take drastic measures against car traffic to meet carbon monoxide standards, state and Federal pollution officials predicted yesterday that they would still end up requiring such measures to solve the region's other major air pollution problem, smog.</p>
        <p>The measures being discussed include limiting access to midtown Manhattan by cars with one passenger, leveling special charges on such cars and limiting cars to fewer than five trips to Manhattan a week.</p>
        <p>The city and state faced a Federal deadline this weekend to propose steps to curb carbon monoxide. As the deadline arrived, city officials announced that no steps would be needed because carbon monoxide, a pollutant that hovers in street level hot spots and is most serious in winter, had already fallen to acceptable levels.</p>
        <p>But a bigger problem, and another deadline, lie ahead. A year from now state environmental officials across the metropolitan region plan to decide on measures to curb smog, a pollutant more prevalent in summer and one that tends to spread more widely across local boundaries. Smog Improvement Less</p>
        <p>Smog levels have been improving, too, but not as dramatically. And, although carbon monoxide and smog are "two completely different problems," said Nancy Wittenberg, director of the New Jersey Office of Energy, the solutions for both are much the same.</p>
        <p>New York State says that to meet the smog requirements of the Clean Air Act of 1990, it will eventually have to reduce the number of miles traveled by car. To do so, the state will require either more carpooling or more public transportation.</p>
        <p>The plans, which are likely to be submitted to the Federal Government next November and to take effect over the following few years, will be developed in conjunction with New York City and could include "no drive days," bans on single-occupant cars and extra charges like tolls or taxes on those cars.</p>
        <p>Maura Fitzpatrick, director of policy analysis in the New York City bureau of air policy and programs, part of the Department of Environmental Protection, said that while additional controls were likely, "We're fuzzy about when it will happen and how severe it will have to be." Wide Area Affected</p>
        <p>The transportation measures are likely to extend to Long Island, to Westchester County in New York, Fairfield County in Connecticut, and 12 northern New Jersey counties, according to officials in the three states. The Federal Government defines that area as a single smog region.</p>
        <p>New Jersey and Connecticut also reported a declining number of carbon monoxide violations. But Philip S. Florkoski, supervising environmental analyst in Connecticut's Bureau of Air Management, said that ozone was still a problem.</p>
        <p>All three states reported that ozone violations were decreasing, in part because of changes in fuel and the gradual replacement of old cars with new ones that have better pollution control equipment. Cooler, wetter summers were also cited.</p>
        <p>Carbon monoxide is primarily a cold-weather phenomenon. When cars are started on cold days, carburetors or fuel injectors deliver a fuel-rich mixture to help the engine catch, and some fuel goes through the engine incompletely burned, emerging as carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide. As the car is driven, the catalytic converter warms up and burns off excess carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>Smog, or, more formally, ground-level ozone, is created on sunny summer days by the interaction in bright sunlight of chemicals from gasoline or car engines and nitrogen oxides. Technology Can Help</p>
        <p>Smog can blanket areas hundreds of miles long. Its short-term effects are less dramatic, causing irritation of the lungs and reduced lung function, but millions of people are exposed, and it can cause long-term damage, according to scientists.</p>
        <p>The commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Thomas C. Jorling, said that the news about carbon monoxide, which is part of a report that the state will file with the Federal Government by tomorrow, was encouraging. "It was technically the easiest of the problems to solve," he said.</p>
        <p>He added: "It does show that technological changes in auto emissions and improvement in maintenance of autos can produce real results in performance. If we stay steadfast and apply good principles of science to pollution, we can succeed."</p>
        <p>To combat smog, New York and New Jersey are planning to implement rules that will require some cars to run on electricity and will probably require others to use natural gas or methanol. Connecticut is considering similar measures. Consumers Face Increases</p>
        <p>Under the rules, even regular gasoline-powered cars are to carry extensive new pollution-control equipment, which automobile makers say will cost more than $1,000 extra per vehicle. Meanwhile, under Federal or state requirements, all the gasoline sold in the Northeast will be extensively changed, raising its cost.</p>
        <p>In addition, many drivers in all three states may soon face tougher inspections for air pollution, under rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency last week. Those rules will help limit both smog and carbon monoxide, but air pollution experts said that those rules, which do not take effect until 1994, had not yet contributed to cleaner air.</p>
        <p>Antonia Bryson, New York City's deputy commissioner of environmental protection for air policy and programs, said that for carbon monoxide and ozone control, "we may be looking at a menu of similar measures, but not identical."</p>
        <p>She said, and state and Federal officials agreed, that to fight carbon monoxide required reducing congestion, while reducing smog meant reducing total mileage. Some measures would do both, by reducing traffic on city streets.</p>
