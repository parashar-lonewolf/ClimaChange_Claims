        <p>The breakdown of three electric feeder cables on the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Monday forced Consolidated Edison to take emergency measures to prevent a widespread power failure. It was, on a smaller scale, exactly the same type of failure that started a chain of events leading to the 19-hour blackout in northern Manhattan during a heat wave last July.</p>
        <p>Months of recriminations and investigations followed last year's blackout, and Con Ed said it would spend $315 million to prevent the situation from ever happening again.</p>
        <p>Con Ed officials said yesterday that despite the problems Monday, the system worked as intended, with only eight buildings affected and 76,000 customers inconvenienced.</p>
        <p>''Over all, the system performed very, very well,'' said Bill Donohue, Con Ed's vice president for electrical operations. ''Remember we serve about 3.1 million customers, and we are talking about the fact that we asked eight buildings to reduce the load for a couple of hours.''</p>
        <p>But with the summer heat just beginning to settle in, Monday's incident served as a reminder that power companies in the New York region are confronting two distinct challenges -- routine equipment breakdowns, like failure of transmission lines, and a limited capacity to generate power -- each of which has the potential to pitch large sections of the city and its suburbs into dark misery at little or no warning.</p>
        <p>In either case, the problems stem from a seemingly inexorable rise in energy demand. The record for power use, set before last year's blackout, is expected to be broken again this year. At the same time, electric power producers in New York State have reached their maximum generating capacity, and the first of a new generation of power plants will not open for at least two more years.</p>
        <p>''Another summer and another crisis is what we have,'' said Ashok Gupta, a senior economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ''And this is going to be true for the next two or three summers.'' He and other energy experts suggest a more foreboding situation: the prospect that even with local distribution lines working perfectly, there will not be enough power to meet public demand.</p>
        <p>The problem is not specific to New York. Across the country, with the economy booming and more people taking for granted air-conditioning, computers and gadgets of various shapes and sizes, demand for electricity is swiftly outpacing supply. Experts say only a steady program of power plant construction and energy conservation can ensure smooth operation of millions and millions of television sets, personal computers and cellular phone chargers and, yes, plain old light bulbs.</p>
        <p>The public's insatiable thirst for energy comes at the same time that many states, including New York, are experiencing profound changes in how the sale and distribution of electricity are managed with the nationwide deregulation of public utilities. Con Ed, for example, is getting out of the power generation business to become primarily a distributor.</p>
        <p>As with any deregulation, the result is more competition with a goal of cheaper energy. Lower prices, of course, only further increase demand. Free market fluctuation can also go the other way, as it did with huge price increases in May, caused by a surge in demand because of hot weather and higher prices for fossil fuels used to create electricity.</p>
        <p>Experts say it is hard to predict what, if any, effect the shortage in the New York power supply will have on residential electric bills between now and the opening of new power plants in two to three years. Because of deregulation, prices are expected to be lower during nonpeak months.</p>
        <p>Because of the May increases, which took prices from a normal level of $30 per megawatt-hour to $3,900 per megawatt-hour, the New York State Public Service Commission has proposed a rate cap of $1,000 a megawatt-hour. The cap is opposed by energy producers and distributors as well as by environmentalists who say lower prices just raise demand.</p>
        <p>Regardless of price and even with sufficient generating capacity, as with any mechanical system, breakdowns are inevitable.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut and throughout New England, officials declared a power watch yesterday and urged consumers to reduce their energy use after a minor problem Monday night caused a disruption in energy supplied by the Seabrook nuclear power plant in southern New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>Interruptions of energy supply -- a plant's unexpectedly going off line, for instance, or a main supply line breaking down -- can usually be handled by tapping into energy reserves, which all power grid operators are required to maintain. New England officials declared the power watch to avoid tapping too deeply into their reserves in case further problems arose from yesterday's hot weather.</p>
        <p>In New York, the peak electricity demand this summer is expected to reach 30,200 megawatts, up from about 29,700 megawatts in 1999. With reserves, the state can produce a total capacity of about 35,600 megawatts, said William J. Museler, president of New York Independent System Operator, an organization that operates the state power grid. ''We do believe we have enough capacity to supply the load this summer, but on any given day, when you get up to these levels, it's tight,'' he said. ''The problem is there is not much more in New York, and some of the capacity that we count on in New York comes from other regions.''</p>
        <p>But New York City and Long Island are ''load pockets,'' areas that because of geography can import only a limited amount of electricity. New York City, which is generally required to maintain reserves equal to 18 percent of its daily load, has been operating at about 300 megawatts, or 3 percent, less than that, local energy executives said. Long Island, too, has barely maintained its reserve levels.</p>
        <p>''We are about 300 megawatts short in the New York metropolitan area,'' said Richard Cattle, chief executive of Keyspan, which produces more than 6,000 megawatts in the city and on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Unlike supply problems, distribution problems are much less predictable. Overhead power lines can get knocked down by wind or snow or a car accident. Underground lines can overheat. Local transformers can fail. Careful monitoring of the system can help predict some but in no way all of these problems. And these are the problems most likely to cause summer blackouts.</p>
        <p>Con Ed officials said they were confident that the extra money being spent this year to reinforce the distribution system would prove effective. On the supply side, companies are pushing to build power plants. The first of a new generation of plants, to be built in Greene County, received final approval in May. Companies have proposed more than a dozen other power plants in the state.</p>
        <p>Energy executives, regulators and environmentalists say communication is a major part of the solution: to warn of problems, encourage conservation and efficiency. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that city officials would meet with Con Ed to assure better communication in case of future problems.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 1, 2000, Saturday  An article on Wednesday about problems faced by power companies in the New York region in meeting the summer's high demand for electricity misidentified the chief executive of Keyspan Energy, which supplies power for Long Island and parts of New York City. He is Robert Catell, not Richard Cattle.</p>
