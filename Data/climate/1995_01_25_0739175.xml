        <p>Most of the crops America's farmers raise each year are eaten. But the country's agribusiness is hoping that the small portion that is not consumed can be turned into a new wave of profitable nonfood agricultural products.</p>
        <p>Many of the recent innovations, like corn-based golf tees and biodegradable pens, are relatively inconsequential novelties. But others, like new lubricants, fuel additives, and inks, make up the advanced guard of products that could eventually earn billions of dollars annually for farmers and agribusinesses while benefiting the environment.</p>
        <p>"The 1990's may be witnessing an historic turnaround in the fortunes of plant matter," said David Morris, an economic development specialist at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Minneapolis who has studied the potential for using materials derived from plants instead of fossil fuels like oil and coal.</p>
        <p>No one expects a return to the early days of this century, when scientists like Thomas Edison and George Washington Carver were famous for their research into new industrial uses for crops and industrialists like Henry Ford not only wanted to run cars on soybean oil but also to build steering wheels and other parts from soybean-based plastics.</p>
        <p>World War II and the cheap oil era that followed dramatically highlighted the attractions of fossil fuels, which have a higher energy content by weight and volume, and are easily processed into a variety of wondrously durable plastics and fibers.</p>
        <p>Nor is the rebound going to put any oil companies out of business. Farmers would satisfy only a small fraction of the demand for gasoline, fuel oil, plastics and other petroleum-based products even if every bushel of every crop planted last year went to such uses.</p>
        <p>Even enthusiasts like Mr. Morris concede that the rebound is starting from a very low base: Fewer than 10 million tons annually of plant matter other than wood go into industrial and construction products in the United States, compared with roughly 175 million tons of petroleum and coal and 300 million tons of inorganic minerals like sand, salt and iron ore. About 6 million tons of corn go into fuel and about 450 million tons of plants end up as food or animal feed.</p>
        <p>Still, growing industrial use of crops could slow the nation's increasing dependence on oil and other raw materials imported from politically unstable areas like the Persian Gulf. A Department of Energy study last year concluded that 19 of the 50 most widely used chemicals in the United States could wholly or partly be replaced by biomass feedstocks, as materials from plants and animals are known. Petrochemical companies say that outside of a few niches, raw materials from plants are no match for oil-based products on a cost or performance basis. A crucial part of the equation, they say, is how much industry has invested in existing processes and factories.</p>
        <p>The environmental pitfalls of some petrochemical materials are providing a market opening for some agricultural products that cannot compete simply on a per-pound cost basis with petrochemicals. Construction companies, for example, have begun to use Bio-Form, which is made from the oil in rape (a relative of mustard), to coat the wood beams that keep concrete in place while it hardens. The coating allows the workers to remove the wood after the concrete has set. By using Bio-Form, which is made by the Leahy-Wolf Company of Franklin Park, Ill., instead of cheap but noxious substances like waste motor oil, construction companies do not need to give workers gloves or respirators. Because Bio-Form breaks down into harmless components, the companies also avoid the kind of lawsuits many have run into charging them with contaminating their work site.</p>
        <p>Other developing market niches have bigger potential, not all of which would come at the expense of oil companies. Phenix Biocomposites Inc., a privately held company in Mankato, Minn., is aiming Environ, a blend of soybean flour, shredded newspapers, and mixers, at the building materials market. "Looks like granite, works like wood," is the company's slogan. An independent study commissioned by the United Soybean Board, a Government-appointed trade organization that oversees spending of research and promotion funds raised from farmers, said that the annual market for such hardwood replacements could be $1.8 billion by the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>Phenix's giant neighbor, Cargill Inc. in Minneapolis, is currently leading a new assault on one of the biggest petroleum-based markets of all: plastics. Cargill has been making up to 1,200 pounds an hour of Eco-Pla, a polymer derived from the lactic acid produced by fermenting corn, at a plant it built for $10 million in Savage, Minn. Polylactic acid, as the polymer is known, was discovered in 1833 and has been used in surgical products like sutures and screws because it breaks down harmlessly in the body. But it has cost hundreds of dollars a pound to produce.</p>
        <p>Cargill has figured out how to make polylactic acid for as little as $3 a pound in Savage. It has designed a production line for its plant in Blair, Neb., that should be efficient enough for Cargill to make up to 300 million pounds annually for sale at about $1 a pound.</p>
        <p>"It looks and functions just like a plastic but has the added advantage of degrading completely when disposed of," said Patrick Gruber, a general manager at Cargill. "This could be the first renewable polymer product to break into a classic petrochemical product stream."</p>
        <p>Cargill said various Eco-Pla formulations could be used as paper coatings, fast-food containers and cutlery, disposable diapers and trash bags. Among those on the record as interested is the Packaging Corporation of America, a large manufacturer of packaging material for fast-food companies.</p>
        <p>"We see a lot of interest from our customers in biodegradability," said Gordon Putz, vice president of marketing for the Packaging Corporation. He said the company aimed to have Eco-Pla products by 1997.</p>
        <p>Because plant chemistry was so neglected as oil and other hydrocarbons came to dominate the economy, researchers say the area is now ripe for innovations like Eco-Pla. And that is without even factoring in the new tools of biotechnology, which make it easier for researchers to manipulate plants to produce bigger quantities of valuable substances or variations on naturally occurring compounds.</p>
        <p>But even if the new products eventually begin selling in sizable enough quantities to have a significant impact on the overall demand for major crops, it is by no means clear that farmers will capture many of the benefits. Demand will have to rise faster than their ever-increasing productivity to raise prices. That explains why many farmers are more interested in specialized strains of their crops, like Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.'s new varieties of soybeans that are low in saturated fat, than new end uses. These hybrids could be sold at premium prices to food processors trying to create healthier products.</p>
        <p>But others see new uses as a means for getting better returns. Robert Schemel, who grows corn, soybeans and sugar beets on 3,000 acres in southern Minnesota, is chairman of a new farmers' cooperative that is raising money to build a processing plant to make Environ for Phenix Biocomposites. Once the plant is running, Mr. Schemel said, the farmers who own it will get up to $9 a bushel more for soybeans than the market price, which is currently $5.50 a bushel.</p>
        <p>"We want to get as close to the consumer as possible," said Mr. Schemel, who sees Environ as a way to branch into higher-margin products. "If a farmer does not do more to his crop than just grow it, his long-term viability is limited."  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
