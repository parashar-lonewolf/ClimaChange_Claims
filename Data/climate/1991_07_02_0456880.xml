        <p>The reckless destruction of the Amazon rain forest is surely among the saddest of the world's environmental disasters. Encouraged by past Brazilian governments, cattle ranchers and landless settlers have set fire to huge sections of Rondonia, in western Brazil, fouling the air and laying waste to a precious natural resource.</p>
        <p>To the delight of conservationists everywhere, President Fernando Collor de Mello has now agreed to allow foreigners to help save the forest through so-called "debt for nature" swaps. In simplest terms, Brazil would engage in extensive reclamation projects in exchange for forgiveness of part of its massive overseas debt.</p>
        <p>This is an extraordinary turnaround. Mr. Collor's predecessor, Jose Sarney, made hopeful noises about saving the Amazon but essentially did nothing. And he condemned debt-for-nature swaps as foreign interference.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Collor's scheme, foreign governments or environmental groups could purchase each year $100 million in Brazilian debt at a bargain price, say $30 million, from international banks eager to accept 30 cents on the dollar for loans they may never collect anyway. The $30 million would then be forgiven in exchange for Brazil's pledge to spend the original face amount, $100 million, in local currency on conservation projects.</p>
        <p>The plan comes not a moment too soon. Last year, more than six million acres of rain forest disappeared. At risk is not only a priceless biological nursery. The fires also account for an estimated 7 percent of the world's annual production of carbon dioxide, the main cause of the feared greenhouse warming of the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collor is the first Brazilian president to conclude that the battle to save the Amazon is not a challenge to Brazil's sovereignty but a joint struggle to enrich the planet. For that, he deserves the applause of nations everywhere -- and their help.</p>
