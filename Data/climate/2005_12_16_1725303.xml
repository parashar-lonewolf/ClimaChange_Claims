        <p>High Turnout for Iraq Vote In Day of Surprising Calm  In a day remarkable for its calm, millions of Iraqis cast ballots across their war-torn country to elect a parliament to a four-year term, with Sunni Arabs turning out in what appeared to be heavy numbers and guerrillas staging relatively few attacks.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The high turnout of Sunni Arabs suggests their seeming willingness to distance themselves from the insurgency and a yearning to find a place for themselves in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Thousands of residents of Ramadi, a defiant Sunni Arab town and insurgent stronghold, poured into polling stations and cast votes in high numbers, a contrast to the almost nonexistent turnout there during the election in January.</p>
        <p>A26</p>
        <p>Reconstruction Scandal Grows  An Army lieutenant colonel who received the bronze star for her service in Iraq was arrested and charged with taking bribes in a growing corruption scandal that has rocked the Iraq reconstruction program.</p>
        <p>A28</p>
        <p>Spying Limits Lifted After 9/11  Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants usually required for domestic spying, according to government officials.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>U.N. Extends Hariri Inquiry  The Security Council voted unanimously to extend by six months the United Nations investigation of the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, and it cited Syria for not providing the inquiry ''full and unconditional cooperation.''</p>
        <p>A25</p>
        <p>Abbas Threatens to Resign  The divisions within the main Palestinian faction, Fatah, broke into the open, as the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, threatened to resign unless a rival slate of younger Fatah members for the Jan. 25 legislative elections was withdrawn, Palestinian officials said.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Ancient Battlefield Discovered  In the ruins of an ancient city in northeastern Syria, archaeologists have uncovered what they say is substantial evidence of a fierce battle fought in about 3500 B.C., and what they believe could be the oldest known excavated site of large-scale organized warfare.</p>
        <p>A28</p>
        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Complaints Over SAT's Length  College counselors at about 200 high schools nationwide, and a few college admissions officers, have joined to ask the College Board to give students the option of taking the three parts of the SAT separately, instead of requiring that they take the whole test in one sitting.</p>

        <p>President Backs McCain On Treatment of Prisoners  Under intense bipartisan Congressional pressure, President Bush reversed course and reluctantly backed Senator John McCain's call for a law banning cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of prisoners in American custody.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Bush Doubles Flood Protection  The Bush administration agreed to double the amount it would spend on flood protection for New Orleans, promising a system it said would make the city safe from catastrophic flooding caused by a storm as powerful as Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>U.S. Literacy Declines  The average American college graduate's literacy in English declined over the past decade, according to results of a nationwide test.</p>
        <p>A34</p>
        <p>Pentagon Mishandled Data  Pentagon analysts appear not to have followed guidelines that require deleting information on American citizens and groups from a counterterrorism database within three months if they pose no security threats, officials said.</p>
        <p>A36</p>
        <p>S.B.A. Official Defends Agency  Hector V. Barreto, the head of the Small Business Administration, on Capital Hill defended his agency's response to the Gulf Coast hurricanes, saying it had responded ''quicker to this event than any in our history.''</p>

        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>New Questions on Cloning Study  The South Korean scientist whose claims of a stunning series of advances in cloning and stem cell research have come under suspicion defended his work on Friday, saying he had proof of his success. The scientist, Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, made his statements during a televised news conference at Seoul National University a day after a colleague and co-author of a scientific journal article said Dr. Suk had admitted that critical parts of one discovery were fabricated.</p>

        <p>2 States Drop Out of Pact To Combat Global Warming  Officials in New York, New Jersey and several other Northeastern states scrambled to hold together what was left of a landmark regional pact to control power plant emissions after the governors of Massachusetts and Rhode Island abruptly refused to sign on.</p>
        <p>B3</p>
        <p>Child Welfare Goals Unmet  New Jersey's child welfare system is failing to provide medical checkups to about 80 percent of children entering foster care, just 18 months after the state made such checkups a cornerstone of its court-ordered overhaul. The state blames staff shortages, a delay in financing, and poor communication between caseworkers and foster parents.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Mayor Returns Donations  Mayor Bloomberg spent nearly $80 million of his own money to win re-election, but at least six people thought he needed their financial help, too.
