        <p>LEAD: RETROSPECT often makes the most recent moments seem the most vivid. That is usually a trick that our minds play upon us, but surely not in the 1980's.

        <p>RETROSPECT often makes the most recent moments seem the most vivid. That is usually a trick that our minds play upon us, but surely not in the 1980's. The pictures of Berliners dancing upon, pouring through, chipping hunks out of their hated wall, symbolizing the end of 45 years of cold war, seem incredible now, and surely they and what they epitomize will still seem extraordinary in the next century.</p>
        <p>For they mark the climax of a decade and the end of the world order that had its origins in the ashes of World War II. To two generations and more, ''normal'' seemed to mean East vs. West, as for tens or hundreds of years in the past it meant Germany vs. France or Christians vs. Muslims. Suddenly, as a hurricane of change blew across Eastern Europe this fall, through Prague and Sofia and East Berlin and Budapest and at last Bucharest, through the lives of millions whom Marxism had ruled but never wholly subjugated, the wall and the cold warriors who built it seemed as out of date as the forts of Malta, beneath which the last summit conference of the 1980's took place, and the Crusaders who manned them.</p>
        <p>Who would have predicted it, 3,600 days ago, at the dawn of the decade, with Jimmy Carter preparing his campaign for a second term in a country that was down on itself after defeat in Vietnam and humiliation in Iran? With Leonid I. Brezhnev clinging grimly to life and power in a Soviet Union whose vulnerabilities had been detected by only a few keen experts in the West, and in a Communist bloc that seemed totally under his thumb?</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan, fated to be one of the two leading players of the 1980's, was to step into the spotlight in that first year of the decade and to stay there for nine years. In the end, though, he was upstaged by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who began the decade as an obscure apparatchik in Stavropol but ended it as the man of the decade, the father of glasnost and perestroika.</p>
        <p>Which is not to denigrate the role of the brave men and women who fought, without guns or tanks or hand grenades, for human rights and human liberties - celebrated people like Lech Walesa and the late Andrei D. Sakharov, as well as anonymous ones like the students of Prague, the Lutherans of Leipzig and the marchers of Timisoara and Bucharest.</p>
        <p>But as Dr. Sakharov himself wrote not too long before his death, it was Mr. Gorbachev, for all his failings, who made the decisions ''that completely changed the situation in the Soviet Union and the psychology of its people.''</p>
        <p>Without Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, the cold war would have ended in the 1990's or the 2010's or sometime, but assuredly not in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Some would argue that the United States and its allies ''won'' the cold war by applying relentless military pressure, giving Mr. Reagan's vaunted arms buildup much of the credit, and it is no doubt true that without vigilance during the era of Soviet hostility things would have been different.</p>
        <p>But it was the utter failure of the Marxist economies that set the stage for Mr. Gorbachev's reforms and signaled the demise of traditional Communism, and if heavy military spending contributed to that failure, it also helped make the United States a debtor nation.</p>
        <p>Much was made of Mr. Reagan's military muscle-flexing, including the invasion of Grenada, the bombing of Libya and the war by proxy in Nicaragua, but the egregious Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi remains in power, and things haven't changed all that much in Central America.</p>
        <p>Indeed, President Bush had to invade Panama in the decade's waning days to achieve a Reagan goal, the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan did manage to reduce the frequency of terrorist attacks, though a Pan American jet was blown up only last Christmas. Through the judicious application of American power, he helped install a fragile democratic government in Manila.</p>
        <p>For a time, the tide of freedom seemed to be running in China as well, where the introduction of limited capitalism temporarily carried in its wake limited democracy. But that link was broken with the massacres in Tiananmen Square, which, like so many of the seminal events of the decade - the destruction of the spacecraft Challenger also leaps to mind - were engraved on the public eye by the modern magic of global television.</p>
        <p>But Ronald Reagan was a domestic President, more than anything else, his two terms marked by a giddy celebration of free enterprise and its bounty, of American pride and patriotism, and of family values.</p>
        <p>At its best, the Reagan Presidency provided a tonic of self-confidence that helped to restore vigor to the national economy and psyche; at its worst, it fostered greed, chauvinism and intolerance.</p>
        <p>Its monuments were an economic boom of unprecedented length, the uprooting of much bureaucratic underbrush and a vastly heightened sense of national unity; its failures the scandals and then the crash in Wall Street, the intractable budget deficit and the resultant starvation of programs to aid the homeless and the drug-ridden.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan planted the Republican standard on the hilltop and kept it there throughout the decade. If he fell short of his goal to make his party the new majority, he redefined, for the moment at least, the parameters of American politics, forcing even the opposition to address his agenda (viz. the hapless Michael S. Dukakis driving a tank to earn his macho credentials).</p>
        <p>Yet by decade's end, Mr. Reagan, out of office less than a year and still one of the most popular figures in postwar American history, seemed curiously passe.</p>
        <p>The ''evil empire'' had vanished, Ivan Boesky and Leona Helmsley, the paramount symbols of greed, were paying the price, nobody talked about the yuppies much any more, and the serious problems seemed more serious than ever to many people. The 1980's were the decade of AIDS and of the homeless, of ever-mounting threats to the environment and ever-widening concern about the quality of American education, and of fresh doubts about the very viability of the American political system.</p>
        <p>Whether because they saw little need for the Government to act or because they questioned the ability of the politicians to make a difference, fewer people than ever bothered to vote. Fewer officeholders than ever seemed to excite wide admiration, and it was an age of scandal, of what some saw as an absurd preoccupation with personal behavior: Jim Wright, Douglas Ginsburg, Gary Hart. Neither the budgetary system nor the legislative process seemed to function very well any more, and electoral campaigns, more and more trivial, more and more dominated by the political consultants instead of the candidates, did little to set alternative policies or programs before the electorate.</p>
        <p>The doubts extended to America's role as a world economic power. The 1980's were the decade when the astounding rise of Japan (and of smaller Pacific nations like Taiwan and South Korea) began to cause real angst in the United States. The omnipresence of Japanese cars and television sets, the purchase by the Japanese of iconographic American assets like Columbia Pictures and Rockefeller Center, and the new dominance of Japanese banks, set American teeth on edge, giving new life to the old idea of tariff barriers.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, many in the United States foresaw similarly tough competition coming from Europe, where greater economic and perhaps political integration, scheduled for 1992, would threaten American business from the other flank unless it could become more efficient and more innovative.</p>
        <p>For some seers, such as the historian Paul Kennedy, the great paradox is this: at the very moment when the United States, as the leader of the West's protracted crusade for capitalism and democracy, should be savoring victory, it may well be an empire doomed to a long, slow economic decline.</p>
        <p>And yet, and yet . . . If the 1980's proved anything, they proved once again the power of ideas, and the ideas that have triumphed have been those of the great American experiment. Even in the third world, with its seemingly limitless suffering, where Marxism was for so long the intellectual fashion, the free-market alternative has been embraced by some with eagerness and by others with reluctance. A few African nations are headed up that path, as is Argentina, led by a Peronist.</p>
        <p>The Middle East remains locked in its dismal strife, China bedevils George Bush and remains an enigma, the whole world worries about pollution and the greenhouse effect and the fate of the rain forests, to say nothing about feeding a population that passed five billion in the decade that ends in just a week. There is no dearth of problems, and many of them face Eastern Europe, the arena of the great victory of the 1980's, as it copes with the 1990's.</p>
        <p>But who can begrudge the old decade its last Christmas present and most vivid symbol: the wall breached at the Brandenburg Gate in the heart of Berlin, nearly 50 years after the end of World War II, 200 years after the first of Europe's great revolutions swept France.</p>
