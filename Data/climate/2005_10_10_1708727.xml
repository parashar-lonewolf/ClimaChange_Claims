        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anybody reading Gov. Brian Schweitzer's article might conclude that synfuels from coal are the answer to global warming. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
        <p>Burning synthetic gasoline made from coal releases as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as burning the real thing.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the process for making synfuel or hydrogen from coal produces carbon dioxide, which is vented into the atmosphere. Nobody has yet figured a safe place to put it where it will stay put for long enough.</p>
        <p>The big investment in coal infrastructure is locking us into an energy policy that will be an environmental catastrophe, both locally and globally.</p>
        <p>Raymond T. Pierrehumbert  Chicago, Oct. 3, 2005</p>
        <p>The writer, a geophysical sciences professor at the University of Chicago, was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report.</p>
