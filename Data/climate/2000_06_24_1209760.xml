        <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a new air-pollution program meant to drastically reduce smog that flows from the Middle West to the East.</p>
        <p>Although still subject to further appeals, the ruling on Thursday by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would affect 19 states. It upholds a decision by a three-judge panel of the same tribunal, which held in March that rules set down by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1998, but stayed by a lawsuit, were proper.</p>
        <p>''This decision is a major environmental victory for everyone living throughout the Eastern United States,'' Carol M. Browner, the E.P.A. administrator, said today.</p>
        <p>Federal officials have said the new rules could remove 1.1 million tons of nitrogen oxide -- equivalent to the pollution from 166 million cars -- from the air each year. They estimate that the endeavor will cost $1.7 billion annually over 15 years but will make up for it in lower medical costs and better public health.</p>
        <p>Two environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Clean Air Trust, expressed elation. ''This decision will help clear up the smog that has been searing the lungs of people across the Eastern United States,'' said David Hawkins, a lawyer for the natural resources group.</p>
        <p>It was not certain how quickly the new rules, supposed to be in place by 2003, would actually go into effect. Michigan and West Virginia, whose officials contend that their states have been treated unfairly, and other parties that have sued the E.P.A. may seek an appeal before the Supreme Court. Or lawmakers from those states and others could fight the E.P.A. in Congress.</p>
        <p>Coal-burning power plants are the target of the regulatory action because the smog-causing chemical the E.P.A. is going after, nitrogen oxide, is a byproduct of burning fossil fuels. Federal officials say more than 100 million people live in regions where the air would be improved, especially in the summer.</p>
        <p>New York, New Jersey and Connecticut and other states in the East are also covered by the regulations, but the issue has developed as one that pits those states and others against states farther west. More than half the reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions would come in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p>
        <p>Officials in New York State have viewed the new regulations favorably, and E.P.A. officials said this afternoon that the state had already submitted plans for reducing its smog.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has also moved to upgrade its coal plants, the E.P.A. said. Robert C. Schinn Jr., commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, called the appeals court action ''an enormous boost'' for the environment.</p>
        <p>Connecticut officials, too, lauded the court decision. The state's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said today that the case was ''a poor candidate'' for Supreme Court review. ''There's no conflict among the federal courts,'' he said. ''It's plainly correct on the merits and it requires no drastic change in national policy.''</p>
        <p>Federal officials estimate that the new rules would cost a typical household $1 a month in extra electricity charges that the utilities would pass on to their customers to cover costs of upgrading equipment.</p>
        <p>The Midwest Ozone Group, a coalition of utilities and other businesses that have contested the regulations, expressed disappointment through its lawyer Kathy G. Beckett, who said group members had been trying to cut down on pollution. She said the coalition would consider an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Environmental officials in Michigan and West Virginia said that their states had been trying hard to cut down on their pollution, and that they, too, would consider further appeals. They questioned, too, whether their states really polluted New England skies as much as some people suspected.</p>
        <p>''We do need to reduce our emissions, and I know we create some problems for Pittsburgh,'' said Skipp Kropp, an environmental official in West Virginia. ''But New Hampshire?''</p>
        <p>The 19 states have 128 days from the appeals court ruling, or roughly to the end of October, to tell the E.P.A. how they expect to comply. Assuming the new rules go into effect, states that fall short could face sanctions, including the loss of highway construction money.</p>
        <p>Other states covered are Alabama, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Three others, Georgia, Missouri and Wisconsin, were included in the E.P.A.'s original order, but the appeals court removed them pending further review.</p>
