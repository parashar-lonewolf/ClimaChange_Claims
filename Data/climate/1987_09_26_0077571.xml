        <p>The Government researcher who directed the production of a controversial report on acid rain has resigned for what he said were personal reasons.</p>
        <p>The official, Laurence Kulp, said he would step down Oct. 3 from his post as research director of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, the interagency group that has spent more than $300 million since 1980 in an effort to learn more about acid rain.</p>
        <p>The program's interim report, issued Sept. 17, concluded there was no evidence that a significant number of Northeastern lakes would get much more acidic under current levels of acid rain, but lakes in the Southeast could continue to worsen.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists assert that acid rain is acidifying lakes in the Northeast to the point that fish are killed. Several groups attacked the interim report summary as a distortion of the scientific reports on which it was based.</p>
