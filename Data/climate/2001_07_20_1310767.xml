        <p>President Bush basked today in the least problematic of his administration's foreign relationships, visiting the bunker where Churchill weathered World War II, lunching with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and spending the night here at Chequers, the official country retreat, as a guest of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who did everything he could to minimize his differences with Washington.</p>

        <p>President Bush basked today in the least problematic of his administration's foreign relationships, visiting the bunker where Churchill weathered World War II, lunching with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and spending the night here at Chequers, the official country retreat, as a guest of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who did everything he could to minimize his differences with Washington.</p>
        <p>The visit here came just hours before Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair were scheduled to fly to the annual summit meeting of industrialized nations, in Genoa, Italy, where both men said they expected to be surrounded by demonstrators protesting free trade and Mr. Bush's position on global warming.</p>
        <p>Today's show of British-American friendship was apparently intended to demonstrate that Mr. Bush was tending to the United States' strongest alliance, even as his relations with Europe and China have been under considerable strain. Today he and Mr. Blair invoked the ''special relationship'' between Washington and London at every turn. And Mr. Blair went as far as he could to sound positive about Mr. Bush's missile defense plans without actually endorsing them, declaring that any new nuclear strategy ''has got to encompass defensive systems and offensive systems.''</p>
        <p>Both men know that Mr. Blair's endorsement will eventually become crucial for President Bush's plans for a comprehensive missile defense system, because American radar sites here would play an integral role in detecting missile launchings near Europe.</p>
        <p>Without naming names, Mr. Bush noted today that ''there are some leaders who just out of hand reject any willingness to think differently about security.'' Then he said Mr. Blair ''is not that way.''</p>
        <p>''He's had great questions,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He's been more than willing to listen to the philosophy of moving beyond a treaty that has codified a relationship that no longer exists'' between the United States and the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Tonight's visit to Chequers was intended to cement the budding relationship between the two leaders. Mr. Blair's wife, Cherie, told American reporters over tea at 10 Downing Street this morning that three of her four children would be there -- Mr. Bush was seen lifting one of them into the air -- along with Laura Bush and Barbara, one of the president's twin daughters.</p>
        <p>Together, they wandered the gardens around the Tudor mansion, which looks like it could easily serve as the setting for a novel by the BrontÃ« sisters. But that was the last stop of a busy day of sightseeing for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>This morning he began his day at the British Museum, where the circular, domed reading room has been recently restored. After Mrs. Bush read ''The Legend of the Bluebonnet'' to a group of children, Mr. Bush urged them to read rather than watch television. He also reviewed the list of notables who have held ''tickets'' to read in the room.</p>
        <p>''Karl Marx and Lenin, Mark Twain, George W. Bush,'' he said, laughing. ''From one end of the spectrum to the other.''</p>
        <p>From there he moved to the underground Cabinet War Rooms, where Churchill and his aides operated during the Blitz. Mr. Bush has often expressed admiration for the wartime leader and recently installed a bust of the former prime minister, on loan from the British government, in the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>''I loved Churchill's stance on principle,'' he said. ''Sometimes in this world, it is important to have a world leader stand up on principle and defend policy based upon principle, not trying to figure out politics.'' Then it was off to see the Queen and Prince Philip, with an entourage of his senior advisers, for a lunch out of earshot and, in the words of one participant, ''utterly apolitical.''</p>
