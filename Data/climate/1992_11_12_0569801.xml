        <p>During the first six months of this year, at least three separate mistakes were made in the operating rooms of a New York City hospital, and three patients died.</p>
        <p>A student required surgery for a skin abscess, but when an oxygen alarm rang during the procedure it was dismissed as a malfunction. A healthy man was admitted for routine foot surgery, but a doctor did not wait for a broken monitoring device to be fixed. A woman needed a biopsy of a lung tumor, but the anesthesiologist did not take proper precautions against a rare complication of the anesthesia.</p>
        <p>Such mistakes do not happen often. The state Health Department investigated 36 cases of anesthesia-related deaths through mid-October, out of the more than one million times that anesthesia was administered. And state officials stress they have no evidence that mistakes happen more often at this hospital, Roosevelt, than at other city hospitals, although they are conducting an investigation to make sure the cases do not represent a pattern. The Manhattan District Attorney's office said it is also investigating one of the cases.</p>
        <p>But mistakes do happen, and when they do, how are they handled?</p>
        <p>An examination of these three cases finds there are no rules. The family of one patient was immediately told that an error had preceded that patient's death, the second family learned the details through a state investigation, and a third was never told. A Major Challenge</p>
        <p>Similarly, the nurse and two doctors who made the mistakes met very different fates. One doctor retreated to her office, then took a leave of absence and has not worked for four months. The nurse was asked to change shifts and take courses in anesthesia safety. The other doctor was not disciplined; his error was not reported to the state and was only discovered during an investigation of another case.</p>
        <p>The incidents point up a major challenge of medicine: keeping staff members on their toes so that mistakes do not happen. To a patient, a hospital is a nerve-racking place. But to those who work there it is familiar and routine, and human beings can become lax when they get too comfortable.</p>
        <p>That is what happened at Roosevelt Hospital, at 59th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, on at least three occasions this year between January and June, according to New York State Department of Health reports, internal hospital memos and interviews with doctors and administrators.</p>
        <p>For their part, hospital officials have admitted responsibility in only one case. In another instance, they argue that the cause of death was a mystery. In the third instance, they said that the patient involved was extremely ill and would have died anyway.</p>
        <p>Officials in the state Health Department have another judgment. They found that errors by the anesthesia team had caused two of the three deaths, and a third investigation is under way.</p>
        <p>Regardless of which version is correct, the stories of three Roosevelt patients illustrate that mistakes do happen and, indeed, can happen anywhere. Joseph Brinson  An Alarm Sounds But Is Not Heeded</p>
        <p>The death of 35-year-old Joseph Brinson is one that Dr. Daniel M. Thys, director of anesthesiology for St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, says could have been prevented.</p>
        <p>In early January, Mr. Brinson, a communications student at City College, developed an abscess between his buttocks. The pain became so severe that he went to the emergency room of Roosevelt Hospital on Jan. 15, and, later that afternoon, was scheduled for surgery.</p>
        <p>Before the operation he called his closest friend, Richard Battle.</p>
        <p>"He said I shouldn't worry," Mr. Battle said. "It was no big deal."</p>
        <p>Mr. Brinson lay on his abdomen during the operation. He was given sedatives to make him calm and sleepy, and a spinal injection to deaden the nerve endings. The anesthesiologist then left the room -- common procedure when local anesthesia is being used, said Dr. Thys (pronouced tease). A nurse anesthetist, Rosalind Sargeant, remained. Glitches in the System</p>
        <p>Part way into the operation, the alarm sounded on the oximeter, a small device clipped over one of Mr. Brinson's fingertips that measures the amount of oxygen in his blood. The devices are extremely sensitive and alarms can sound for no reason. According to the Health Department report, the alarm was not heeded and, when the anesthesiologist returned to the operating room, Mr. Brinson's pulse had slowed dramatically.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sargeant refused to be interviewed for this article, and Dr. Thys gave a somewhat different version of what happened. Ms. Sargeant had been an anesthesia nurse for eight years, he said, and was used to glitches in the system. When the alarm sounded, he said, Ms. Sargeant did not alert the surgeon, but rather moved the oximeter to another finger. The alarm stopped briefly, then sounded again. She jiggled the wire. She tried a third finger.</p>
        <p>Then she checked the patient, whose heart was beating slowly and who was beginning to show signs of oxygen deprivation. At that point the anesthesiologist returned, Dr. Thys said, and Mr. Brinson was turned onto his back and a breathing tube was inserted in his throat.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Battle arrived at the hospital, flowers in hand, to see his friend, he was told by a teary surgeon that his friend was in a coma because of an error in the operating room. 'Machines Cry Wolf'</p>
        <p>Oversedation, Dr. Thys said in an interview, was the probable reason Mr. Brinson stopped breathing. It is a potential risk of anesthesia, he said, which is why the oximeter is used.</p>
        <p>In this age of advanced medical technology, there are countless machines at a critically ill patient's bedside, and each has an alarm. "The machines cry wolf so often," said one surgeon who was not involved in any of the three cases. "You assume it's nothing unless proven otherwise."</p>
        <p>Another doctor, who spent much of his career in intensive care units, remembers reviewing a pamphlet telling families of I.C.U. patients not to worry if an alarm rang.</p>
        <p>"That's human nature, but it's wrong in a hospital," he said. "When an alarm goes off, we should be alarmed." Her Single Mistake</p>
        <p>Mr. Brinson never regained consciousness. His family sat by his bed for months, as his body curled ever tighter into a fetal position. He died on Aug. 2. His family is suing the hospital.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sargeant was moved to the day shift for several weeks, Dr. Thys said, "where she could be observed more closely," and she was required to take extra classes in anesthesia safety. No action was taken against the anesthesiologist, and the state investigation did not cite him for wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Battle said he and Mr. Brinson's family were angered that the nurse whom they hold responsible for a patient's death still had her job. But Dr. Thys defended her, saying she was a valued employee with a previously unblemished record who had made "an extremely unfortunate mistake."</p>
        <p>"Do you fire someone for a single mistake?" he said. Rick Sklar  A Monitor Stays Out of Service</p>
        <p>In the case of 62-year-old Rick Sklar, a former disk jockey and radio executive, the hospital concluded that blame was less clear cut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sklar, an avid runner, tried to ignore the nagging pain of an injured ankle for three years, but this summer he finally decided to have surgery to switch the tendons from one muscle to another.</p>
        <p>His was the second operation scheduled in Operating Room 2 of Roosevelt Hospital on June 22. Mr. Sklar sat in the waiting area while the first operation was under way. What Mr. Sklar could not know was that a piece of monitoring equipment -- a capnometer -- was not working during that operation. A capnometer measures the amount of carbon dioxide in exhaled air, thereby insuring that the tubes bringing oxygen and anesthesia to the patient are properly placed. It is possible to administer anesthesia without a capnometer, but in the event of a miscalculation the results can be extremely serious.</p>
        <p>General anesthesia, in which a patient is "put to sleep," is riskier than local anesthesia, in which sensation is deadened in a specific portion of the body. There are two types of general anesthesia: in shorter operations, anesthetic gas is given through a mask; in more complex operations, the patient is paralyzed with drugs and is placed on a machine that breathes for him. New York State requires the use of a capnometer for the latter procedure. Operation Never Begins</p>
        <p>The anesthesiologist in Operating Room 2, Dr. Livia Helmer, appeared to know the capnometer was out of order. On the anesthesia record kept during the operation, which is signed by Dr. Helmer, there is a box labeled "Anesthesia Machine Check" which is supposed to be filled with a check mark to show that the machinery was tested and found to be working. The box is empty, and there is a question mark where capnometer readings should be.</p>
        <p>Dr. Helmer declined to comment on the case.</p>
        <p>The first operation ended without incident, and Mr. Sklar went in about 10:40 A.M. Before Dr. Helmer administered anesthesia to him, she called the office that repairs hospital equipment to report the broken capnometer, Dr. Thys said. A technician arrived and began to replace it but the machine remained out of service.</p>
        <p>The operation never actually began. Before any incisions were made, an alarm rang indicating Mr. Sklar was not getting enough oxygen. Dr. Helmer responded by pumping pure oxygen through Mr. Sklar's breathing tube. That increased the numbers indicating the percentage of oxygen, but only briefly. Mr. Sklar was suffocating. Call for Assistance</p>
        <p>At that point, said Phyllis Goodman, a spokeswoman for the hospital, Dr. Helmer "called in a second anesthesiologist for assistance." That doctor, Dr. Thys said, suggested that the breathing tube be removed and reinserted to make sure it was in the right place.</p>
        <p>Moments later, Mr. Sklar's heart stopped beating and he stopped breathing. He was pronounced dead at 11:40 A.M.</p>
        <p>The surgeon broke the news to Mr. Sklar's stunned family. According to Philip Pierce, a lawyer for the family, the surgeon did not mention that the capnometer was broken during the operation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pierce said the family plans to file suit against the hospital, and added that he has been contacted by the office of the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau. A spokesman for Mr. Morgenthau confirmed that the office is investigating the case, but would not comment on whether the other two cases were under investigation.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Sklar died, Dr. Thys said, Dr. Helmer took the chart into her office. She wrote a two-page addendum, giving her account of what happened. She also appears to have made two inserts into the record. An "X" was placed in the box labeled "Anesthesia Machine Checked," -- the same box that was empty on the record from the preceding operation. In addition, a number was entered on the line reserved for capnometer readings. Chart Filled Out Later</p>
        <p>Dr. Thys confirmed that Dr. Helmer filled out much of the chart after Mr. Sklar was already dead. That is standard procedure in an emergency when there are more urgent things to do, he said. Dr. Helmer entered the erroneous capnometer reading, he said, not out of duplicity, but confusion.</p>
        <p>"She was shaken," he said. The broken capnometer was flashing during the operation, he said, "and she just entered one of the numbers" that she remembered seeing flash across the screen.</p>
        <p>While all this was taking place, the risk-management machinery of Roosevelt Hospital shifted into gear, as it had in the case of Mr. Brinson. Every hospital has such an office, which is informed of all mishaps and is required to follow state reporting laws.</p>
        <p>The result of its investigation was a five-page report, submitted to the Health Department on Aug. 7. It admitted that state regulations for carbon-dioxide measurement had not been met. However, the report said, the absence of the equipment had not necessarily led to Mr. Sklar's death.</p>
        <p>"The exact cause of death could not be determined," the report said, "but several possibilities were considered."</p>
        <p>A list of five alternative theories followed. The first was "esophageal intubation," meaning the breathing tube, which was supposed to be placed in the windpipe, which leads to the lungs, was instead placed in the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. The others were: an allergic reaction to the anesthesia; an extremely rare condition in which the body's temperature rises suddenly and sharply; a rare blood condition induced by anesthesia; a freak reaction to Vitamin C, which he was taking to try to ward off a cold.</p>
        <p>The Health Department received the report, conducted its own interviews, and settled on the first theory.</p>
        <p>But hospital officials disagree. Dr. Thys said that if the tube was incorrectly placed from the beginning, Mr. Sklar's oxygen levels should have begun to drop much earlier than they did. He did concede, however, that because Mr. Sklar was in superb physical shape, his body may have been able to use oxygen more efficiently, meaning it would take longer in his case for the alarm to sound.</p>
        <p>In addition, Dr. Thys said, if the tube was incorrectly placed, Mr. Sklar's stomach would be "extremely distended" from the gases being pumped into it. In addition, the esophagus would be bruised or cut by the tube. Mr. Sklar's autopsy, he said, found "only minor" stomach distension, and no evidence of harm to the esophagus.</p>
        <p>Officially, the hospital still considers the cause of Mr. Sklar's death a mystery. Dr. Helmer has taken a voluntary leave of absence and has not been to work since early July. Before she could return, Ms. Goodman said, she must take 20 hours of continuing medical education courses in anesthesia safety. Janet Robins  A Failure to Take Every Precaution</p>
        <p>Of all three cases, the death of 60-year-old Janet Robins is the one for which Roosevelt takes the least responsibility.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Robins had cancer that had spread to her liver, breast and lung. By the time she was taken to the operating room for a lung biopsy last January, she weighed only 80 pounds.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Robins's doctors knew that she had a rare tumor, known as a carcinoid, which can cause blood pressure to plummet suddenly and unexpectedly. It is an extremely unusual complication, according to Dr. Rena V. Sellin, an endocrinologist at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who says the center sees about two such cases a year.</p>
        <p>The condition poses a particular risk if a patient undergoes general anesthesia, Dr. Sellin said, but in recent years a drug has been developed to make the drop in blood pressure less likely. When a patient with the syndrome faces surgery, she said, the drug is given in advance and the surgery and anesthesiology staffs are alerted to potential complications. 'Standard of Care Not Met'</p>
        <p>In Mrs. Robins's case, Dr. Thys said, those precautions were not taken. After the woman was sedated and the breathing tube was inserted, her heart rate suddenly slowed, then quickened, then stopped. Attempts to resuscitate her were futile and she died in the operating room.</p>
        <p>The hospital's internal report of the incident found "the standard of care not met" in this case. Those deceptively mild words are among the strongest used in the medical community for questionable treatment of a patient. Specifically, the report said, the likelihood of complications from the carcinoid tumor was not properly evaluated, and during the operation the patient was not treated with medication that might have reversed the effects.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thys agreed that a mistake had been made. "If a lesson is to be learned out of this," he said, "it's that if another carcinoid patient ever has to come to the operating room, we will take every precaution."</p>
        <p>Even so, the anesthesiologist in the case, Dr. Eric Kincaid, was not disciplined or required to take continuing medical education courses. In addition, the incident was never reported to the Health Department. State law requires the reporting of any unexpected deaths, or deaths that may have resulted from hospital or doctor error. 'Death Was Not Unexpected'</p>
        <p>Dr. Thys said this incident is different from the other two, because, although an error occurred, the patient's health was extremely poor and the error could therefore not be blamed for her death. "We felt the death was not unexpected given the course of her illness," he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kincaid declined to be interviewed for this article. The Department of Health disagreed with the hospital's evaluation of the seriousness of the case. Alerted to the incident while investigating the death of Mr. Sklar, the department has cited Roosevelt for failing to report Mrs. Robins's death. Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the department, said a full review of the case is under way.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Thys, Mrs. Robins's family was not told of the findings of the hospital's investigation. Nor, to his knowledge, were they told everything that happened in the operating room. Attempts by a reporter to locate her family were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>When her relatives were told she had died during the procedure, they were "relieved," Dr. Thys said, because she was "out of her pain."</p>
