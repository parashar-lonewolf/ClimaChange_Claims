        <p>LEAD: FOR generations, dairy has been synonomous with ''pure,'' beef with ''strong.'' And cattle have ranged over the soul of America, a symbol of wide-open spaces, broncobuster spirit and the bucolic life on the family farm.</p>
        <p>FOR generations, dairy has been synonomous with ''pure,'' beef with ''strong.'' And cattle have ranged over the soul of America, a symbol of wide-open spaces, broncobuster spirit and the bucolic life on the family farm.</p>
        <p>Then the all-American icon stumbled into a land-mined pasture. Environmentalists, politicians and consumers are debating whether the planet can sustain its cattle herd as the human population swells.</p>
        <p>In America, the cow is on trial. The charges include dietary wrongdoing, pollution and misuse of natural resources.</p>
        <p>There are compelling arguments on both sides of the cow case.</p>
        <p>Lean beef provides protein and iron; low-fat dairy products provide calcium and zinc. Cattle help maintain open space and can feed on plants and grains that are unfit for human consumption. Whose Grain?  On the other hand, there are health risks in a diet that is high in beef and dairy, and questions about the growth enhancers and antibiotics administered to cattle. And the amount of grain used to feed cattle in this country could help ease world hunger.</p>
        <p>Cattle are linked with the erosion of topsoil and the agricultural runoff that damages streams. Worse yet, bovine flatulence generates a significant amount of methane, a greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>Recently, Elsie and Bossy have been called ''public enemy No. 1'' and ''nature's nuclear reactor.''</p>
        <p>Pound for pound, livestock outweighs humans four to one in the United States. Americans consume 106 grams of protein a day, said Dr. David Pimentel, professor of of Agricultural Science at Cornell University. The recommended daily allowance is 54 grams of protein, he said; ''we are eating way too much protein as a nation.''</p>
        <p>America's taste for cows had less environmental effect when the country was less densely settled. But today beef and dairy farming add to pollution, and concerns about national diet extend beyond personal health to the well-being of the planet.</p>
        <p>In a 1988 report, the Environmental Protection Agency said agricultural runoff is ''by far the most extensive source of pollution.''</p>
        <p>The Runoff Problem</p>
        <p>The agency is unable to determine what share of the problem is due to cattle, as opposed to fertilizers or pesticides. But Dr. Pimentel points out that livestock occupies almost half the land devoted to farming in the nation. The cattle runoff adds nitrogen to water, and the nitrogen promotes plant life, which can clog streams.</p>
        <p>Cattle growers don't disagree, at least when animals are crowded into feed lots. ''When you pack cattle into feed lots they are going to be producing more manure than the lot can handle and you're going to get some runoff,'' said Bert Hawkins, president of Agri-Business, a consulting firm in Lake Oswego, Ore. The industry has shortened the time that animals remain in feed lots. But for some environmentalists, this isn't enough. ''Get rid of the confinement feed lot altogether,'' said Wes Jackson, founder of the Land Institute in Salina, Kan. ''You don't have these problems when cattle graze the grasslands where they evolved and where they are part of a natural, balanced system.''</p>
        <p>For other environmentalists, that isn't enough, either. ''This is just an interim remedy to the environmental disaster we have created through our food growing practices,'' said John Robbins, author of ''Diet for a New America'' (Stillpoint Publishing, 1987). ''The only real solution is to find alternative food sources.''</p>
        <p>Kendal Frazier of the National Cattlemen's Association in Englewood, Colo., replied, ''This is another example of taking a very important issue, our environment, and using it to promote a strictly vegetarian agenda.''</p>
        <p>And this is a typical exchange between defense and prosecution in the case of the cow.</p>
        <p>Whether the charge is a clogged river or a clogged artery, a passionate subtext runs just below the surface of the trial. And the American all-or-nothing attitude kicks in.</p>
        <p>Radical measures such as adapting a beef- and dairy-free diet could conceivably eradicate the problems that cows cause. But not without ruining the $57 billion-a-year cattle industry. And not without unsettling a basic tenet of American culture: burgers and milk are a birthright.</p>
        <p>The shrinking world may be squeezing the birthright. Cattle's contribution to topsoil erosion is also being studied by the E.P.A. And while alternatives are investigated, predictable assertions are hurled between the pro-cow and anti-cow factions.</p>
        <p>The cattlemen quote Cy Jamison, Direc-tor of the Bureau of Land Management: ''Public lands are in better shape than ever before in this century.''</p>
        <p>''Cattle are responsible for 85 percent of topsoil erosion,'' said Mr. Robbins.</p>
        <p>The clearing of Central American and Brazilian rainforest to create cattle range epitomized the environmental effects of trying to grow cattle cheaply. Over the last several decades, ''millions of acres of rain forests a year were cleared for cattle in Central America,'' said Dr. Allen Hammond of the World Resource Institute in Washington. The deforestation created critical erosion. ''Hamburger imperialism,'' said one member of the Greenhouse Crisis Foundation. Dr. Irving Mintzer of the Research Center for Global Change in College Park, Md., was more circumspect. ''There is not enough land for everybody in the world to live on cheap hamburgers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>These debates are polite compared with the methane charge.</p>
        <p>The average cow - a ruminant, named for the ruman compartment of its stomach where cellulose is broken down by bacteria into cud and gas - emits up to 400 liters of methane a day, according to Prof. Don Johnson of Colorado State University, who measures such emissions. Methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, has more than doubled over two centuries. It is produced by organic decay in rice paddies, wet soils, ruminant animals and landfills. Underground methane, or natural gas, escapes from coal mines and gas wells. After rice paddies, ruminant animals are the largest producers of methane, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of emissions, according to the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>This figure is fiercely contested. In a study commissioned by the National Cattlemen's Assaociation, Prof. F. M. Byers of Texas A&amp;M University concluded: ''Cattle are not a significant source of greenhouse gases. The methane produced by all beef cattle in the U.S.A. amounts to less than 0.5 percent.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Byers's figure is ''rather low,'' said Michael Gibbs, co-author of the E.P.A. report, and the category of beef cattle in the United States is irrelevant. ''The point is overall global emissions,'' he said. If they were cut 25 percent by 2050, he said, it could reduce global warming by one-tenth of a degree.</p>
        <p>A Matter for Senators</p>
        <p>The importance of animal methane emissions is such that the Senate addressed control options, though it did not act on them, in the recent debate over clean-air legislation. ''Now, we have not been told exactly how our administrators are expected to collect this gas, but we might envision some sort of bag to catch gas,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican.</p>
        <p>''Who knows, if cows can have airbags, why not equip them with catalytic converters? And if that does not work in reducing cow methane gas emissions, we can tax them. Call it another gas tax,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Someone suggested that the solution to ruminant methane production could be corks, but I don't subscribe to that,'' said Dr. Mintzer, who notes that most emissions are belched. He believes they could be lowered by genetic engineering and changes in feed.</p>
        <p>And yet, such technological manipulations, already used to create leaner beef and cows that give more milk, threaten a tenet of the way of life that the American cow represents: life on the family farm.</p>
        <p>''Beef and dairy cattle both have a place in the ecosystem of the integrated family farm,'' said Joan Gussow, professor of nutrition at Teachers College of Columbia University. ''They are raised in proportion to other crops and most of the byproducts can be used on the farm.''</p>
        <p>But the 136 million metric tons of grain that feed the beef for 250 million Americans could feed 400 million worldwide, according to Dr. Pimentel of Cornell. ''Cattle and dairy are the most inefficient use of land concievable,'' said Mr. Robbins.</p>
        <p>The cattlemen's association counters with nutritional claims. ''The nutritional content of one pound of beef is far superior for humans to the nutrient content of the 4.1 pounds of grain or the 20.3 pounds of grass used to produce that one pound of beef.''</p>
        <p>The American Dietary Association acknowleges that low-fat beef is an excellent source of protein and iron. Nevertheless, Karen Kovach, a dietitian with the organization is perplexed by one of the pro-cow nutritional claims.</p>
        <p>''Grass and beef are sort of like apples and oranges,'' she said. The Dietary Association relies on dairy products as an excellent source of calcium and zinc but encourages low-fat varieties.</p>
        <p>The climbing sales of lowfat milk products show that the public is responding. In 1979, Americans purchased 78 pounds of beef each; last year, they bought 69 pounds.</p>
        <p>But as the taste of both diary and meat lighten on the national palate, Americans are wildly romancing the cow image.</p>
        <p>Cows graze on the side of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream trucks, and their creator, Woody Jackson of Middlebury, Vt., said sales are lively at his novelty company, Holy Cow.</p>
        <p>After last year's International Gift Show in New York, its public relations director, Sharon Shepperd, noted the cows' heyday. The last big popular image, she said, was the dinosaur. The smaller planet and the diet it will require may spell an ice age for cows as well.</p>
        <p>But public taste changes at a glacial pace. ''I know we need to find more sustainable agriculture, I know we need to stop binging on beef for our health, to end world hunger, to save our planet,'' said Dr. Mintzer of the Research Center for Global Change. But, he said, ''sometimes I still have a hamburger for lunch.''  COWS IN TROUBLE  Correction:  May 13, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final</p>
