        <p>BUDGET deficits plague the Patent and Trademark Office no less than most Government agencies. So the office has raised its patent application fees.

        <p>The Patent Office is one agency that raises enough money through fees to support itself. It used to get tax dollars, too, but in 1990 Congress imposed a surcharge on patent filing fees so the Patent Office could finance itself. Then Congress turned around and declared that a portion of those surcharges should be withheld from the Patent Office, which left it with a deficit.</p>

        <p>BUDGET deficits plague the Patent and Trademark Office no less than most Government agencies. So the office has raised its patent application fees. As of Oct. 1, the basic filing fee for a large company increased to $730 from $710. A small company or individual will now pay $365 instead of $355.</p>
        <p>The Patent Office is one agency that raises enough money through fees to support itself. It used to get tax dollars, too, but in 1990 Congress imposed a surcharge on patent filing fees so the Patent Office could finance itself. Then Congress turned around and declared that a portion of those surcharges should be withheld from the Patent Office, which left it with a deficit.</p>
        <p>Herbert Wamsley, executive director of the Intellectual Property Owners Association, says this forces inventors to subsidize the Federal budget.</p>
        <p>"This agency should not be a profit-making agency for producing money to help run the rest of government," Mr. Wamsley said. "It's a tax on innovation, that's what it comes down to."</p>
        <p>Bradford R. Huther, the Patent Office's chief financial officer, said, "We understand why the inventors see it that way."</p>
        <p>"Our fees are set to recover costs," he explained. "If we collect the money and don't use it for services, by anyone's definition that is a tax. We have reported that view to Congress."</p>
        <p>Mr. Huther said that of the office's annual $500 million budget, about $107 million comes from the surcharge. This year, the agency got only $77 million of that. And the amount withheld was almost double that of last year.</p>
        <p>"It's like going into a department store," Mr. Huther added, "paying $30 for a sewing machine, and then finding out that some of that money has been diverted to pay for another appliance."</p>
        <p>The agency tried to get Congress to pass legislation changing the way the surcharge is allocated early this year. But the Congressional Budget Office said the change would not comply with the Budget Enforcement Act. Mr. Huther said the Patent Office would try again next year.</p>
        <p>Some fees help pay for more than one service. The $3 charge for copies of patents, for example, subsidizes the agency because the service actually costs less than $2. "All the fees we charge cover 100 percent of the P.T.O.'s aggregate operating costs,"Mr. Huther said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wamsley countered, "But the way it's turned out, is that it's more than 100 percent self-supporting, and the money is diverted."</p>
        <p>The Patent Office also raised by 3 percent the maintenance fees inventors must pay over the life of a patent. It now costs about $8,000 to obtain and hold a 17-year patent. Similar patent protection costs $80,000 in Europe and about $10,000 in Japan, Mr. Huther said.</p>
        <p>Trademark application fees have not been raised -- chiefly because they were increased last year. But as of Oct. 1, the Patent Office will charge for on-line services that used to be free. It now costs $40 or $50 an hour to conduct a computer search at the office's Washington area headquarters, depending on whether the patent drawings are included. Libraries across the country with patent archives will be charged an annual subscription, starting at $2,250 for 300 hours of on-line time.</p>
        <p>"There's still no service fee for our electronic bulletin board of basic patent files," Mr. Huther said. That service provides only recent patent numbers, inventor's names and a brief abstract of the invention. Compressed Air For Aerosol Cans</p>
        <p>Aerosol cans used chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant until the discovery that those chemicals depleted the ozone layer. So most aerosol manufacturers began using hydrocarbons like propane, butane and isobutane. They work, but they are also highly flammable.</p>
        <p>John Mizzi and Don Merte have invented an aerosol that uses compressed air as a propellant, and they have patented three types of dispensers: one that inserts into cans, one that comes with a refillable container and a side pump that can be switched between different cans of consumer products without contamination.</p>
        <p>"The standard aerosol is something sealed and filled under pressure," Mr. Mizzi explained. "There's a propellant that is in liquid form with vaporized pressure on it. Generally today these are hydrocarbons, even though initially they were considered too dangerous for personal products."</p>
        <p>After chlorofluorocarbons were banned, hydrocarbons were adopted because they were cheap and manufacturers did not have to redesign their machinery.</p>
        <p>"My aerosol can uses air as a propellant," Mr. Mizzi said. "The air is compressed by the simple action of shaking the container a few times before use."</p>
        <p>He described an "inertia-coupled compressor, or pump, inside the container."</p>
        <p>"It comes in two forms -- either a piston and cylinder, or a bellows," Mr. Mizzi said. "It maintains pressure between uses, so you don't really have to shake it every time."</p>
        <p>He said his cans had the same look as ordinary aerosol cans, with standard valves and nozzles. While hydrocarbon-propelled aerosols spray at about 30 to 50 pounds a square inch, Mr. Mizzi's average about 20 to 25. He said he had a high-pressure version that reached 70 pounds a square inch.</p>
        <p>"It's primarily for liquids, but it can also generate foams for shaving creams," he said. He hoped by offering refillable models, the invention would reduce solid wastes, manufacturing costs and shelf space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizzi and Mr. Merte hope to license their inventions as well as manufacture some of the cans themselves. They received patents 5,348,190; 5,348,197 and 5,348,198.</p>
