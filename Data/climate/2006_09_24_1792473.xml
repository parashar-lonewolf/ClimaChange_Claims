        <p>Re ''The Good News About Oil Prices Is the Bad News'' (On the Contrary, Sept. 17), on why higher oil prices are good for the economy and the planet:</p>
        <p>The column said that ''the burden of higher oil prices, unfortunately, will fall most heavily on the world's poor.'' But this is not necessarily so.</p>
        <p>The revenue from higher prices for oil (and coal and natural gas) can be recycled to the public via an environmental trust fund. Because individuals would pay into the fund in proportion to their consumption of fossil fuels, the rich would pay more than the poor. If the fund then paid equal dividends to every woman, man and child -- based on the principle that all have equal ''ownership'' rights to the atmosphere's capacity to recycle carbon emissions -- the poor would come out ahead, getting more in dividend checks than they pay in higher fuel prices.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yes, cheaper oil is ultimately bad news. So, yes, load it with taxes -- European style -- and use the revenue bonus for alternative-fuel research. Unfortunately, President Bush would probably use it to lower top tax rates again.</p>
