        <p>After a week of intensive negotiations, diplomats here at the World Summit on Sustainable Development arrived at a plan early this morning that is intended to reduce poverty and preserve the earth's natural resources.</p>
        <p>The breakthrough came after diplomats worked late into the night on Tuesday to resolve a dispute over language in the conference's plan on health care for women.</p>
        <p>Also on Tuesday, Russia announced that it would ratify the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty intended to ease global warming -- a move virtually ensuring that the treaty would go into effect despite its rejection by the United States.</p>
        <p>Canada wanted the words ''in conformity with human rights and fundamental freedoms'' linked to health care to avoid condoning practices like female genital mutilation. Representatives of developing countries initially opposed the language, but backed down this morning.</p>
        <p>''We're very pleased,'' Kelly Morgan, a spokeswoman for the Canadian delegation, said. ''We are finished.''</p>
        <p>The plan is meant to set the global agenda for coming years. It calls on nations to reduce by half the number of poor people who lack sanitation by 2015; to commit to the sound management of chemicals with the goal of minimizing their adverse effects on health and nature by 2020; and to reduce significantly by 2010 the number of animals and plants having endangered status.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for the reduction of agricultural subsidies in wealthy countries, which, poor nations say, protect farmers in the United States and Europe from competition. It also urges nations to promote renewable energy sources like solar and wind power as well as to expand access to energy services by the poor.</p>
        <p>Officials from the United States and the United Nations praised the document, but it was sharply assailed by environmentalists and advocates for the poor, who complained that wealthy countries had weakened the language.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell flew in late on Tuesday and will make a speech here today.</p>
        <p>The United States, along with Canada, Japan and oil-producing countries, blocked an effort by the European Union to set a target and a timetable for the conversion from oil and gas to renewable sources of energy. The Europeans had sought a commitment to ensuring that renewable energy sources would account for 15 percent of the world's total energy production by 2010. But American officials opposed the target, saying they preferred concrete action to goals that might ultimately prove meaningless.</p>
        <p>In the end, the nations agreed to promote an increase in renewable energy, but rejected the specific target and time frame, officials said.</p>
        <p>The United States praised the plan and the negotiations that preceded it. ''It's a message of hope to impoverished areas of the world,'' said John F. Turner, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs. ''I think it builds an excellent framework for going forward.''</p>
        <p>But Brooks Yeager of the World Wildlife Fund said most environmentalists were disappointed. ''We're particularly disappointed at the outcome of the energy discussions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The secretary general of the conference, Nitin Desai, emphasized that leaders had succeeded in finding common ground in difficult discussions. But he, too, acknowledged that the plan was weaker than many hoped. ''In some areas,'' he said, ''I wish we could have done more.''</p>
        <p>Russia's decision was hailed as a step forward in the struggle to prevent the droughts, floods and agricultural disruptions many experts think is caused by climate change.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov said Russia planned to ratify the Kyoto treaty ''in the very near future.'' Diplomats said they expected ratification by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The treaty would set the first binding restrictions on releases of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrial nations.</p>
        <p>Officials also said they hoped Russia's decision would put more pressure on President Bush, who angered many leaders last year when he rejected the accord. But Mr. Bush maintains that it could harm the American economy and that it is unfair because the required emissions cuts apply only to industrial powers, not to fast-growing developing countries like China and India.</p>
        <p>Among treaty supporters, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien of Canada pledged to push his Parliament to ratify the treaty by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said they thought Russia was waiting to ratify the treaty in an effort to win concessions in other areas, like increased financial aid or compensation for maintaining vast forests that emit carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>China announced today that it had ratified the treaty, but American officials said that did not change their position. As it now stands, the Kyoto accord does not require China to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
