        <p>The first woman to head New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation, Erin M. Crotty, will leave the agency next month, the latest in a number of officials in the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki to resign recently.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crotty, 38, has been commissioner of the department, one of the largest and most complex in state government, since March 2001. She said in an interview that she was leaving now because the department had already accomplished many of the environmental and health initiatives that were her priorities.</p>
        <p>''Equally important,'' she said, ''I got married last year and want to start a family.''</p>
        <p>Since taking control of the department nearly four years ago, Ms. Crotty has overseen several significant environmental efforts. They include the creation of a state plan to pay for the cleanup of contaminated but reusable building sites called brownfields.</p>
        <p>She also oversaw the refinancing of the state Superfund law; the creation of a plan for decontaminating heavily polluted Onondaga Lake, near Syracuse; the acquisition of hundreds of thousands of acres of Adirondack woodlands; and the imposition of tough new acid rain rules.</p>
        <p>But environmental groups sometimes accused her of lacking sufficient independence from the governor's office and ineffectively warding off interference from industry sources opposed to tough environmental regulations. They also said she had not protected the department from budget cuts that had left it understaffed.</p>
        <p>''This is an agency that over all is stretched too thin,'' said Peter M. Iwanowicz, director of environmental health for the American Lung Association of New York State.</p>
        <p>Jeff Jones, a spokesman for Environmental Advocates of New York, said the department had lost 700 positions in the last decade. That has decreased the department's effectiveness, he said, and increased mistakes, such as the missed deadline that led a state judge to strike down tough new acid rain regulations last June after power plant operators challenged them.</p>
        <p>Despite cuts, the department has more than 3,000 employees, who Ms. Crotty said were fulfilling all their responsibilities.</p>
        <p>After the acid rain regulations were thrown out, the department successfully reintroduced them on an emergency basis. They are now in place, despite another appeal by power plant operators. ''And that translates into very meaningful improvements to the environment and public health,'' Ms. Crotty said.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki named Lynette M. Stark, the current deputy commissioner for natural resources and water quality, as acting commissioner of the department. She will serve until a new commissioner is named.</p>
        <p>The governor's budget director, Carole E. Stone, left her post in October. His communications director, Lisa Dewald Stoll, left last month. And just this week, a close ally of Mr. Pataki, Robert L. King, requested a six-month sabbatical from his job as chancellor of the State University of New York, only to announce in a surprise move Thursday that he wanted to stay in the post.</p>
