        <p>Praxair Inc., a large producer of industrial gases, said yesterday that it had made a $2.1 billion offer to buy CBI Industries Inc., the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>In a letter delivered on Friday to CBI's chairman and chief executive, John E. Jones, Praxair said it would pay $32 -- in either cash or Praxair common stock -- for each share of CBI stock. Praxair would also assume about $700 million of CBI's long-term debt.</p>

        <p>Praxair Inc., a large producer of industrial gases, said yesterday that it had made a $2.1 billion offer to buy CBI Industries Inc., the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>In a letter delivered on Friday to CBI's chairman and chief executive, John E. Jones, Praxair said it would pay $32 -- in either cash or Praxair common stock -- for each share of CBI stock. Praxair would also assume about $700 million of CBI's long-term debt.</p>
        <p>Praxair's offer represents a hefty premium of 59 percent to the $20.125 closing price of CBI shares on Friday. The shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, have recently fallen from a 52-week high of $27.75 to flirt with a five-year low of $19.</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday, CBI said that it would review the offer and had retained Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch &amp; Company as advisers.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone yesterday, Alan J. Schneider, CBI's chief financial offer, declined to comment on the Praxair offer.</p>
        <p>H. William Lichtenberger, Praxair's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that he had not received a response from CBI. But Mr. Lichtenberger spoke with enthusiasm, asserting, "We see some terrific market synergies and significant cost synergies."</p>
        <p>Praxair, which is based in Danbury, Conn., is the leading producer of such industrial gases as oxygen, hydrogen and helium. Last year, the company earned $203 million on sales of $2.7 billion. The company's stock, which also trades on the New York Stock Exchange, closed at $26.875 on Friday.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Lichtenberger, the letter making a formal bid was sent after informal discussions between Praxair and CBI broke off Oct. 20. The two companies had been talking about a possible merger for about six months.</p>
        <p>"We obviously thought a lot about the $32 and the premium," Mr. Lichtenberger said. "We tried to put an offer there that CBI's board and shareholders would find attractive."</p>
        <p>CBI, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., also operates the Chicago Bridge and  Iron engineering and contracting business. The carbon dioxide business of its Liquid Carbonic Industries produced roughly half the company's $1.9 billion in revenue last year but accounted for nearly 80 percent of the company's $160.5 million in income from operations.</p>
        <p>"The attraction to us is the No. 1 worldwide producer in an important industrial gas," Mr. Lichtenberger said.</p>
        <p>He said he believed that CBI also offered Praxair the opportunity to expand geographically, especially in South America, where CBI has a presence in areas that complement Praxair's operations.</p>
        <p>If the deal is completed, Mr. Lichtenberger said that Praxair would review whether to sell or keep CBI's engineering business.</p>
        <p>Analysts agreed that the acquisition would be a good fit for Praxair. "The absence of carbon dioxide in Praxair's portfolio, to a certain extent, is a gaping hole," Jane Mehrning, a specialty-chemical analyst with Smith Barney, said. Since being spun off from the Union Carbide Corporation in 1992, Praxair has shown its ability to reduce costs and raise operating efficiencies, she said.</p>
        <p>Joseph Cappello, an analyst with New Vernon Associates, a specialty chemical  equity research firm in Parsippany, N.J., said he thought that "Liquid Carbonics would fit perfectly in Praxair."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cappello estimated CBI's stock as having an intrinsic value of roughly $34 a share, but called $32 a fair offer. "The real reason the stock has gone down is that investors haven't been confident that the value of the assets would be unlocked," he said.</p>
        <p>Still, CBI may not be so quick to accept Praxair's offer. Last year, when Airgas Inc., an industrial gas distributor in Radnor, Pa., offered to buy CBI's  carbon dioxide business, CBI refused to be broken up. Airgas dropped its bid in  January.</p>
        <p>"If CBI management said yes on day one, I'd be very surprised," Mr. Cappello  said.</p>
