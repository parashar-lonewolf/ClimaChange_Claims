        <p>LEAD: President Bush called today for a cautious response to the threat of global warming, pleasing those in his Administration who want a deliberate policy but disappointing many environmentalists.</p>
        <p>President Bush called today for a cautious response to the threat of global warming, pleasing those in his Administration who want a deliberate policy but disappointing many environmentalists.</p>
        <p>In a speech to an international environmental group, the President called for global action but warned against policies that would interfere with economic growth and the free market.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the speech struck a middle ground between conflicting positions among Mr. Bush's aides.</p>
        <p>His chief of staff, John H. Sununu, wanted to emphasize scientific uncertainties about global warming and to warn of economic dangers in rushing to act. Several agency heads, including William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, pressed for a stronger message of America's commitment to action.</p>
        <p>No New Recommendations</p>
        <p>The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the speech did not represent a victory for the chief of staff. But it is clear that Mr. Sununu, who has a degree in nuclear engineering and has taken a strong interest in environmental issues, is having substantial influence on one of the most important environmental issues before the President.</p>
        <p>''The United States remains committed to aggressive and very thoughtful action on environmental issues,'' Mr. Bush said in his speech. But he offered no new recommendations for specific action to slow or reduce global warming. He did not even use the words ''global warming,'' speaking only of ''climate change.''</p>
        <p>Although there is considerable disagreement over the extent of the problem, many scientists expect temperatures across the world to increase as carbon dioxide and other industrial and vehicular gases accumulate in the atmosphere and trap radiation from the sun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called for an ''international bargain, a convergence between global environmental policy and global economic policy, where both perspectives benefit and neither is compromised.'' He asserted that strong economies around the world would provide the resources for better protection of the environment.</p>
        <p>''Wherever possible,'' he said, ''we believe that market mechanism should be applied and that our policies must be consistent with economic growth and free-market principles in all countries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush spoke at a meeting here of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body formed under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Association. The panel's mission is to assess the changes in the world's climate that many scientists expect will occur in the next century, and the political and scientific implications of those changes.</p>
        <p>The President's remarks disappointed environmentalists and some European government officials and scientists at the meeting. They had hoped Mr. Bush would outline specific suggestions for concerted action to lower the gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Contrast With Europeans</p>
        <p>''A year ago this speech would have been exciting,'' said Christopher Flavin of the Worldwatch Institute, a research group based in Washington, adding that in the past year there has been a growing international consensus about the threat of global warming. ''Now it's a disappointment.'' The combustion of fossil fuels like oil and coal is the chief source of carbon dioxide pollution. Mr. Flavin noted that some European governments had committed themselves to controlling emissions, often through taxes on industries and products that emit carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>He added that members of the Bush Administration were seeking to kill a provision in the clean air bill before the Senate that would require improved fuel efficiency in automobiles as a way to curb emissions.</p>
        <p>James T. B. Tripp, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, said of the speech, ''The tone is fine but there are no specific commitments.'' He added, ''What is needed now to deal with global warming is a massive energy Marshall Plan that stresses energy conservation and efficiency, renewable sources of energy and a reversal of trends toward increasing oil imports and traffic congestion.''</p>
        <p>Praise From Industry</p>
        <p>Industry representatives praised the President's insistence that any policies to deal with the environmental threat must be consistent with economic growth.</p>
        <p>Thomas G. Lambrix, chairman of the Global Climate Coalition, an industry group, called the President's speech ''very strong'' and said it struck a good balance between the global warming problem and the need to achieve a better understanding of the scientific issues and to develop strategies that are premised on economic development.</p>
        <p>Jana R. Oakley, assistant vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said, ''The President has outlined strong environmental initiatives,'' and added, ''I don't see how anyone in this room can say he is not an environmental President.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the muted tone of the President's speech reflected concerns by the White House staff that more scientific data about global warming and more study of the potential costs of meeting the threat are needed before formal international action is taken.</p>
        <p>But the officials said that despite Mr. Sununu's influence, most of the changes he sought were not included in the speech as delivered. Those changes would have had the President dwell chiefly on the scientific uncertainties and economic dangers and play down the environmental threat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly, who pressed for a strong commitment on global warming, praised the President's speech.</p>
