        <p>SKIERS at Jiminy Peak in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts will see plenty of construction this season, though it's not a new base lodge or chairlift. This fall, the resort broke ground on a $3.9 million, 253-foot-tall wind turbine that will generate a third of the resort's energy consumption. By avoiding fossil fuels, Jiminy Peak hopes to save more than a half-million dollars annually and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to both a healthier bottom line and environment.</p>
        <p>Jiminy Peak may be the first ski resort to install a wind turbine, but it joins a growing number of resorts turning to emission-free, sustainable energy such as wind, solar and geothermal. To date, 47 resorts in 14 states are using some kind of renewable energy, according to the National Ski Areas Association.</p>
        <p>It's not just about being environmentally correct, though the feel-good publicity doesn't hurt. Climate change presents a singular threat to ski resorts, perhaps more than any other industry. According to a 2003 United Nations report, global warming may force low-altitude alpine resorts to relocate, increase snowmaking and even close as early as 2030. The effects of warmer temperature and diminished snowfall are already threatening the closure of ski resorts in Scotland and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Among the most aggressive in going green has been Vail Resorts. Three months ago, the company announced that it was buying 152,000 megawatt hours of wind energy a year, enough to offset 100 percent of its energy use at its five ski resorts (Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone and Heavenly Mountain), as well as its lodging properties including RockResorts and Grand Teton Lodge Company, its 125 retail shops and its corporate offices in Broomfield, Colo.</p>
        <p>At first, Vail considered installing two wind turbines, but opted instead to buy wind credits through Renewable Choice Energy, a wind-farm broker in Boulder, Colo. Buying energy credits means that the amount of electricity a company uses is replaced on the power grid with wind energy that is produced on wind farms or other renewable sources.</p>
        <p>''Purchasing wind credits was the most efficient and environmentally sensitive option,'' said Robert A. Katz, chief executive officer for Vail Resorts, ''eliminating the need for new construction on the mountain and offering a new source of income to local farmers.''</p>
        <p>Further promoting renewable energy, the Vail resorts offer free one-day lift tickets to visitors who buy wind power for their homes for a year through Renewable Choice Energy. Vail calls the program ''Ski With the Wind.''</p>
        <p>There are now at least 19 ski resorts in North America that rely 100 percent on wind power, including Okemo Mountain Resort in Vermont, Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado and Mount Sunapee Resort in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>Though wind power is the main source of alternative energy for powering lifts, ski resorts are also experimenting with other approaches.</p>
        <p>Aspen/Snowmass, which was the first major resort to use wind energy to power its chairlifts, installed a small hydropower turbine two years ago that turns the mountain's spring runoff into electricity. The turbine can power about 35 homes year round. The resort also installed an array of solar panels to power one of its ski patrol stations.</p>
        <p>Mammoth Mountain Resort in California is trying different solar systems and is now reviewing the use of geothermal heating. Mammoth sits on top of a dormant volcano. ''Punch a hole in the ground and you don't have to go very far to find warm water,'' said Lisa Isaacs, director of environmental programs for Mammoth.</p>
        <p>The resort hopes to use that energy to melt snow and to heat a new 80,000-square-foot base lodge. ''Given the limitations of imported oil, the timing couldn't be better,'' Ms. Isaacs said.</p>
