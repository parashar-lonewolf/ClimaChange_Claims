        <p>Companies</p>
        <p>A. Alfred Taubman's shopping mall empire plans to go public to raise $335 million to $389 million. Investors would get a 22 percent stake in 19 large shopping malls from California to Connecticut, and Mr. Taubman, who also controls Sotheby's Holdings, would be freed of hundreds of millions of dollars of personal debt.  [ D1. ]  Whether he is discussing Monets or malls, Mr. Taubman is a gifted salesman who enjoys a lavish style of living.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>Carl C. Icahn would step down as T.W.A. chairman under a deal being negotiating for the carrier's unionized employees and creditors to buy him out. Analysts saw short-term relief for the bankrupt carrier, but it would be left with an aging fleet and ill-positioned to compete. Mr. Icahn stands to lose up to $100 million.  [ D1. ]</p>
        <p>Bidding escalated for LTV's missiles and aerospace unit. Martin Marietta offered $440 million and Loral $445 million.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet is being shipped without Lotus 1-2-3-style command menus, following a copyright infringement ruling. But any damages await a trial by jury.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>Midlantic plans to raise about $113 million of additional capital from overseas investors and from a direct sale by the New Jersey bank to five American investors.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>Chipwich filed for bankruptcy protection. The New York maker of chocolate-chip-cookie ice cream sandwiches cited inventory overstatements by its Peltz Food division.  [ D4. ]</p>
        <p>David Paul should be fined $3 million for violating a cease and desist order related to the collapse of Centrust Savings and Loan, Federal regulators said in a hearing in Miami.  [ D5. ]</p>
        <p>New England Electric has a new approach to recaputuring the carbon dioxide that plants pump into the atmosphere. The utility plans to pay lumber companies to work more gently.  [ D4. ] The Economy</p>
        <p>An outlay of $550 million for the superconducting supercollider next year was voted by the Senate, weeks after the House rejected the $8.2 billion proton smasher as unaffordable.  [ A11. ]</p>
        <p>The purchasing managers' index of economic activity rose to 54.2 in July from 52.8 in June, which economists said suggested that any economic upturn would be slow.  [ D10. ]</p>
        <p>Construction activity in June fell 1.5 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $416.9 billion, the worst decline in 13 months, largely because of a sharp drop in government spending.  [ D10. ] International</p>
        <p>An obscure dispute involving Canada's apparel industry has resulted in slow progress on the final details of a planned North American free-trade agreement, but talks are continuing.  [ D2. ]</p>
        <p>Turkish business travelers are finding Central Asia has no money for the trade they would like to develop.  [ D10. ] Markets</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average added 1.62 points, to 3,395.40, and advancing stocks outnumbered decliners.  [ D6. ]  Trading was quiet in the bond market, as traders awaited Friday's unemployment report for July and next week's Treasury auction.  [ D14. ]</p>
        <p>Hog and pork belly futures prices shot up after President Bush offered to sell 30,000 metric tons of United States pork to the former Soviet republics at subsidized prices.  [ D15. ]  The dollar was mixed against most currencies, and gold prices dropped sharply.  [ D15. ] Today's Columns</p>
        <p>Individual states may serve as laboratories for an eventual national program to deal with the problems of high health-care costs. Milt Freudenheim: Business and Health.  [ D2. ]</p>
        <p>A Prudential short-term bond fund has performed very well, and yet its assets have plunged. The apparent reason: Brokers are not promoting it. Market Place.  [ D6. ]</p>
        <p>Philosophers may debate illusion and reality, but to Madison Avenue a faux Olympian can be as good as a gold medal winner. Stuart Elliott: Advertising.  [ D16. ]</p>
