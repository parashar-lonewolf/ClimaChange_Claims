        <p>THERE have been all sorts of pronouncements in the past week about the ambitions and absurdities of the Iraq war, but nothing in newspapers, on cable or even out there in the blogosphere matched the impact of a deft little turn in the middle of ''The War Tapes,'' a documentary about -- and filmed by -- a New Hampshire National Guard Unit stationed in Iraq that opened in theaters two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Specialist Mike Moriarty is filming his squad leader, Staff Sgt. Kevin Shangraw, as they bounce along in a Humvee. He asks his leader for his take on the broader mission, and Sergeant Shangraw comes straight off the dome with a government-issue rationale.</p>
        <p>''Well, I think it's a fantastic opportunity for the Iraqis to establish a new history in the country and be able to be a free and democratic society, which in turn should stabilize the whole Middle East and create a freer and more stable earth as we know it.''</p>
        <p>''Tell me how you really feel,'' an unseen Specialist Moriarty prompts.</p>
        <p>Sergeant. Shangraw waits a beat as the bleak landscape flies by in the window before answering.</p>
        <p>''Then, after that happens, maybe we can buy everybody in the world a puppy.''</p>
        <p>It is mordantly effective filmmaking. ''The War Tapes'' has the stock characters of any war movie -- the gung-ho guy, the wiseacre, the bookish one -- but the fact that they are actually fighting the war not only gives them a perspective on events most of us are seeing through a straw, but also a ferocious credibility. The movie is less diatribe than a vérité tour of the vagaries of war in general and this one in particular. (Much of the unit's mission involves guarding convoys of supply trucks from Halliburton, driven by highly paid civilians.)</p>
        <p>''The War Tapes'' is one of a rash of current documentaries feeding appetites for information and coverage beyond traditional channels of information. ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' a filmed version of former Vice President Al Gore's slide show on global warming, has turned the most boring of issues -- and public personalities -- into an entertainment. ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'', a whodunit about the death of electric vehicles in California, landed with enough impact that the Smithsonian removed its only electric vehicle from display last week. ''The Road to Guantánamo,'' a hybrid of documentary and feature techniques, seemed to neatly prefigure the recent events at the prison.</p>
        <p>THE current surge in politically inflected documentaries seems like a mashed-up, digital version of the 1960's, when books like ''Silent Spring,'' ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' and ''The Other America'' came out of nowhere to define public debate. Those interested in advancing specific points of view these days are picking up the 800-pound pencil of filmmaking, in part because digital technology has made it easier to deliver complicated political messages in a visual narrative.</p>
        <p>But the cluster of serious, point-of-view documentaries may also represent something else, a coup d'etat on the status quo. Just as those big books of the 60's took on the elites of the day (chemical companies, Detroit engineers) these films betray a disaffection with their postindustrial counterparts (Hollywood, the traditional news media) for filling theaters with brain-dead blockbusters and neglecting important stories.</p>
        <p>''Documentaries used to explore issues, but there has been an extraordinary explosion of political advocacy,'' said Sheila Nevins, president of documentary films at HBO. ''I don't think the evening news is doing a good job of expressing the confusion about the state of the world, and this is a soapbox that a lot of people are turning to.''</p>
        <p>Michael Moore, whose ''Fahrenheit 911,'' and ''Bowling for Columbine'' set the template for the new political documentary, believes there are two reasons we are seeing these films in theaters.</p>
        <p>''Mainstream media, especially The New York Times, has failed to cast a skeptical eye on those in power,'' he said. ''The other reason is that Hollywood has not done the job of producing interesting films of substance. If journalism isn't doing the job and fiction isn't doing the job, nonfiction has stepped in with compelling characters, good stories and important films.''</p>
        <p>Sgt. Zack Bazzi, one of the stars and battlefield auteurs of ''The War Tapes,'' said the war he fought in (and probably will again) is the one he saw in the documentary, which was directed by Deborah Scranton.</p>
        <p>''The strongest message of the film is that you have three primary characters who have very different views of the war who do their jobs to the best of their abilities with no regrets,'' he said, speaking by cellphone from Vermont.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, gunfire erupted in the background. ''That isn't real. Those are blanks,'' he said, explaining that he had volunteered for a few days to assist in training a unit that was on its way to Iraq.</p>
        <p>''No film or book is going to capture the exact reality of a war, but this film comes as close as any I have seen,'' he said, moving away from the explosions. ''This is another vehicle to relay the message and help bridge the current disconnect people feel with the war. It helps civilians be better citizens, to not confuse the war with the warrior.''</p>
        <p>The current impulse to fight back by picking up a camera is generally considered a liberal reflex -- there are very few politically conservative documentarians. But much of the most bracing work comes from people who were not ideologues to begin with. Dean Devlin, an executive producer on ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' decided to finance his first documentary after General Motors killed its electric car program and insisted that the cars, including his, be returned.</p>
        <p>''Both the director and I lived that story,'' he said. ''I think that now that you have high-quality digital cameras that produce images that can be edited on PC's, it is a much easier matter to put together a film. And audiences are much more comfortable with unscripted entertainment because of the ubiquity of reality television. It seems more real.''</p>
        <p>But verisimilitude does not equal impact, and it's an open question whether these documentaries will achieve any real-world effect. Books like ''Silent Spring'' and even ''The Feminine Mystique'' put long-ignored issues into the mainstream, altering or sometimes creating a debate. But even that rare documentary like ''An Inconvenient Truth'' that breaks through to wide release is up against the tyranny of mass consumption. It's likely that more people saw ''Cars,'' an homage to joyous combustion, on its opening weekend than will ever see ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' or ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' The choir of the converted may line up for the latest cause, but most people who clog the multiplex are not going to be talking about global warming as they drive away.</p>
        <p>''A book is far more consequential,'' said Ralph Nader, who brought at least a corner of Detroit to account with ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' a meticulously reported account of G.M.'s willful neglect of safety issues. He pointed out that although the Gore documentary was getting visibility, a serious, handsome book of the same name had been produced.</p>
        <p>''No one ever sent a documentary to Congress. Films land with immediacy and get people angry, but they do not create a civic motivation,'' Mr. Nader said. ''The usual homily is that a picture is worth a thousand words, but when it comes to the documentaryversus a traditional muckraking book, I think the reverse is true.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, Mr. Moore and others suggest that a lightweight traditional media that is both afflicted with A.D.D. and rife with agendas has left filmmakers and citizens looking elsewhere for their information.</p>
        <p>In ''The War Tapes,'' Sgt. Stephen Pink walks into a dorm room with his camera at Fort Dix, N.J., where soldiers are preparing to go to Iraq.</p>
        <p>One soldier protests. ''We're not supposed to talk to the media.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not the media,'' he retorts as the soldier turns away. Sergeant Pink persists. ''I'm not the media, damn it!''</p>

        <p>Correction:  June 27, 2006, Tuesday  The David Carr column in Business Day on June 19 about political documentaries misstated the reason that an electric vehicle was removed from a display at the Smithsonian Institution on June 14, shortly before the release of the film ''Who Killed the Electric Car?'' It was taken out as part of the standard rotation of exhibits; it was not removed in anticipation of the documentary's release.</p>
