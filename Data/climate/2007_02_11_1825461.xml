        <p>ENVIRONMENTALLY conflicted couples can ''offset'' the global warming impact of their celebrations by purchasing carbon credits from a company that helps reduce emissions of climate-changing gases. Such companies help finance windmills that replace coal-burning power plants, for example, or help pay for projects to gather cow manure and use it to make methane that is burned for electricity. That replaces coal and stops emissions of unburned methane, itself a global warming gas.</p>

        <p>ENVIRONMENTALLY conflicted couples can ''offset'' the global warming impact of their celebrations by purchasing carbon credits from a company that helps reduce emissions of climate-changing gases. Such companies help finance windmills that replace coal-burning power plants, for example, or help pay for projects to gather cow manure and use it to make methane that is burned for electricity.

        <p>''When you do the math of a wedding,'' said Tom Arnold, the chief environmental officer at TerraPass, it's flying that has the biggest environmental impact. There are other ways to make travel more earth-friendly. ''I have pitched my girlfriend, who I hope will be my fiancée, that we should go on tour, instead of everybody coming to see us,'' Mr. Arnold said. So far, she has not consented to that plan (or to a wedding).</p>
        <p>Burning a gallon of gasoline or of jet fuel produces approximately equal amounts of carbon dioxide. The airlines say that that each gallon moves a passenger about 20 miles, so a 1,000-mile trip would use about 50 gallons. (At TerraPass, a pass for such a trip would cost $9.95.) A large sedan on the highway would also go about 20 miles on a gallon, but would be much more efficient per person if it is carrying three or four people.</p>
