        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said today that it had filed insider trading charges against unknown investors who bought CBI Industries stock just days before Praxair Inc. announced a takeover bid for the company.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. announced the lawsuit just hours after CBI, a carbon dioxide and industrial gas producer, rejected the $2.1 billion takeover bid as "inadequate."</p>
        <p>CBI said it was "exploring alternatives to maximize stockholder value" and as a result had agreed to share financial data with certain parties.</p>
        <p>In the unusual insider trading case, the S.E.C. said, identity of the investors is protected by secrecy laws in Switzerland and Germany, where they placed the stock purchase orders through Swiss and German banks that maintained  accounts with United States broker-dealers.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. asked the banks through which the orders were placed whether their customers would consent to being identified, but the agency has received no response, said Tom Newkirk, an S.E.C. enforcement official.</p>
        <p>The brokers were Gruntal &amp; Company, the Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corporation and Commonwealth Associates, court papers show.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. contended that unknown persons bought 84,000 CBI shares two trading days before the Oct. 29 announcement by Praxair of its $32-a-share tender offer.</p>
        <p>The defendants stand to realize about $1.3 million from the illegal trades, the S.E.C. contended.</p>
