        <p>William Safire Op-Ed column says Democrats are so eager to regain White House and leadership in House and Senate that they are submerging their deeply rooted policy differences this election year; says they have embraced 9/11 commission's call for intelligence czar without stopping to ask important questions about hidden dangers in such an approach; says with dissent suppressed, a well-behaved convention can be expected (M)</p>

        <p>If anything can concentrate the mind of Democratic partisans, it is four interminable years suffering Republican leadership in the House, Senate and White House -- the political equivalent of service in the Siberian gulag.</p>
        <p>As a result, Democrats are assembling in Beantown for their most argument-free out-of-power convention in memory. Deeply rooted policy differences and personality clashes that provided all the excitement of lusty, newsworthy Democratic conventions past -- and that surely exist today -- have been submerged in the fervent desire of the Outs to Get Back In. The driving ideology is In-ism.</p>
        <p>That's why we see business executives strolling across the Commons arm in arm with the trial lawyers who are driving them out of business. And why Deaniacs are silently swallowing the new Kerry deference toward the principle of pre-emptive war. And why Clinton welfare reformers are willing to abandon hope of a Hillary Restoration next time around.</p>
        <p>All the traditional, internal party anger -- evoking derision as ''a firing squad lined up in a circle'' -- is now redirected outward. The party-unifying target is That Man in the White House and his coldblooded coterie of warmongering neocon homophobic tax cutters.</p>
        <p>Unaccountably, the only Democratic group left out in the cold by the Shrumbums (the affectionate sobriquet that Toots Shor would have applied to acolytes of Kerry's eloquence grise, Robert Shrum) is the tree-hugging set. Can you imagine a Democratic platform document without a single mention of global warming?</p>
        <p>I'm told that there was quite a struggle over that litmus-test phrase, but the smokestack set won out. That hands Ralph Nader an opening to exploit here in Boston. He will surely find the pragma-greens angry at him for being the skunk at the garden party and will use global warming to embarrass them, which is precisely what he needs to stir up a modicum of news-making controversy in this frozen sea of tranquillity.</p>
        <p>The legion of thumbsuckers who far outnumber delegates is certain that come the day after election -- no matter who wins -- the familiar intraparty scraps among slightly left, far left and whoopi left will break out again. That's a fair bet, but expect counterpressure to conform from the groupthink tanks.</p>
        <p>Consider the way the Boston Democrats have embraced the quick-fix of our intelligence weaknesses with an intelligence czar (or, not to be sexist, czarina). Perhaps misadvised by the inadverter whose nickname is now the same as the Clinton White House cat, John Kerry proposed this easy palliative months ago.</p>
        <p>With great fanfare, the 9/11 commission amplified that call for a super-spymaster. This rush to ''reform'' is stampeding otherwise sensible senators into writing a czarist bill to combine the spying techniques of secret surveillance with the law-enforcement power of the F.B.I., invading the unsuspected citizen's privacy under the rubric of fighting terrorism.</p>
        <p>With this fear-driven new groupthink spurred, booted and in the saddle, nobody at this convention stops to ask: Would John Kerry, if elected, be well served by a fixed-term, ''cabinet level official'' who does not serve, as other members of the cabinet do, ''at the pleasure of the president''? What if, in some crisis about pre-emption, they disagreed -- would the unelected official prevail? Who would really be in charge?</p>
        <p>And suppose one person had budget authority over intelligence-gathering and evaluation as well as F.B.I. investigations -- what would become of the rules of evidence that protect the innocent accused? What the czar wants, the czar gets -- and one day he could just as easily be a John Ashcroft as a Lee Hamilton.</p>
        <p>One looks in vain for a Democrat here in the Boston lovefest to break out of the groupthink enough to say: ''Hold on. In the spirit of the 9/11 bestseller, let's use our imagination to discern hidden dangers in unrestrained dot-connecting.'' Won't happen; in a time of fear, civil liberty butters no political parsnips.</p>
        <p>With dissent suppressed, we can expect a well-behaved convention. With ''values'' rhetorically devalued, no speech will be permitted without the words ''strong'' and ''respect.'' You can tune in with your children; there will be no breast-baring or breast-beating or frenzied Bush-bashing. Why? Because the angry Outs have been seized by In-ism.</p>
