        <p>The board of the New York League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, is deeply divided over whom to endorse in the Senate race, because its members say both candidates have strong positions on the environment.</p>
        <p>The league, unlike most environmental groups, has a history of supporting both Democratic and Republican candidates for political office.

        <p>The board of the New York League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, is deeply divided over whom to endorse in the Senate race, because its members say both candidates have strong positions on the environment.</p>
        <p>The league, unlike most environmental groups, has a history of supporting both Democratic and Republican candidates for political office. The group endorsed Vice President Al Gore in February, when he was still locked in a battle for the Democratic nomination. And in 1998, it endorsed Gov. George E. Pataki for re-election.</p>
        <p>''Usually there is a clear leader on the issues on one side or the other, but this is one of those times when you get what you really wish for: two candidates who are very concerned about the environment,'' said Sharon E. Soons, communications director for the league. ''It is one of those situations you wish for, but it is really hard when you get it.''</p>
        <p>Last night, Hillary Rodham Clinton attended a forum in Manhattan sponsored by the organization. It was supposed to be a debate on the environment -- and an opportunity for the 2,000-member group to get a better sense of the two candidates -- but Representative Rick A. Lazio declined to participate. His campaign said that he had decided not to attend debates dealing with single issues, choosing instead to face off against Mrs. Clinton on televised forums that cover a broad range of topics.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has won several major environmental endorsements, including ones from the Sierra Club and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer who co-founded the New York League of Conservation Voters. But even Mr. Lazio's absence may not be enough to secure backing for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The 40-member board is to meet privately with each candidate next Thursday and announce its endorsement then. Mr. Lazio, who has won praise for his efforts in Congress to restore Long Island Sound, has a strong following among some board members, league officials said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Soons said the league was always looking for Republicans with strong environmental records. She said it was disappointed when Mr. Lazio decided not to attend, noting that many board members considered his environmental record one of his strongest suits. Many environmentalists, Ms. Soons said, give Mr. Lazio the same praise they reserve for Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert of Utica, who is regarded as one of the party's most committed environmentalists.</p>
        <p>''We think the environment is a bipartisan issue,'' Ms. Soons said. ''We are always amazed that there are not more Republicans who are supportive.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio was criticized last night by league leaders for not showing up, while Mrs. Clinton was greeted with a standing ovation and shouts of approval from the audience of 700.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton acknowledged to the group that she was only now ''coming out'' on environmental issues, but she said her commitment was real and more sincere than Mr. Lazio's.</p>
        <p>''I will attempt to build on New York's proud tradition of environmental stewardship, a tradition launched by Teddy Roosevelt and carried forward by Bobby Kennedy and Pat Moynihan and Chuck Schumer,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, after visiting the Cherry Lane Elementary School in Suffern, N.Y., yesterday, said that his environmental record alone should merit an endorsement from the league, which has supported him in the past.</p>
        <p>''I have a record that in the past has won the highest rating from the League of Conservation Voters,'' said Mr. Lazio, who listed among his achievements a bill to study how to clean up Long Island Sound and fight the effects of acid rain in the Adirondacks. ''I'm very hopeful that they will base their endorsement on merit, and if that's the case, it's going to be a very easy choice for them.''</p>
        <p>In his address to the fourth, fifth  and sixth graders in the school gymnasium, Mr. Lazio, in a departure from his previous talks to students, made several references to his environmental record, sometimes using it in his examples to explain his job and the workings of Congress.</p>
        <p>''If I'm able to convince them, all my people in the leadership, to bring a bill to the floor, like a bill to clean up the Long Island Sound or an environmental bill, then it comes before the House,'' he said at one point.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton spoke to students at Brooklyn Law School and, in keeping with Mr. Gore's comments during Tuesday's debate, said voters should place great weight on the Supreme Court appointments the next president is likely to make and the next Senate will decide whether to confirm.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton pledged to vote against any nominee to the court who would overturn the abortion rights decision Roe v. Wade, which she said should be guarded in the same way that racial equality and free speech rights are. Mr. Lazio, who supports abortion rights, has said he would not disqualify a Supreme Court nominee based on his or her position on a single issue.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was asked by a reporter whether she invited guests to state dinners at the White House because they contributed to the Democratic Party. Undoubtedly, she said, there were guests at state dinners who were contributors, but she defended the invitations.</p>
        <p>''If you go back and look at events held at the White House, going back I would assume to the very beginning of our republic, you invite people who support you, you invite people who have a connection to what you are doing in the White House, you invite people who are making contributions to America in some way,'' she said. ''That is what we do.''</p>
