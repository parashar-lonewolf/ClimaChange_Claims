        <p>Demonstrators jeered Secretary of State Colin L. Powell today to protest the administration's environmental and foreign aid policies as the World Summit on Sustainable Development drew to a close.</p>
        <p>The 10-day event, involving representatives from more than 100 nations, concluded with sharply mixed reviews from its 40,000 participants, with some warmly praising and others harshly deriding efforts to stem global pollution and relieve poverty.</p>
        <p>The culmination of the meeting was an ''action plan'' that set broad timetables for improving sanitation, reducing chemical pollution and protecting endangered species through the coming two decades.</p>
        <p>There were also numerous pledges to protect rain forests, combat AIDS, expand education and ease hunger from an array of foundations, private companies and wealthy nations, including the United States.</p>
        <p>But many participants and observers complained that the talks failed to achieve significant results, with some contending the event was a step backward from the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</p>
        <p>In particular, the critics attacked the United States -- along with Canada, Japan and oil-producing states -- for blocking efforts to set firm timetables for reducing oil and gas consumption.</p>
        <p>''On climate change, they took a major step back from the Rio agreements 10 years ago,'' said Phil Clapp, president of National Environmental Trust. The Bush administration, he added, was part of ''an axis of oil.''</p>
        <p>The Johannesburg plan calls on nations to reduce by half the proportion of poor people who lack sanitation by 2015, to minimize health and environmental problems caused by chemical pollution by 2020 and to reduce significantly the number of endangered species by 2010.</p>
        <p>Secretary Powell, during his only day at the talks, endured the brunt of the criticism, having his 10-minute speech to the delegates interrupted twice by hecklers who chanted, ''Shame on Bush.'' Several of the two dozen protesters, many of them Americans, were escorted from the hall so that he could resume his address.</p>
        <p>There were also murmurs of protest inside the hall when Secretary Powell attacked Zimbabwe's government for rights abuses and criticized southern African countries for refusing American genetically engineered corn to help allay famine. Some European governments have raised health concerns about genetically altered grains, but the Bush administration contends the corn is safe.</p>
        <p>Secretary Powell used his speech to promote the administration's philosophy on foreign aid, which demands that developing nations end corruption, open their borders to trade and improve services in exchange for assistance. The program will increase foreign aid by 50 percent, to $15 billion a year, in three years, Secretary Powell said.</p>
        <p>''Official development aid alone is not enough,'' he said. Then, repeating the mantra of the Bush administration, he added, ''Trade is the engine of development.''</p>
        <p>The administration has also encouraged partnerships between governments and the private sector to underwrite environmental and poverty programs overseas. The secretary praised two partnerships today: one with Japan, to increase access to clean water, and another involving conservation groups and industrialized nations, to protect rain forests in the Congo River basin.</p>
        <p>''Essential to this approach is the realization that sustainable development is too big for any government alone,'' Secretary Powell said at an event for the Congo Basin partnership.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's approach to foreign aid, and the development meeting generally, has pleased American conservatives, who had urged Mr. Bush to avoid the event. But environmental groups raised concerns about recruiting private corporations to help finance environmental programs.</p>
        <p>''The corporate fox cannot continue to oversee the planet and people's health and the ecological sustainability of this world,'' said Michael Dorsey, a director of the Sierra Club. ''Partnerships, especially corporate partnerships, must be subject to an international framework of binding accountability.''</p>
        <p>In a news conference today, Secretary Powell called the talks a success, asserting that those taking part had articulated a ''shared vision'' for improving the planet.</p>
        <p>But even some of the organizers and most active promoters could muster only tepid praise.</p>
        <p>''Johannesburg is less visionary and more workmanlike, reflecting perhaps a feeling among many nations that they no longer want to promise the earth and fail, that they would rather step forward than run too fast,'' said Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.</p>
        <p>The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, put it this way: ''Obviously, this is not Rio.''</p>
