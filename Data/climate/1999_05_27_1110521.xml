        <p>IN the fall of 1998, the Newton Pride Committee, the volunteer beautification army for this grand old Boston suburb, took a quantum leap from planting tulips.</p>
        <p>''Leo Levi called me up and asked me if I wanted to do a wildflower project,'' said Dr. Richard Primack, a conservation biologist who loves to stalk pink lady-slippers and the elusive lousewort behind his house in Newton. ''Up until then, the committee had planted ornamentals.''</p>
        <p>And how. Since Mr. Levi, 84, started the pride committee more than a decade ago, hundreds of volunteers have planted more than a million bulbs, annuals and trees in public places around town -- at no cost to the city.</p>
        <p>''Not 5 cents on the tax dollar,'' said Mr. Levi, a retired pharmacist, who flips out when the bloodroot blooms in his garden. ''We support everything through plant sales.''</p>
        <p>But last fall, the committee decided to add wildflowers to the beautification of Newton. With the help of hundreds of schoolchildren and other volunteers, the group planted 1,200 last fall and 2,000 more this spring, tucking cardinal flowers and marsh marigolds along the marshy banks of streams, and columbine and black-eyed Susans along the paths of upland woods.</p>
        <p>''I think we all realized that the woods weren't the same as when we were kids,'' said Linda Simon, a retired medical researcher who is the leader of the wildflower committee. ''We remember seeing a lot more than we see now.''</p>
        <p>Over the last 10 years, Dr. Primack has been experimenting with the best ways to re-establish wildflower populations, from scattering seeds to planting mature specimens.</p>
        <p>''The rate of success with seeds is astonishingly low,'' Dr. Primack said, citing one project carried out in the late 1980's. ''We planted tens of thousands of seeds throughout Newton. Only three species produced seedlings. And we got new populations at only two sites.''</p>
        <p>Not much better, in other words, than wildflowers in a can.</p>
        <p>Planting mature specimens rather than seeds or seedlings had the best success rate, Dr. Primack found in a later study, in the early 1990's. Which seems like common sense, but it hasn't been documented in the literature, he said.</p>
        <p>''People would try to do one thing, like putting a lot of seeds out, or a lot of plants in one place, and they would die out in a year or two,'' Dr. Primack said. ''Or people would go back six months later to see if the plants were up, and never go back.''</p>
        <p>It's tedious work, with an abysmal success rate. Yet, here comes this wildflower committee willing to take his advice -- the worker-bee force of a scientist's wildest dreams.</p>
        <p>So Dr. Primack selects the best sites for planting various species, but unknowns make survival chances slim. ''You can plant 20 marsh marigolds in one place,'' he said, ''and 20 more in another place that looks the same, and one group will thrive, and the other die. There are subtleties of shading and sun. Some might be eaten by deer or rabbits.''</p>
        <p>The committee is mapping the exact location of every plant and keeping track of how many survive, the size of the plants, when they flower and fruit, how many offspring are produced. All this information gets entered in a database.</p>
        <p>One of Dr. Primack's graduate students, Mita Bhattacharya, counts the hours of work in every aspect of the project, and adds this to the cost of the plants to come up with a cost for the restoration project. ''What is the monetary cost, in other words, in trying to save this many plants?'' Ms. Bhattacharya said. ''The ultimate message, I hope, is that it's better to preserve than to restore.''</p>
        <p>At the moment, the wildflowers they're planting are not endangered.</p>
        <p>''But they represent important cultural aspects of Newton's history, and many people have never seen them,'' said Dr. Primack, who teaches plant ecology at Boston University. His book, ''Essentials of Conservation Biology'' (1993, Sinauer Associates), a key textbook in the field, has been translated into German, Japanese, Chinese and Indonesian.</p>
        <p>By their struggle to survive, wildflowers can teach us about our degraded habitat. ''Marsh marigolds are very sensitive to changes in hydrology,'' he said. ''If there is a lot of human movement or changes in the water patterns, they disappear very quickly.''</p>
        <p>One of the town's last wild populations of marsh marigolds has just finished flowering behind Dr. Primack's house, which sits on the edge of a stream that still nourishes cinnamon ferns, skunk cabbage, turtlehead, witch hazel and spicebush along its marshy banks.</p>
        <p>''There are many streams in Newton, but many have been diverted or put underground, so they won't flood houses,'' Dr. Primack said. ''So the flow is much weaker. Or the streams have been channelized, so where in the past were wide, marshy areas are now sharp edges and steep banks not suited to these flowers.''</p>
        <p>The town's earlier, agricultural past demolished millions of wildflowers as woods were cut for cropland and fields continuously plowed and cultivated. Then came the fine old Victorian houses and generous yards that still characterize Newton today. And then the explosion of development that accompanied the construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike and other major roads. And don't forget acid rain, nitrogen overload, lead in the soil and so on.</p>
        <p>As the pride committee's report says: ''Of the nearly 3,000 plant species native to New England, one in six is rare or endangered. And since 1776, more than 200 plants have become extinct in the United States.''</p>
        <p>One recent morning, Ms. Simon and Dr. Primack were staring at an ignominious little plant growing by the gray birch in the Hammond Woods. It looked like a fern. Or a weed. ''Canadian lousewort,'' Dr. Primack said. ''It has little flowers that look like the claws of body lice. This is the only one in the area. It comes up every year, but it's never spread.'' And it's incredible that nobody has sat on it.</p>
        <p>That afternoon, third graders from the Cabot School planted columbine in Edmands Park, a woods that rambles right behind the school.</p>
        <p>''We're separating the roots,'' Anabel Sanchez said, ''because they're all bundled up and you want them not bundled up, or they won't grow well.'' She set the plant into the hole she had dug, careful not to cover the crown.</p>
        <p>Martia Branch, a third grader at Cabot, led the way to her ''plot,'' a grassy knoll under an oak tree. ''We don't plant anything,'' she said. ''We just see what's there, we watch it. There's leaves that have some fungus. And my tree, my teacher said, is the oldest tree. It's an oak.''</p>
        <p>Her teacher, Penny Benjamin, has been teaching children in these woods for 37 years. And her former students often return, 15 years later, to see how high the pine tree in their plot has grown.</p>
        <p>Whether or not these youngsters will increase the wildflower population remains to be seen. ''Everybody talks about the tropical rainforest,'' Ms. Simon said, ''but deforestation is going on right here.'' In another woods, Mr. Levi was crowing over a bit of partridgeberry discovered, mere minutes from the highway.</p>
        <p>Who knows? This Newton beautification committee is a ferocious force of human nature. Perhaps there is  hope.</p>
