        <p>LEAD: PATTY FREEMAN DORSON is not unlike many other Americans trying to do their part when it comes to the environment.</p>

        <p>LEAD: PATTY FREEMAN DORSON is not unlike many other Americans trying to do their part when it comes to the environment.</p>
        <p>PATTY FREEMAN DORSON is not unlike many other Americans trying to do their part when it comes to the environment.</p>
        <p>She separates glass bottles from her family's trash so they can be recycled and asks for paper bags, rather than plastic, at the supermarket checkout counter.</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. Dorson, a 34-year-old Indianapolis lawyer, is confused about what else she can do to ''save the planet,'' particularly after she discovered that the more expensive ''photodegradable'' garbage bags she used to buy are no more beneficial to the environment than other kinds.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to know what to do,'' said Mrs. Dorson, whose husband, Roland, spent Earth Day planting lilies and raspberries in the backyard. ''It's all so overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>Earth Day 1990 has come and gone, and there is no question that a subtle but powerful change has taken place across the country in how Americans perceive the dangers facing the environment and what they are prepared to do to help. Survey after survey conducted in conjunction with Sunday's Earth Day festivities found that the environment ranks with unemployment and the economy as a major national concern. According to a recent New York Times/CBS poll, for example, 71 percent of Americans said they would be willing to pay higher taxes to clean the environment and 56 percent said they favored protecting the environment even if it meant a loss of jobs in their communities.</p>
        <p>But as debate continues over long-term solutions and confusion mounts about just how effective individuals can be, environmentalists and others say they are concerned that the public may become apathetic and disillusioned about the environment, as it did about the energy crisis.</p>
        <p>''What worries me is that people will say the heck with it and turn away,'' said Barry Commoner, one of the early leaders of the environmental movement and the author, most recently, of ''Making Peace with the Planet'' (Pantheon Books, $19.95).</p>
        <p>The problem is that now that Americans have been made aware of the staggering problems facing the environment and are actually taking steps to do their part, they want to be assured that their efforts have an impact. Claims by manufacturers trying to tap environmental concerns with promises that certain products are ''environmentally friendly'' when in fact many are no different from other products have added to the confusion. (Some manufacturers counter that they are helping to clarify the issue with such labels and that, compared to other products, theirs are indeed ''environmentally friendly.'') The confusion has been magnified by disagreement among scientists about solutions. The growing awareness, for example, that garbage buried in landfills does not decompose even after long periods has set off alarms with consumers, who feel they have been misled. So have conflicting claims over the biodegradibility of plastics.</p>
        <p>''We have a real sense of a need to be good to the environment and to do our part, but there is a real sense of confusion as to what our part is,'' said Dr. William L. Rathje, professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona and director of the Garbage Project, which has been digging up landfills across the country for the past 17 years in to determine just what happens to the nation's garbage over time. ''There is a crisis mentality that we have to act now. But we have no information on how to act.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Hardie, executive director of the Central States Glass Recycling Program, a nonprofit office providing information about recycling to communities in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, says confusion among scientists and conflicting commercial claims directly affect the public.</p>
        <p>''People want to do the right thing,'' Mr. Hardie said. ''But they don't know what the right thing is.''</p>
        <p>Amy Burger, a 40-year-old homemaker and mother of two living in Montclair, N.J., for example, is confused about whether any plastic in products she buys at her local grocery store is truly recyclable. (According to the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental organization in Washington, only 1 percent of all plastic produced in this country is actually recycled - despite many manufacturers' claims - because there are so few plastic recycling plants.) This misconception about plastics underscores an even larger misunderstanding about recycling. Just because a consumer sets aside paper, glass, aluminum cans or anything else for recycling does not necessarily mean that these goods are actually recycled. Barry J. Cutler, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the recycling of products depends largely on whether there are enough recycling plants available in a particular locale.</p>
        <p>Debbie Romano, a writer living in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, is confused about what commercially available cleaning products, if any, are ecologically sound. Some environmental groups urge boycotting all commercial cleansers and using only natural ingredients like vinegar and baking soda. A spokesman for the Clorox Corporation, which manufactures chlorine bleach and other cleaning products, countered by saying consumers should have a choice in such matters and should be made aware that certain chemicals in commercial cleansers serve as disinfectants as well as having other advantages.</p>
        <p>Rae Evenson, who works part time in her husband's dental office in Houston, Minn., is confused over recycling claims being made on packages of cups made of plastic foam. ''I'm trying to be conscientious,'' Mrs. Evenson said. ''But it's hard to know what to do.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Kelleher, recycling coordinator for the county where Mrs. Evenson lives, says the cups are not recycled. But when citizens in his community separate them out of the trash for recycling, Mr. Kelleher instructs his workers to pick them up because not to do so ''would be a slap in the face.'' The cups are sent to a landfill.</p>
        <p>For all of these Americans, daily life has become a balancing act between their desires to help the environment and their needs for personal convenience at a time when experts themselves disagree.</p>
        <p>There is sharp disagreement, for example, over whether recycling or making products biodegradable is the more appropriate avenue for the nation to pursue in solving the nation's solid waste crisis. So is the issue of creating additional landfills or using incinerators. Overwhelmed, perhaps, by these larger issues as well as by such cosmic notions as saving the rain forest or repairing the damaged ozone layer, many Americans nevertheless seem to be making their peace with the issues, adopting behavior they hope will ultimately prove beneficial.</p>
        <p>It was not until she became pregnant last year, for example, that Mrs. Dorson of Indianapolis had to come to terms with disposable diapers. Despite her desire to help reduce the nation's solid waste, Mrs. Dorson decided in favor of the disposable diapers for convenience. There is some thought that cloth diapers present other dangers to the environment if they are washed in certain strong detergents, but Mrs. Dorson says she still feels guilty about her decision and, to compensate, she now drives five miles a week to take her glass bottles and aluminum cans to the nearest recycling plant.</p>
        <p>''It seems like such a small thing,'' Mrs. Dorson said. ''But at least it's something. It does help your conscience.''</p>
        <p>In Montclair Mrs. Burger, who on Earth Day took her family to church where the congregation planted a tree, buys orange juice in cartons at her supermarket and then transfers the juice at home into reusable plastic jugs to reduce her use of plastics. She no longer uses paper napkins or plastic eating utensils in an attempt to teach her children that ''less is more.''</p>
        <p>''It is the little things,'' Mrs. Burger said, adding that only by reducing the amount of garbage consumers produce can the country ever gain mastery over its solid waste problem. ''It is how you lead your daily life more than telling the children. You're doing it. You're living it.'' Richard Denison, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, which has helped encourage such consumer awareness, said, ''Everyone can take a small step.''</p>
        <p>But it is just these small gestures that other environmentalists, like Mr. Commoner, say offer Americans a false sense of accomplishment.</p>
        <p>''It confuses feeling good with having an influence on the problem,'' Mr. Commoner said, arguing that the real power individuals wield is not at their garbage cans but rather in their banding together to demand changes in corporate boardrooms, in much the same way that individuals and groups refused to buy tuna and forced major companies to change the way fish are caught.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mrs. Romano of Brooklyn took her family to the beach for Earth Day. She took along four paper bags so that she, her husband and their three children, could do their part for the day by helping to clean up the beach. But when they arrived at the beach at Jacob Riis Park in Brooklyn, it was so filthy with debris that they just turned around and left without picking up so much as a can.</p>
        <p>''There was too much to do,'' said Mrs. Romano, expressing the kind of frustration many Americans feel in the face of such large-scale environmental problems.</p>
        <p>As for the future, most experts agree that much will depend on what course the Government ultimately takes on solid waste disposal. Research continues, but in the meantime some fear that the public may turn its attention to other things.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately it will depend on the nation's leadership,'' said Dr. Theodore Roszak, a social historian at California State University at Hayward and the author of ''Where the Wasteland Ends'' (Celestial Arts, $14.95). ''Otherwise all this interest in the environment could be a fad that will come and go.''</p>
