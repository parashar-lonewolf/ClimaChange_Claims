        <p>Sounding very much like the candidate he was and may become again, Al Gore said today that the environment was a moral issue and the Bush administration was giving ''policy payoffs to polluters.''</p>
        <p>''Our environment is under siege,'' Mr. Gore, the former vice president, said in an Earth Day speech here to 400 students at Vanderbilt University. ''The Bush administration has chosen to serve the special interests instead of the public interests and subsidize the obsolete failed approaches of the past instead of the exciting new solutions of the future. Instead of ensuring that our water is clean to drink, they thought that maybe there wasn't enough arsenic in the drinking water.''</p>
        <p>He criticized the Clear Skies initiative that Mr. Bush was promoting today in the Adirondacks, saying that it ''actually allows more toxic mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur pollution than if we enforced the laws on the books today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not respond to Mr. Gore's remarks. ''Hadn't paid attention to him,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>In his half-hour speech, Mr. Gore revisited the election of 2000, taking issue with comments made by Ari L. Fleischer, the White House spokesman, who said in response to an opinion article by Mr. Gore in The New York Times on Sunday that the environment was a reason that Mr. Bush ''defeated Al Gore in the election of 2000.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, sounding more amused than bruised, rose to the bait. ''Now, I didn't bring up the election of 2000,'' he said. ''I put that behind me. They want to keep talking about it. So let me just say a word. When they say that the American people endorsed their approach to the environment in 2000, there are two things wrong with that charge.</p>
        <p>''No. 1, they are overlooking the fact that during the campaign then-candidate Bush himself pledged to bring about a reduction in greenhouse gases. Of course, the day after he took his oath of honor and integrity, he made that his very first broken promise.</p>
        <p>''Now the second thing that's wrong with this, and as I said, I've put this behind me long since -- but refresh my memory a little bit -- did a majority of the American people endorse his policies in the election? He won the election and he is our president, but he ought to be a little bit more careful about claiming that a majority of the voters endorsed his policy payoffs to polluters who pressured him to break his promises to the public.''</p>
        <p>The otherwise respectful audience erupted in applause at Mr. Gore's unspoken reminder that he won more popular votes than Mr. Bush but lost the electoral vote after the deadlock in Florida.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's words were noticeably sharper than much of the language he used in the presidential campaign. Leaders of various environmental groups, which endorsed him in 2000, said they welcomed Mr. Gore's return to environmental issues but also expressed disappointment that he had not used them more to his advantage in his campaign.</p>
        <p>The executive director of the National Environmental Trust, Phillip Clapp, said he believed that Mr. Gore wanted to make a strong statement because the environment was his signature issue and a way to reconnect with voters.</p>
        <p>''If there's one issue the American public associates with Al Gore, it's the environment,'' Mr. Clapp said. ''If you want to reconnect with the public and with your constituency, your best place to do it is on the issue they know you care about. But it would be nice if it also came with a recognition on his part that he misread the importance of the issue in 2000.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Clapp's view, Mr. Gore's neglect of the environmental issue opened the way for Ralph Nader to run as the green candidate, which drained crucial votes from Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore invited Ralph Nader to the party,'' Mr. Clapp said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore today called for a change in course in energy policy, which he said was too dependent on imported oil and dictated by officials who joined the administration from the energy industry.</p>
        <p>''The Bush-Cheney energy policies leave us at the mercy of a region that's racked with violence and instability, now more than ever,'' Mr. Gore declared. He ridiculed the administration's proposal to drill for oil in Alaska as a response to American dependence on foreign oil and saluted Senate Democrats for defeating that proposal, even though some of them may compete against Mr. Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said that his vision on the environment was right all along and that others were just beginning to catch up.</p>
        <p>In the campaign, Mr. Bush and other critics critics liked to remind automobile workers and others that Mr. Gore had once said he hoped that new technologies could replace the internal combustion engine. Today, Mr. Gore seemed to have the last laugh, as he told the audience:</p>
        <p>''Even the Republican governor of Michigan is now calling for a replacement for the internal combustion engine. That has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?''</p>
