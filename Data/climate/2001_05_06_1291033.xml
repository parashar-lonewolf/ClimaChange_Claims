        <p>What a difference a few years make. In ''The Next Generation: Energy's Future on L.I.'' [April 29] the LIPA chairman, Richard Kessel, envisions solar energy providing 10 percent of Long Island's energy needs in 10 years. He has also stated that at least two new natural gas power plants need to be constructed.</p>
        <p>A power plant was constructed that could have been producing more then 800 megawatts of electricity. It would have produced no greenhouse gases or acid rain and would have released less radioactive particles then a comparable sized coal- or oil-powered plant. But Mr. Kessel and others assured us that such a power plant was not necessary, that we had all the power we needed for the foreseeable future. This plant was, of course, the Shoreham nuclear power plant.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has been supplying electricity without hurting one American for more than 40 years. I am all in favor of renewable electric sources like wind and solar power. Such renewable sources may not be able to provide us with the all power we need in a reliable manner. We should consider nuclear power, not only to supply more energy, but as a replacement for current plants that use fossil fuels.</p>
