        <p>The labs at Connecticut College were busy this summer, but the scientists operating the microscopes, lasers and computers did not hold Ph.D.'s. In fact, most of them have not yet earned their bachelor's degrees.</p>
        <p>With their costs covered by stipends and grants from public and private sources, 29 undergraduates at the coeducational liberal arts college spent 10 weeks conducting scientific research firsthand. Working individually or in teams with faculty mentors, the student scientists continued experiments originated by Connecticut College professors.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Adams, a senior chemistry major from Lyndhurst, Ohio, furthered research that she began in the program last summer, searching for biochemical causes of cystic fibrosis.</p>
        <p>Alexi Carayannopoulos, a senior English major from Winchester, Mass., studied what makes fireflies glow and is awaiting the results of Pfizer Inc.'s analysis on his findings.</p>
        <p>Scott Pearsall, a senior zoology major from North Haven, Conn., worked on determining the DNA sequence of embryonic glyceral phosphate dihydrogenase, an enzyme that regulates carbohydrate metabolism. Such information could provide scientists with a clearer understanding of prenatal development, he said. Other Research Projects</p>
        <p>During the program, which ended on Aug. 9, other undergraduates researched lake acidity, osmotic regulation in marine sponges, the endangered yellow-breasted chat and rising marsh sea levels.</p>
        <p>The projects were not limited to natural science. Miriam Fendel, a senior psychology major from Huntington, L.I., was part of a team expanding the player capacity of a computerized music program created by Bridget Baird, a Connecticut College mathematics professor. With faculty support, many of the students will continue their experimentation in the fall semester and expect to publish the results in national scientific journals, or, in the case of computer research, help to market the product.</p>
        <p>In the program's first two summers, the students' stipends and research costs have been covered by grants from public and private sources. Until now, however, the research positions have not been guaranteed. With announcement this month of a $175,000 grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation of Los Angeles, Claire Gaudiani, the college's president, has pledged her administration's commitment to the establishment of a permanent student research program.</p>
        <p>Matching the Keck grant with a $200,000 endowment and planning to raise an additional $625,000, Connecticut College will set up the Keck Undergraduate Science Program this fall, Ms. Gaudiani said. The guidelines require students to earn 10 credits in an academic year and summer research on a self-designed project, give a formal oral presentation of their work and publish a paper in the college's in-house journal. 'So Much Different'</p>
        <p>Dr. Gaudiani has dubbed the undergraduate research "Science as discovery, not science as cookbook," and the students said they believe that the hands-on experience has given them a fresh perspective.</p>
        <p>"Until now, I've done all book science," Mr. Carayannopoulos said. "It's so much different than lab science."</p>
        <p>Unlike many universities with large research labs, Connecticut College has no graduate students or teaching assistants in its labs. Undergraduates perform all tasks and have direct access to faculty scientists. "From a student's standpoint, the major benefit, and the major difficulty, is that they deal directly with the faculty member," said Bruce Branchini, chairman of the chemistry department.</p>
        <p>Stephen Loomis, professor of zoology, added: "As the nation faces a shrinking pool of science graduates, many private institutions are invigorating their programs and student interest by shifting the emphasis to firsthand research opportunities. The vanguard of the movement for undergraduate research is small liberal arts colleges."</p>
        <p>The changing nature of science education at the college has already led one undergraduate to move in a more scientific direction. Inspired by her work on cystic fibrosis, Elizabeth Adams, who originally planned to earn a medical degree, has changed her goal to lab research. "I'm really happy in the lab," she said. "I'd much rather do research."</p>
