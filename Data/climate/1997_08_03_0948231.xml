        <p>RARELY has a movie villain emerged as triumphant and as smugly self-satisfied in his malevolence as he does in the form of Chad in the film, ''In the Company of Men.'' Like Iago in Shakespeare's ''Othello,'' Chad comes across less as a flawed man than as an embodiment of pure evil, updated as a sinister corporate climber, racist and misogynist who destroys souls for sport. The film won an award at the Sundance Film Festival, and many critics have applauded its raw, if unappealing, ferocity.</p>
        <p>Corporate Macho</p>
        <p>A movie for the 90's? Of late many films have struggled to tap the cultural zeitgeist by tossing in dashes of relevance. ''Waterworld'' addressed global warming; ''Disclosure'' grappled with sexual harassment. But in ''In the Company of Men,'' the characters are the antithesis of contemporary notions of correctness, driven by corporate competition -- and many critics seem to love it.</p>
        <p>Chad savagely betrays a deaf woman he has ensnared, and then his best friend. His comeuppance? He gets the promotion he has been seeking and settles in with his lovely girlfriend. Redemption? Forget it. The corporation he serves is perhaps the biggest villain in the piece, and it just grinds forward.</p>
        <p>The film's 34-year-old screenwriter and director, Neil LaBute, is basking in unusual publicity for a first-time film maker. His movie, which cost a modest $250,000, was praised by Andrew Sarris in The New York Observer as ''one of the best and most disciplined films of the year.'' Referring to Mr. LaBute, Mr. Sarris said, ''He may even be able to get by without a heart.''</p>
        <p>Jack Mathews of Newsday was so troubled, though, that he called the film ''a vile, morally empty piece of business,'' comparing it to watching a rape and doing nothing to stop it.</p>
        <p>Camille Paglia, the critic and essayist, said she had not seen the film but had heard much about it and was upset at what appeared to be its simplistic depiction of Chad's sadism. She argued that, though the film appeared to be flouting conventions of behavior with its depiction of Chad as extreme in his remorseless evil, the film was actually politically correct. ''True tragedy cannot depend on something so manipulative as the suffering of a child or people who are maimed,'' she said, referring to the deaf woman. ''The deck is stacked. I'm impatient with that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaBute defended himself against the charge that his film is irresponsible toward women. ''I think this is an intensely moral film,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''But it's a bit pretentious to suggest that things will always right themselves. If the audience wants that world to be right, if they need it so badly, they'll have to do that work.''</p>
        <p>Michael Barker, the co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, the film's distributor, has also had to defend himself. ''One publicist told me, 'I can't work on this movie. Aren't you worried about your reputation?' '' he said. ''But what I've found is that the people who are the most positive about this film are women.''</p>
        <p>Like 'Carnal Knowledge'</p>
        <p>The film revolves around a scheme in which Chad and his best friend, Howard, seek revenge against women with a plot to woo and then dump a deaf typist in their office.</p>
        <p>''Women, nice ones, the most frigid of the race,'' Chad says, bristling and barely coherent. ''Doesn't matter in the end. Inside they're all the same, meat and gristle and hatred.''</p>
        <p>''Sure,'' Howard responds.</p>
        <p>But the aim, Mr. LaBute acknowledged, is partly to show what skewed these characters -- their jobs. Ultimately, their deception is part of Chad's scheme to leapfrog over Howard in the corporate hierarchy. The sensibility is similar to some films from the 1960's, he said, including the anti-capitalist satire ''Putney Swope'' and the darkly misogynistic ''Carnal Knowledge.'' By contrast, more recent movies like ''Disclosure,'' in which a woman sexually harasses a man, show the corporation as a trap filled with inequities, but good still wins out.</p>
        <p>Not for Mr. LaBute. The company that Chad and Howard work for is has no name, exists in no discernible place and even its product is never mentioned, all of which accentuate its evil. The characters' suffocatingly dull lives are a hell of reports, presentations and deadlines with no clear purpose.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to come off like a Karl Marx,'' he said, ''but I'm suspicious of anything that uses people en masse and takes what's good about them and filters them into cubicles and removes questioning and ideas.''</p>
        <p>Chad is a pure product of the modern corporate ethos, suggesting that everyone is a victim.  ''He's a straight line,'' Mr. LaBute said. ''I'm not even sure he's angry at anything. It's personified evil. He's a cipher in the end. I don't know what's driving him.''</p>
