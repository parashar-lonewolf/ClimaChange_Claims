        <p>U.N. Admits Mishandling Video of Arab Guerrillas  The United Nations said misjudgments and deliberate evasions had occurred in its handling of videotape related to the kidnapping of three Israeli soldiers last October by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters. But investigators said the tape did not have information about the kidnapping itself or shed light on the soldiers' condition. Israel's ambassador expressed satisfaction with the inquiry.</p>

        <p>Senate Democrats Yield On Farm Aid Legislation  The Senate's Democratic leaders bowed to a White House veto threat and approved a farm aid bill that was $2 billion less than they wanted. President Bush welcomed the voice vote on the $5.5 billion bill as ''a victory for our nation's farmers at a time when they need it the most.''</p>

        <p>Bipartisan Alliance on Climate  Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, joined forces to warn that the nation's isolation from a global warming pact could hurt business as well as the environment and said they wanted to guide the nation toward mandatory limits on greenhouse gases.</p>

        <p>Bush Rates Bush  The president, setting off on a monthlong vacation in Texas, said enactment of a tax cut and improved prospects for final legislation defining patients' rights had proved he could end ''deadlock and drift'' in the nation's capital. Some Democrats disputed that assessment, saying Mr. Bush favored bipartisan imagery over bipartisan policy making.</p>

        <p>Cheney Rejects Files Request  Vice President Dick Cheney, citing constitutional grounds, declined to turn over certain documents sought by Congress in an inquiry into how the Bush administration's energy policy was formed.</p>

        <p>Iran Told to Pay Hostage's Kin  A federal judge ruled that Iran should pay $314.6 million to the family of the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest held hostage in Lebanon by Islamic radicals for nearly 19 months in the 1980's. The suit was filed by the estate of Father Jenco, who died of cancer in Illinois in 1996, and by his siblings.</p>

        <p>Bar to Executing the Retarded  Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, a Democrat, plans to sign legislation barring the execution of mentally retarded people, his office said. That would make North Carolina the fifth state to enact such legislation this year. A person is considered mentally retarded under the North Carolina measure if his I.Q. is below 70 and he has significant difficulty in performing basic functions.</p>

        <p>Hevesi Hopes to Preserve Parts of Giuliani Legacy  Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller and a Democrat, said in an interview that if he were elected mayor he would offer ''the best of Rudy Giuliani without the worst.'' He said he would work to continue driving crime down but would also work to curb police misconduct. Saying public education had been long neglected, he said he would press for smaller classes. And he said he would use city money to create a trust fund to build more affordable housing.</p>

        <p>Tougher Museum Rules Urged  Mayor Giuliani, displeased with efforts of the panel he appointed to assess standards for art museums, was said to be pressing for stronger language to impair the museums' ability to show work considered profane.</p>

        <p>U.S. Still Losing Jobs  Private-sector payrolls fell by 73,000 jobs in July, similar to the pace of recent months. But unemployment, calculated from separate data, held steady for the second month in a row, at 4.5 percent. Manufacturers -- which often provide a glimpse of where the economy is heading -- cut their fewest number of jobs in 10 months, while layoffs rose in the larger service sector.</p>
