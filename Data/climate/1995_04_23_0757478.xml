        <p>A NATURAL HISTORY OF NATURE WRITING. By Frank Stewart. Shearwater/Island Press. Cloth, $32.50; paper, $16.95. In this deft celebration of nature writing from Thoreau to Edward Abbey, an essayist and poet demonstrates how profoundly the genre has influenced American literature and our national character.</p>
        <p>ECOPSYCHOLOGY: Restoring the Earth, Healing the Mind. Edited by Theodore Roszak, Mary E. Gomes and Allen D. Kanner. Sierra Club. Paper, $15 (June). It isn't simply the scramble for profits that leads to environmental devastation, and laws alone won't alter our exploitive behavior, the psychologists and scholars in this collection say. Their essays, ranging from the persuasive to the airily speculative, probe for the root of our often destructive attitudes toward nature.</p>
        <p>THE PRAIRIE KEEPERS: Secrets of the Grasslands. By Marcy Houle. Addison-Wesley. $20. Even a modest landscape can harbor a complex mix of species, as a wildlife biologist discovered when she set out to investigate one patch of prairie in Oregon. This lively record of the delicate ways humans alter seemingly untouched ground is a particularly effective portrait of an ecosystem.</p>
        <p>LET THE MOUNTAINS TALK, LET THE RIVERS RUN: Prescriptions for Our Planet. By David Brower with Steve Chapple. HarperCollins. $20. Partial victories and piecemeal efforts won't work, according to the dean of American conservationists, who argues in a series of salty, often very personal monologues that nothing less than a worldwide crusade of environmental restoration can avert the collapse of modern society.</p>
        <p>A YEAR IN THE MAINE WOODS. By Bernd Heinrich. William Patrick/Addison-Wesley. $22. A writer and zoologist tells of four seasons in a cabin in a Northern forest. These passionate observations of a place "where the subtle matters and the spectacular distracts" superbly mix memoir and science.</p>
        <p>THE FUTURE OF THE ENVIRONMENT: Ecological Economics and Technological Change. By Faye Duchin and Glenn-Marie Lange with Knut Thonstad and Annemarth Idenburg. Oxford University. $29.95. The bottom line in this application of economic principles to the environment is that present plans for recycling, fuel efficiency and pollution abatement don't do enough.</p>
        <p>THE TRUE STATE OF THE PLANET. Edited by Ronald Bailey. Free Press. Paper, $15. In one of the few books timed for Earth Day that argue that things may not be as bad as they seem, researchers conclude that the perils of deforestation and global warming are exaggerated but the oceans are in trouble.</p>
        <p>ECOLOGICAL IDENTITY: Becoming a Reflective Environmentalist. By Mitchell Thomashow. MIT. $25. This attempt to cool hostilities between the tree huggers and the enviro-bashers explores the spiritual benefits of activism.</p>
        <p>ECOCIDE OF NATIVE AMERICA: Environmental Destruction of Indian Lands and Peoples. By Donald A. Grinde and Bruce E. Johansen. Clear Light. $24.95. A terse report on the contamination of Indian reservations by industrial waste and radiation also argues that the Indian philosophy of sustainable land use is the model for the future.</p>
        <p>EARTH WARRIOR: Overboard With Paul Watson and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. By David B. Morris. Fulcrum. Paper, $14.95. This admiring chronicle of the wars of the Sea Shepherd II and its captain against Pacific drift-net fleets presents Paul Watson, a founder of Greenpeace, as "a cross between St. Francis and Rambo."</p>
        <p>BUT IS IT TRUE? A Citizen's Guide to Environmental Health and Safety Issues. By Aaron Wildavsky. Harvard University. $30 (May). Global warming. Acid rain. Ozone holes. Just how much are we really at risk? This careful analysis of the evidence concludes that aside from ozone depletion, claims of imminent catastrophe are "mostly false, unproven or negligible."</p>
        <p>THE NEW ECOLOGICAL ORDER. By Luc Ferry. Translated by Carol Volk. University of Chicago. Cloth, $34.95; paper, $14.95 (July). A professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne dissects the influential theory of "deep ecology," which asserts that even trees and rocks should be granted legal rights to protect nature from humans. He finds it irrational and antidemocratic.</p>
