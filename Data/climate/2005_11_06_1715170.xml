        <p>FIRST MAN</p>
        <p>The Life of Neil A. Armstrong.</p>
        <p>By James R. Hansen.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 769 pp. Simon &amp; Schuster. $30.</p>
        <p>SHORTLY after 9/11, I traveled to Houston with the historian Stephen E. Ambrose to conduct interviews with Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, for the official NASA oral history. I considered it an honor. Armstrong had been a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952, and had flown 78 combat missions over the Korean peninsula in a Grumman F9F-2 Panther. (James Michener, reporting on the Korean War for The Saturday Evening Post, was so impressed with the derring-do of Armstrong and his fellow aviators from the carrier Essex, that he profiled the squadron in his novel ''The Bridges at Toko-Ri''). When I asked Armstrong about the Air Medal and Gold Star he earned in Korea, however, he froze, saying they were ''unimportant.'' Asked later if he had ever moon-gazed in the days before the Apollo 11 liftoff, Armstrong scoffed, ''No. I never did that.''</p>
        <p>The 75-year-old Armstrong has become our nation's most bashful Galahad. While his space feats appear in American history textbooks, he could walk into any Wal-Mart or Neiman Marcus and not be recognized. Disdainful of the modern news media -- and insistent on not commercializing his ''moon walk'' -- Armstrong lives on a farm near Lebanon, Ohio, with his second wife, far from the autograph hounds. (Charles Lindbergh, who befriended Armstrong before his moon flight, warned him about the pitfalls of fame.) Armstrong is not, however, a hermit. He often delivers scientific papers like ''New Knowledge of the Earth From Space Exploration'' and ''The Ozone Layer Controversy'' at international conferences. And, as it turns out, he was cooperating with James R. Hansen, a professor of history at Auburn University. Hansen interviewed Armstrong for 50 hours in preparing ''First Man,'' a fine authorized biography brimming with groundbreaking research, fresh anecdotes and fair-minded analysis.</p>
        <p>Armstrong's home state, Ohio, had an immense formative influence on him. His father, Stephen Armstrong, worked for the Ohio Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Public Offices, which required him to hopscotch around the state like an itinerant plumber. Although Neil was born in Wapakoneta (on Aug. 5, 1930), his boyhood was one long truck odyssey, with stints in Lisbon, Warren, Ravenna, Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, Jefferson, Moulton, St. Marys and Upper Sandusky, then back to Wapakoneta. ''In these genuine Smallvilles,'' Hansen writes, ''young people -- with the right kind of family and community support -- grew up embracing ambition.''</p>
        <p>At 10, Neil -- who was shy but strong-willed -- got his first job, cutting grass in a cemetery, and became a Boy Scout leader. Hansen, in fact, points out that out of the 294 candidates selected to be NASA astronauts between 1959 and 2003, over 200 had been active in Scouting (and 11 of the 12 astronauts to moonwalk were scouts). Meanwhile, Hansen dispels a number of falsehoods that circulated at the time of Apollo 11 about Armstrong's youth. He never studied the galaxy from his neighbor Jacob Zint's telescope. He had not read about the Wright Brothers in the first grade. But it was true that he flew in a Ford trimotor when he was 5 or 6, built exquisite model airplanes and had a recurring dream. ''I could, by holding my breath, hover over the ground,'' Armstrong recalls of these nighttime reveries. ''I neither flew nor fell in those dreams; I just hovered.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong got a student pilot's certificate on his 16th birthday. Weeks later he was soaring solo over Ohio farmscapes. By the time he enrolled in Purdue University, aeronautical engineering was his obsession. But his college studies were interrupted by the Korean War, and the amateur aviator became a bona fide American fighter pilot. ''The great airplanes I had so revered as a boy were disappearing,'' Armstrong told Hansen. ''I had grown up admiring what I perceived to be the chivalry of the World War I pilots -- Frank Luke, Eddie Rickenbacker, Manfred von Richthofen and Billy Bishop. But by World War II, aerial chivalry seemed to have evaporated. . . . Air warfare was becoming very impersonal. The record-setting flights -- [John] Alcock and [A. W.] Brown, [Harold] Gatty, [Charles] Lindbergh, [Amelia] Earhart and [Jimmy] Mattern -- across the oceans, over the poles and to the corners of Earth, had all been accomplished. And I resented that.''</p>
        <p>But the moon? That was virgin territory. Most of ''First Man'' recounts, often in exacting slide-rulerish detail, how Armstrong worked his way to become a moon-bound astronaut. As a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California, Armstrong made over 900 flights in a wide range of models, even going hypersonic in a North American X-15. Clearly he possessed what Tom Wolfe called ''the right stuff.'' (Shockingly, Hansen claims that Chuck Yeager, Wolfe's cockpit ace, exaggerated his own heroics in his 1985 autobiography.) A turning point in Armstrong's life came in 1962 when his young daughter died of an inoperable brain tumor. ''People who knew Armstrong well,'' Hansen notes, ''indicated that Neil never once over the years brought up the subject of his daughter's illness and death.'' A few months after Karen Anne Armstrong's demise, her father signed up to be an astronaut.</p>
        <p>Using NASA records, Hansen superbly reconstructs the Gemini 8 mission (March 16, 1966) when Armstrong performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space. His reputation for sheer technical competence became legendary at Johnson Space Center in Texas. According to Chris Kraft, the chief of flight operations in Houston, Armstrong was tapped ''first man'' over Edwin ''Buzz'' Aldrin, one of his sidekicks on Apollo 11, because, ''Neil was Neil. Calm, quiet and absolute confidence. We all knew that he was the Lindbergh type. He had no ego.'' A disappointed Aldrin grew increasingly resentful that he had not been chosen. Hansen, though, takes Armstrong's side in the lingering ''first man'' squabble.</p>
        <p>One debate that Hansen straddles regards Armstrong's phrase ''That's one small step for [a] man. One giant leap for mankind.'' While Armstrong claims that those dramatic words came to him eureka-style while sitting in the Eagle landing craft on the lunar surface, Hansen offers other possible variations. Some Apollo 11 buffs speculate, for example, that ''The Hobbit,'' by J. R. R. Tolkien, was an influence on Armstrong because of the line ''not a great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark.'' This theory is given further credence because after leaving NASA in 1971 Armstrong named his farm Rivendell, a site in Tolkien's ''Lord of the Rings.'' Then there is an April 19, 1969, internal NASA memorandum that suggested Armstrong or Aldrin declare a ''forward step for all mankind.'' On the morning of Armstrong's walk, Walter Cronkite talked about ''a giant leap,'' echoing President Dwight Eisenhower's 1957 post-Sputnik call for ''a giant leap into outer space.'' These coincidences have led to a widespread rumor that NASA had scripted the immortal words; they didn't. When presented with all this, Armstrong shrugged. ''You never know subliminally in your brain where things come from,'' he says. ''But it certainly wasn't conscious. When an idea runs for the first time through your own mind, it comes out as an original thought.''</p>
        <p>Regrettably, there are no color photographs of Armstrong walking on the moon: Aldrin did not snap a single one. But we do have 842 pounds of rock from the different space missions that still haven't been properly analyzed. This scientific neglect is not surprising. While millions of Americans were glued to their television sets back in July 1969, the historic moon walk has evolved into a retro spectacle with little contemporary currency. And Neil Armstrong, once the most sought-after interview in the world, has virtually disappeared from the public eye. If nothing else, Hansen should be commended for decoding the enigmatic Armstrong: a space hero short on words but sky-high on Midwestern integrity.</p>

        <p>Correction:  November 6, 2005, Sunday  A review on Page 26 of the Book Review today, about ''First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong,'' by James R. Hansen, misstates the location of Mr. Armstrong's current home. According to Mr. Hansen, Mr. Armstrong lives in a suburb of Cincinnati, deliberately unidentified in the book, not on a farm near Lebanon, Ohio.</p>
