        <p>LEAD: The Governors of New York and Ohio, two states that have been on opposite sides of a fierce debate over reducing acid rain, have agreed on a joint proposal to require steep reductions nationwide in pollution from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources over the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>The Governors of New York and Ohio, two states that have been on opposite sides of a fierce debate over reducing acid rain, have agreed on a joint proposal to require steep reductions nationwide in pollution from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources over the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>The proposal for new Federal acid rain legislation, which could represent a breakthrough in a long deadlock in Congress, was reached after a year of negotiations between Governor Cuomo and Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, assisted by their aides.</p>
        <p>The agreement would raise about $900 million a year to pay about half the anticipated cost of compliance and to help the polluting states meet the anti-pollution goals. More than two-thirds of the $900 million would be paid by the oil industry, the other third by the Federal Government. An additional $900 million would be paid by polluters.</p>
        <p>The plan differs in several respects from pending legislation in Congress that is backed by states that suffer from acid rain pollution and opposed by states where much of the pollution originates. Leading the battle over that legislation have been New York, a major victim of the pollution, and Ohio, where plants emit more sulfur dioxide, an important source of acid rain, than any other state.</p>
        <p>Compared with the pending legislation, the new compromise would require a smaller reduction in pollutants that produce acid rain. It lengthens the period for reaching anti-pollution goals and provides innovative techniques by which the nation would share costs of compliance, including a device for providing revenue from an expanded Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>Governors Cuomo and Celeste said in telephone interviews over the weekend that they would ask members of Congress from their states to introduce their proposal as amendments to the Clean Air Act. They expressed hope that the agreement would clear the way for a breakthrough after an impasse of nearly a decade.</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo called the plan ''a reasonable and imaginative effort to resolve our differences and solve the problem of acid rain.'' He said he would ''push hard'' to achieve a national program to deal with the issue.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of lakes in the Adirondack Mountains in New York have become acidified by the pollution, much of which is believed to come from coal-fired electric power plants in Midwestern states such as Ohio.</p>
        <p>Ohio and other Midwestern states with large coal-fired power plants have opposed acid rain controls because they feared sharply higher electric rates and loss of jobs in mining industries that produce a great deal of coal with a high sulfur content.</p>
        <p>Governor Celeste said today that ''if the folks in New York and Ohio can find a common ground, it may well serve as a guidepost for the rest of the nation.''</p>
        <p>New York's two Senators, Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato, praised the agreement and said they would introduce legislation to implement it. Governors Wanted Settlement</p>
        <p>Governor Celeste said the more strict legislation pending in Congress was like a ''sword of Damocles'' hanging over electric utilities and other industry in Ohio because it would impose a heavy cost. He also wanted a settlement because many companies in Ohio have held off on long-range investment plans because of uncertainty over how the issue would be resolved.</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo, who has long sought strong legislation to reduce acid rain damage to New York, is willing to accept a program somewhat less stringent than pending legislation, that would take longer to implement and that would cost New Yorkers more, because it has a better chance of approval.</p>
        <p>The most prominent of the acid rain legislation already in Congress was introduced by Senator George Mitchell of Maine. It has wide support but its chances are questionable because it also has serious opposition, including that of the majority leader, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Mr. Byrd considers the Mitchell legislation, which would require businesses to pay the cost of acid rain control, a threat to his state's coal industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell today said he would have to examine the New York-Ohio bill to see whether it was fair and sufficient, but he called the proposal ''encouraging,'' and commended Governor Celeste for what he said was ''political courage.'' He said that the proposal should help get a bill enacted this year.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is caused by pollution from power plants and other industries that produce oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. These change chemically as they travel through the atmosphere and descend as acid rain, snow, fog or dust. Much of the pollution blows into the Northeast and Canada from the Midwest's industrial areas. Environmental Damage</p>
        <p>Scientists generally agree that acid rain destroys plant and animal life in sensitive lakes and streams, and some scientists believe it damages forests and man-made structures, adds to the pollution pressures on marine life in eastern coastal areas and threatens human health in many areas.</p>
        <p>The New York-Ohio plan would require reductions of sulfur and nitrogen emissions in several stages between now and 2003. Total sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced in three phases by a national total of 10 million tons from the current level of about 23 million tons a year. All of the reductions would be made by coal-fired utility plants.</p>
        <p>According to Thomas C. Jorling, head of New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, the major sources of Midwestern pollution would have to make the biggest reductions in the first stage of the program, which would end in five years.</p>
        <p>The plan would also require a 3 million-ton reduction in nitrogen oxide pollution by 1998 from current emissions of nearly 20 million tons a year. $1.8 Billion a Year The proposal anticipates that the plan would cost $1.8 billion a year nationwide in the first 10 years. The Federal Government would provide subsidies of $900 million a year, of which $650 million would come from a change in the way the nation pays for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>The reserve, which consists of oil under storage for use in the event of a national emergency, is now paid for with Federal tax revenues. Under the New York-Ohio proposal, the pace of filling the reserve would be accelerated and the cost would be shifted from the Treasury to the oil companies, which would be required to set aside 2 percent of their imports for that purpose. The companies would retain title to the reserve oil and would pay storage fees that would generate the $650 million.</p>
