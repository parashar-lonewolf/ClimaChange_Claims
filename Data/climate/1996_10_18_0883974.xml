        <p>Just thinking about the World Wide Web for children can make you edgy. So much information! Too many sites! Turn the computer off and read a book instead! But wait, if you take it slowly, one site at a time, you realize that the Web is useful for  helping with homework and making pen pals.</p>
        <p>Here are three sites that represent a sampling of what's out there, from a giant name to a small consortium in Minnesota. One guide you can consult is the Internet Kids Yellow Pages (Osborne-McGraw-Hill). You can also visit the children's sites of America Online, Prodigy and Compuserve, but don't stop there. The lesser-known places are what keep you from pushing the computer's off switch.</p>
        <p>Disney.com  http://www.disney.com  Recommended ages: 5 and up</p>
        <p>You can't help logging on with great expectations. The graphics fulfill your dreams, and the home page sparkles with color. At the top of the page is a banner of changing graphics that recently included the logo for the movie ''D3: The Mighty Ducks'' and an announcement about ''Beauty and the Beast.'' Directly underneath is a lineup of words (''Star Watch,'' for one) that you can click on to link up to other pages in the site. Below this is the table of contents, organized under headings like Movies, Books, Shopping, Theme Parks-Vacations and the Walt Disney Company (investor information).</p>
        <p>Clicking on the Theme Parks-Vacations page, you can peruse a menu that includes, among other things,  Walt Disney World. What's interesting here, especially if you've never been there and are looking at the page at night, is the live camera feed of Magic Kingdom Park, all lighted up.</p>
        <p>Returning to the home page, you might want to check out the Movies pages, namely ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' (in case you haven't seen that, either). Click to the ''page du jour'' and you meet the people involved in the animation process: not terribly exciting. O.K., do you want to see Esmeralda? Click her name and she appears in a large illustration, sultry with black tresses.</p>
        <p>Where's the real fun? Try the home page and click ''Star Watch.'' Then follow Esmeralda to the serialized storybook of ''The Hunchback.'' Here a child can actually read the story, which translates well onto the Web. But the riveting illustrations  are what make you think you have at last found something worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Then you can call it a night. Which might be a good idea as you can't help but feel let down by the overt commercialism.</p>
        <p>ZuZu  http://www.zuzu.org  Recommended ages: 5 and up</p>
        <p>What a surprise to find ZuZu, the former Manhattan-based children's newspaper, on the Web. The paper published children's articles, fiction, poetry and artwork (mixed in with work by adults). But Beck Underwood, the editor, has resurrected ZuZu in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>The paper was iconoclastic in its graphics, tone and the way it reminded adults of their late youth, when they read the SoHo Weekly News and  7 Days, both now defunct. The new Web site, organized by themes, is as original as the paper ZuZu was, and the design is so clean and simple you want to move right in.</p>
        <p>The graphics are children's illustrations; the pages' background color is a lush tropical green. Roam around and click on a pair of ruby-red slippers to revisit the home page. What's disappointing is that some of what you'll find is old stuff from the paper. What's exhilarating are articles like ''The Story of Joe,'' the editor's dog.</p>
        <p>An obituary of ZuZu the newspaper is gratuitous, but reading about what the paper's child and adult contributors are up to these days is like attending a reunion. Take Avery Singer's page. She's 9 now, and her ''art gallery'' is made up of a four-color Munch-like drawing of ghost people captioned ''Ahhhh!'' She has also created an animated movie on her page, but you need additional software to view it.</p>
        <p>You can also learn how to get published on the new ZuZu and link up with other sites that ZuZu recommends (these are good). Or drop it an E-mail message and express yourself that way.</p>
        <p>Youth in Action Network  Mighty Media  http://www.mightymedia.com  Recommended ages: 8 and up</p>
        <p>You're never too young or too ignorant to become an activist. This new site is put together by Mighty Media, a Minneapolis-based group of private corporations, nonprofit organizations and educators that provides educational networks on the Web. This site is a guide on how to ''help make the world a better place.'' It's meant for teachers and children and  anyone who cares about the environment or human rights.</p>
        <p>The home page resembles a book report, although the graphics in the top banner are energetic and youthful. The page tells you how the site is organized. For example, the ''Learn'' section gives you background information on certain issues; the ''Communicate'' area allows you to join discussions on topics like global warming. ''Take Action'' encourages you to ''really make some noise'' by, say, reaching Congressional representatives via E-mail. Just reading the instructions, it's easy to start thinking about how you can fix the world. You feel effective before you have even registered.</p>
        <p>Which is what you have to do to take advantage of the interactive parts of the site. This requires giving  your name and E-mail address, not something everyone using the Web likes to do. But if you don't want to, you can still obtain plenty of useful information. You can, for example, read Youth in Media's list of facts, including this: Every two days, 25 children lose their lives to guns.</p>
        <p>''Share your knowledge and hear what others have to say,'' the site implores.</p>
