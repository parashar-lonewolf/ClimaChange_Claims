        <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments on Friday in a five-year battle over whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>In arguments on a suit that consolidates a number of legal actions, opposing lawyers cited the same words of the Clean Air Act and drew entirely different conclusions.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs are 12 states, a territory, 3 cities and 13 nongovernment organizations, most of them environmental groups.</p>
        <p>They have been seeking to have the E.P.A. explain why the Clean Air Act does not empower the agency to regulate carbon dioxide emissions for global climate considerations. That position of the Bush administration is a reversal of Clinton administration policy.</p>
        <p>Joining the government's side in the case are 11 states that oppose carbon dioxide regulation and 19 industry groups, including those representing car makers, refiners and chemical companies.</p>
        <p>The arguments Friday, before a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, reflected a major fault line in current environmental battles: the extent to which carbon dioxide can be linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has taken a skeptical view of global warming and its effect. It has resisted international treaties, like Kyoto, that govern some polluting countries and not others, and has worked to protect industries that would be adversely affected if carbon dioxide were regulated.</p>
        <p>Exchanges between the judges and the lawyers focused on whether Congress intended for the agency to regulate carbon dioxide even if its link to global warming is uncertain and adverse effects on humans cannot be accurately predicted.</p>
        <p>In effect, the arguments came down to Congress's meaning when it wrote into Section 202 of the act that the E.P.A. administrator ''shall'' regulate any air pollutant from any new vehicles that ''may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.''</p>
        <p>''You don't have to look far to find the authority that the E.P.A. says is missing,'' said the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, James R. Milkey, an assistant attorney general of Massachusetts. Ignoring a broad reading of the act, Mr. Milkey said, ''is like saying a stop sign is not specific enough.''</p>
        <p>But the section makes no specific mention of carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Jeffrey Clark of the Justice Department argued that if Congress had intended for the agency to regulate tailpipe emissions -- a quantum shift in policy that would have an enormous economic effect -- the lawmakers would have used language more comprehensive.</p>
        <p>Judge A. Raymond Randolph, whose questions suggested that he did not believe a clear link had been established between carbon dioxide and global warming, cited another section of the Clean Air Act that says the language referring to effects on public health includes ''climate.'' Judge Randolph told Mr. Clark, ''I can't imagine anything turns'' on a single word.</p>
        <p>''We agree,'' Mr. Clark responded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clark compared the current case to an effort by the Food and Drug Administration under President Bill Clinton to regulate tobacco as a drug. That effort was resolved when in 1997 the Supreme Court upheld the tobacco industry's opposition, ruling that Congress had never intended for tobacco to be considered a drug.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Milkey called the comparison erroneous, declaring that if tobacco came under F.D.A. jurisdiction, ''it would be banned, and here nobody is banning anything.''</p>
        <p>All three judges engaged in aggressive questioning of the lawyers, although it was difficult to determine how the panel might ultimately vote. While Judge Randolph seemed rough on Mr. Milkey, Judge David S. Tatel was equally hard on Mr. Clark. The third judge, David B. Sentelle, was skeptical of assertions from both sides, leading lawyers for the environmental groups to wonder after the arguments if he could be the swing vote.</p>
        <p>Regulation of carbon dioxide emissions has been a major national environmental issue since President Bush first won election. Despite a campaign promise in 2000 to include carbon dioxide as an air pollutant that should be regulated, the administration has resisted regulations on such emissions from mobile as well as stationary sources. Conflict over carbon dioxide is one major reason Congress has not passed new antipollution legislation for power plants.</p>
        <p>Motor vehicles account for about a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions. Yet automakers have fought efforts to force them to build more efficient engines, pointing to the extraordinary costs of altering their factories to meet any new standards. The courtroom audience Friday included lobbyists from leading car manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The judges are expected to take as long as six months to issue an opinion, after which an appeal is almost certain.</p>
