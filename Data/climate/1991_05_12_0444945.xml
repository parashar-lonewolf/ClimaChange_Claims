        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I consider myself an environmentalist. But as a chemical engineer, I have been bothered by the myths, misconceptions, and half-truths littering the environmental policy landscape. "Recyclable . . . or Just Fraudulent?" (Forum, April 21) reinforces several:</p>
        <p>* Degradable plastic bags don't degrade in landfills.</p>
        <p>True, but they were never intended to. Degradable plastics were developed in response to the litter, not the landfill, problem. When exposed to sunlight, they will break down into small harmless fragments, eliminating the hazard.</p>
        <p>* People should buy biodegradable paper products rather than plastics.</p>
        <p>Why? Nothing degrades very fast in a landfill. If the materials did degrade it would lead to more problems. A number of houses in my area were recently evacuated because methane gas entered basements from decomposing construction debris buried nearby. Rather than being an environmental benefit, biodegradable packaging probably has an overall negative effect on the environment.</p>
        <p>* Plastics make up an ever-growing share of landfill space.</p>
        <p>According to your article, "plastics now account for 18 percent of landfill volume -- six times the 1970 level." William Rathje, in the May 1991 National Geographic, reports that his studies show that only 10 percent of landfill volume is occupied by plastic products, a number unchanged since the early 70's. But paper has gone to 50 percent from 30 percent of landfill volume in the same period.</p>
        <p>* We are running out of space for landfills.</p>
        <p>Nonsense. Landfills may be filling up, but if not for the "not-in-my-backyard" syndrome there would be millions of acres available for new landfills.</p>
        <p>Let's stop worrying about nonproblems. Our efforts and investment should be concentrated on problems such as ozone depletion, acid rain and global warming that are not going to go away. STEVEN H. GOVE  Wilmington, Del., April 23</p>
