        <p>FOR more than two centuries aeronauts have dreamed of circumnavigating the world in a balloon, the last great aeronautical challenge remaining to be conquered. All the adventurers who previously attempted the daunting 22,000-mile voyage have failed, but this week an American balloon ace, a seasoned aeronautical mechanic and a senior Russian astronaut are completing preparations for the launching of Earthwinds, the most complex and advanced balloon ever built.</p>
        <p>If all goes well in the next few days here, the huge craft, carrying American and Russian scientific experiments as well as the three crew members, will ascend on Thursday or Friday from its berth at the Loral Defense Systems Air Dock, a gigantic hangar built in 1929 to accommodate the largest dirigibles ever built in America, the ill-fated Akron and Macon. The Earthwinds balloon is supposed to rise slowly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet, slip into the eastward-flowing jet stream, and complete its trip around the world in something under two weeks.</p>
        <p>But the unpredictable jet stream could take the craft over such hazards as the Persian Gulf, the Arctic Sea or the Himalayas, and its crew has planned for the worst: stowed in compartments aboard the boxcar-sized crew capsule are parachutes, Arctic clothing, cold-water immersion suits, rescue beacons and even a hunting rifle.</p>
        <p>The Earthwinds balloon differs radically from previous long-duration balloons and cost $3.5 million, not counting the time, labor, expertise, devices and material donated by hundreds of volunteers. The balloon's builders say it has more in common with a manned space vehicle than with any conventional airship or balloon.</p>
        <p>It is also one of the most expensive lighter-than-air craft ever built. The cost was shared by Larry Newman, the balloon's captain, with nine sponsors, including the Hilton Hotels Corporation, for which the crew capsule was christened "Earthwinds Hilton," and Virgin Atlantic Airways, after which the balloon itself was named "Virgin Earthwinds."</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman, the organizer, fund-raiser, construction chief and captain of Earthwinds, is a 44-year-old millionaire businessman, airline captain for America West Airlines, and veteran of several historic balloon flights. Those include the first balloon flight across the Atlantic Ocean, aboard Double Eagle II in 1978, and the first across the Pacific, aboard Double Eagle V in 1981.</p>
        <p>Ballooning is dangerous, and Mr. Newman is no stranger to disaster. Maxie Anderson, who flew with Mr. Newman on the trans-Atlantic balloon flight, made three attempts to fly around the world, all ending in failure. After giving up further attempts, Mr. Anderson and Don Ida competed in the Gordon Bennett Balloon Race of 1983, during which their balloon crashed on a German mountainside, killing both pilots. Two years later, Ben Abruzzo, captain of both the Atlantic and Pacific balloon flights, was killed while piloting an airplane in New Mexico.</p>
        <p>"Ben was almost a father to me," Mr. Newman said, "but now it's my turn as a balloon captain. I'm a bit uneasy flying a balloon that's dependent on so much new and relatively untested technology, but after you've checked and rechecked every component a hundred times, you have to put your faith in the system and hope for the best."</p>
        <p>Maj. Gen. Vladimir Dzhanibekov of the Russian Air Force, commander of Russian astronaut training and the veteran of five space missions, takes a similarly cautious view. "I give this flight a 50 percent chance of success," he said. "People ask, 'what's this crazy Russian general doing on such a flight?' And I say, it's my job. We are carrying scientific experiments on the balloon that will help the space programs in both our countries. But more than that, this is a change for me."</p>
        <p>One experiment to be conducted on the flight is in General Dzhanibekov's (pronounced JOHNNY-byeh-kov) own body. Soviet space scientists have extensively studied the organisms in the intestines of astronauts, and concluded that long periods in space with continuous nervous stress upset the natural ecology of intestinal microbes. This, according to the Soviet Institute of Biomedical Problems, has led to malnutrition, chronic indigestion and even serious illness. The balloon experiment is intended to test the protective effects of a special colony of microflora that has been planted in General Dzhanibekov's digestive tract.</p>
        <p>Another Russian experiment will measure the penetration of dangerous ultraviolet radiation through the atmosphere to a level of 35,000 feet around the world and furnish data on the depletion of the ozone layer shielding the earth from this radiation.</p>
        <p>General Dzhanibekov, who is on temporary leave from the Russian Air Force, commanded a successful rescue mission to save the Salyut 7 space station in 1985. He is a winner of the Order of Lenin and was twice decorated as a Hero of the Soviet Union. He has been working here almost around the clock on the Earthwinds balloon, along with American and British project engineers and mechanics. To calm her nerves as she waits for the balloon launching, the General's wife, Lilia, has been knitting sweaters for the crew.</p>
        <p>The Earthwinds crew member selected for his expertise as a builder, mechanic, plumber, electronics expert and engineer is Don Moses, a Hawaii-based boat builder and airplane pilot. Mr. Moses and his fellow crew members expect to have their hands full during the flight, keeping the balloon's many systems working. New Design  System Allows Ballast Renewal</p>
        <p>Of all the innovations incorporated in Earthwinds, the most important is a system that allows the balloon to replenish its ballast, thereby vastly increasing its endurance aloft.</p>
        <p>Balloons come in two varieties: hot-air balloons and gas balloons. Hot-air balloons, which derive their lift from air heated by propane burners, are fundamentally similar to the first manned balloon built by the Montgolfier brothers in 1783. Gas balloons are lifted either by hydrogen or helium, although hydrogen, which is dangerously flammable, is rarely used today. Gas balloons require no heat to stay aloft, but helium slowly leaks through any type of balloon, which consequently loses lift.</p>
        <p>Several hybrid balloons with separate compartments of helium and hot air have also been built. One, which is near completion at the big naval airship hangar at Lakehurst, N.J., was built by the British balloonist Julian Nott. Mr. Nott, who holds several ballooning records, still hopes to make a round-the-world flight in it, but has run out of money to finish the project.</p>
        <p>Although new technology has enormously extended the duration of hot-air balloon flights, they consume prodigious quantities of propane fuel, which must be carried in heavy steel tanks. So far, no hot-air balloon design has come close to meeting the needs of a round-the-world flight.</p>
        <p>Gas balloons require no propane and generally have longer range than hot-air types, but they pose other problems. A pilot cannot add appreciable amounts of lifting gas to his balloon once it is aloft, so to rise, he must drop ballast -- sand, water, wrenches or anything handy. If he runs out of ballast to drop, the flight will soon be forced to end. Cycle of Light and Dark</p>
        <p>The reason for this is the warming and cooling that accompany the cycle of sunlight and darkness. In the warmth of daylight, the gas in a balloon expands, becoming less dense and yielding greater lift. The balloon rises, and at a certain altitude, as the pressure of the atmosphere decreases, the balloon's gas expands beyond the limiting volume of the balloon itself. At this point an automatic or manual valve must release gas to prevent the balloon from ripping open, and when the valve is opened, helium is irrevocably lost. When the sun sets, however, the remaining gas cools and contracts, and the balloon sinks, forcing the pilot to drop more ballast. This cycle repeats each day, and at the end of about a week, most balloons have used up their ballast and must land.</p>
        <p>But the Earthwinds balloon, designed by Tim Lachenmeier of Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, S.D., makes its own ballast, and by so doing, avoids the need to ascend uncontrollably and release gas.</p>
        <p>Earthwinds is actually two balloons arrayed over-and-under, like the bulbs of an hourglass. The upper lifting balloon, from which the crew capsule is suspended, is made of four layers of polyethylene film and contains 1.1 million cubic feet of helium, about the same amount as a Goodyear blimp. A second balloon, the anchor, contains 550,000 cubic feet of ordinary air and hangs below the capsule.</p>
        <p>The anchor balloon differs from the helium balloon in that it can be pressurized. One hundred feet in diameter, the anchor balloon is made of an ultra-strong synthetic textile called Spectra, a product of Allied-Signal Inc. that is ordinarily used in bullet-proof garments, commercial fishing nets and other applications requiring lightness and great strength. The inelastic Spectra envelope of the balloon is lined with gas-tight polyethylene film, and compressed air inside it can neither escape nor force the balloon to expand.</p>
        <p>At sunrise when the Earthwinds helium balloon begins exerting greater lift, a powerful compressor will pump extra air into the anchor balloon. The extra load of air in the balloon will increase the balloon's normal weight of about one ton by an additional 1,800 pounds, enough added ballast to keep the balloon from rising and having to release its vital helium. At night, to prevent the cooled balloon from descending too far, compressed air can be released from the anchor balloon, and the effect will be the same as dropping conventional ballast. Power in Flight  Gasoline Engines Play Vital Role</p>
        <p>But the anchor balloon's electric air compressors require a steady source of power, which will come from either of the two eight-horsepower engines mounted under the crew capsule's floor. Insulation, mufflers and other sound-absorbing means will make these engines quieter, but they will throb continuously, forcing the crew to wear special electronic noise-canceling earphones.</p>
        <p>Besides generating electricity for the anchor balloon's compressors and the Earthwinds's lighting and electronic systems, the engines will drive another compressor that pressurizes the fiberglass crew capsule with breathing air, supplies pressurized air for the engines' carburetors and heats the air in the crew quarters. The capsule's complex heat-exchange system also uses engine heat to operate a stove for warming food for the crew that is similar to that used by astronauts.</p>
        <p>At 35,000 feet and a temperature of minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit, the outside air would be far too thin to breathe or keep a gasoline engine running, and permanent loss of power in both engines would soon end the flight, Mr. Newman said. The crew would be saved from asphyxiation, however, by oxygen masks.</p>
        <p>Slung against the outer sides of the capsule are two drums with 700 gallons of high-octane gasoline for the engines, which is enough for 40 days continuous running, and two 750-gallon insulated tanks of liquid helium at a temperature of minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit. Mr. Newman does not expect to need the helium, but it could be converted into gas in case of a slow leak in the lifting balloon.</p>
        <p>The crew capsule has many of the same flight instruments as an airliner, including a satellite navigation system and various communication links to operate a fax machine, a transmitter for sending still and television pictures and all the radio links used by commercial aircraft. Since the balloon will be flying at an altitude used by many airliners, its pilot must continuously provide air traffic centers with its exact location, course, altitude, and speed, which is likely to exceed 250 miles an hour. Old Dangers  Swift Wind Shears Pose Major Threat</p>
        <p>The Hilton Hotel chain, a major sponsor of the flight, has furnished the large cabin with lightweight carpeting, and a single bunk was installed at one end, in which crew members will take eight-hour turns. Under this bunk they have installed an instrument built by NASA to gather data on wind shear conditions all along the balloon's route.</p>
        <p>Robert B. Rice of Weather Service Corporation, the balloon's meteorological forecaster, said wind shear, an abrupt transition between two bodies of air moving at different speeds, could be a serious problem for the balloon.</p>
        <p>"Between 20,000 and 35,000 feet you can encounter a wind shear difference of 115 miles an hour," Mr. Rice said. "For an airplane this is not a problem, because a plane is fairly thin and can slide up through it gradually. But this balloon is 350 feet high, and as it passes through a shear, the top might be pulled violently in one direction and the lower part in another. Since the lifting balloon is made only of plastic film, that could be a concern."</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman, the captain, believes the most hazardous phase of the trip may be the launching. "You often get gusts and wind shear close to the ground in Ohio at this time of year," he said, "and there are rising columns of warm air, power lines, and huge building obstructions all around the launching site. The launch will probably be my most anxious time." But the Air Dock is the only building in the United States large enough to accommodate the ballon.</p>
        <p>At least Mr. Newman and his crew have had some practice with this type of balloon. A small prototype was built by Raven Industries in 1990, and after a nearly calamitous launching, the crew flew it successfully for two days and nights near Mount Rainier, Wash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman's wife, Lynne, the owner of a Scottsdale, Ariz., insurance business and an administrative manager of the Earthwinds project, will join the former astronaut Eugene Cernan aboard a chase plane provided by Barron Hilton, president of the Hilton chain, to follow the balloon around the world. Each day the plane is to rendezvous with the balloon to exchange communications, check positions and keep up morale.</p>
        <p>"I can't help worrying," Mrs. Newman said. "I've told Larry I'll kill him if he doesn't make it."</p>
