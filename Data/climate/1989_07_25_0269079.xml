        <p>LEAD: WHEN President Bush outlined his vision of America's future in space last week, Mars and the Moon outshone another initiative that the President said was critical to the space program: a 25-year effort using a new network of satellites to understand how the Earth's atmosphere, seas and living creatures function as a global system.</p>
        <p>WHEN President Bush outlined his vision of America's future in space last week, Mars and the Moon outshone another initiative that the President said was critical to the space program: a 25-year effort using a new network of satellites to understand how the Earth's atmosphere, seas and living creatures function as a global system.</p>
        <p>The enterprise, Mission to Planet Earth, is envisioned as one of the nation's most encompassing and urgent scientific programs. Costing the United States $15 billion to $30 billion over 15 or 20 years, it would create the first system of unmanned satellites able to observe and measure the actions of major components of the global environment as they interact.</p>
        <p>When observations from the new network are fed into computer models, they are expected to provide a more detailed and accurate picture of the Earth's evolving climate and ecosphere than is possible with the fragmentary measurements from existing satellites and ground stations.</p>
        <p>Using a wide array of remote-sensing instruments, more than half of them of new and more advanced design, the system is intended to gather detailed information and measurements about the Earth's climate and weather, its land, its crops, its ocean temperatures and currents, its forests and all its other biota.</p>
        <p>Scores of other satellites, mainly those that observe the weather and many whose main purpose has been to develop the technology of observation and measurement, were the system's precursors.</p>
        <p>If the effort succeeds, scientists say, it will enable them to give much more precise and confident answers about over-arching environmental concerns like the rate and severity of global warming, thereby aiding policy makers. It is being undertaken in cooperation with the European Space Agency and with Japan, each of which is to place in orbit a major piece of the system.</p>
        <p>The enterprise is seen by some scientists as the practical embodiment of the vision of the planet as a lovely, unified sphere that thrilled people everywhere, and changed their perceptions, when astronauts bound for the Moon first beamed it back from space 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>''I consider the program very exciting and very worthwhile,'' said Thomas M. Donahue, a professor of planetary science and physics at the University of Michigan. ''It's something we must do. The nation and the world must undertake these studies, otherwise the planet is in serious trouble.'' As chairman of the space board of the National Research Council, Dr. Donahue headed a study of the nation's space program that last year strongly recommended Mission to Planet Earth.</p>
        <p>The program ''has the potential to revolutionize global studies,'' said James Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, who has been deeply involved in the planning of Mission to Planet Earth and who would be one of its principal scientific investigators.</p>
        <p>''This is without doubt the largest science program the agency has ever undertaken,'' said Shelby Tilford, the director of NASA's earth science and applications division, under which the satellite program falls. ''We believe it has the potential for more near-term meaning than any other science program we might ever undertake.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Donahue expressed misgivings that are shared by other scientists. His main criticism, which he considers ''fairly serious,'' is that the major orbiting platforms of the system would be very large and would assemble a broad range of instruments in one place. But ''many of them need different kinds of orbits and altitudes,'' he said. ''The whole thing would be better and less expensive, I think, if we had a multitude of instruments on smaller platforms.</p>
        <p>''I think it's still worth doing if NASA sticks to its present plans,'' he said. ''The present concept is almost certainly not disabling.'' Flood of Data Feared</p>
        <p>Other scientist fear that the flood of data expected from the satellites will overwhelm the ability to analyze it. ''The main reservation I have,'' Dr. Hansen said, ''is that we do not now have the scientific brainpower to take advantage of the global observations.''</p>
        <p>Still others say that because the satellite system by itself cannot measure events in the Earth's core or mantle that interact intimately with the land surface, seas and atmosphere in making the global system run, it will provide an incomplete picture. The National Research Council recommended a parallel investment in new instruments and stations to measure events in the core and mantle for integration with the satellite picture. But no financing for such research has been proposed. The research council is the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, a private organization that is the Government's chief advisory body on science policy. Flaws in Current Models</p>
        <p>Despite the reservations, the program has drawn overall support. Without a program like Mission to Planet Earth, say climatologists, it would probably never be possible to understand global change well enough to make predictions or guide public policy. These climatologists rely on computerized, mathematical simulations of the global climate in a flawed and imperfect attempt to understand how the climate is changing. But the models do not include many of the crucial factors that interrelate to make the global system function, since they lack data the mission is intended to provide.</p>
        <p>They do not, for instance, account for deep-ocean circulation or the amount of ice in the sea, the flow patterns of glaciers, deforestation, the spread of deserts or the impact of living things, from plankton to humans.</p>
        <p>For this, ''it is clear that satellite observations are essential,'' said Dr. Hansen, who heads one of the American groups that operate general-circulation models of the world's climate. Wide Political Support</p>
        <p>Because of its likely benefits in the near future to the globe's habitability, the mission appears to enjoy wider political support than the other three space enterprises endorsed last week by President Bush: a base on the Moon, a manned mission to Mars and to a lesser extent the space station Freedom. And with the earliest satellites scheduled for launching in 1993, it is the nearest to getting under way.</p>
        <p>''This is America's true priority in space,'' Senator Al Gore, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate subcommittee on space, science and technology, said in an interview after the President's speech last week. Whether such sentiments will be able to overcome the budgetary chill that grips Congress remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>One key aspect of the program would be its extensive measuring of the role of living things in shaping the environment. Scientists know there has been an interrelationship between living things and the global environment at least ever since blue-green algae began to transform the atmosphere billions of years ago, by exuding the first oxygen into it. The feedback continues to this day, with creatures from plankton to Homo sapiens exerting critical influences on the global system. Variety of Sensors</p>
        <p>''It's not just the physical aspects of the climate, but also the biology that has shaped this planet and has shaped the environment strongly,'' said Dixon Butler, a NASA scientist who is chief of advanced earth-science missions under Dr. Tilford. ''For the first time,'' he said, ''this is being incorporated, and being incorporated in a quantitative way.''</p>
        <p>The satellites that NASA is preparing to send up would be equipped with a variety of remote sensors, like imaging radar, lasers, spectrometers and infrared beams, some of which have been proved in practice aboard earlier satellites.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the system would be a series of at least four 15-ton instrument platforms in pole-to-pole orbits, each with 12 to 14 instruments ''reading'' the Earth as it rotates beneath them. Together, they form what NASA calls the Earth Observing System. Its initials spell the name of the Greek goddess Eos, who was the mother of the stars and the winds.</p>
        <p>NASA'S plans, subject to Congressional approval, call for the first platform to be launched by a Titan 4 rocket in 1996. A second platform would follow in 1997, launched by the European Space Agency aboard an Ariane rocket.</p>
        <p>A second American-launched platform would go aloft in 1998, and a fourth would be launched by Japan later that same year. The United States expects to place instruments on both the European and Japanese platforms, which are to be paid for by those countries. Scientists from all nations would have access to the data. Display of Shifting Conditions</p>
        <p>The amount of funds available will determine how many platforms are actually put into orbit, although NASA considers four to be the minimum. The Europeans and the Japanese, like NASA, must seek money from their parliaments.</p>
        <p>Later, perhaps between 2000 and 2002, the three organizations hope to install a second part of the system, comprising an undetermined number of platforms in orbits synchronized with the Earth's rotation so that they stay above one spot on the Earth. The EOS platforms, because they would be in a polar orbit and the Earth would be turning beneath them, would miss many climatic events of short duration like rainstorms. Geostationary instruments would enable scientists to see and measure such events and combined with the EOS satellites would provide full global coverage for the first time.</p>
        <p>Advancing technology is expected to enable scientists to display changing conditions on screens, so that they can see more quickly and easily what alterations are taking place, say, in cloud cover, vegetation patterns, oil slicks and holes in the atmospheric ozone layer. Simplifying the Task</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilford believes this would ease any problem of scientists' becoming overwhelmed by data; automatic analysis and visual displays would simplify and shorten much of the task.</p>
        <p>By 1993, NASA hopes to launch the first of three less elaborate ''earth probes'' as the first elements of the mission. These would be smaller, more modest satellites, in orbits over the Equator, focused on specific needs: observation of the ozone layer, of biological activity in the ocean and of rainfall in the tropics, the ''heat engine'' of the Earth.</p>
        <p>Three other earth-science satellites, precursors and adjuncts of a sort, are also to be launched in the early 1990's. The first, planned for 1990, would measure stratospheric winds and energy from the Sun as it affects the atmosphere. Another would measure wind speed at the ocean's surface, and the third would observe part of the ocean's subsurface circulation.</p>
