        <p>A PIECE of rock no bigger than a potato has awakened a somnolent American space program and inspired planetary scientists, spacecraft designers and the NASA leadership with what may become a new sense of mission. Tantalizing clues in the meteorite have emboldened them to think that if they are clever and persistent, they may yet find on Mars the first evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
        <p>Although NASA officials refrained from money talk when they announced the discovery of these sensational clues last week, they did nothing to discourage sweeping discussions about expanding and accelerating current plans for Mars exploration. Scientists think the only way to get definitive proof of some microbial forms of Martian life -- in the distant past or, just possibly, at present -- would be to drill for subsurface rock samples and bring them back to Earth.</p>
        <p>Already on the books are 10 low-cost, unmanned flights that are designed to orbit and land on the planet over the next 10 years, with the first two launchings scheduled for November and December. The Russians are ready to launch in November a long-delayed mission to place two scientific stations on Mars, each with instruments to probe at least six feet beneath the cold, arid surface.</p>
        <p>If successful, these would be the first visits to the Martian surface since two American spacecraft, Viking 1 and 2, landed there in 1976 and failed to find any unambiguous signs of life. It is too late to modify this year's missions in light of the meteorite findings. But scientists expect the American and Russian explorations to set the stage for an eventual robotic mission that would bring back samples to Earth.</p>
        <p>''Certainly by 2001,'' said Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, ''we may want to consider some very bold missions where we bore down real deep, and we bring back samples. This is the process we're going to talk about. And this is where the excitement comes in.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Donna Shirley, manager of the Mars exploration program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in an interview that engineers and mission planners were waiting for instructions on how to proceed with future flights.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is real excited,'' she said. ''One of our primary goals in the next decade has always been to search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.''</p>
        <p>The future pace and priority of Mars exploration will be foremost on the agenda at a meeting on space policy to be convened by the White House in November. NASA officials will be armed with a report by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, completed this summer, saying that the current program for Mars exploration is severely underfinanced and especially hampered by insufficient support for the development of new technology for miniaturized scientific instruments. Any attempt to increase the budget for NASA significantly is, of course, likely to run into opposition.</p>
        <p>Scientists, meanwhile, are stepping up their laboratory analysis of the meteorite, designated Allan Hills 84001, which almost certainly came from Mars and fell on Antarctica 13,000 years ago. The research team that reported ''evidence of primitive life on early Mars'' conceded that its findings were not definitive, though several members expressed confidence that in time they would be proved right. They must first meet the objections of many skeptics.</p>
        <p>One of the leading skeptics, Dr. J. William Schopf, a paleobiologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the ''burden of proof'' was on those who claim that the organic compounds and fossil-like objects are biological in origin. Similar evidence that has been found in other meteorites and in Earth rocks has turned out to be produced by nonbiological processes.</p>
        <p>Referring to the supposed microfossil objects in the meteorite, Dr. Schopf said, ''We've got to look inside these things, see if they have cell walls, see if they are compartmentalized, see if they are cellular, see if they are composed of organic material.''</p>
        <p>The investigation will not be easy, but microfossils -- if that is what they are -- are tubular specks many times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Looking inside the specks for traces of cell walls may be beyond the ability of the best electron microscopes.</p>
        <p>Dr. David S. McKay, the geochemist at the Johnson Space Center in Houston who led the team reporting the discovery, described plans to use an ultrasensitive transmission electron microscope to examine thin slices of the meteorite, seeking to magnify these fossil-like objects. He said, ''We will be able to see inside and we will be able to see if there's a membrane -- perhaps.''</p>
        <p>Likewise, planetary scientists from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville intend to conduct new tests, beginning this week, to see if they can detect the same evidence suggesting fossil life. They are dubious, though, because in previous studies, reported last month in the journal Nature, two scientists, Dr. Ralph Harvey of Case Western and Dr. Harry Y. McSween Jr. of Tennessee, found a striking absence of water-bearing minerals in the meteorite, which would seem to contradict the findings and interpretation by Dr. McKay's group.</p>
        <p>They detected very little calcium carbonate, material that is sometimes found in meteorites and that is sometimes associated with life processes. Dr. McKay's team found this in abundance. But Dr. Harvey and Dr. McSween reported instead an abundance of magnesium and iron carbonates, which are not usually associated with organic production. They proposed that these carbonates formed not as a result of microbial life but as a result of a pulse of carbon dioxide at 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, heated by an asteroid impact, that flushed through the ancient Martian crust.</p>
        <p>Responding to this argument, Dr. Everett K. Gibson Jr. of the Johnson Space Center, another member of the discovery team, said the presence of certain oxygen isotopes, organic molecules and particular minerals indicated that the carbonates had formed at temperatures no higher than 180 degrees. If the identified organic molecules had been exposed to heat greater than 750 degrees, he said, they would have been degraded and would have fragmented.</p>
        <p>''We see nice, clean spectra, which suggests there had been lower temperatures,'' Dr. Gibson contended.</p>
        <p>Dr. Harvey, who led the Antarctic party of geologists that collected the rock in 1984, said the other 11 meteorites considered Martian were not likely to yield definitive answers because they were all much younger specimens. But he said he was comfortable with the analysis establishing that these meteorites are indeed pieces of Mars.</p>
        <p>As for what it would take to confirm the report of Martian life, Dr. Harvey said in an interview: ''If the McKay group were to analyze the microfossils and come up with something indisputably produced by organisms -- chlorophyll or DNA or proteins -- I'd shake their hands and say that's life. That's going to be difficult, and I don't know if we have the technology.''</p>
        <p>Dr. James W. Head, a planetary geologist at Brown University, said the new findings could do for Mars studies what the concept of plate tectonics had done for earth geophysics. ''It will make us ask questions we never thought of before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In particular, Dr. Head said, the possibility of life on early Mars pointed up the critical need to map the chronology of Mars's climate changes, showing when the planet was warmer and wetter, when liquid water could have flowed on its surface and when conditions drastically changed, leaving Mars the cold, dry and forbidding place seen today.</p>
        <p>Although the two Viking landers in 1976 did not detect life, orbital photographs by the Vikings and Mariner 9 showed evidence that water had once flowed on the Martian surface, leaving deep channels, river deltas and lake beds. Ever since then, scientists have been looking for ways to reconstruct early climatic conditions there and search for fossils of life that might have evolved in that watery past.</p>
        <p>From what they know now, scientists think that the Martian crust solidified 4.5 billion years ago, soon after the planet formed. Heavy asteroid bombardment followed, as it did on all the planets. These impacts fractured the Martian surface, causing carbonate globules to form in the crevices. In these deposits, bacterial life might have thrived. The carbonate deposits found in the meteorite, which contained the indications of life, are thought to be 3.6 billion years old.</p>
        <p>''At some point in Mars's history, things went bad,'' Dr. McKay said. ''But it's some time after the time that we're talking about here when we think we see signs of life.''</p>
        <p>If liquid water was once abundant on Mars and may still be below the surface, scientists hope that the next round of flights to the planet will be able to chart its most likely repositories, as well as map the planet's geology, thus pointing the way to places where life may have existed -- or may still exist.</p>
        <p>The first mission, called Mars Global Surveyor, is to be launched in November and go into orbit around the planet the following September. Its primary mission over two years -- a full Martian year -- will be to map surface geology and study the thin Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere.</p>
        <p>A second spacecraft, Mars Pathfinder, is to be launched a few weeks later, but it will pass the Global Surveyor and land on Mars on July 4 next year. Dr. Shirley, the project manager, said the lander's destination could not be better for scientists looking for water on Mars or possible life. It is to set down at the mouth of an ancient water channel called Ares Vallis, just north of the Mars equator, where rocks have presumably come tumbling down from the highlands.</p>
        <p>Pathfinder will also carry a 22-pound roving vehicle called Sojourner, which is to make short excursions beyond the lander to examine the chemistry of rocks with an alpha-proton-X-ray spectrometer, a version of the instrument that was sent to the Moon by unmanned spacecraft in preparation for the Apollo landings. The Pathfinder mission is considered an experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of such low-cost landers and mini-rovers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roger D. Bourke, a specialist in international space activities for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said the Russian mission for 1996 ''seems to be solidly on track for a launch in mid-November.'' The flight, originally planned for 1992, has been delayed by that country's economic and political problems. The mission will include an orbiter equipped with European remote-sensing instruments as well as the two landers with penetrators for probing the temperature, mineral composition and other properties of subterranean Mars.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the United States is planning to fly two more spacecraft to Mars, one an orbiter and the other a lander. One objective will be to look for water in the layers of dust and ice near the south pole. In the same year, Japan expects to launch a Mars orbiter to study the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''It's wide open what we do in 2001,'' Dr. Shirley said. One possibility is to fly a gamma-ray spectrometer in orbit to survey the global chemical composition of the planet and use an infrared spectrometer to search for likely current water sources. Another part of this mission might include delivering a large Russian roving vehicle to the ancient highlands. Discussions with the Russians are under way.</p>
        <p>Where the Mars program goes after 2001, Dr. Shirley said, will depend on decisions to be made in coming months and whether ''people are going to want to add more money.'' Favorable launching opportunities come only every 26 months. Engineers are preparing ideas for a possible robotic sample-return flight as early as 2003, two years before it had been tentatively scheduled. Such a mission would be complicated and much more expensive than the Pathfinder and the Global Surveyors, which are costing only $250 million each.</p>
        <p>At some point, said Mr. Goldin, the NASA Administrator, planners will have to decide whether robots will be able to perform the tasks and return the samples, ''or do we have to send human beings, paleontologists and geologists, to do sampling.'' He added, ''This is a discussion that we are going to have to have.''</p>
        <p>So unless serious flaws in the meteorite findings are exposed, planetary scientists and NASA officials could find themselves with the kind of clear sense of mission that has been lacking since the first Apollo Moon landings in 1969. Then the challenge came from the Soviet Union in a world divided by cold war politics. The challenge now is scientific and is pregnant with philosophical implications. After all, an answer just may be at hand to that haunting and enchanting question: Is Earth alone as an abode of life?</p>
