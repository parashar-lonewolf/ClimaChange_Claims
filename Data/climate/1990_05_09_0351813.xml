        <p>LEAD: The Bush Administration has decided to oppose an international plan that would grant $100 million to developing nations to drastically reduce the use of chemicals that are depleting the earth's protective ozone layer, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has decided to oppose an international plan that would grant $100 million to developing nations to drastically reduce the use of chemicals that are depleting the earth's protective ozone layer, officials said today.</p>
        <p>A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Richard G. Darman, director of Management and Budget, and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, insisted on the decision to oppose the plan over the objection of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly. The decision is regarded by officials as a crucial part of President Bush's environmental policy but one that could eventually be reversed.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the United States and other nations are are expected to take up the ozone proposal, which has strong support in Europe, Wednesday in Geneva. The meeting is designed to lay the groundwork for a conference in London next month that would strengthen a 1987 treaty that restricts the chemicals, cholorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, and eliminate production of the industrial chemicals outright.</p>
        <p>Emphasis on Economic Growth</p>
        <p>The State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to persuade President Bush to reverse his decision in time for the London conference.</p>
        <p>President Bush has repeatedly pledged that his concern for the environment, but critics maintain that his words are stronger than his actions. Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu have emphasized economic growth over environmental considerations in previous debates on such issues.</p>
        <p>The proposed prohibition on CFC production would require the development of substitutes for their use in refigerants, solvents, foam insulation and a wide variety of other products.</p>
        <p>Scientists say the chemicals persist in the atmosphere, destroying ozone, which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Such radiation can cause skin cancer and immunological problems in humans, harm wildlife and crops.</p>
        <p>Use of World Bank Suggested</p>
        <p>India and China, which together make up more than a third of the world's population, never signed the 1987 treaty, the Montreal Protocol.</p>
        <p>India informed American oficials last month that it would not participate in the ozone treaty without substantial financial and technical aid from the industrialized countries. The Indians informed the United States that they and the Chinese would procede with plans to continue CFC production. They also said that without such aid not only would developing countries refuse to join in the ozone treaty but that a number of countries that had already signed would withdraw. They did not identify the countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman reportedly opposed any financial aid to developing countries to help them with environmental programs. Mr. Sununu was said to suggest that the World Bank could finance such programs.</p>
        <p>White House officials were also said to have discussed the possibility of denying World Bank loans to countries that refused to sign the ozone treaties.</p>
