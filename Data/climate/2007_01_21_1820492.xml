        <p>THE town almost missed the news late Wednesday afternoon when the White House announced President Bush was ending his warrantless wiretap program. It was initially hard to believe that a president who has held his ground on so many fronts, against so many prevailing forces, had reversed himself on a signature assertion of executive power.</p>
        <p>There had to be a hitch.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the move -- which really did happen -- should not have come as such a surprise.</p>
        <p>It was the latest evidence of an emerging pragmatism inside the West Wing. In the last few months, the new White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, has switched out longtime Bush loyalists with a handful of so-called policy realists -- and their appointments have cast a famously ideological White House inner circle in a more pragmatic light. And they have expressed a willingness to deal with a new Democratic Congress.</p>
        <p>But Washington being Washington, there is skepticism. Just how pragmatic will they be on issues they hold dear?</p>
        <p>Kenneth Duberstein, the former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan who has welcomed the changes, said it was clear that Mr. Bolten had retooled the administration for a new era of ''compromise and confrontation.'' But, he added, ''They may have changed their faces, but not what's in their hearts.''</p>
        <p>This goes to a fundamental debate over whether -- or how far -- the president will do a turnabout on issues which he had refused to budge on when dealing with a Republican Congress.</p>
        <p>Evidence is ample that Mr. Bush will choose his battles more carefully in his final two years. After all, the war is taking up so much political oxygen and Congress is under Democratic management. And as Texas governor, Mr. Bush worked well with Democrats.</p>
        <p>''He understands how to work with a majority and he understands how to work as part of a minority and he'll adjust accordingly,'' said Mark McKinnon, a political strategist for Mr. Bush's presidential campaigns. ''This is a president who still wants to get a lot done.''</p>
        <p>Yet this new approach is not a wholesale about-face. In fact, the administration's decisions in the last few weeks could be seen as a move to compromise now to avoid more serious setbacks to his agenda later. In other words, it is pragmatism at gunpoint.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the administration's agreement last week to submit the wiretap program to judicial review. Opponents of the program said the administration had finally folded, trying to avoid pending legal decisions that could find that presidents do not have the wartime executive authority to issue wiretaps without warrants. In the process, the administration may also have deflated Congressional plans to move against the program. In effect, critics say, the White House was trying to duck for now a debate on a crucial balance of power question.</p>
        <p>''They've changed the surveillance program under the pressure,'' said Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a leading Republican opponent of the policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter said he did not think the administration would yield on its long-term goal, pushed most by Vice President Dick Cheney, to reclaim the executive authority that was lost after Watergate.</p>
        <p>''I would expect the vice president to continue to insist on executive power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter is among the administration's many moderate allies who hopes that one of Mr. Bolten's new appointees, the incoming White House counsel Fred F. Fielding, will prevent what the administration's critics would call overreaching. Fairly or not, the woman he is succeeding, Harriet Miers, was seen as too often going along with -- or being unable to rein in -- some of the administration's more assertive impulses. Mr. Fielding, who has the stature of having worked for Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, is perceived to be better able to counterbalance those impulses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter said, ''I think Fred is going to be much more'' -- here comes that word again -- ''realistic in his dealings.''</p>
        <p>The same has been said about Robert M. Gates, the successor to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who hails from the realist school of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Even Democrats praised his appointment. But they were decidedly less enthusiastic about the Iraq policy he ultimately endorsed -- including an increase in troops -- which many took as a rebuttal to the bipartisan approach recommended by the Iraq Study Group.</p>
        <p>''What the president did on Iraq just sends a real signal that he's going to continue to basically do what he wants to do,'' said Leon Panetta, a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and a member of the Iraq Study Group. A true test of how pragmatic Mr. Bush will be will come on Tuesday night when Mr. Bush presents his State of the Union address.</p>
        <p>HIS team is clearly hoping to do in 2007 what Bill Clinton did in his penultimate address, in 1999: produce a rousing speech with a hefty set of goals that catch his opponents off guard and help put his second term on firmer footing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's strategists have already foreshadowed a more aggressive approach to end what the president last year called the nation's ''addiction to oil.'' The president is expected to reaffirm his understanding of the human causes of global warming, and discuss ways to reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>Yet some energy industry officials have said his proposals will be partly pre-emptive -- adopting an environmental policy that hews to his anti-regulatory and free-market principles before someone with more liberal ideas on regulation can take over in 2009.</p>
        <p>And, just as President Clinton in 1999 proposed a long-term fix for Social Security and challenged his Republican partners in Congress to join him, Mr. Bush is likely to do the same this year. Mr. Clinton had opened the door to investment of some Social Security funds in the stock market, a break from traditional liberal orthodoxy.</p>
        <p>Some conservatives fear that Henry M. Paulson, Mr. Bush's new treasury secretary, will similarly try to seek common ground with Democrats, in this case by not categorically ruling out some sort of tax increase to help shore up the system. But Republicans close to the administration say Mr. Bush's longtime political adviser, Karl Rove, is focused on holding together the president's conservative coalition, and would be dead set against any such thing.</p>
        <p>Yet all of this talk about deal making and pragmatism is enough to give Mr. Bush's longtime supporters a serious stomach ache. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who consults regularly with White House officials, suggested that Mr. Bush should avoid deal making, hold firm on his principles and help Republicans win back power in 2008 to finish out his vision thereafter.</p>
        <p>''What you're sacrificing short term is approbation,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''But you'll be able to say 'It didn't happen when I was in office, but it happened because I was in office.' ''</p>
