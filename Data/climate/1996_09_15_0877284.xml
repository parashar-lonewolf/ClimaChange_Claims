        <p>ON behalf of Jersey girls of all ages, the following is the Jersey column's response to the Hawaii-based sunglasses company that ran humorous national ads depicting two helmet-haired ladies as representing ''all these women in Jersey'' who are ''using so much hair spray'' that the earth's ozone layer is being destroyed:</p>
        <p>Get a life, Maui Jim.</p>
        <p>According to the experts, big hair -- while still popular in the South, the Midwest and, yes, Hawaii -- has been hopelessly out of style for nearly a decade in New Jersey. Hair spray sales are declining, in favor of conditioners and other liquid rinses. Jersey women have been maligned.</p>
        <p>''As the only state in the union with a woman as Governor, New Jersey is home to stylish, progressive and intelligent women,'' Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Teaneck, wrote in a letter she fired off to Maui Jim, the Hawaii sunglasses company, after seeing the ad in an airline magazine. When Governor Whitman followed up with her own protest last week, the ad was dropped, with an apology to ''the fine women of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>I spoke briefly the other day with Assemblywoman Weinberg to pose a hypothetical question: Just for comparison, who uses more hair spray? Governor Whitman or, say, Jack Kemp?</p>
        <p>''Kemp, no contest,'' she chuckled. ''Listen, I'd talk to you longer, but I'm a Jersey girl. I have to go get my hair done.''</p>
        <p>Within the fashion-poster-covered walls of hair academia, there is strong agreement that big hair and the chemicals to hold it up are history. The other afternoon, at the Artistic Academy of Hair Design in Fair Lawn, the new freshman class was spilling out merrily into the parking lot at dismissal time. Hair blew free in the breeze, with not a frozen bouffant in sight.</p>
        <p>The supervisor of the 200-student school is Noreen Schubert. Stylish, trim and middle-aged, she pointed out class pictures arrayed on the walls showing graduates over the years. The big-haired Class of 1987 looked like a casting call for a John Waters movie. The Class of 1995 looked like a casting call for ''Friends.''</p>
        <p>''See? Most of it's now short hair, cut straight. Nothing poufy,'' said Ms. Schubert, who wears her own dark auburn hair at wispy, layered shoulder length.</p>
        <p>New Jersey fashion has always been strongly influenced by New York and international trends, she said. Furthermore, she added, women now insist on knowing what's in the beauty products they use. ''Years ago, nobody told us what was in the bottle -- what they were going to do to your hair, let alone some ozone layer,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So it is not a good time for hair spray. Nationally, retail sales of hair spray totaled about $750 million in 1995, according to Lenka Contreras of Kline &amp; Company, a consumer-product research firm based in Fairfield, who added: ''The market for hair spray has been declining about 2 1/2 percent annually for the last five years. This has a lot to do with a trend toward straight-looking, less made-up hair.''</p>
        <p>Irene Malbin, a spokeswoman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, a Washington-based trade group, said that the Maui Jim ad not only took ''a very unfair shot at New Jersey women,'' it also maligned the whole hair-care industry. ''Our industry was among the first to work with the E.P.A. to reformulate products to reduce harmful emissions,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It is, however, a good time for beauty parlors, of which there are more than 212,000 in the United States, according to American Salon, the industry's trade magazine.</p>
        <p>New Jersey (population 7.9 million) has 9,147 of them, according to the State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling. (In one half-mile stretch of Broad Street in Bloomfield last week, I counted 11 hair salons among the 60 small businesses.) But in sheer numbers, New Jersey is outranked by California (population 35.6 million), which has 25,500 beauty salons; Texas (18.7 million), with 14,800; New York (18.3 million), with 12,590; Florida (14.3 million), with 11,462, and Illinois (11.9 million), with 9,210.</p>
        <p>But attitude, not numbers, is what counts. Take Jyoti Gursahaney, 20, a student teacher at the Artistic Academy, who wears her luxuriant black hair loose and natural.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty new to this country,'' said Ms. Gursahaney, who came here from India about six years ago. ''I moved to Jersey and became a Jersey girl. And we stay up with the fashion trends.''</p>
        <p>''It's shags now, long layers,'' Ms. Schubert said.</p>
        <p>''I just hate big hair,'' Ms. Gursahaney added, wrinkling her nose.</p>
        <p>''Jersey girls!'' Ms. Schubert said. ''You can't beat 'em.''</p>
