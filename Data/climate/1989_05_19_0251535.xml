        <p>LEAD: A report on New York State's energy needs warned today that additional generating capacity must be built within three years but cautioned that reliance on traditional energy sources will cause ''alarming'' increases in acid rain and other airborne pollution.</p>
        <p>A report on New York State's energy needs warned today that additional generating capacity must be built within three years but cautioned that reliance on traditional energy sources will cause ''alarming'' increases in acid rain and other airborne pollution.</p>
        <p>The report called for the state and Federal governments to take stringent steps to reduce energy demand and to control air pollution, including the adoption of strict auto emission standards and the increased use of natural gas instead of coal and oil.</p>
        <p>The report, released today as a draft recommendation, projected that overall energy use in New York would grow by 26 percent over the next two decades if steps are not taken to curb demand.</p>
        <p>Overall, the report, the Draft New York State Energy Plan, strongly emphasized the need to combine energy planning with concern for the environment. 'Real Departure'</p>
        <p>''Energy policy development has to be integrated with environmental policy goals,'' said Charles R. Guinn, a deputy commissioner of the State Energy Office who oversaw drafting of the report. ''You can't - as I think we do at the national level - go on separate tracks.''</p>
        <p>Thomas C. Jorling, the State Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said the report, which his agency helped draft, was a ''real departure from other state energy plans and other energy planning in general.''</p>
        <p>''Historically, energy planning and often energy decision-making has been independent of environmental considerations,'' he said. ''Because of that we have had to take very costly actions to remediate problems after the fact, such as acid rain and global warming.'' Energy Efficiency</p>
        <p>The study was requested by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in December 1988. The first statewide assessment and energy plan since late 1982, it calls for changes in state and Federal energy policy, including the following:</p>
        <p>* Increasing emphasis on energy efficiency. The draft calls for the Federal Government to support higher mileage standards for automobiles and trucks and more aggressive standards for appliances. It also advocates more ambitious state codes for buildings.</p>
        <p>* Reducing such pollutants as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide by building more natural-gas-fired generating plants and adopting auto-emission standards like those adopted by California. ''Clearly, the projected increases of these emissions are not acceptable,'' the report stated.</p>
        <p>* Providing additional generating capacity by requiring the state's large, investor-owned utilities to compete with small, independent power producers and other energy suppliers. Such a plan, already mandated by the State Public Service Commission, should also give priority to environmentally benign projects. Public Hearings</p>
        <p>''Fortunately, the projected increases in energy demand, imported oil dependence, fossil fuel consumption and air emissions are not inevitable,'' the report said. ''Actions by the Federal and state governments, industries, commercial establishments and individual consumers can change these trends.''</p>
        <p>Today's staff recommendations will be subject to further public hearings after which Mr. Jorling; the State Commissioner of Energy, William D. Cotter, and the chairman of the State Public Service Commission, Peter A. Bradford, will issue a final recommendation to Mr. Cuomo.</p>
        <p>Once accepted by the Governor, state agencies will be mandated to follow the plan, and independent commissions like the Public Service Commission, will be directed to give high priority to recommendations in the plan, officials said.</p>
        <p>Reaction to the study was generally favorable from both industry representatives and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>''The State Energy Office has always been pretty good at being environmentally aware,'' said Warren Liebold, president of the Environmental Planning Lobby, ''but this report brings even stronger awareness than had existed in the past.''</p>
        <p>And Steven P. Chwiecko, the present of the Independent Power Producers of New York, an industry group, said the report signaled that the state is ''getting much more realistic about capacity needs and the timing of those needs.'' Increased Demand</p>
        <p>Demand for energy, the report stated, is projected to increase in all areas because of a growing economy, swelling personal incomes and a corresponding growth in the number of households in the state. Electric use will soar by 53 percent in the next two decades, the report forecasts, adding that highway travel will also climb by 68 percent.</p>
        <p>In addition, the report said that efficiency improvements in buildings, vehicles, furnaces, boilers, industrial equipment, lighting and appliances ''are not projected to keep pace with energy demand. ''A severe and sustained real energy price increase, especially an oil price increase, would result in greater efficiency improvements, but such a price increase is not projected,'' it said.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration on Wednesday took action on a recommendation in the report, more demanding fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, but fell far short of the standard that state officials said must be reached to reduce energy consumption. The Administration decided not to reduce the 27.5-mile-per-gallon average for a manufacturer's cars. The auto industry expressed disappointment, but environmentalists welcomed the decision.</p>
        <p>''The Administration's decision is only a palliative,'' Mr. Jorling said. ''To get serious, we have to get up into the 50-miles-per-gallon range if we are to make significant inroads on not just imported oil, but also on global warming and any improvement in acid rain.''</p>
