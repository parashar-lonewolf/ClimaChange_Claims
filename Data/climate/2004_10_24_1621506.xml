        <p>FORGET superheroes and the flame-throwing marionettes of ''Team America.'' Bruce Mau wants you to know that designers are going to save the world.</p>
        <p>Known for his groundbreaking graphic design work for Zone Books in the 1980's and for collaborations with the architects Rem Koolhaas and Frank Gehry, Mr. Mau is a leading member of a profession that is sometimes known for its jaded, glass-half-empty point of view.</p>
        <p>''The designers I know,'' Mr. Mau said, ''are always complaining that they don't have any power.''</p>
        <p>But in ''Massive Change,'' a visually jam-packed, color-saturated exhibition that opened earlier this month at the Vancouver Art Gallery, Mr. Mau paints a remarkably upbeat picture of the ways that design of all varieties promises to improve the human condition.</p>
        <p>''In nearly every field that design touches, the long-term developments that we can see are hugely positive,'' Mr. Mau, 44, explained on a recent afternoon, wearing his standard uniform of an untucked black shirt, black pants and white sneakers.</p>
        <p>He was in the exhibition's opening room on the first floor of the museum, an ornate, neo-Classical building that opened in 1907 as a courthouse. Behind him, nearly every inch of wall space, from floor to ceiling, was covered with words. In a typeface chosen (naturally) by Mr. Mau -- Helvetica Neue bold condensed -- the text trumpeted the show's central theme: ''a change in global design culture so audaciously hopeful, so advanced, so optimistic, so generous and so global that we call our project Massive Change.''</p>
        <p>You can stop worrying about global warming, the displays in the next rooms suggest. The same goes for homelessness, oppressive governments and even traffic jams. Or rather: Make sure to pay attention as designers dispense with these problems in coming years, with solutions ranging from vegetables modified to become edible vaccines to sleek, factory-built housing for 21st-century megacities. In ''Massive Change,'' anybody who helps develop the capacity for progress qualifies as a designer, whether it's a computer scientist working on open-source software or an animal breeder creating a featherless chicken better able to survive in hot climates.</p>
        <p>That broad-based approach -- and the fluidity of Mr. Mau's own career as a graphics expert, a design-world impresario and now a curator -- has made it tough for some people here to get a sense of what awaits them inside the museum.</p>
        <p>''I've had friends say, 'What is this ''Massive Change'' thing?''' said Kathleen Bartels, director of the Vancouver Art Gallery, a job she took in 2001 after six years as assistant director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. She always begins her answer by mentioning that Mr. Mau is from Toronto. ''People here are very particular about who's Canadian and who isn't,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then she does her best to describe an exhibition that seems to resist definition. ''We tried to step back from just putting together a list of objects, from looking at a beautifully designed car or skateboard,'' she said. ''The show has more to do with what we can say about what design is making possible. So instead of looking at architecture we look at urbanism. Instead of graphic design we look at information.''</p>
        <p>The show's upbeat pragmatism is inspired by a somewhat unlikely source: the English historian Arnold Toynbee, who died in 1975. In a quotation Mr. Mau came across nearly three years ago, Toynbee predicted, ''The 20th century will be chiefly remembered by future generations not as an era of political conflicts or technical inventions, but as an age in which human society dared to think of the welfare of the whole human race as a practical objective.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mau knows that sentence by heart, and he recites it like a poem to anybody who will listen. It is practically a thesis statement for the exhibition, which remains here until Jan. 3 and then travels to Toronto and Chicago. A New York stop is also being planned.</p>
        <p>''My whole desire to organize this project grew out of this disjunction I was feeling,'' Mr. Mau said. ''On the one hand, the mood of the day seemed to be very negative around the world,'' especially among his colleagues in the design professions. ''But at the same time,'' he said, ''I saw designers doing work with the capacity absolutely to change the world. And when I read that quote I said: 'That's exactly what I'm seeing designers working on. That's the pattern. That's our project.'''</p>
        <p>''The most important part are the words 'practical objective,''' he added. ''That changes what Toynbee was talking about from a utopian project to a design project. It becomes something we can not just dream about but undertake.''</p>
        <p>Still, the resulting exhibition -- which is accompanied by a book published by Phaidon, a Web site (www.massivechange.com) and a research project with students from George Brown Toronto City College -- is a good deal more visually exciting and less wonky than it might have been.</p>
        <p>This is especially surprising when you consider that Mr. Mau and his collaborators decided to dispense with the two building blocks of any traditional design exhibition. First, they agreed to ''take aesthetics off the table,'' as Mr. Mau put it, choosing designs not for their formal appeal as objects but for the changes they make possible. ''The image most of us have of design is a discrete object,'' he said, ''a single thing, a product, a form. But design is no longer about that. It's absolutely become the opposite, which is about the plural, the collective, the distributed project.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Mau, it makes little sense to pull individual objects out of their social and political contexts to put them on a pedestal. ''There's this old notion of objects being somehow separate from their environments, from the flows that produce them and support them and absorb them,'' he said. ''That idea is over.''</p>
        <p>The few objects on display in ''Massive Change'' tend to represent inventions or medical breakthroughs, like a teardrop-shaped device that purifies water simply by evaporation or a titanium socket for shoulder replacement surgery. The rest of the show is heavy on eye-popping information graphics: The potential solar power that remains untapped in the world's poorest countries, for example, or how many Philippine political protesters were roused to march by a simple cellphone text message.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mau and his team also decided that they would do without the focus on different disciplines that helps to organize most design shows. Instead of dividing the exhibition into rooms devoted to graphic designers, industrial designers and so on, they created a rubric for the entire show: ''design economies,'' realms where, as Mr. Mau put it, ''design is shaping how we experience the world,'' usually for the better.</p>
        <p>Each room of the exhibition examines a design economy, from energy to movement to information. ''We will seamlessly integrate all supply and demand around the world,'' the section on global markets declares. ''We will eradicate poverty,'' the one on wealth and politics says. Near the end, the exhibition includes ballot boxes and questions viewers about issues like genetically modified crops: ''Should we be doing this?''</p>
        <p>There are times when Mr. Mau, in describing ''Massive Change'' and its aims, falls into a recitation of well-rehearsed sound bites (''The show is not about the world of design, but about the design of the world'') or bits of jargon (''What we have to discover is, Where are the vectors pointing?''). But there is no doubting his enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Mau's educated optimism may be the most radical part of ''Massive Change.'' That is particularly true in Canada, where issues like globalization and biotechnology -- both of which the exhibition endorses, at least implicitly -- cause even more anxiety than in the United States.</p>
        <p>''We've all been beaten down so much by a cynical outlook that it's sometimes impossible to see the positive developments that are out there,'' said Bruce Grenville, a senior curator at the Vancouver Art Gallery who helped oversee the exhibition.</p>
        <p>Proof of that comes near the end of the show, where Mr. Mau has left a giant wall blank and provided pens and paper so that visitors can leave their own remarks. The wall has only one bit of official text; it asks viewers, ''Now that we can do anything, what will we do?''</p>
        <p>On the exhibition's opening day, the wall was already filling up with replies. And many of them, despite Mr. Mau's best efforts, were profoundly negative, even nihilistic, suggesting a few cracks in the designer's rose-colored crystal ball.</p>
        <p>''More of the same, unfortunately,'' one suggested. ''Whatever,'' read another. ''Watch TV, I guess.''</p>
        <p>And then the cruelest of all: ''Watch the world crash and burn. It's a little too late, methinks.''</p>
