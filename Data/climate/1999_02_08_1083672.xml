        <p>When most buses accelerate, they labor, lumber and roar, spewing clouds of choking exhaust as their heavy diesel engines struggle to drag along 24 tons or so. But a new bus rolling out of a sailboat factory here, hums at a constant tone, never emits visible exhaust and runs on about half the horsepower a compact car needs.</p>
        <p>It may look like a bus, but it is also a performance vehicle. Floor it, said Stephen A. Misencik, the chief designer, and ''we can almost smoke the tires.''</p>
        <p>The bus, a 30-foot model that will enter service soon as a shuttle between terminals at Logan Airport in Boston, is powered by two electric motors, one for each rear wheel, and a natural gas engine. More fiberglass than steel, it is two-thirds the weight of a regular bus. The prototype cost about $1 million. A conventional full-size bus costs $225,000 to $275,000. With other designers pushing in the same direction, and mass production, the cost of the hybrid bus is expected to drop.</p>
        <p>Some of the most creative work in reducing air pollution is being seen in the design of buses, which are big enough to accommodate bulky new components and whose buyers are often governments eager to buy antipollution technologies.</p>
        <p>''Transit agencies are under more and more pressure to get off diesel,'' said Sheila Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a nonprofit agency that helped finance the design and assembly of the new bus with money from the Pentagon. ''Government agencies are reviewing all their options,'' said Ms. Lynch, who pointed out that Boston has decided not to buy any new diesel buses, and that in New York City, the Natural Resources Defense Council is on a campaign to win the same promise from local officials.</p>
        <p>The new bus here is the brainchild of Everett A. Pearson, who looked at the standard 30-foot bus, which weighs about 23,500 pounds without passengers, and decided it needed to go on a diet. He kept the metal in the axles and the wheels, but hardly anywhere else. It weighs 16,200 pounds.</p>
        <p>The rest of the manufacturing world may not be ready for such a weight drop. Mr. Misencik, a mechanical engineer, said that finding lightweight, mass-produced axles, hinges and other parts was sometimes impossible: The door weighs only 28 pounds but the lightest hinge available is too heavy, because it is designed for a 98-pound door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson founded Pearson Yachts with a cousin in 1957 but later sold the company. John Walton, of the Wal-Mart fortune, owns part of his current company, TPI Composites. Among TPI products are modular bathrooms for passenger trains and hot tubs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson spent about $500,000 of the company's money on the bus that will go to Boston. The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, a nonprofit agency that distributes grants, also invested $500,000.</p>
        <p>Building a large fiberglass chassis involved several innovations. Local air pollution officials in Rhode Island insisted on a change, Mr. Pearson said, that led to one of them. The traditional method of making fiberglass is to lay out fabric woven from glass fibers and slather it with resins -- but the resins give off gases during manufacturing that help cause smog. Under pressure from Rhode Island, Mr. Pearson invested in a patented system of pumping the resin into the material while it is in a vacuum. The result: a stronger finished product with more glass, less resin and no air bubbles, which are a source of structural weakness.</p>
        <p>He said that TPI had also improved a method for increasing the ability of fiberglass to withstand compression, so bolts could be inserted without weakening the structure.</p>
        <p>The weight reduction achieved by using fiberglass is only half of the innovation. The other half is the hybrid electric-natural gas drive system. Hybrid systems use less fuel and produce fewer emissions than diesel engines. Both Toyota and Honda plan to introduce cars with hybrid systems soon.</p>
        <p>New York City has been using five hybrid buses with conventional steel bodies since September, and plans to buy 10 more. They run on the M-5 route along Riverside Drive, and the M-60 route from the Upper West Side to La Guardia Airport. Most riders notice the low floors because they do not have to climb steps into the bus.</p>
        <p>''The reaction of our bus drivers has been overwhelmingly positive,'' said Albert W. O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit. Maintenance is easier, too, he said, because drivers of New York's hybrid buses do not make much use of the brakes. To stop, they press the brake pedal, turning their drive motors into generators, which slow the bus and convert that energy into electricity that flows back into the battery.</p>
        <p>A conventional bus the size of the hybrid bus would need a 190-horsepower diesel engine. The hybrid bus, with 68 horsepower, has two large electric motors, powered by batteries charged continuously by a generator, which in turn is powered by the small natural gas engine. Natural gas is far cleaner than diesel. And this engine, fueled by natural gas, runs at a constant speed, which is the engine's ''sweet spot,'' at which it returns the most energy from fuel.</p>
        <p>The result is a huge reduction in energy use. And the TPI bus produces 58 percent less carbon dioxide as a diesel model than do conventional buses with diesel engines.</p>
        <p>But changing the bus industry is not easy and the first big contract, from North American Bus Industries, of Anniston, Ala., a major manufacturer, will be for bus bodies that will accept conventional diesel drivetrains. N.A.B.I. signed a $6 million contract to buy several bodies, plus tooling and technical information so it can build more. Some will be 40 feet long, like a standard city bus, and others 45 feet, like a Greyhound coach. Once N.A.B.I. is comfortable with the fiberglass bodies, Mr. Misencik hopes to persuade the company to try one with a hybrid engine.</p>
