        <p>WEALTH can be a curse, and not just for the spoiled progeny of corporate executives and movie stars. Economists have long suspected that natural wealth -- oil, minerals and the like -- undermine the prospects for growth in less developed countries.</p>
        <p>That may run against all common sense, but Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner of Harvard's Institute for International Development have now documented the impact. In an as-yet-unpublished research paper, they offer a variety of possible explanations. The best of them appears to be that natural resource exports interfere with the development of industry and the export-oriented manufacturing that, according to Mr. Sachs, seems to be the most promising "way out of poverty."</p>
        <p>The two economists used standard statistical techniques to tease out the impact of a variety of factors influencing growth in developing countries from 1971 through 1989. Not surprisingly, they found that rates of investment, the openness of markets to competition from imports and bureaucratic competence -- a proxy for the absence of corruption and the efficiency of government -- all played a part. So, too, did the level of income at the beginning of the period. That confirmed the so-called convergence theory that playing catch-up in the race to affluence is easier than being the leader.</p>
        <p>But the availability of natural wealth, here measured as the ratio of raw material and primary product exports to national income, depressed growth rates. And not just by a smidgen: a 10 percent higher ratio of natural exports to national income is associated with a 56 percent lower rate of economic growth. Indeed, only three resource-rich developing countries -- Malaysia, Mauritius and Botswana -- managed to average 3 percent growth across the last two decades.</p>
        <p>What could be going on here? It isn't just the performance of the Persian Gulf economies, virtually all of which shrank in the last two decades in spite of their off-the-charts abundance of fossil fuels. The broad statistical relationship between resource abundance and tepid growth holds, even when the Middle East oil exporters are excluded from the sample.</p>
        <p>Nor should it give aid and comfort to the followers of Raoul Prebisch, an Argentine economist much in vogue in the 1950's and 1960's, who argued that primary products producers were doomed to fall behind because the value of their exports would fall over time. In fact, the purchasing power of raw materials has risen -- a pound of cotton and a barrel of oil buy more clothing or computer chips than they did a half-century ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sachs and Mr. Warner wonder whether the debilitating effect of resource wealth works indirectly through other factors affecting growth. Natural wealth can lead to corruption and red tape. Look no further than Nigeria or Indonesia.</p>
        <p>It may also encourage efforts to diversify domestic production by protecting domestic manufacturers -- Mr. Prebisch's flawed formula for progress. Australia, Argentina and Canada are good examples of countries that have nursed inefficient industries at great cost to living standards. But in statistical tests, the two economists found that these indirect routes to slow growth explained relatively little of the impact.</p>
        <p>A more promising explanation goes under the rubric of "Dutch disease." If natural resources are cheap and plentiful -- as in the Netherlands of the 1970's, after the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea -- they crowd out other potential exports. In an extreme case like Saudi Arabia, virtually all manufactures are imported since wages are far too high to support production of goods that can be imported.</p>
        <p>But Dutch disease is not a true pathology unless the failure to produce manufactured goods in a competitive environment somehow inhibits long- term development. One possibility is that economic productivity must be learned by doing. If manufacturers cannot compete to begin with, the argument goes, they may never get enough experience to become competitive.</p>
        <p>Another is "linkages": manufacturing may be the key to development because it stimulates the growth of modern distribution systems and capital markets. It may also generate a demand for the sorts of skills that spill over to other businesses. "You just don't know how the world really works without going into the world market," Mr. Sachs said.</p>
        <p>Howard Pack, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, sharpens the focus. Exporting raw materials produces little or no backwash of knowledge from abroad. Export-oriented manufacturing, by contrast, "forces you to obtain the foreign technology to remain competitive," he argues.</p>
        <p>Thus in Mr. Pack's view the engine of economic growth is powered by the transfer of technology. And natural wealth can be a curse because it disrupts this lifeline to modernity.</p>
