        <p>Every suburban parking lot is stacked with minivans and sport utility vehicles that do nothing remotely connected with commercial hauling or farming. Yet these vehicles of choice for a multitude of families and commuters are classified as light trucks by Federal regulators, allowing them to escape the Federal pollution and fuel economy standards that apply to cars.</p>
        <p>The light-truck category was created decades ago when most vehicles in this category, such as pickup trucks, were indeed used for agricultural or commercial purposes. But when regulators classified the Chrysler minivan as a light truck in the early 1980's, they created a giant loophole that now threatens to compromise Government efforts to conserve fuel, control smog and reduce carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming.</p>
        <p>In almost every way, Federal law regulates these vehicles -- which are mostly used as passenger cars -- more loosely than actual cars. While consumers like them for their power, less than 15 percent of all sport utility vehicles are used for towing or other truck-like activities.</p>
        <p>Even so, most of these vehicles are allowed to emit nearly twice the smog-causing nitrous oxides as cars. They need only meet a fuel economy standard of 20.7 miles per gallon, compared with an average 27.5 miles per gallon for all the cars produced by a given manufacturer. They are exempt from gas-guzzler taxes that apply to cars getting less than 22.5 miles per gallon. The larger light trucks are also exempt from luxury taxes, which apply to cars costing more than $36,000, though many deluxe trucks can cost even more.</p>
        <p>The regulatory and tax benefits of these vehicles, coupled with consumer demand for roomier transportation, have created an enormous light-truck market that now represents 40 percent of all family vehicles sold. Sales will probably reach 50 percent of the passenger market in the next five years, pushing up emissions from these less efficient, dirtier vehicles.</p>
        <p>Even though there are still twice as many cars on the road as light trucks, the trucks produce as much total carbon dioxide as cars because they burn more fuel. By 2010 these trucks may produce up to 75 percent of the smog-causing pollutants and 63 percent of the carbon emissions coming out of personal vehicle tailpipes. Unless there is some regulatory change, light trucks will be the largest and fastest-growing contributor to transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Analysts at the Environmental Protection Agency have been tracking the problem for some time. Yet tightening the loophole has been considered so difficult politically that even environmentalists have shied away from joining the battle. But a global warming treaty that would commit the United States to reducing greenhouse emissions within 15 years may finally force Congress and the Administration to look at controlling the light-truck factor.</p>
        <p>This would not mean doing away with the light-truck category. Regulators need to come up with a more discriminating definition for trucks, perhaps requiring them to have certain structural characteristics that many minivans and sport utility vehicles would not meet. If a light truck is nothing more than an extra-big family car, as is true of most vehicles in that category today, it should have to meet the pollution and efficiency standards that apply to cars. Anything less will leave a loophole big enough to drive a truck through.</p>
