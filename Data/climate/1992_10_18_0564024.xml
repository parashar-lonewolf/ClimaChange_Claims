        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We in the Tennessee Valley found that S. David Freeman's guessing ("An Energy Prophet Who Guessed Right," Sept. 27) was not as good as ratepayers in the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, for which he now works, might hope.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman was chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority for nearly four years. During that time, our residential electric rates doubled and industrial rates went up by 133 percent. In 1981, President Reagan replaced Mr. Freeman as chairman, although he served on the T.V.A. board until 1984.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Marvin Runyon, named T.V.A. chairman in 1988, vowed to put the authority on a businesslike basis. Nonessential programs were terminated and other economies were effected.  Electric rates have remained stable for the past six years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeman's prophecies -- based on the continued availability of cheap natural gas, increased conservation and exploiting renewable energy sources -- should be viewed with skepticism.  FRANK R. BRUCE Oak Ridge, Tenn., Oct. 5  Frank R. Bruce is a retired associate director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
