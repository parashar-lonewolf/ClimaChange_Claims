        <p>LEAD: ARCO, the largest seller of gasoline in Southern California, introduced a new unleaded premium today that it says emits fewer pollutants into the air than other fuels of its type.</p>
        <p>Fuel Was Reformulated</p>
        <p>Last September, ARCO was the first oil company to replace leaded gasoline at its California pumps with a reformulated fuel that cut pollution from cars manufactured before 1975. Other oil companies followed. ARCO's newest fuel will replace the company's Super Unleaded at more than 700 locations selling ARCO gasoline from Santa Barbara, Calif., to the Mexican border. The company will expand availability to other areas in the West where it markets gasoline in several years, once its ability to manufacture reformulated fuel is enlarged.</p>
        <p>The Shell Oil Company, the Chevron Corporation and the Exxon Corporation have all introduced reformulated unleaded premium gasolines within the last year, but ARCO said EC-Premium burned cleaner because it contained more oxygen than the others, cutting down on carbon monoxide emissions. It also has a lower content of benzene and other pollutants, ARCO said.</p>
        <p>''This is two or three steps beyond,'' said Herbert W. Bruch, technical director of the National Petroleum Refiners Association in Washington. ''It's what I would classify a very good reformulated gasoline.''</p>
        <p>Company Will Absorb Cost</p>
        <p>The new gasoline, which generates up to a third less pollutants than conventional premium gasoline, will cost ARCO about 4 cents more a gallon to manufacture than its conventional premium, but the company said consumers would pay no more at the pump. ARCO plans to absorb the cost.</p>
        <p>Lodwrick M. Cook, ARCO's chairman, said he hoped the new gasoline would improve profits by increasing the company's market share.</p>
        <p>ARCO has always paid close attention to its public image. By introducing the first reformulated regular gasoline last year, the company helped make gasoline appear environmentally competitive with cleaner alternatives like methanol.</p>
        <p>Bid to Combat Perception</p>
        <p>During the first weeks of the Persian Gulf crisis, ARCO was the first company to temporarily freeze wholesale gasoline prices in an effort to combat the perception that oil companies were gouging consumers by quickly raising prices.</p>
        <p>A major component in ARCO's newest gasoline is methyl tertiary butyl ether, known as MTBE, which helps convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. ARCO said that in several years, when the nation's supply of MTBE is large enough, the company would reformulate its biggest-selling gasoline, unleaded regular, which accounts for about 60 percent of ARCO's gasoline sales. The rest are divided evenly between leaded and unleaded premium.</p>
        <p>Since introducing its reformulated leaded regular gasoline last year, ARCO said it increased its share of that market by 3 percent.</p>
