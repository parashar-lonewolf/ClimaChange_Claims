        <p>LEAD: Growing concerns about air pollution and the greenhouse effect have stirred new interest in fuel cells, devices that generate electricity through chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Growing concerns about air pollution and the greenhouse effect have stirred new interest in fuel cells, devices that generate electricity through chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>The appeal of fuel cells is clear. They are quiet, they produce little pollution, and they are more efficient than conventional power plants at converting the energy in coal, oil and natural gas into electricity.</p>
        <p>But for nearly 30 years, high costs and the reluctance of both equipment manufacturers and electric utilities to plunge into new generating technologies - after disappointments with nuclear power - have kept the cells always on the horizon. Fuel-cell advocates say the time may now be right to overcome those obstacles.</p>
        <p>The business spotlight is on the leader in the technology, the International Fuel Cells Corporation, a division of the United Technologies Corporation that is based here. I.F.C. has 53 orders for 200-kilowatt generating stations to be delivered in the early 1990's. But the company, which became involved with fuel cells through its work for the United States space program, has been reluctant to invest heavily in developing a business of supplying utilities.</p>
        <p>Company executives say that before they start a production line they need about 100 orders, to bring average costs down, plus the financial and technical support of a partner familiar with the utility industry.</p>
        <p>Other manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Japan are continuing to investigate fuel cell technology. I.F.C. says Japan's Fuji Electric Company has made the most progress toward developing competing models, spurred by five orders from Japan for I.F.C. fuel-cell plants of various sizes.</p>
        <p>A 200-kilowatt generator could supply enough power to serve a 30-unit apartment building or a small factory. Initial commercial applications are expected in instances in which a natural gas utility, already supplying an industrial plant, offers electric power as part of a complete package.</p>
        <p>The concept of a fuel cell was described as far back as 1839, although the first practical applications came in the United States space program of the 1960's. Fuel cells provided power for the Gemini and Apollo missions and three fuel-cell units generate the on-board electricity for the space shuttles.</p>
        <p>A fuel cell is a form of continuously operating battery. Inside the cell, a fuel, typically hydrogen, is passed over a negatively charged pole, or anode, where electrons are stripped off through catalytic action. The hydrogen ions that result then flow through conducting substances known as electrolytes toward a positively charge pole, or cathode.</p>
        <p>The electron flow produces an electric current. The hydrogen ions are left to combine at the cathode with oxygen, producing heat and water. The oxygen needed for the reaction can usually be taken directly from the air around the fuel cell.</p>
        <p>Since the fuel is not burned in a conventional sense, there are no pollutants; in a cell with pure hydrogen and oxygen, water is the only byproduct. In others, depending on the fuel used, carbon dioxide is also produced, although in smaller quantities than from conventional processes.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the proposed air-pollution regulations in Southern California, they are pretty draconian,'' said Edward Gillis, a project manager at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Fuel cells may be the only game going there.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cells are also more efficient than conventional power plants at converting hydrocarbons into electricity, because they do so through a direct chemical reaction. In a conventional plant, hydrocarbons are burned to boil water, creating steam that drives a turbine to generate electricity. Some energy is lost with each step.</p>
        <p>''A conventional power plant is 34 or 35 percent efficient,'' said Manville Mayfield, a researcher at the Department of Energy's technical center in Morgantown, W.Va. ''A fuel cell is as much as 45 percent efficient.''</p>
        <p>The fuel cell's advantage can be even greater if waste heat is captured in the form of steam and used to drive a conventional generator. Then the efficiency soars to between 70 and 80 percent, advocates say. Moreover, they say, the steam produced by a fuel cell is generally cleaner than that in a normal power plant, causing less corrosion.</p>
        <p>There are many kinds of fuel cells, each with attributes and drawbacks. The ones used in the space program have a solution of potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and operate on pure hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
        <p>Pure hydrogen and oxygen would be too expensive for ordinary power generation. Worse still, even the small amounts of carbon dioxide in the air will destroy the type of fuel cell used in space.</p>
        <p>I.F.C.'s most commercially advanced models use phosphoric acid as the electrolyte. They take oxygen from the air and use hydrocarbons drawn from oil or gas wells as fuel. The hydrocarbons are treated in a device called a reformer to create a supply of unattached hydrogen atoms. The 200-kilowatt generators that I.F.C. is preparing to build use phosphoric acid, as have the units, some of them larger, sold to Japan.</p>
        <p>Using a petroleum-based fuel instead of pure hydrogen results in the emission of carbon dioxide, the gas believed responsible for much of the greenhouse effect. But because of the greater efficiency of fuel cells, less is emitted per unit of power than from conventional generators.</p>
        <p>Two other types of fuel cells are under development. One uses molten lithium, potassium and sodium carbonates as the electrolyte and operates at a temperature of about 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with about 400 degrees for the phosphoric acid types. Molten carbonate cells could have electric conversion efficiencies as high as 57 percent and could free the hydrogen atoms from fuels without the need for a reformer.</p>
        <p>Also emerging from the laboratory is a cell that does away with messy, corrosive liquids and uses solid zirconium oxide as the electrolyte. It operates even hotter - about 1,800 degrees - producing steam that can be used to run either heating or cooling equipment. But fabrication of the cells is difficult, and the technology is still being developed.</p>
        <p>A typical commercial unit today consists of three main parts. At the front is the reformer, in which high-temperature steam is used to convert hydrocarbon fuel into relatively pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Then comes the cell itself, actually a stack of hundreds of small cells wired together to increase voltage.</p>
        <p>The power that emerges is direct current, the kind that runs battery-powered devices. Since most electrical devices run on alternating current, the third main component is an inverter, which converts direct current into utility-quality alternating current.</p>
        <p>Because they are made of many small cells rather than the boilers and turbines of conventional plants, fuel-cell systems can be built to fit an application. And since they are clean, quiet and need only a pipe to bring in fuel, they can be good neighbors.</p>
        <p>''A fuel cell plant can be sited in a city next to an office building,'' said Daniel G. Lewis, director of technical services for the American Public Power Association, a trade group for local utilities.</p>
        <p>The association and I.F.C. failed last year to agree on terms for developing 11-megawatt generators, which would have more than 50 times the capacity of I.F.C.'s 200-kilowatt units but about 1 percent of the capacity of a large nuclear power plant. The association then asked other manufacturers to submit proposals. Four were received and are being evaluated, association officials said.</p>
        <p>Those familiar with the situation say the chief barrier to more widespread use of fuel cells has long been economics rather than technology. Lower oil prices in the 1980's reduced the pressure on electric companies to seek new forms of generation, and problems with nuclear power threw all new technology into question.</p>
        <p>In addition, the cost of being a pioneer is high. In its proposal, the public power group said early units might cost $1,500 to $2,000 per kilowatt of power, or $22 million for an 11-megawatt unit. The group believes the price has to be cut to $800 to $1,000 a kilowatt to be competitive with conventional generation.</p>
        <p>Willaim Podolny, chairman of I.F.C., agrees that it is a tough sell. ''We are asking them to pay two and a half times what makes sense,'' he said. ''That's a stretch for gas utilities that have to fight with regulatory commissions just to sell power.''</p>
        <p>Gas companies, seeing both an opportunity to broaden their market and a way to compete with electric utilities, are the main backers of I.F.C.'s 200-kilowatt project. All of the orders received so far have been from gas distributors in the United States, Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>A revised Clean Air Act, expected within a year, could force more utilities to consider fuel cells and other low-pollution methods of power generation. ''It all depends on the criteria they set,'' Mr. Podolny said. ''If they do it the way they did with automobiles - that utilities must be more efficient in generation and must get down to some level of emissions -then people will start spending money on new technology.''
