        <p>Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a minivan.</p>
        <p>It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car.</p>
        <p>But officials at DaimlerChrysler A.G. have decided that as far as Federal regulations are concerned, their lightweight, fuel-sipping vehicle is a truck and not a car. ''We certainly are intending to have this classified as a light truck,'' said Jan Zverina, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler has chosen to call the Cruiser a truck because of breaks it can get under the complex system of separate Federal fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.</p>
        <p>Counting the Cruiser as a light truck stands to improve the average fuel economy of the entire fleet of DaimlerChrysler's light trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups. The more Cruisers DaimlerChrysler sells, the more big, high-profit sport utilities and pickups it can sell while still meeting the gas mileage averages required by law.</p>
        <p>After heavy lobbying by the auto industry, the Senate is expected on Wednesday to extend a four-year-old ban that prevents the Clinton Administration from studying or changing these two-decade-old fuel economy regulations. Meanwhile, auto makers are preparing to introduce as many as two dozen vehicles with car-based designs in the coming years and to ask that many of them to be certified as light trucks.</p>
        <p>Two car-based sport utility vehicles, the Toyota RAV-4 and the Honda CR-V, have been on the market in limited numbers for two years and are categorized as light trucks. BMW A.G. will start selling its car-based sport utility vehicle, the X5, in December and has asked that it be certified as a light truck. Next spring, the Ford Motor Company will put on sale the Escape, a small sport utility vehicle that is based on the Ford Contour compact sedan. And the Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Saturn and Chevrolet divisions of the General Motors Corporation are all developing models that will combine car and light truck features, although G.M. has not said when they will go on sale.</p>
        <p>Auto executives say that Americans want automobiles that combine the rugged appearance of a light truck with the handling and easy access of a car. The new models are not being created for fuel-economy reasons, said Lawrence D. Burns, G.M.'s vice president for planning, research and development. ''That is not the driving force behind what we're doing here,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Surveys show that with gasoline prices low, consumers care very little about fuel economy. Yet as buyers have switched from cars to light trucks, fuel economy has declined, increasing the nation's dependence on imported oil and increasing emissions of gases that many scientists have linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>Each auto maker is required to produce a fleet of cars with an average gas mileage of at least 27.5 miles a gallon. But manufacturers are permitted to sell their fleets of light trucks with average fuel efficiencies  of just 20.7 miles a gallon.</p>
        <p>The rules that govern whether automobiles are classified as cars or light trucks have remained virtually unchanged since they were first written in 1976, and they are riddled with loopholes. Current and former regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal agency that administers the fuel-economy laws, say the agency has never challenged an auto maker's decision on whether to register an automobile as a car or as a light truck.</p>
        <p>When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 and began trying to curb what they called regulatory excesses, one of the first things they did was prohibit the Clinton Administration from spending any money even to study increases in fuel-economy standards or changes in the fuel-economy rules. The House has already voted this year to extend the prohibition for another year as part of the Federal budget; the Senate is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on a nonbinding resolution that would urge Senate budget negotiators to remove the provision during conferences with House leaders. That vote is expected to fail.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have been lobbying hard for passage of the Senate resolution, but the auto industry has fought back with full-page newspaper advertisements and radio spots in nine states and appears likely to prevail. The Administration has sat on the sidelines during the current debate.</p>
        <p>Even some auto executives acknowledge the shortcomings of the current system. BMW, for example, has sold only cars until now, and its executives had been very critical of the breaks that are available for auto makers who sell vehicles that qualify as light trucks. But BMW changed that position when it developed the X5.</p>
        <p>Victor Doolan, BMW's president for North American operations until he was hired by Ford a few weeks ago, said in an interview early this year that he had decided to submit  the X5 to regulators as a truck primarily because of the preferential treatment afforded light trucks under fuel-economy rules. ''That's the major reason: Why should we pay punitive penalties that Mercedes and Lexus do not'' on their sport utility vehicles? he said. ''It's the rules that are wrong, not the way we play the game.''</p>
        <p>Most crossover vehicles ride high off the ground and have all-wheel drive. Those two features qualify them as ''off road'' vehicles, which the fuel-economy rules classify as light trucks.</p>
        <p>But few of these crossover vehicles are ever likely to be driven up a rocky mountain trail. ''Every crossover vehicle is being called a sport utility even if they can't go up a wet driveway,'' said Jamie Jameson, the vice president for sales and marketing at DaimlerChrysler, which takes pride in the off-road capacities of its Jeeps.</p>
        <p>The company does not make such claims for the PT Cruiser, which has front-wheel drive instead of all-wheel drive. The Cruiser is being classified as a light truck through an obscure provision of the fuel-economy rules often applied to minivans. The provision says that vehicles can be so classified if they have removable back seats and a flat load floor.</p>
        <p>Barry Felrice, a top regulator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for two decades and now a top lobbyist in DaimlerChrysler's Washington office, said the provision was written in the 1970's to cover about 12,000 cargo vans a year. Without the provision, those vans might have been classified as cars. But since the 1970's, the auto industry has used the provision to classify the entire minivan market, or 1.2 million a vehicles a year, as light trucks.</p>
        <p>The Cruiser is no gas-guzzler. It may even get high enough mileage to match the mandated average for cars. Indeed, Mr. Zverina, the DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said  the vehicle's combined city and highway gas mileage might reach 30: the Environmental Protection Agency will issue an official figure when the vehicle goes on sale.</p>
        <p>By adding the Cruiser to its light truck offerings, DaimlerChrysler will improve the overall average fuel economy for its fleet. This will allow the company to sell more large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which are the most profitable models, with margins of up to $15,000, but which also tend to have thirsty V8 engines.</p>
        <p>The Cruiser ''helps us because on the light truck side, there's very strong demand for V8's,'' Mr. Zverina said.</p>
        <p>The average fuel economy of new light trucks appeared to improve slightly in the 1998 model year, the most recent data available. Auto makers acknowledge that this is largely because of anomalies in the rules.</p>
        <p>Ford and DaimlerChrysler, for example, began equipping many of their minivans and pickups to run on either gasoline or ethanol to take advantage of Federal fuel-economy credits for dual-fuel vehicles -- even though fewer than 100 service stations in the country actually sell ethanol. G.M. redesigned its four-wheel-drive Suburbans to make them too large to be counted as light trucks; they ceased to be included in any gas mileage averages at all.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether they are classified as cars or light trucks, the new, car-based vehicles have a number of advantages. Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says they might be safer than current sport utility vehicles because they will tend to be lower and less likely to roll over. The new vehicles are also less likely than sport utility vehicles to kill other motorists in crashes because they have lighter  underbodies that are not as stiff.</p>
        <p>The new automobiles get 20 to 30 miles a gallon, a level several miles a gallon less than the small and mid-size cars on which they are based, but far better gas mileage than most current sport utility vehicles. Over all, the effect of the new vehicles on the nation's fuel efficiency depends on what kind of vehicles they will replace. If they attract customers who might otherwise buy big sport utility vehicles, then the net effect would probably be to improve fuel efficiency slightly.</p>
        <p>But most customers for crossover vehicles seem likely to switch from cars, hurting overall fuel efficiency. Except for a few, low-volume luxury models, like the BMW X5 and the Lexus RX 300, most new crossover vehicles will sell for less than $20,000 and be fairly small. Three-quarters of the sport utility vehicles now sold cost $26,000 and up, including all of the big gas guzzlers.</p>
        <p>The success of the giant vehicles, despite their price tags, has put DaimlerChrysler, G.M. and Ford all perilously close to falling short of the light truck fuel-economy standard. For each tenth of a mile per gallon that an auto maker falls short of the standard, it must pay $5.50 for each vehicle sold. This can add up to tens of millions of dollars for a big auto maker.</p>
