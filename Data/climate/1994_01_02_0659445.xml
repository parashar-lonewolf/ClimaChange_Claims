        <p>MOST first-time visitors to London delight in recognizing the famous landmarks -- Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the Tower. But those who return to London again and again look upon arrival for their own favorite, reassuringly familiar totems. Mine is the humble red letter box.</p>
        <p>Only it is not really so humble. Gracefully crowned at the top and ornamented with the insignia of the reigning sovereign, the freestanding pillar-shaped letter box, emblem of Her Majesty's Royal Mail, can impose an almost regal presence on an otherwise dowdy street. No one would ever refer to such a repository as a mere mail drop. Although letter boxes can be placed in walls (even, as I once saw in Wales, carved into a rock cliff face), or attached to poles in a form known as a lamp box, the venerable pillar box commands the most attention and respect.</p>

        <p>MOST first-time visitors to London delight in recognizing the famous landmarks -- Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, the Tower. But those who return to London again and again look upon arrival for their own favorite, reassuringly familiar totems. Mine is the humble red letter box.</p>
        <p>Only it is not really so humble. Gracefully crowned at the top and ornamented with the insignia of the reigning sovereign, the freestanding pillar-shaped letter box, emblem of Her Majesty's Royal Mail, can impose an almost regal presence on an otherwise dowdy street. No one would ever refer to such a repository as a mere mail drop. Although letter boxes can be placed in walls (even, as I once saw in Wales, carved into a rock cliff face), or attached to poles in a form known as a lamp box, the venerable pillar box commands the most attention and respect.</p>
        <p>Several pillar boxes, all slightly different in shape and style, are on display in the lobby of the Chief Post Office, on King Edward Street near St. Paul's. The boxes are cordoned off, perhaps to protect them from unthinking patrons who might try to stuff mail in their antique slots, or perhaps from too-curious visitors who might want to finger the gleaming gold of Queen Victoria's embossed initials. Grouped in a circle, the stately pillar boxes look rather like mysterious standing stones -- albeit painted a startling red.</p>
        <p>These historic letter boxes are an excellent preamble to the National Postal Museum, just a few steps away in the same building. Opened in 1966, the museum contains a fascinating set of exhibits. They illuminate not only the history and complexity of the post office -- an institution whose functions have included a savings bank, telephone and telegraph departments and many miscellaneous services -- but also England itself.</p>
        <p>The story of the postal service offers a combination of romance and practicality. An 1828 painting, "The Royal Mail's Departure From the GPO," by J. Pollard, illustrates a time when London crowds gathered every night to watch the horse-drawn mail coaches dash off to all parts of the kingdom. Old photographs show a Welsh postman on horseback, plunging through what looks like waist-high marshland; intrepid postmen on bicycles, motorcycles and in Morris Minor vans, and one rather rakish-looking postman sporting a straw hat, "optional for summer wear."</p>
        <p>Mail carriers were not always men. In times of war, women were called to duty. One photograph, available as a postcard in the museum gift shop, illustrates the Corps of Women Drivers and Grooms in World War II. Standing at attention, dressed in double-breasted greatcoats and helmets, with coiled long whips in hand, these women exude a fierce pride.</p>
        <p>If I had not grasped the immensity of the post office enterprise, among England's largest employers, one picture would have convinced me: a corner of the old post office clothing store, which stocked at one time tunics in 450 sizes, with four sleeve lengths, making 1,800 possible fittings. In England's more meticulous days, no postman need have worn jackets that were too tight or sleeves that drooped. Today's post office is more suitably represented by a photo of its modern fitness center.</p>
        <p>Another display describes Telegram Boys, a grade of service discontinued in the 1970's. As one leaflet notes: "To maintain smartness and discipline the boys undertook regular drills, section leaders being issued with stripes to wear on their uniforms. The boys had their own restroom with a matron looking after their welfare." Though a photograph of the boys was not alarming, I found the idea of regimented Telegram Boys a trifle Dickensian. I read more cheerfully about Smokey, one of the official Post Office cats. Pay and conditions for these cats "were a constant source of debate," according to a placard next to Smokey's picture, since too much food provided meant not enough mice devoured.</p>
        <p>After several levels of exhibits about postal history, including a copy of the world's first stamp-canceling machine, a visitor ascends to what must be the inner sanctum for all serious philatelists. In one long room, lined with bronze pull-out files, the Post Office Museum houses and displays the Phillips collection of British Victorian stamps; the Public Record collections of the artwork, essays and registration sheets of all British stamps, and the Universal Postal Union collection of world postage stamps since 1878. Freestanding glass cases hold small acquisitions: postal scales, letter balances, engraving tools, master dies and plates, miniature models of mail vans, and two collections of stamp boxes, made of silver, ormolu, brass or wood. But the bronze files of stamps hold pride of place.</p>
        <p>Walking down the long row of labeled files, which slide silently outward, revealing a thin two-sided glassed cabinet, I felt as if I were studying an abbreviated and rather eccentric compendium of British political, cultural and social history. One case illustrated the history of the Penny Black, the world's first adhesive postage stamp, issued on May 6, 1840.</p>
        <p>Next to such sober displays, I found 19th-century greeting cards, including elaborate Valentines from the 1850s, with even the smallest lavishly engraved: "I think of thee, at midnight hour . . ." A whole row of cases was devoted to Dickens, with scenes from his novels commemorated on postcards, all with appropriate quotations.</p>
        <p>As I proceeded to the files of actual stamps, I realized that they might tell anyone who knew nothing about England almost all that was necessary. Here was the Commonwealth Collection, reminders of how far the old Empire once stretched: Aden, Antigua, Burma, Ceylon, Fiji, the Falklands, Gibraltar, Ghana, Gold Coast, Guernsey, India, Leeward Islands, Muscat, Norfolk Islands, Pakistan, New Zealand -- on and on.</p>
        <p>Many of these Commonwealth stamps are astonishingly beautiful. One, showing trekkers in British Antarctic Territory, is a miniature landscape painting, complete with ice sheets, sled dogs and white mountains in the background. A sailboat on green seas comes from the Bahamas, a scrupulously detailed series of gaudy butterflies symbolizes Antigua.</p>
        <p>The Royal Family appears in almost infinite variations, as ubiquitous in the Commonwealth collection as in Britain's own stamps. Other stamps vividly picture England's particular obsessions. A series on British wildflowers chronicles the larger bindweed and viper's bugloss with infinitesimal care; another series celebrates village churches. British children's books, still read and treasured by English-speaking children around the world, appear in a series of illustrations from the "Tale of Peter Rabbit," "Wind in the Willows," "Winnie the Pooh," "Alice in Wonderland."</p>
        <p>For the serious philatelist, this floor of the museum would offer still more attractions, including copious material on, for instance, the changing image of Britannia; the refinement of stamp-canceling, and thousands of original designs, both accepted and unaccepted, for British stamps. Some materials must be requested from storage.</p>
        <p>For a less serious visitor, the museum gift shop probably has more appeal than a genuine set of proof sheets of the Penny Black. This small shop offers a surprising assortment of out-of-the-ordinary London souvenirs: a shiny red money tin in the shape of a pillar box, for example, with toffees inside, for about $6; a polyester tie with stamp designs, $8; red or green pottery banks, 10 to 12 inches high, for $20 and $21. One of the handsomest was a silk black-and-white headscarf, bearing an almost abstract design of the Penny Black, for $13.30.</p>
        <p>For any mail posted from the museum shop, the post office provides its own postmark of a Maltese Cross. I stocked up on postcards, including several of the whip-carrying Women Drivers and Grooms, not to mention a few of an ingenious contraption I hadn't seen in the museum, a bright red five-wheeled cycle, c. 1883, used at Horsham, Sussex, to carry parcels. The high, thin-wheeled, giant-sized cycle looked more vintage-Victorian than the VR royal initials on those antique pillar boxes.</p>
        <p>My most prized postcard, however, is one from the British Postbox Series. In full color, it captures the E II R Type G Pillarbox with Scottish Crown, Type Sheffield 10, a brilliant scarlet letter box pictured against a leafy green street. I don't plan to send it to anybody. MAIL AND MORE</p>
        <p>The National Postal Museum is in the London Chief Post Office, in the King Edward Building, King Edward Street, London EC1A 1LP, not far from St. Paul's Cathedral. (King Edward Street, now a busy commercial and institutional center, was once known as Stinking Lane because of the filth accumulated from the nearby Newgate and Smithfield markets.) A statue of Sir Rowland Hill, founder of Uniform Penny Postage, stands outside the main entrance.</p>
        <p>The museum, near St. Paul's underground station on the Central Line, is open Monday to Friday, 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Closed Monday bank holidays. Admission is free.  SUSAN ALLEN TOTH's most recent book is "My Love Affair With England: A Traveler's Memoir" (Ballantine).</p>
