        <p>The 178 countries that completed a treaty on Monday aimed at curbing global warming may have to wait a very long time before President Bush, who rejected the pact, puts any alternative on the table, some American officials say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and members of his administration have repeatedly said that they consider climate change a serious issue, that greenhouse gases eventually need to be stabilized and that they are reviewing options.</p>
        <p>But some officials involved in the policy review, and business executives and experts who have briefed the cabinet, say there appears to be little, if any, pressure from the top to come up with something soon.</p>
        <p>The highest echelons at the White House, they say, see little need to amplify what was said last month, when Mr. Bush made a Rose Garden speech and a cabinet panel headed by Vice President Dick Cheney issued a 32-page report on the subject.</p>
        <p>''There is going to be a Phase 2, but what happens depends on domestic political pressure,'' said one American official involved in parts of the administration's policy review.</p>
        <p>Global warming has been a major topic in Europe, where various Green parties exert a powerful influence in several countries, but it generally remains far down on lists of day-to-day concerns in the United States, fading in and out of the news.</p>
        <p>''There's a sense in which everybody's saying the American public doesn't have the attention span or background to pay attention to this issue,'' the official said. ''There's still a hopeful perception around the White House that this has gone away.''</p>
        <p>White House officials defend the slow pace of the review, saying it reflects the importance and complexity of curbing the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is a basic byproduct of burning fuels and thus a result of almost every daily activity.</p>
        <p>''The long-term goal is stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,'' a senior White House official said recently. ''But our approach must be measured, flexible and consistent with economic growth and prosperity.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, by standing firm against binding restrictions, particularly in the form of a treaty, Mr. Bush is satisfying conservative Republicans, who rarely support treaties on global problems.</p>
        <p>Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, has long objected to the treaty on curbing gases that contribute to global warming, which is called the Kyoto Protocol. On Monday, he praised the president and American negotiators for steering clear.</p>
        <p>He and the president both say the treaty threatened the economy and is unfair because emissions cuts are required only of the 38 top industrialized countries, and not of developing nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagel, who was once an outspoken skeptic on the science of global warming, now believes that it is a serious problem and is interested in legislation to tackle it.</p>
        <p>In the absence of a new policy direction from the president, the driving force at home now appears to be Congress. This month alone, there have been several proposed bills and three Congressional hearings on global warming.</p>
        <p>Over all, experts say, it is becoming clear that rejection of the Kyoto treaty will not stand as a substitute for action for much longer.</p>
        <p>''Kyoto has become something of an albatross,'' said William K. Reilly, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Mr. Bush's father. ''Deficiencies with Kyoto are advanced as a reason not to address the climate problem seriously. It's as if it's the only mode for addressing the problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly worked on the first climate treaty, the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was signed by the first President Bush nine years ago, but was strictly voluntary. That earlier accord gave rise to the Kyoto Protocol, which is expected to be formally adopted at a meeting in the fall in Marrakesh, Morocco.</p>
        <p>For now, the Bush administration is focusing on developing a plan to improve research on causes of global warming and on ways to capture greenhouse gases with new technologies. The only international initiative Mr. Bush has announced is new work with Central and South American countries to promote conservation of forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Some officials from Europe, which spearheaded the drive to finish the details of the treaty in Bonn, have sensed the lack of political urgency in the United States and expressed deep frustration over the situation.</p>
        <p>''We've fallen into a trap,'' said one European diplomat. ''We knew that Bush wasn't going to accede to Kyoto and gave him a bit of space to let him develop a policy. But the upshot is there's nothing.''</p>
