        <p>Prime Minister Paul Martin is scrambling to keep power as the scandal involving his Liberal Party grows, making deals that delay or even jettison central elements of his political agenda, including a bill to legalize same-sex marriages and a measure to control greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Less than a year after the Liberal government was elected, the House of Commons has virtually ground to a halt as leaders of Canada's four political parties, sensing the imminent fall of the government, have begun campaign posturing for elections that are rumored for June. Mr. Martin, it seems clear, hopes to delay elections until fall, expecting that public anger will cool by then.</p>
        <p>The campaign debate is already emerging in Parliament. The opposition is emphasizing the issue of honesty in government, while the Liberals are claiming that the Conservative leader, Stephen Harper, has allied with the separatist Bloc Québécois on a secret agenda to scrap the public health insurance system.</p>
        <p>''Right now it's paralysis, and the House of Commons is a circus,'' said David Taras, a political scientist at the University of Calgary.</p>
        <p>The increasing pressures on the government and the likelihood it will soon fall stem from recent disclosures of Liberal Party kickbacks and money laundering in a program sponsoring sporting and cultural events in Quebec.</p>
        <p>The program, begun in the 1990's when Jean Chrétien was prime minister and Mr. Martin his finance minister, was supposed to improve Quebecers' opinion of the central government, and as a result undercut the separatist movement.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Martin has not been personally implicated, the Liberal Party lost majority control of the House of Commons last June because of the scandal. New polls indicate that the party is in danger of losing even its plurality to the Conservatives if the opposition votes to bring down the government and force new elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, apparently preparing his campaign defense, has begun staging tightly scripted events in which he reminds people that he appointed the commission investigating the sponsorship program.</p>
        <p>Answering questions on Thursday from students at an Ottawa high school, he acknowledged, ''I know full well that some of the things that are happening in that commission are hurting me and hurting my party.'' Then he added, ''When there's a problem, you confront it, you tell the people about it, and then you solve it.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Martin's position deteriorating, action has been delayed on many of his campaign promises -- including decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, establishing a national child-care system and cracking down on child pornography.</p>
        <p>The long-promised legislation to strengthen regulation of the online pharmacy industry, which provides many elderly Americans with cheaper drugs, has also been delayed because Liberal Party lawmakers in western Canada fear they could be punished politically by the 4,000 Canadians who work in the industry.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, a threat by Conservatives to vote against Mr. Martin's budget forced him to remove the financing for an environmental measure that would have fined industrial producers of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>But last week, his struggle was to avert defections from his own ranks.</p>
        <p>Pat O'Brien, a Liberal member of Parliament who opposes the expansion of marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, threatened to leave the party, citing both the marriage-rights issue and the money-laundering scandal. He stayed only after Mr. Martin promised to encourage a legislative committee to hold public hearings on same-sex marriages. The hearings would delay passage of any legislation until the fall.</p>
        <p>Since Canadian courts have already made same-sex marriage legal in provinces and territories where 90 percent of the population lives, the legislation is mostly symbolic. But the delay makes it clear that it will be a campaign issue.</p>
