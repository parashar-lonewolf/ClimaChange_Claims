        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Feb. 18 editorial on global warming makes some strong points, but does not go far enough. You fail to mention, for example, that the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a recent study, estimated that carbon dioxide emissions could be cut 25 percent by 2005 and 70 percent by 2030 with a net, cumulative savings of $2.3 trillion for the United States economy. Thus, as opposed to the conventional wisdom, adopting energy-efficient technologies is good for the economy, the environment and the deficit.</p>
        <p>To me, as someone who recently spent a year in Bangladesh, the threat of global warming has added meaning. By the mid-21st century, the predicted rise in sea level would make thousands of my friends environmental refugees, with their homes and places of work submerged by the Bay of Bengal.</p>

        <p>To me, as someone who recently spent a year in Bangladesh, the threat of global warming has added meaning. By the mid-21st century, the predicted rise in sea level would make thousands of my friends environmental refugees, with their homes and places of work submerged by the Bay of Bengal.</p>
        <p>I often wonder what my children will think of me when I try to explain why the families of my Bengali friends are drowning when simple, cost-efficient technologies in the 1990's could have saved them.</p>
        <p>For all of these economic, environmental and humanitarian reasons the Bush Administration must alter its position and sign a climate convention with strict timetables for reductions in the gases that cause global warming. ALEXANDER M. COUNTS Washington, Feb. 19, 1992 The writer is legislative director of Results, an anti-hunger lobby.</p>
