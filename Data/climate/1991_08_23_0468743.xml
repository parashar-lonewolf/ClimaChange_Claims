        <p>Why does the Statue of Liberty have skin problems?</p>
        <p>For the last 10 years or so, scientists have theorized that the blemishes on Miss Liberty's face were caused by acid rain. Now comes a scientist who asserts that acid rain has gotten a bad rap.</p>
        <p>Instead, the salty water in New York Harbor bears responsibility for the darker patches on the statue's green-colored copper skin, says the scientist, Richard A. Livingston, a geochemist at the University of Maryland at College Park.</p>
        <p>What's more, he says, a gradual drop in airborne sulfur dioxide -- a result of tighter pollution controls -- has actually aided in the discoloration process.</p>
        <p>In the August issue of Environmental Science and Technology, a scientific journal, Dr. Livingston argues that New York City rainfall does not contain enough acid to produce the chemical reactions necessary to lead to the dark patches. But deposits of the salt that washes onto the statue in mist or spray can react with the copper to produce darker tones in sections where wind or rain do not wash it away.</p>
        <p>"The acid rain signal gets lost in the noise," Dr. Livingston said.</p>
        <p>But one of the experts who helped oversee the Lady's latest facelift in the 1980's disagrees. Robert Baboian, a proponent of the acid rain theory, said Dr. Livingston's theoretical work was fine but his conclusions were wrong. Mr. Baboian, head of the corrosion laboratory at Texas Instruments Inc. in Attleboro, Mass., has been a consultant to the National Park Service, which is responsible for the statue's upkeep, and was involved in the restoration effort.</p>
        <p>There is more to the disagreement than academic jousting. Most people find the statue's mostly light green skin etestically pleasing. Perhaps more important, the darker areas may be more prone to erosion, raising the possibility that holes could form in the 105-year-old statue's surface.</p>
        <p>Corrosion of the statue's copper skin pro duces a patina, its greenish layer. This layer serves as a protective coating for the copper beneath it. In the 1980's, scientists concluded that acid rain was helping to convert the stable copper mineral brochantite, which made up the patina, into antlerite, a mineral more likely to wash away, increasing the opportunity for copper loss.</p>
        <p>The statue's copper skin is one-tenth of an inch thick, and only 5 percent of it has eroded in the first 100 years of its life, Mr. Baboian said.</p>
        <p>Acid rain results mostly from sulfur dioxide discharged into the air by coal-burning power plants. The pollutant can travel hundreds of miles and return to earth, as an acid, in rain or snow. Until anti-pollution laws were passed in the late 1960's and early 1970's, local utilities and other boiler operators routinely burned fuel oil high in sulfur.</p>
        <p>Dr. Livingston wrote that his calculations showed that acid rain, as measured in New York City, "has no effect on either the mineralogy or the patina or its solubility." He added, "The color patterns on some parts of the statue, particularly the left side of the face, seem to result from the combination of sea salt deposition and sheltering from rain water."</p>
        <p>Where rainwater washes away salt, colors will be light bluish-green, he said. Where it does not, as on parts of the statue's face, colors will grow darker.</p>
        <p>And the decreasing sulfur dioxide in the air, Dr. Livingston said, will encourage that color change because the sea salt will dominate the chemical processes on the surface of the statue. When sulfur dioxide levels were higher, sulfur dominated the processes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baboian said Mr. Livingston's theory was wrong, in part because he failed to note that when acid rain evaporates, it becomes acidic enough to produce the mineral antlerite, which is responsible for the darker patches.</p>
        <p>Also, he asked, if sea salt was responsible for the darkening, why were such changes on the statue not noted until 1974, when acid rain seemed to have peaked as a problem?</p>
        <p>Whatever the cause of the darkening, those who monitor the condition of the Statue of Liberty are concerned for its future.</p>
        <p>"If you start to lose patina completely, you have lost the protective effect and the corrosion rate can increase significantly," Mr. Baboian said. "It hasn't happened yet, and we don't know what is going to happen."</p>
