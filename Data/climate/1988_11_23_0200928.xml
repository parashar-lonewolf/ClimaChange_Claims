        <p>LEAD: Brian Mulroney now has the mandate he sought for free trade with the United States. More important, Canadian voters rejected the opposition's anti-American pandering and helped redefine their nation as a forward-looking, self-confident participant in an interdependent world.</p>
        <p>Brian Mulroney now has the mandate he sought for free trade with the United States. More important, Canadian voters rejected the opposition's anti-American pandering and helped redefine their nation as a forward-looking, self-confident participant in an interdependent world.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mulroney's victory did not match the margin of his 1984 landslide. But in a three-cornered race against the Liberals and the New Democrats, the 43 percent won by his Progressive Conservative Party was enough for a 22-seat edge. And the Conservatives made significant gains in the industrial power centers.</p>
        <p>The election was forced by the refusal of the Liberal-dominated Senate to ratify the free-trade agreement without a national referendum. Courageously, Mr. Mulroney called an election instead; two earlier Governments had been voted out of office on similar free-trade proposals.</p>
        <p>For a time, after the Liberal leader, John Turner, assailed Mr. Mulroney in debate for having ''sold out'' to Washington, the Conservatives looked doomed. But Mr. Turner and Ed Broadbent, leading the New Democrats, pressed their anti-American case too far, raising threats about the impact of free trade that were shown to be blatant misrepresentations. Mr. Mulroney's clear victory makes it all but certain that the agreement, already approved by Washington, will be ratified in time to take effect on Jan. 1, as scheduled. But he, and the United States, must reckon with the fact that the bitterly divisive campaign revealed genuine nervousness about the pact among many Canadians. The Liberals doubled their strength in the House of Commons. Thus Mr. Mulroney and his countrymen need breathing space to digest the giant step they've agreed to.</p>
        <p>If President-elect Bush wants to reassure Canadians that they are paired with a friend and not a monster, nothing would be more welcome in Ottawa than for him to reaffirm his campaign pledge to take action on acid rain, the outstanding sore point in U.S.-Canadian relations.</p>
        <p>The free-trade agreement is a 10-year plan for removing all existing trade restrictions between the two nations, and it commits both to raising no new barriers. Some important disputes have yet to be resolved, and the agreement has a system to resolve them. But the overriding message is that the two North American powers are entering into open trade with each other, strengthening both to meet the increasing competitiveness of Japan and Western Europe. Their historic commitment should be an example for the world.</p>
