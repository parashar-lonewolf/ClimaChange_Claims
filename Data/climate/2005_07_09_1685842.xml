        <p>A2-8</p>
        <p>Death Toll Rises to 49 In London Bomb Attack  Investigators have concluded that the bombs that ripped through three subway trains and a bus in London were crude devices containing less than 10 pounds of explosives each -- a finding that supports a theory gaining momentum among authorities that the plot was carried out by homegrown extremists rather than terrorists exported to England.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Police in London said they were hampered by fears of structural damage to subway tunnels at the sites of the explosions and by vermin, particularly at the site between King's Cross and Russell Square, where numerous bodies had yet to be recovered.</p>
        <p>A7</p>
        <p>As officials across Europe scrambled to beef up security in the wake of the London bombings, the tension was greatest in Italy, a country many experts regard as the next terrorism target because of its involvement in the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Europeans have refused to sacrifice civil liberties in the fight against terrorism, criticizing the United States for restricting its citizens' rights for the sake of security. Even with the London attacks, there is little indication that this view is changing.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>G-8 Sees Progress on Africa  Striking tones of optimism and defiance a day after the attacks in London, President Bush and the leaders of seven other big industrial nations concluded a summit meeting saying they had made progress in addressing African poverty and global warming.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Iraq Asks Muslims for Support  Iraq's transitional government reached out to Arab and other Muslim nations, asking them not to be intimidated by the killing of Egypt's top diplomat in Iraq by an Islamic terrorist group linked to Al Qaeda.</p>
        <p>A5</p>
        <p>Philippine Leader Urged to Quit  Influential allies of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines, including 10 of her departing cabinet officials and the former President Coraz√≥n Aquino, called on her to step down.</p>
        <p>A4</p>
        <p>No Change to North Korea Offer  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she intended to rebuff a South Korean request to enhance an offer five nations made to North Korea in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program.</p>

        <p>NATIONAL</p>
        <p>A9-11</p>
        <p>Copter Victims Memorial Draws Many Supporters  More than 2,000 people gathered at a memorial service in Virginia Beach for eight members of the Navy Seals and eight Army special operations soldiers who died on June 28 when their helicopter was shot down in a ravine in eastern Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Residents Brace for Hurricane  Coastal residents from the Florida Keys all the way to Louisiana scrambled or held their breath as Hurricane Dennis plowed through Cuba, killing at least 10 people, before surging toward the Gulf of Mexico barely a month into hurricane season.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Rumors Follow Rehnquist  Rumors of an imminent retirement announcement by 80-year-old Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who has been ill with thyroid cancer, reached a frenzy of bizarre proportions.</p>
        <p>A9</p>
        <p>Court Upholds Abortion Ruling  A federal appeals court upheld a ruling by a Nebraska district court that struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which banned a method of abortion generally used after the first trimester.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Seeking End to Loan Loophole  Margaret Spellings, the education secretary, joined the chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, John Boehner, in asking Congress to close a loophole allowing lenders to claim a 9.5 percent government subsidy on certain student loans.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>Ms. Spellings also suggested that the federal No Child Left Behind law, which requires that public school children be tested in reading and math, could be expanded to include other subjects.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>Cardinal Questions Evolution  An influential cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, which has long been regarded as an ally of the theory of evolution, is now suggesting that belief in evolution as accepted by science today may be incompatible with Catholic faith.</p>

        <p>Seniors Finding Difficulty Paying for Long-Term Care  To pay for long-term care, the Depression-era elderly and their baby boom children are finding it necessary to consult with lawyers in order to untangle a 40-year-old thicket of changing Medicaid regulations.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Security Funds Still Unspent  Two and a half years after the MTA announced it would invest nearly $600 million in security improvements, only a fraction -- $30 million -- has been spent, putting New York's transportation system well behind those of other cities, like Washington and Boston.</p>

But she proved once again that she can hold her own against the men. Wie shot an even-par 71 during the second round of the John Deere Classic and missed the cut by two strokes.</p>

The finding by Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the United States District Court in Los Angeles prompted her to declare a mistrial.</p>
