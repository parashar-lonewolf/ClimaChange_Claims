        <p>The Bush administration wants Congress to collapse several of the most contentious air pollution control programs into a more flexible and less intrusive system strongly favored by leading electric utilities.</p>
        <p>The proposal is the clearest indication to date that the administration favors overhauling the Clean Air Act in ways that would answer the complaints of utilities that the agency's rules tie them up in paperwork and make them reluctant to invest in new power plants needed to provide electricity to consumers and businesses.</p>
        <p>In trying to revise one of the core environmental statutes, last revised in 1990, the administration would set in motion a protracted and politically charged battle in Congress. Unlike some of the Bush administration's  moves to reverse environmental regulations adopted by the Clinton administration, any changes to the Clean Air Act would require legislative approval.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups say they fear that the plan to simplify regulations and enforcement procedures could undercut measures intended to reduce haze in national parks, cut down on interstate transmission of smog-causing pollutants and minimize health risks to people who live close to power plants.</p>
        <p>Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said today that her staff was drafting a new approach to controlling emissions that would set nationwide caps on three major pollutants and allow utilities to trade pollution credits, much as they already do for sulfur dioxide emissions that produce acid rain. She said the trading system could replace five separate enforcement programs that regulate emissions on a plant-by-plant basis.</p>
        <p>One of those enforcement programs, known as new source review, compels utilities to install modern pollution controls when they build a new power plant or significantly expand or upgrade one already in use. Utilities have lobbied aggressively to have new source review scaled back or eliminated, and Mrs. Whitman's comments were the first indication that, at least for utilities, the administration would prefer to end the program altogether.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's new plan would also replace established programs that seek to improve visibility in national parks and to force individual utilities to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions that cross state lines.</p>
        <p>''We think we can produce a system that will result in cleaner air, but also make enforcement much more efficient,'' Mrs. Whitman said in an interview today. ''I think people will be surprised at what we can get done.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman first outlined the new plan when responding to questions at a Congressional hearing on Thursday. She has offered only a sketch of the plan, saying it will be presented formally in September.</p>
        <p>The proposal raised a number of questions among lawmakers, environmentalists and industry groups. The idea of replacing plant-by-plant enforcement with a national trading system is popular among industry groups and acceptable to some environmentalists, though people on both sides argue about which pollutants should be capped and at what level, debates that could take months or years to resolve.</p>
        <p>Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont independent, has introduced legislation that would set relatively stringent national caps on four major pollutants: nitrogen oxide, the main component of smog; sulfur dioxide; mercury, a toxic health hazard; and carbon dioxide, which many scientists say causes global warming.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman favors a plan that would cap three pollutants, excluding carbon dioxide. The Bush administration has rejected the Kyoto Protocol to control global warming and backtracked on a campaign commitment to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say that the new plan raises concerns because it would end successful enforcement programs without any guarantee that the new trading scheme would have the same effectiveness in cleaning up the air.</p>
        <p>''We have a real fear that they will try to spin this as a major step forward when it's really a step backward,'' said Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental group.</p>
        <p>For utilities, especially those that own heavily polluting coal-fired power plants, the plan could amount to a major victory. Coal-using utilities were among the most generous donors to Republicans and Democrats in the last election, and they have pushed hard to shape elements of the Bush administration's approach to energy and the environment.</p>
        <p>''The notion of providing a new framework that would replace the command and control permitting nightmare would be an enormous step forward,'' said C. Boyden Gray, a White House official in the administration of Mr. Bush's father who now represents several major utilities. ''It sounds like the E.P.A. is trending in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>Eliminating new source review on utilities would not exempt other polluting industries from its requirements, Mrs. Whitman said today. Refineries, paper plants and chemical companies also must install new pollution controls when they significantly modify their plants.</p>
