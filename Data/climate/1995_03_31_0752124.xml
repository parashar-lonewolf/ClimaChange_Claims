        <p>It was an unlikely scenario: Law school students bidding against corporate giants for pollution rights. But at the Chicago Board of Trade on Monday, students from seven law schools vied with representatives of electric utilities for government-issued allowances to emit sulphur dioxide.</p>
        <p>The law students had pooled $3,256 to buy 18 of the auction's 176,400 allowances, each of which permits the emission of one ton of sulphur dioxide. Instead of selling the allowances for a profit at a future auction, the students said they would let them expire unused -- yielding a reduction, albeit a small one, in pollution.</p>
        <p>"We're also trying to force the price up by taking as many off the market as we can," said Richard Facciolo, president of the Environmental Law Coalition at the University of Maryland, which enlisted six other schools in the bidding effort. "If allowances cost more than pollution control equipment, companies will have a great incentive to invest in that equipment and there will be even less pollution."</p>
        <p>The other law schools that bought allowances this year were at the City University of New York, Detroit, Duke, Michigan, Hamline in St. Paul, Minn., and New England in Boston.</p>
        <p>The notion of law students joining in the auction originated with Robert Percival, an environmental law professor at the University of Maryland, who has written several textbooks on the subject.</p>
        <p>Sulphur dioxide, a chemical component of acid rain, contaminates the environment and can cause respiratory and other health problems. In an effort halve sulphur dioxide emissions by the year 2000, Congress, in the Clean Air Act of 1990, authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to issue allowances, not to exceed 9 million a year, to electric utilities nationwide.</p>
        <p>Utilities that exceed mandated pollution reductions, either through the use of cleaner fuels or the installation of enhanced pollution control equipment, can sell their unused allowances for a profit to other companies.</p>
