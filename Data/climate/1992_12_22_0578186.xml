        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The concept of taxation as a primary deterrent to polluters, as recommended in a report of the World Resources Institute (Science Times, Nov. 24) is fundamentally and dangerously flawed.</p>
        <p>While the proposal would no doubt generate substantial tax revenues, it would shift responsibility from environmental regulators, whose priority is protection of public health, to tax collectors, whose role is to collect revenues. It is possible that the tax collectors would be successful in their efforts without achieving the desired environmental improvements. The tax collectors would go away happy, and the degradation of the environment would then continue.</p>
        <p>This concept fails most significantly by selling the right to befoul our air, water or soil as long as the polluter is willing to pay the going price. Shrewd business people have always found ways to make the tax structure work to their benefit. Establishing the sale of "environmental indulgences" creates a dangerous precedent. Who will decide the dollar value of lives harmed and lost to pollution?</p>
        <p>The very real threat that global warming poses to human existence cannot be left to tinkering with the tax structure.</p>
        <p>It will require the full force of governmental power in this and other countries to bring about major changes in the way we live and work to stem the inexorable progression toward global disaster that is under way. Many important initiatives were established at the Rio de Janeiro conference of nations to begin dealing with this serious problem.</p>
        <p>Taxation is a weak substitute for the aggressive regulation and tough enforcement and creative sustainable development programs that will be necessary to protect our environment. ETHAN C. ELDON  Huntington Bay, L.I., Dec.2, 1992 The writer is a former New York City air resources commissioner.</p>
