        <p>The owner of a car-repair shop in St. Louis who admitted letting the refrigerant from a car's air-conditioner leak into the air has become the first person prosecuted under a Federal law intended to protect the atmosphere's ozone layer by tightly regulating such chemicals.</p>
        <p>The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri, Edward L. Dowd Jr., described it as a landmark air-pollution case.</p>
        <p>The shop owner, George Hofele of Chesterfield, Mo., faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but Mr. Dowd agreed to recommend smaller penalties in exchange for Mr. Hofele's guilty plea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hofele, 52, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to draining an automotive air-conditioner without the proper training or equipment. The authorities were tipped that Mr. Hofele engaged in the practice by a former employee of the shop, G&amp; H Tire and Auto of Marlborough, in St. Louis County. They sent a state highway patrol officer to investigate. Unmarked Police Car</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's Office, Christy Marshall, said that the car was unmarked and that Mr. Hofele "went ahead and serviced it in an improper manner."</p>
        <p>Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, shops that service automotive air-conditioners were supposed to install equipment by January 1992 that sucks the refrigerant, a chlorofluorocarbon, from the air-conditioners and purifies it for re-use. But the equipment costs $2,000 to $3,000, and technicians must be trained to use it. Some gas stations have given up servicing automotive air-conditioners as a result. Mr. Hofele did not have the equipment or the certified workers.</p>
        <p>Equipment designed for C.F.C.'s will only be useful for a few years, because production of that type of refrigerant, often referred to by its Du Pont Company trade name Freon, is being phased out; new cars use a different material. Still, many gas stations have tooled up for the work.</p>
        <p>"Hundreds of other businesses in the St. Louis area that work on vehicle air-conditioners have invested in the proper equipment," Missouri's Attorney General, Jay Nixon, said in a statement. "They complied with a law Mr. Hofele apparently felt did not apply to him, and so he tried to cut corners." Up to 60 Cars Serviced</p>
        <p>An examination the shop's records showed that between January 1992, when the regulations took effect, and July 1993, when he was caught, Mr. Hofele may have serviced 60 car air-conditioners.</p>
        <p>Automotive air-conditioning systems routinely leak their refrigerant, but until the Federal Government heeded scientists' warnings that chlorofluorocarbons were destroying the earth's ozone layer, refilling a system cost only a few dollars. If a system stopped working, the standard procedure was to drain the chemical, which is a liquid or a gas, depending on temperature and pressure, fix the problem and refill the air-conditioner. The new procedure is more costly to motorists because of the shop equipment involved.</p>
        <p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, until the new regulations were put in place, about 30 percent of chlorofluorocarbon emissions were from repair shops. Now, said a spokeswoman for the agency in Washington, Wendy Butler, "the compliance rate is really quite high."  Asking Public's Help</p>
        <p>Neither the E.P.A. nor the law-enforcement agencies involved in the St. Louis case have a regular program of looking for violators.</p>
        <p>"I don't know if we're having a crackdown on gas stations," said Ms. Marshall. But Mr. Dowd, the United States Attorney, and others involved in the case appealed to the public to alert them to cases of improper air-conditioner servicing.</p>
