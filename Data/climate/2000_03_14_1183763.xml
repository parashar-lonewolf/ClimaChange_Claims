        <p>The microscopic particles of atmospheric dust, sea salt and smoke known as aerosols are meteorological and climatic will-o'-the-wisps -- now here, now not, materializing somewhat randomly in a given parcel of air and then disappearing in a few days. But they are essential to the formation of clouds and the production of rain and snow, and they also have a considerable cooling influence on the earth's temperature.</p>
        <p>The evanescent character of aerosols has made it especially difficult for scientists to pin down their effects on weather and climate. The task has been complicated further by industrial pollution, a relatively new source of aerosols with shifting distribution patterns.</p>
        <p>Now researchers have turned up evidence that seems to confirm a longtime suspicion: that the flood of aerosols loosed by urban and industrial pollution suppresses rainfall and snowfall downwind of the pollution source. In the process, clouds become brighter, reflecting more sunlight. They may also stay around longer, and the combined effect is to exert extra cooling on localities and regions underneath those particular clouds.</p>
        <p>The extra particles cast aloft by the modern industrial economy prevent cloud moisture from condensing into water droplets large enough to fall to the ground before evaporating, according to a study by Dr. Daniel Rosenfeld, a cloud physicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The study appears in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenfeld examined precipitation patterns discerned by instruments aboard an earth satellite launched in late 1997 to measure global rainfall. He found that in ''pollution tracks'' downwind of pollution sources like cities, power plants, lead smelters and oil refineries, virtually all precipitation was shut off because the clouds in those atmospheric swaths were composed of abnormally small water droplets.</p>
        <p>In order for raindrops to form, there must be some nucleus on which atmospheric water vapor can condense. Aerosols provide the nuclei. The resulting droplets of condensation create clouds. When enough of the droplets collide and coalesce -- it takes about a million of them -- a precipitation-sized drop of water forms and falls to earth.</p>
        <p>But when the atmosphere is flooded with extra aerosols produced by industries and cities, there are many more nuclei on which moisture can condense. Consequently, the droplets are smaller and never become heavy enough to fall to earth.</p>
        <p>The results of the new study ''indicate that human activity may be altering clouds and natural precipitation on a global scale,'' Dr. Rosenfeld wrote in Science.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, measurements of smokestack emissions from ships at sea, taken by satellites and airplanes, provided the first evidence that aerosols could change cloud structure by redistributing water onto a larger number of smaller droplets. Presumably, scientists thought, the same thing might happen on land. But in many industrial areas, aerosols from air pollution are so pervasive that it was difficult to discern clearly their effect on precipitation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenfeld selected study sites where pollution tracks were somewhat isolated in a broader region of less polluted air, and thus stood out clearly. These included sites in Canada, Turkey and Australia.</p>
        <p>The results showed for the first time that downwind of pollution sources, clouds are brighter, said Dr. Owen B. Toon, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, who wrote a commentary on the findings in Science. The clouds were brighter, he said, because the increased number of droplets, though smaller, reflected more sunlight, cooling the area under the clouds.</p>
        <p>In those bright cloud plumes, said Dr. Toon, ''there's no rainfall, whereas the clouds surrounding the plume are raining. People had thought this might happen, but there was no clear evidence of it happening before.''</p>
        <p>Since the clouds do not produce as much rain, he said, they probably persist longer; until a large-scale atmospheric system like a cold front moves them out, they continue to cool the earth beneath.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how widespread the pollution-induced precipitation reduction and the cooling effects are,  Dr. Toon said. Many scientists believe that to some extent, the cooling effect of industrial aerosols counteracts whatever global warming is being produced by heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide.  But they have found it difficult to establish the magnitude of the aerosol cooling.</p>
        <p>One reason is that the amount of pollution-generated aerosols in the atmosphere varies from time to time and place to place; since they fall out of the atmosphere in days or weeks at most, their effect is regional, spotty and short-lived.</p>
        <p>Many experts believe that aerosol-producing pollution is lessening in industrialized countries as they place controls on emissions, and that in North America and Europe it may therefore become less important as an influence on climate and weather.  Meanwhile, this sort of pollution is believed to be increasing rapidly across Asia.</p>
        <p>The net global effect of aerosols on both precipitation and temperature is thus a shifting target for scientists. Dr. Toon, along with many other experts, says he believes that over the next few decades, as controls are placed on pollution by aerosols, their diminishing climatic effects will be overshadowed by the warming effect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases: while aerosols disappear from the atmosphere quickly once controls are placed on them, greenhouse gases persist for centuries.</p>
        <p>The climatic role of both aerosols and clouds may become markedly clearer in the next few years, said Dr. Toon, as new earth satellites designed to measure them are launched. The first such satellite, called Terra, went into orbit last December and should begin collecting data in the next few months.</p>
