        <p>FUELED by clean air rules, the electric vehicle may be just down the road. But the weak point in electric vehicles is still generally believed to be batteries.</p>
        <p>But Joseph P. Maceda is showing off a 30-foot, 25-passenger electric transit bus, complete with wheelchair lift, 150-mile range and acceleration as good as a diesel, and it has hardly any batteries at all.</p>
        <p>Instead it uses a fuel cell, which makes electric current by combining hydrogen with oxygen.</p>
        <p>The "Georgetown bus," so called because Georgetown University helped manage Mr. Maceda's work, has been traveling from demonstration to demonstration lately. Last week it tagged along on part of the Tour de Sol race from New York to Philadelphia, following electric vehicles of various pedigrees.</p>
        <p>The bus, for which Mr. Maceda's start-up company, the H-Power Corporation, was prime contractor, was built with some $17 million in Federal money from the Department of Energy and an additional $5 million from H-Power. The Government wants to demonstrate the feasibility of fuel-cell vehicles. Mr. Maceda wants to show that H-Power, based in an old factory here, can make them pay.</p>
        <p>As every high-school chemistry student learns, passing a small electric current through water divides it into its component parts: oxygen and hydrogen. A fuel cell simply reverses the process.</p>
        <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration built the first practical fuel cells in the 1960's for the moon program. But such cells are expensive, and the hydrogen is hard to ship and store because it is flammable.</p>
        <p>But the H-Power bus makes the hydrogen it needs on the spot, a process Mr. Maceda says can be managed cheaply. And if the cells were produced in large enough volumes, he contends, they would be cheap enough for use in automobiles.</p>
        <p>Fuel-cell technology recently gained endorsement from an unexpected quarter, Allison Gas Turbine, in a recently released report produced under contract for the Department of Energy last winter, before General Motors sold Allison. The report reached the preliminary conclusion that an electric mini-van powered by a fuel cell could provide performance similar to a standard gasoline-powered van, use only about half as much energy and not intrude into cargo or passenger space. A 60 kilowatt fuel cell would cost about $3,900, the report said. And the van, complete with motors and other hardware and produced in high volumes, would costly only slightly more than a conventional van.</p>
        <p>A kilowatt is 1.34 horsepower, a conversion shoppers will have to remember if electric cars of any type become a common consumer item. Thus a 60-kilowatt system would be equivalent to an 80-horsepower car.</p>
        <p>That sounds underpowered, but Mr. Maceda's bus, which weighs 22,900 pounds, gets along on less, 50 kilowatts. The reason is that it also carries a small bank of nickel-cadmium batteries for extra power during acceleration; at those times, the batteries and fuel cells together are sufficient to run its 125-horsepower motor. When the bus is cruising, the fuel-cell output that is not required for the drive wheels is used to recharge the batteries. Thus the batteries begin and end the day fully charged.</p>
        <p>But at least on the Georgetown bus, the fuel cell is not competitive in price. Mr. Maceda insisted, however, that most of the $22 million cost was government paperwork, and that H-Power could have built the whole thing for $5 million.</p>
        <p>The technology is moving so fast, according to Mr. Maceda and others, that only some parts of the bus will be relevant to the next generation of the vehicle. One part is the source of the hydrogen, a troublesome fuel because of its flammability and because the molecule is so small that it easily leaks from fittings and valves.</p>
        <p>In its current version the Georgetown bus produces its hydrogen as needed by cooking methanol, a liquid hydrocarbon that can be made from natural gas, in an onboard tank. The chemical formula for methanol is CH3 OH. When methanol is mixed with water, or H2 O, and cooked under pressure, the mixture breaks down into hydrogen, and carbon dioxide, or CO2 . The hydrogen is then delivered to the fuel cell and the carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is what humans exhale, and Mr. Maceda said the vehicle qualifies as "zero emission" under the rules set by the California Air Resources Board. The board has ordered that major manufacturers of light-duty vehicles make 2 percent of their 1998 model-year production electric, with the number rising to 10 percent in later years. New York and Massachusetts have adopted the California program, and 11 other Eastern states are also considering it. The rule does not cover buses, but states are scrambling to replace dirty vehicles of any size.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maceda said his bus uses methanol as a hydrogen source because that is what the Department of Energy specified. But it could just as easily break down diesel oil, he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever the fuel, Mr. Maceda said, it should be liquid rather than a gas, so there would be no need for compressors or other new infrastructure. "Pouring stuff is always going to be the fastest solution," he said. Moreover, a fuel-cell vehicle that could run on diesel fuel or gasoline would use conventional filling stations.</p>
        <p>In addition to H-Power and Georgetown University, other participants on the bus project were the management consultant Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. and the Energy Department's Argonne National Laboratory.  Bus Manufacturing USA Inc., of Santa Barbara, Calif., built the chassis; the fuel cell came from the Fuji Electric Company of Japan and the electric-motor propulsion system from the Soleq Corporation of Chicago.</p>
        <p>The fuel cells used on the bus are of a type called phosphoric acid, which Is the electric car an idea whose time may never come? Viewpoints, page 9.</p>
        <p>has been sold to electric utilities for producing power, although it is not yet cost-competitive in most applications. Such cells also have disadvantages for transportation uses: it takes them a few minutes to reach their operating temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit, and they are not good at quickly varying their output.</p>
        <p>To avoid these problems in the future, Mr. Maceda is now working with a different type of fuel cell, a proton exchange membrane cell, known in the industry as a PEM.</p>
        <p>In most fuel cells the chemical reaction takes place in a liquid medium called an electrolyte, just as it does in batteries. The hydrogen nucleus, which has a positive charge, migrates through the acidic electrolyte. In the PEM cell, the hydrogen migrates through a plastic membrane. The difference means each cell can be smaller and work at a lower temperature than a phosphoric acid system.</p>
        <p>Last month, Daimler-Benz of Germany announced that it had built a test-model mini-van that operates on a 50-watt PEM fuel cell made by Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, B.C. Others who have worked with PEM cells, however, have generally found them too expensive, because the metal plates that divide one cell from the next must be precisely manufactured. But Mr. Maceda said he has been able to greatly reduce the cost by using heat-exchanger plates built for the aerospace industry.</p>
        <p>H-Power has already sold about 80 of these cells, all hand-built for engineers and still quite pricey, at $3,000 for a 20-watt model. But in mass production they will fall to 10 percent of that, said Mr. Maceda, who is also working on repackaging one model so that it will be small enough to replace a laptop computer's battery.</p>
        <p>If the cost of PEM's falls enough, as Mr. Maceda predicts, the market for the cells could go far beyond transportation -- like providing electricity for rural vacation homes that might use propane gas as the hydrogen source for the fuel cells. Or utilities might use them to produce electricity from natural gas. Fuel cells are more efficient than conventional power plants in squeezing kilowatt-hours from natural gas, and if General Motors' estimate of $65 for each kilowatt of capacity is accurate, the cost would be lower, too.</p>
        <p>This is speculative, of course, because it is hard to know what mass production will cost before it starts. But Mr. Maceda pointed out that if G.M.'s number is correct -- he thinks it might even be too high -- fuel-cell buses would be good for more than sending people around the city.</p>
        <p>In the lull between rush hours, he said, taking on that visionary gaze so common among electric-vehicle entrepreneurs, the bus could park, plug in, and send electricity to the utility company for a little extra profit.</p>
