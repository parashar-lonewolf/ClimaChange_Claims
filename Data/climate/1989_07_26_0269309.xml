        <p>LEAD: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who moved or dismissed nearly half her Cabinet on Monday, signaled her determination today to continue the policies that most of her critics, inside and outside the Government, blame for the decline in the Conservative Party's fortunes over the last six months.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who moved or dismissed nearly half her Cabinet on Monday, signaled her determination today to continue the policies that most of her critics, inside and outside the Government, blame for the decline in the Conservative Party's fortunes over the last six months.</p>
        <p>According to aides, the scope of the changes she made in her Government was a reflection of her desire to get the Cabinet in fighting shape for what promises to be a difficult campaign to win a fourth national election victory two years from now.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher and the people around her appear to believe that a sharper image, and a few officials in key ministries more adept at presenting it, will help her bring that off.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher's new party chairman, Kenneth Baker, indicated that all that needed to be done was to put a better face on things. ''I don't think we have used the opportunities well in the last six months to a year,'' he said. ''It is a much fresher Government than it was 24 hours ago.'' No Longer Unbeatable</p>
        <p>But as the Conservative Party's defeat by the opposition Labor Party in elections for the European Parliament last month proved, Mrs. Thatcher is no longer undefeatable, and Labor is no longer unelectable.</p>
        <p>And while Mrs. Thatcher is committed to pushing unpopular policies, the Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, has abandoned the commitment to unilateral nuclear disarmament that cost him heavily in middle-class support in the last elections. Labor's rank and file is expected to endorse the change at its annual conference in October.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister is committed to ambitious programs that would change the way the comprehensive National Health Service operates, sell the national water companies in England and Wales to private investors this fall, and impose a new ''head tax,'' the same for rich and poor alike, next year in place of property taxes on which local governments have relied for their income.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher did not move the man in what is arguably the most crucial position, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, even though she blames him for a miscalculation in monetary policy after the 1987 stock market crash that has allowed inflation to rise to nearly 9 percent this year and prompted a wave of public-sector strikes for higher wages. Mr. Lawson has jacked up interest rates to double-digit levels, and there, it seems, they will remain until inflation comes down again. Foreign Minister Removed</p>
        <p>Her most unexpected change was the removal of the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, who tried to mute some of her more strident criticisms of European Community bureaucrats during the European Parliament campaign. Mrs. Thatcher replaced him with John Major, a 46-year-old junior Cabinet secretary with no foreign policy experience at all.</p>
        <p>Sir Geoffrey, who was Foreign Secretary for six years and served in Mrs. Thatcher's first Cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1979, has never concealed his ambition to succeed her one day as Prime Minister, a fatal flaw in her eyes.</p>
        <p>Sir Geoffrey was named Deputy Prime Minister and leader in the House of Commons. The title of Deputy Prime Minister is essentially meaningless in a Cabinet dominated by Mrs. Thatcher's strong personality, and a clearly unsettled Sir Geoffrey said today that he agreed to take the job only after being assured that he would be chairman of a number of important Cabinet committees, like Mrs. Thatcher's last deputy, William Whitelaw. The post had been unfilled since 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Major, who comes from a working-class background and never finished college, said his appointment ''came right out of the blue,'' and dismissed speculation that he was now Mrs. Thatcher's heir apparent.</p>
        <p>Foreign policy was not a major issue in the June 15 European elections, and Mrs. Thatcher dismissed the Government's defeat as meaningless in British national terms. Barely more than half the electorate voted, but those who did gave a clear majority of Britain's 81 seats to the Labor Party, and nearly 15 percent cast votes for environmentalist candidates of the Green parties. A Change in Spokesmen</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher, who convened a world conference on protecting the ozone layer in April, felt she needed a more effective spokesman in charge of environment issues, aides said.</p>
        <p>She got one by moving one of her oldest political confidants, the 64-year-old, intellectually brilliant, but cigarette-smoking and disheveled Nicholas Ridley, out of the Environment Ministry, putting him in charge of the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
        <p>The new Environment Minister is 45-year-old Christopher Patten, whose responsibilities also include being more convincing than Mr. Ridley was in explaining how the new ''head tax'' will work because administering it falls within the purview of his ministry.</p>
        <p>The Daily Telegraph, a newspaper that backs the Government, said today: ''A change of ministers is alone no substitute for a sense of priorities and sound policies, sensibly pursued. The difficulties in the National Health Service remain acute, as do the crisis of the teaching profession, the dilemma about Europe, and, above all, inflation and the structural difficulties of the economy.''</p>
