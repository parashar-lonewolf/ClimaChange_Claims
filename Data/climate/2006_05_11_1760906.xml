        <p>With New York State's gasoline taxes the highest in the nation, legislative leaders agreed on Wednesday to cut 4 to 9 cents a gallon from the tax, even as the oil industry says there is no guarantee the savings will actually reach the public.</p>
        <p>The agreement comes as lawmakers across the nation are brimming with proposals to offer relief at the pump, though a recent proposal by Republicans in Washington to offer drivers $100 rebate checks was abandoned after being ridiculed as a political ploy. The New York Legislature is expected to approve the bill next week and send it to Gov. George E. Pataki, whose aides are reviewing the legislation.</p>
        <p>Federal, state and local taxes add an average of 67.9 cents to the price of a gallon of gas in New York State. New Jersey, by comparison, has taxes of just 32.9 cents a gallon. And gas taxes in New York have been rising alongside gas prices because state law requires that part of the taxes increase proportionally to the underlying price of gas.</p>
        <p>But should the measure win final approval, even the oil industry acknowledges that there is no guarantee that the savings will get passed on to consumers.</p>
        <p>One reason is that gas taxes, for the most part, are levied when oil companies import fuel into the state and not directly at the pump. Though tax cuts at the wholesale level are passed down to retailers, small cuts would not necessarily show up in prices set by gas stations since variations of a few cents among stations are common.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure consumers would see it,'' said Rayola Dougher, the manager of energy market issues for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group. ''They might see something, but I'd be astonished if they saw 8 cents across the board.''</p>
        <p>New York's move is among a variety of measures being looked at nationwide as gasoline prices have topped $3 a gallon in many areas and the summer driving season nears. Last week, for instance, Gov. Mike Easley of North Carolina called for freezing his state's gas taxes.</p>
        <p>Proceeds from New York's gas tax are distributed to state and local governments. The legislative plan would effectively cap a state sales tax component of the tax at 8 cents per gallon, 4 cents less than the current tax.</p>
        <p>It would also give counties the authority to take a similar step and save up to another 5 1/2 cents at current prices, which would reduce their local revenue. If all of the counties opted in, it would cost the state and localities about $450 million annually -- and it would mean the state would no longer profit from the increasing price of gas.</p>
        <p>''State and local governments should not reap a revenue windfall from high gas prices,'' said Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, a Republican.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, a driver filling up a Toyota Camry could save 74 cents in state taxes and as much as $1.76 over all in counties with the highest taxes, if they choose to opt in. But in reality, while a steep cut in gas taxes would almost surely be felt, modest cuts could be lost in the distribution chain from the oil companies to the gas stations, several oil industry officials said. And that could leave at least some of the tax relief in the hands of the big oil companies that have been reporting record profits.</p>
        <p>Legislative leaders said their bill would require that gas stations pass savings along to customers, and said that the State Department of Taxation and Finance, and the Consumer Protection Board, would be charged with assuring that the modest savings be passed to consumers through audits of gas station records. They said that gas stations did not do so would be fined $5,000 per incident.</p>
        <p>Asked how they would guarantee such modest savings would reach consumers, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the state's top Democrat, said, ''Guarantee is a hard thing to do,'' adding, ''You've got to look at market forces, you've got to look at pricing patterns.''</p>
        <p>Other legislators were skeptical.</p>
        <p>''Are you going to have a thousand new Tax and Finance workers running to gas stations all over the state and comparing notes? I don't think so,'' said Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat.</p>
        <p>In an interview from a stop on the New York State Thruway on Wednesday, Ms. Krueger said a gallon of regular was selling there for $3.29. ''I empathize with the desire of government to try to be doing something, and it's not that I have opposition to this, it's that this isn't addressing the real problem,'' she said, adding that the nation should move towards tougher fuel economy regulations.</p>
        <p>The gas tax cut was part of legislation that included other more modest energy proposals, including granting New York City the authority that other localities already have to reduce or eliminate the 4 percent local sales taxes on home heating fuels, a plan the Bloomberg administration has not signed on to. The legislation would also provide tax credits to people using biodiesel for home heating and credits of up to $500 for people who buy energy efficient heating systems.</p>
        <p>The Legislature also backed a plan already being carried out by Mr. Pataki to make alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel available on the New York State Thruway.</p>
        <p>Peter Constantakes, a Pataki spokesman, focused on the alternative fuel measures in a statement. ''While we need to review the specifics of this legislation, the Legislature's proposal appears to contain elements that recognize the need to develop new sources of renewable energy,'' he said.</p>
