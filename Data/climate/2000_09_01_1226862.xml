        <p>France Proposes Tax Cuts  France proposed a large package of tax cuts, nudged by Germany and probably providing an example to Italy. The proposed cuts, totaling roughly $16 billion over three years, are part of a wave of similar measures being enacted across Europe, as governments react to increased tax revenue from expanding economies and declining unemployment.</p>

        <p>Clinton Vetoes G.O.P. Bill To Repeal the Estate Tax  President Clinton vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill to repeal the federal estate tax, saying it would benefit only the rich, and he stepped up election-year sparring over tax cuts and how to use the budget surplus.</p>

        <p>Bush Ad Mocks Gore Character  Aides to Gov. George W. Bush said they had approved a television advertisement that strikes directly at Vice President Al Gore's character. They said the ad was intended as a ''tongue-in-cheek'' response to critical Democratic ads.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The Democratic National Committee dropped plans for a commercial questioning Governor Bush's record in Texas, choosing to yield the spotlight to the new Republican attack ad in hope that it would backfire.</p>

        <p>Youthful Drug Use Declines  The use of illegal drugs by youths aged 12 to 17 dropped sharply from 1997 to 1999, the government said. And while drug use among people 18 to 25 went up, it was still far below what it was 20 years ago.</p>

        <p>Lazio's Fund-Raising Sprint Keeps Him in Money Race  Representative Rick A. Lazio raised $10.7 million in just seven weeks this summer, aides said, leaving little doubt that despite his late entry into the Senate race, he will have the means to battle Hillary Rodham Clinton, who raised $3.3 million during the same seven-week period. Over all, however, she has raised $21.9 million to his $19.2 million.</p>

        <p>Report on Radiation Leak  An independent monitor has found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted inadequate inspections at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant as far back as 1997 and relied on flawed analyses, inexperienced staff members and the company it was supposed to regulate. The report also criticized Con Edison, the owner of the plant, which was the site of a radiation leak in February.</p>

        <p>Signs of Slowdown Lift Stocks  Factory orders declined 7.5 percent in July, the biggest decline on record, and a report showed that industry in the Chicago area contracted in August to the lowest point since 1996. Merchants reported that sales in August rose only 3 percent, below analysts' expectations. The data suggest that recent interest rate increases may be taking hold and slowing the economy, which may ease Fed concern about inflation. Stocks advanced sharply.</p>
