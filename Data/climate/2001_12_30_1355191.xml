        <p>In 1972, David McTaggart, a Canadian badminton champion, sailed his yacht to the Mururoa atoll in the South Pacific, where France had been conducting nuclear tests for six years. The French rammed his boat and detained him and later claimed to have rescued him after an accident. The following year McTaggart repeated the stunt, and French commandos boarded his boat and assaulted him, injuring his right eye. The French claimed that McTaggart fell, but photos smuggled from this incident proved that he had been attacked. From then on, McTaggart transformed Greenpeace from an obscure organization into one with international recognition, one that was often associated with the ''environmental commando'' tactics McTaggart favored. Below, Ted Turner talks about the fiery environmentalist.</p>

Below, Ted Turner talks about the fiery environmentalist.</p>
        <p>When you first met David McTaggart, were you surprised to find someone like him in charge of the dreamers at Greenpeace?</p>
        <p>I can't remember when I met him for the first time. I feel like I always knew him, he was such a kindred spirit. He wanted to save the whales and rid the world of nuclear weapons and straighten out the environment and save Antarctica -- all the things I wanted to do as well.</p>
        <p>I was a big admirer of Greenpeace, and I already knew that he had sailed his little boat into where they were going to conduct that above-ground nuclear test. And he called the French on the radio and said, ''If you drop the bomb, you blow me up.'' I mean, that's pretty courageous stuff. He got beat up, you know. One of his good lines that I thought was really, really poignant was, when people would ask him why he was so interested in saving the whales, he would say, ''Well, if we could stop killing the whales, maybe we could stop killing each other.'' That's a good one, isn't it?</p>
        <p>It is a good one. Did he look and act the part or was he -</p>
        <p>He was a small guy, short. I would say he was -- I'm guessing now. I'm 6-1, so he must have been about 5-4, 5-5, 5-7.</p>
        <p>I don't know, but he was short, shorter than me. And he was a Scotchman. Yeah, McTaggart! Are you kiddin'? And he was very energetic. You know that character in the Bugs Bunny cartoons -- we own Bugs Bunny -- the guy with the big red mustache?</p>
        <p>That's Yosemite Sam.</p>
        <p>Yeah, he was kind of like Yosemite Sam. He was always moving real fast and he was kind of nervous, darting this way and that. You know, he had that tremendous energy.</p>
        <p>When was the last time you saw him?</p>
        <p>I had lunch with him a couple months before he died [in a car accident on March 23]. It was his last trip to the United States. Oh, it was a very pleasant lunch. I'm sure we talked about the usual stuff -- how we were going to save the world.</p>
        <p>What was the next thing he would have done?</p>
        <p>After saving the world?</p>
        <p>No, the next way he would have tried to save the world?</p>
        <p>Well, basically, those people who are trying to save the world have a rather long agenda. You've got to rid the world of nuclear weapons. And then after that, you've got disease, you've got global warming, population explosion. It's all the stuff that everyone knows. But we keep working on it. It's an uphill battle.</p>
        <p>Was he still determined to make a difference, even after decades of ups and downs?</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah. And he was very, very smart. He understood the situation. And he would not allow himself to get discouraged. David knew that you've gotta keep on truckin'.</p>
