        <p>As the drought continues, take note of the survivors in the desert. Sedums do well in dry weather, thanks to their waxy cuticles and an ability to store carbon dioxide at night, rather than in the daytime, which means they lose less water vapor during transpiration.</p>
        <p>The display gardens at Nassau County's Cornell Cooperative Extension in Plainview, which is experimenting with drought-tolerant plants, have some unexpected flops and successes.</p>
        <p>"Of all things, some of the zinnias are doing real badly," said Richard Weir, an extension agent, "which is strange because zinnias come from arid parts of the world, like Mexico."</p>
        <p>Dwarf varieties like Star White, a low-grower that never stops flowering, are wilting badly. Rose Pinwheels are duds in drought. Scarlet Splendor, however, and the tall zinnias from the Dreamland series are just fine.</p>
        <p>Other winners in this weather are rose verbena (especially one called Homestead Purple), vinca and alonsoa, or mask flower. Unexpected losers are annual poppies and ursinia, which are supposed to do well in dry weather.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weir's all-time favorite is this combination: silvery gray perovskia, or Russian sage; airy pale lavender limonium or sea-lavender, and a gomphrena called Lavender Lady.</p>
        <p>If you want to see the garden under fire, it's open daily at the corner of Old Country and Round Swamp Roads in Plainview, L.I. Just look for the green Nassau County sign.</p>
