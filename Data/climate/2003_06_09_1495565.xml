        <p>For now, it appears that the town of Lead, S.D., will soon be left with only a waterlogged hole in the ground where a world-class laboratory was supposed to be.</p>
        <p>That would be a turnaround from less than two weeks ago, when the National Science Foundation released a report that concluded the Homestake Mine in Lead was the best site for a deep underground laboratory to conduct research not possible on the earth's surface, includingphysics experiments to detect wispy subatomic particles known as neutrinos and biological studies of deep-earth microbes.</p>
        <p>But if the players in the drama surrounding Homestake, a former gold mine in the Black Hills near the Wyoming border that shut down in 2001, act out the roles they have declared for themselves, workers at Homestake will soon shut off the pumps that keep the mine from flooding.</p>
        <p>The Barrick Gold Corporation of Toronto, owner of Homestake, has resolutely stated it will shut off the pumps at Homestake early this week, arguing that it would be foolish to spend more than $250,000 a month to keep the mine dry and that the water could be pumped out later if plans for a laboratory became more certain.</p>
        <p>Scientists who have worked two years to convert the mine into a laboratory would then give up their efforts. In a statement released Friday, the scientists said the flooding, which is inevitable without the pumps, would wreck the possibility of microbe studies and possibly weaken the tunnels.</p>
        <p>They said they doubted that the National Science Foundation would spend millions of dollars to pump the water out.</p>
        <p>The scientists said they will finish and submit engineering plans for the laboratory, but will then begin looking for new locations. ''We think our time is better spent elsewhere,'' said Dr. Wick C. Haxton, a professor of physics at the University of Washington who heads the proposal.</p>
        <p>Without an active proposal before it, the National Science Foundation will probably delay a workshop it had planned to hold on a Homestake laboratory and move on to other matters, although another team of scientists could submit a new proposal.</p>
        <p>''We continue to check our mail,'' said Curt Suplee, a spokesman for the science foundation.</p>
        <p>Lead (pronounced leed) will start looking elsewhere for its future. ''We've been on hold too long,'' said Tom Nelson, the town's mayor.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation had assembled a panel of mining engineers to evaluate three proposed sites for the laboratory: Homestake, Soudan Mine in Minnesota and Mount San Jacinto in California. The panel concluded that Homestake was the best by far and also urged Barrick to keep the pumps running. If the pumps are turned off, water would fill the lower 3,000 feet or so of the 8,000-foot-deep mine within two or three years -- the minimum amount of time before financing for a laboratory could become available.</p>
        <p>In addition, the science foundation said that additional proposals for an underground laboratory should focus on Homestake, not any other site.</p>
        <p>But the science foundation itself is, in a sense, agnostic about whether the mine floods or not. While scientific reviews have concluded that an underground laboratory would open worthwhile avenues of research, the science foundation has not taken a position that it is actively seeking to build an underground laboratory.</p>
        <p>''It's a perennial misunderstanding,'' Mr. Suplee said. ''We don't build things. We fund proposals to build things, and then we kind of oversee them. We don't own stuff and run it.''</p>
        <p>The scientists behind the proposal and officials at Barrick have clearly become frustrated with each other. For months, each side has called the other misinformed and unyielding, their words conveyed via the news media and politicians rather than face to face.</p>
        <p>''The scientists sort of view this in simple terms, because they're not responsible for the cost of maintaining the mine or the safety risk of sending people down into the mine,'' said Patrick Garver, general counsel of Barrick.</p>
        <p>Barrick officials, for example, have been dismissive of the scientists' contentions that the flooding would wreck microbe research. They said the scientists' proposal made small mention of that research and mention that flooding would cause a problem. Dr. Haxton said the scientists did not raise the concern, because Barrick had not told them it was going to flood Homestake.</p>
        <p>''I think there are good intentions on all sides and mistrust on all sides,'' said Dr. John Bahcall, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton who has offered advice on Homestake but is not directly involved with Dr. Haxton's collaboration.</p>
        <p>South Dakota's governor and congressmen continue to express optimism that the laboratory project will move forward, even if the current scientific advocates disperse.</p>
        <p>''If the worst in terms of this situation comes -- we're at a position where Barrick does turn the pumps off -- at that point, I still believe there is a good chance of making this facility, of making this location work for an underground laboratory,'' Gov. Mike Rounds said.</p>
        <p>The optimistic hope is that Homestake's virtues would eventually draw the scientists back.</p>
        <p>The Haxton group, however, insists it will go elsewhere. Homestake may be the best site, but the scientists are not willing to wait indefinitely. Some will conduct their experiences at existing, less deep underground laboratories like the one at Soudan Mine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Haxton said he and others had begun looking at two or three sites where they might be able to build a laboratory similar to what had been proposed for Mount San Jacinto. Instead of digging down deep, a tunnel could be cut into mountain. Access into the laboratory would be easier, and the mountain above would provide equally good shielding from cosmic rays for experiments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tullis Onstott, a professor of geosciences at Princeton University, would like to study using microbes to dissolve rock as potentially a new way to extract metals. Dr. Onstott also wants to study another type of microbes that eat carbon dioxide and produce solid calcium carbonate as waste.</p>
        <p>Those opportunities, however, are lost if Homestake floods, he said. The heat and water will change the environment too drastically at the bottom of the mine, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's probably going be like the world's biggest fermentation tank,'' he said. ''Whatever gets cooked up in the stew pot will contaminate the surfaces.''</p>
        <p>It would be possible to drill new tunnels to expose untainted rock, but ''it just adds on more cost than we are currently planning for,'' Dr. Onstott said.</p>
        <p>''That pretty much shuts it down for us. We'll probably just go somewhere else, do what we can.''</p>
