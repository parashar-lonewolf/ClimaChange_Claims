        <p>Invoking grand national efforts like the Manhattan Project and the race to put a man on the moon, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that it was time for America to set a similarly ambitious goal of eliminating the country's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Linking his call to the fight against terrorism, Mr. Pataki told an audience at Columbia University that our dependency on foreign oil was, in effect, a ''terror tax'' and that it was time for the country to develop alternate sources of fuel and to set a goal of reducing government consumption of oil by 35 percent over the next decade, as he has called for in New York.</p>

        <p>Invoking grand national efforts like the Manhattan Project and the race to put a man on the moon, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that it was time for America to set a similarly ambitious goal of eliminating the country's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Linking his call to the fight against terrorism, Mr. Pataki told an audience at Columbia University that our dependency on foreign oil was, in effect, a ''terror tax'' and that it was time for the country to develop alternate sources of fuel and to set a goal of reducing government consumption of oil by 35 percent over the next decade, as he has called for in New York.</p>
        <p>''Imagine what we could do if we set not just a New York goal but a national goal,'' Mr. Pataki said. The goal: ''By the end of the next decade to break our dependency on foreign oil.''</p>
        <p>However, environmentalists said that Mr. Pataki's remarks, before a conference gathered to discuss global warming, followed a pattern of his rhetoric outpacing his actions. Specifically, they pointed to the limited progress New York has made in one main area that is a direct result of the burning of fossil fuels: carbon monoxide emissions. Environmental groups said that while they have pushed Mr. Pataki to limit emissions by power plants, he has instead merely appointed committees to study the issue.</p>
        <p>''We think that while there has been progress made by the governor, that definitely more can be done,'' said Jason K. Babbie, an environmental policy analyst for the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Pataki's speech, he listed several steps the state has taken toward developing cleaner, alternative fuels. He noted that when he first became governor in 1995, there were only four state vehicles that were hybrid cars, using a combination of fuel and another power source. Today, he said, there were 4,000 such cars in the state fleet. He also said that converting the bus fleet in New York City off diesel fuel had been another major accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, a Republican, also broke from the traditional national party line, and the default position of the Bush administration, saying that it was best to leave innovations and change in the alternative fuels arena to the industry. He said that it is government, in fact, that has a critical role in leading and making laws to spearhead change.</p>
        <p>''One of the things we are looking to do with the power of state government is to create markets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, answering questions after his speech, was careful to say that his remarks were not a criticism of the Bush administration. While President Bush has been derided for what political opponents say is a less-than-ambitious agenda on developing alternative energy sources, Mr. Pataki said he believed the president shared his vision.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, ''There is no question in my mind that we can do more.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Pataki, who has styled himself a moderate Republican with national ambitions, the issue of the environment, particularly when it is cloaked in domestic security, is relatively safe terrain. He has been highlighting environmental issues all week, as the speech at Columbia came one day after he announced that New York had reached a deal to protect roughly 260,000 acres of Adirondack wilderness.</p>
