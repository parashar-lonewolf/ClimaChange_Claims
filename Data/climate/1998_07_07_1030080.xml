        <p>Dressed in camouflage gear and war paint, reeking of bug spray and perspiration and armed with rifles and ammo, Dan Furlong and his buddies were having the time of their lives, replaying the games of childhood.</p>
        <p>Shouts of ''I nailed you, big daddy!'' and ''You got me, man!'' rose from the wooded playing field. From behind bunkers and thick trees, their escape slowed by gopher holes and knee-high grass, two teams fired gooey pellets of paint at each other. The ''dead'' left the field with carbon dioxide-powered guns raised over their heads in surrender, then compared welts with those who had fallen before them.</p>
        <p>''I wish everybody would get killed so we could eat,'' said Mr. Furlong, the center of attention this muggy summer afternoon. Mr. Furlong, 30, is to be married Saturday, and this was his bachelor party.</p>
        <p>The rowdy day of mock warfare -- a cross between a ''Die Hard'' movie and a game of capture the flag -- was organized for Mr. Furlong by his best man, Mike Jackel, who a year ago chose the same way to celebrate his passage from the single life to matrimony. They are part of a small but growing legion of men who are shunning the traditional bachelor party, a bacchanal with strippers, in favor of more politically correct, if no less masculine, events.</p>
        <p>Paintball parties, like Mr. Furlong's, are popular. So are golf outings, like the one for Pete Wolverton, a book editor in New York City who joined his friends for five rounds in three days near Cooperstown, in upstate New York. Or baseball excursions, like the chartered bus trip to an Orioles game at Camden Yards in Baltimore for John Massy, a Connecticut bond trader. Or an all-male weekend in the Hamptons, the party of choice for Rob Gerstner, a New York City businessman.</p>
        <p>Strip clubs, like Scores on the East Side of Manhattan, report no loss in business. In fact, a spokesman there boasted that celebrity grooms-to-be have included the Yankees' David Cone and Roseanne's ex, Tom Arnold. But bridal magazines across the nation have taken note of the movement away from debauchery to parties built around adventure and athletics.</p>
        <p>''It's really coming on strong,'' said Thomas Gunning, the editor of Wedding Pages, which publishes 39 zoned editions. Mr. Gunning recently commissioned an article on the trend away from liquor and lap dancing. ''What modern, sophisticated woman is going to abide that?'' he continued. ''This is a survival instinct among men. Women will not stay with us if we're that stupid.''</p>
        <p>Far be it from experts to pass up the opportunity to slap some polysyllabic labels on a trend. Activities like paintball or other team sports are ''aggressive coalitionary behavior,'' said Richard Wrangham, a Harvard University anthropologist, ''an evolutionary necessity for the male of the species,'' who must learn to hunt and wage war. Such behavior, which involves ''aiming and chasing,'' is inherently pleasurable to men, according to Steven Pinker, a psychologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And its ''sheer physicality is one of the last refuges of maleness,'' said Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist at the University of Washington. ''Doing this kind of guy thing,'' she said, ''is a way of saying 'I love this woman, but I'm still one of us.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tom Wilson, a Westchester dentist, was delighted when both his son and his son-in-law chose athletic celebrations, one a ball game and the other a shark-fishing excursion. ''It's infantile, an insult to your future wife,'' Dr. Wilson said of  stag parties. ''At this point in your life, when you're taking on the responsibility of a family, this is not the way to start off.''</p>
        <p>Another paintball bachelor party was in progress recently at a different field, this one celebrating the impending marriage of Sean Cusack, a 25-year-old salesman from Mineola, Long Island, and Colette Tricarico, 30, an accountant. Like most of the women interviewed, Ms. Tricarico said she had many friends who all but canceled a wedding over the indiscretions at a bachelor party.</p>
        <p>''But it wouldn't matter to me,'' she said. ''As long as he came home in one piece. Anyway, I can strip for him!''</p>
        <p>Wedding consultants, who are usually not involved in the bachelor's plans, nonetheless advise a tame celebration. ''I've been suggesting this kind of thing to my bridegrooms,'' said Claudia Hilbert, a party planner in Bronxville, N.Y. ''This way, you don't have him rolling in -- or not rolling in -- for the ceremony.''</p>
        <p>Scott Torkos, 27, a police officer in Denville, N.J., said his pals have not stopped talking about his paintball party last year. ''It's still a macho thing, but here you get to shoot and kill all your friends,'' Mr. Torkos  said.</p>
        <p>Jerry McAward, the owner of the field where Mr. Torkos played, in Jim Thorpe, Penn., said he had never been asked to provide a stripper on the sidelines. Mr. McAward's theory, more colloquially expressed than those of the academics, is that ''yelling and screaming like a 12-year-old does the trick.''</p>
        <p>There was bonding aplenty at Paintball Madness here, a 394-acre complex a few miles from Middletown, N.Y., followed by a barbecue in Mr. Furlong's honor at the home of his best man, Mr. Jackel, in Mahopac. Two women were invited, Mr. Jackel's wife and his sister Meredith, and their presence caused barely a ripple -- except when Lisa Jackel ''killed'' her husband in the first salvo of the first game. Since they were teammates, the hit was recorded as friendly fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Furlong's bride, however, did not get a chance to figuratively eliminate him. She was at the manicurist, he said, getting nail extensions so her hands would look perfect in the ''ring pictures'' two weeks hence. The pearly polish would be touched up right before the wedding, Mr. Furlong said, but meanwhile she would get used to moving about with long fingernails.</p>
        <p>The goal of the game is either to capture the other team's flag or to kill all the opponents by plugging them with .68-caliber pellets, the size of marbles, that are made of vegetable oil, dishwashing soap and water-soluble dye. Referees determine when a player has been killed by examining the splat of paint on his jumpsuit. The pellets leave raised, red welts on the skin; the carbon dioxide rifles shoot with a report as loud as a pistol.</p>
        <p>Mr. Furlong, a youth pastor at a church in Yorktown, had a moment of glory midway through the afternoon. He was patiently biding his time in the shrubs near the corner of the field, just waiting for someone from the other team to dare a run for the flag.</p>
        <p>Phil Sessa, a 22-year-old intern at the church, did just that when his team had Mr. Furlong outmanned, two to one. Mr. Sessa raced the length of the field unchallenged and had his hand outstretched for the flag when Mr. Furlong aimed a volley of pellets at him. None hit the younger man. But he stumbled out of bounds, empty-handed, and thus lost the game.</p>
        <p>Mr. Furlong retreated in triumph to a chaise longue near the grill where hamburgers hissed. ''This is a good way to get out of doing the lawn,'' he said. ''There are 15 guys here who should be mowing today but aren't.''</p>
        <p>His friends -- from church, the local weight room and the good seats at Madison Square Garden, where they enjoy the fights -- were straggling off the field. One of them, Steve DeMand, an aircraft technician, had tree limbs stuck in the waistband of his camouflage suit, war paint smeared on his face and a sweat-soaked bandanna on his head.</p>
        <p>''My man, my man,'' he said to Mr. Furlong. ''About to tie the knot.''</p>
        <p>''Awesome, isn't it?'' the happy bachelor replied.</p>
