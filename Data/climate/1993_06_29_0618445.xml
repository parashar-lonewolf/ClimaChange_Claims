        <p>THE destruction of habitat and loss of living species as a result of deforestation in the Amazon basin of Brazil is much greater than had previously been believed, according to a new analysis of satellite photographs.

        <p>THE destruction of habitat and loss of living species as a result of deforestation in the Amazon basin of Brazil is much greater than had previously been believed, according to a new analysis of satellite photographs. But the same photographs also show that the annual rate of deforestation is lower than had been thought.</p>
        <p>The reason for the apparent paradox, say the authors of the unusually meticulous and detailed study, is that the disruptive impact of tree-cutting on plants, animals and microbes is not confined to the cut-over area but extends deep into the remaining forest, as well as into isolated "islands" of forest in the middle of otherwise denuded acreage. Past estimates have not taken these effects into account, but the authors of the latest analysis say that it more than doubles the area of ecological damage caused by deforestation itself.</p>
        <p>"The effect of deforestation on biological diversity and on habitat is much greater than the deforestation per se," said Dr. Compton Tucker, a biologist and tropical forest expert at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. He and Dr. David Skole, a physical scientist at the University of New Hampshire, reported their findings in the current issue of the journal Science.</p>
        <p>More than half the world's species live in tropical forests, and many biologists have been sounding an alarm about the forests' destruction. Preserving them has become a major point of contention between the developing countries of the tropics, which see the forests as important to their economic development, and environmentalists in industrialized countries who fear a mass extinction of species.</p>
        <p>Over more than two years, Dr. Tucker and Dr. Skole examined photographs of the Brazilian Amazon taken by the Landsat satellite and by weather satellites; they also studied vegetation maps of Brazil. Rather than take a broad-brush approach to assessing deforestation, they carefully identified and excluded from their count of forest acreage such features as open savanna, water and roads. They hoped in this way to get a more accurate estimate of the extent of forestation.</p>
        <p>Assuming that the "edge effect" of deforestation extends into the forest up to one kilometer (or a little more than six-tenths of a mile) beyond the forest perimeter, they identified all the edge areas they could find. These included clearings caused not only by deforestation for agriculture but those cuts made by rubber tappers, mine operators, airfield and road construction and other small ecological disturbances like the installation of power lines and pipelines. Geometry of Deforestation</p>
        <p>The scientists also identified islands of forest, areas smaller than 40 square miles that had been isolated by deforestation, and computed edge effects for a zone of one kilometer inside the islands' boundaries. In a widely accepted formula, ecologists calculate that when an island habitat of any sort is reduced by 90 percent, the number of species in it eventually is reduced by half.</p>
        <p>On the edges of the forest, Dr. Tucker said, any number of disturbances reduce species diversity: hunting, poaching, capturing animals, a change in the microclimate within the edge zone that affects microbes and insects, and even the wind. Tropical forest trees have shallow roots, he said, and wind gathering speed as it blows across the deforested area easily knocks them down. This "knockdown zone" extends perhaps 300-to-600 feet into the forest.</p>
        <p>An extreme example of the edge effect is offered in the Brazilian state of Rondonia, Dr. Tucker said. There, in the early 1980's, the World Bank financed a network of roads running parallel to each other at right angles to a main highway at intervals of about 2.5 miles. Small farmers settled along the roads and cleared forests, creating a highly fragmented forest pattern with many edges. "If you want to maximize the habitat fragmentation of the forest," said Dr. Tucker, "this is the best way to do it." The fragmented pattern, the Tucker-Skole analysis showed, covered some 30,000 square miles. As a result, the two scientists reported, about a third of Rondonia's forests have suffered habitat loss even though only about 10 percent of the trees have been cut.</p>
        <p>The World Bank stopped financing roads in the Brazilian Amazon several years ago. While Bank officials concede that the roads may have accelerated migration into the area, they maintain that Brazilian government policies encouraging the migration are mostly responsible.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tucker and Dr. Skole also analyzed the shapes of deforested areas, because the edge effect increases or decreases according to their geometry. For instance, they say in their paper, if a 100-square-kilometer patch of tropical deforestation occurs as a single square and the edge effect is 1 kilometer, the total area affected by ecological damage is 143 square kilometers. By contrast, if 100 square kilometers of deforestation is distributed as 10 strips, each 10 kilometers by 1 kilometer, the affected area is 350 square kilometers.</p>
        <p>By combining all these factors, Dr. Tucker and Dr. Skole determined that tropical deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased to 89,000 square miles in 1988 from 30,000 square miles in 1978. The 1988 figure represented 6 percent of the Brazilian forest. But the total area of biological disturbance, with the edge areas and islands included, increased to 227,000 square miles from 80,000 square miles. The 227,000-square-mile area of biological disturbance amounted to about 15 percent of the total forest. It was not possible to calculate how many species were extinguished or rendered endangered, since it is not known how many were there to start with. Effect on Climate</p>
        <p>By comparison, an earlier study of satellite photographs made by the respected Brazilian Space Research Institute estimated a total area of actual deforestation of 108,000 square miles in 1988, 20 percent more than the new estimate. That study also estimated the average annual rate of deforestation in that decade to be 8,100 square miles. Dr. Tucker and Dr. Skole placed it at 5,800 square miles.</p>
        <p>The new finding suggests further that the destruction of tropical forests contributes relatively less to a continuing buildup in the atmosphere of heat-trapping carbon dioxide than has been thought, and that the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal contributes relatively more.</p>
        <p>Trees exacerbate the problem when they are cut down, by giving off carbon dioxide as they are burned, and mitigate it when they are alive, by absorbing carbon dioxide. Some climatologists fear that the atmospheric buildup of the gas could eventually bring on a catastrophic warming of the planet and otherwise disrupt its climate.</p>
        <p>The findings may also go partway toward solving a longstanding mystery about the cycling of carbon through the atmosphere, the oceans and terrestrial plants. Every year, about 5.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide are added to the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels, along with an unknown amount from the burning of tropical forests -- scientists have generally used a figure of about 1.5 billion tons -- for an estimated total of 7 billion tons. About 3.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide are known to stay in the atmosphere, contributing to a steady global buildup. The rest is taken up by the oceans and by plants, which scientists refer to as carbon dioxide sinks. Scientists believe the oceans account for about 2 billion tons of this uptake, but have been mystified as to where the remaining 1.5 billion tons go because they think this quantity is too much to be absorbed by the world's vegetation and soils.</p>
        <p>Since the new findings suggest that deforestation is contributing less carbon dioxide to the air than had been thought, "the missing sink may not be as big as we thought it was," said Dr. Inez Fung, a climate researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "We've been struggling for several years now trying to find the extra sink in the sea or on the land. We haven't come close to resolving it, and this maybe will help us."</p>
        <p>In a political context, she said, the findings reinforce the view that any effort to curb a possible global warming "has to focus on us, on the industrialized nations," since their contribution to the buildup of atmospheric concentration is even greater relative to that of developing countries than had been thought.</p>
