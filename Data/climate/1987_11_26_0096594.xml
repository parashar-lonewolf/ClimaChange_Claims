        <p>LEAD: A former ambassador to South Korea testified today that Michael K. Deaver handed a letter from President Reagan to the President of South Korea when Mr. Deaver was soliciting Seoul as a private lobbying client.</p>
        <p>A former ambassador to South Korea testified today that Michael K. Deaver handed a letter from President Reagan to the President of South Korea when Mr. Deaver was soliciting Seoul as a private lobbying client.</p>
        <p>The former ambassador, Richard L. Walker, testified in Mr. Deaver's perjury trial that he arranged the visit in July 1985 which Mr. Deaver handed over the Reagan letter.</p>
        <p>The letter to President Chun Doo Hwan must have been ''personal'' and ''off the record,'' according to earlier testimony by the State Department official in charge of routing and filing all diplomatic messages. That witness, Nicholas Platt, testified two weeks ago that there is no official record of such a Presidential letter. Letter Remained Unopened</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker said Mr. Deaver ''just put the letter on the table - the letter wasn't opened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver had left his post as deputy White House chief of staff in May 1985 to open Michael K. Deaver and Associates, a lobbying firm that quickly obtained a $475,000-a-year contract to represent the South Korean Government here on trade matters.</p>
        <p>In questioning Mr. Walker, Randall J. Turk, one of Mr. Deaver's defense lawyers, said ''there is no evidence, in the United States files or the files of the government of South Korea,'' that Mr. Reagan wrote a letter to President Chun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker answered that the Government in Seoul ''doesn't disclose what's available there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker was asked by Whitney North Seymour Jr., the special prosecutor in the Deaver case, ''Did Mr. Deaver seem to be trying to ingratiate himself with the Government of South Korea in order to become its consultant?'' ''Yes,'' Mr. Walker replied. Visit by Korean Opposed The former ambassador, who retired in November 1986 after undergoing treatment for cancer, said that in September of that year, in a series of cabled exchanges with Mr. Deaver in Washington, he made sudden and extraordinary arrangements through the National Security Council for a White House visit with Mr. Reagan by Kim Kiwhan, a special trade envoy carrying a letter from President Chun.</p>
        <p>Donald Regan, then the White House chief of staff, testified last week that he had bitterly opposed Mr. Kim's visit to the Oval Office on Oct. 2, 1986, because it set ''a terrible precedent'' for appointments with low-level foreign emissaries. Mr. Regan said that as chief of staff he had twice stricken the Kim visit from the President's schedule.</p>
        <p>But testimony showed that after a telephone call by Mr. Deaver to Adm. John M. Poindexter, then the National Security Adviser, Mr. Kim was permitted a ceremonial handshake with Mr. Reagan, and used the occasion to turn over President Chun's letter.</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Reagan had read the letter, Mr. Regan replied, ''Probably not.''</p>
        <p>On the witness stand today, Mr. Walker left unexplained a statement drawn from him by Mr. Seymour that he, too, had subsequently tried to cancel the Kim visit but was too late; The White House meeting had already taken place.</p>
        <p>Today's testimony was interrupted by more than a dozen prolonged, whispered bench conferences among the lawyers and Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.</p>
        <p>Former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis, who served as the United States special acid rain envoy to Canada in 1985, also testified today.</p>
        <p>He said he consulted Mr. Deaver frequently about his problems with Mr. Regan, who he said opposed most efforts to reduce the effect of United States industrial pollution on Canada. But Mr. Lewis contradicted earlier prosecution testimony that Mr. Deaver had been instrumental in his selection for the acid rain post.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver is accused of lying to a grand jury about his involvement in the Lewis appointment and of lying to a House subcommittee when he denied doing anything to help Mr. Kim get his White House visit.</p>
