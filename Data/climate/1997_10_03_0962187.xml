        <p>The Cable News Network told a coalition of industrial companies today that it would no longer broadcast the group's advertisements criticizing the Clinton Administration's negotiating stance in international talks on controlling global warming.</p>
        <p>The advertisements, which CNN and local affiliates of other networks have televised for about three weeks, are part of a $13 million campaign led by the energy and automobile industries to head off a treaty that would set binding limits on industrial nations' emissions of greenhouse gases, which come mostly from the burning of fossil fuels. The Administration strongly supports setting those limits.</p>
        <p>CNN told the industry coalition, the Global Climate Information Project, that it was no longer appropriate for the network to carry the advertisements because it was devoting considerable news coverage to the global-warming debate, said Steve Haworth, vice president for public relations at CNN's news division. Mr. Haworth said the network had a policy against televising advocacy advertisements on issues that it is covering significantly.</p>
        <p>CNN reviewed the matter, Mr. Haworth said, after the accuracy of the coalition's advertisements had been challenged by the Environmental Information Center, a group that advocates a strong treaty to control global warming. He said that the review had reached no conclusion about the accuracy of the advertisements but that the network would nonetheless televise no advocacy advertisements from either side during the debate leading up to treaty talks in Japan this December.</p>
        <p>The coalition's advertisements contend that the proposed treaty would be unfair because developing countries would not face its strict limits and that it would harm the American economy by imposing controls on fossil fuel consumption.</p>
        <p>Industry officials accused the network of censoring their views to control the debate on global warming, and suggested that the move reflected support for environmental causes, and for the United Nations, by Ted Turner, CNN's founder. Mr. Turner recently pledged to donate $1 billion to the United Nations, the sponsor of the treaty negotiations.</p>
