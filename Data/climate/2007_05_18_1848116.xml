        <p>''Gabon: The Last Eden,'' tonight on the National Geographic Channel, is an example of a currently popular genre that could be called enviroporn. Born from the union of global warming mania and the increasing ease with which anything, anywhere can be photographed in brilliantly colorful detail, it proliferates on outlets like National Geographic, the Discovery Channel and PBS.</p>
        <p>In these programs the documentation of embattled park rangers and conservationists is the obligatory setup -- the plumber walking into the bored housewife's kitchen, as it were -- that we have to sit through to get to the good stuff. Don't kid yourself: The helicopter shots of the surreally beautiful landscape and the close-up scenes of frolicking forest elephants and lowland gorillas are the real draw here. Ivory poachers? Well, everyone has to make a living. Now can you show us that amazing shot of the Kongou Falls just one more time?</p>

        <p>''Gabon: The Last Eden,'' tonight on the National Geographic Channel, is an example of a currently popular genre that could be called enviroporn. Born from the union of global warming mania and the increasing ease with which anything, anywhere can be photographed in brilliantly colorful detail, it proliferates on outlets like National Geographic, the Discovery Channel and PBS.</p>
        <p>In these programs the documentation of embattled park rangers and conservationists is the obligatory setup -- the plumber walking into the bored housewife's kitchen, as it were -- that we have to sit through to get to the good stuff. Don't kid yourself: The helicopter shots of the surreally beautiful landscape and the close-up scenes of frolicking forest elephants and lowland gorillas are the real draw here. Ivory poachers? Well, everyone has to make a living. Now can you show us that amazing shot of the Kongou Falls just one more time?</p>
        <p>To its credit ''The Last Eden,'' produced by National Geographic Television with the BBC and the Japanese network NHK and narrated by Glenn Close, inverts the usual formula. Gabon has done more than other African nations to preserve its forests and protect its wildlife -- the Kongou Falls lie within one of 13 national parks that cover more than 10 percent of the country -- and the documentary honors that by giving more time to the struggles of rangers and scientists than it does to purely voyeuristic, armchair-traveler pleasures.</p>
        <p>Of course seeing how biologists track and tag a female elephant requires riding along as they fly over the forest, and the filmmakers can't help it if the myriad animals down on the ground are thrilling to look at.</p>
        <p>There are various house styles for these TV nature programs, including wonky-didactic (common at PBS) and mystical-reverent. ''The Last Eden,'' jumpy and quick moving, comes from the genre's music video branch, influenced by MTV and, most profoundly, the music, graphics and camerawork of ''Survivor.'' Nothing is lingered over, which may please the attention-deficit crowd but will leave other viewers wishing that they could spend just a little more time watching the elephant delicately pick its way up the riverbank, or smiling at the Sunday afternoon crowds of elephants, hippos, buffalo and gorillas that gather to play in the surf on the Loango beachfront.</p>
        <p>There, however, lies the real conundrum of this kind of show: The longer you spend looking at such amazing sights, the more inclined you are to want to go there and build a hotel on the beach.</p>
        <p>Gabon  The Last Eden  National Geographic, tonight at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.</p>
        <p>Keenan Smart, executive producer; Stella Cha, producer; for NGC, John Bowman, executive producer; Juliet Blake, senior vice president of production; John Ford, executive in charge of production; Glenn Close, narrator. Produced for the National Geographic Channel by National Geographic Television.</p>
