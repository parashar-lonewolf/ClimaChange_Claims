        <p>LEAD: ''THE traditional text of rock lyrics is adolescent love, period,'' said Robert Sietsema of the New York rock band Mofungo. ''We're not adolescents anymore, and we're not so interested in adolescent love, either. We read the paper and watch the news and when we get together to rehearse, we often start by discussing something we've read or seen.</p>
        <p>''THE traditional text of rock lyrics is adolescent love, period,'' said Robert Sietsema of the New York rock band Mofungo. ''We're not adolescents anymore, and we're not so interested in adolescent love, either. We read the paper and watch the news and when we get together to rehearse, we often start by discussing something we've read or seen. And frequently that gives rise to a song.''</p>
        <p>Mofungo's new album, ''End of the World Part Two'' (Lost/Twin Tone), includes a song urging the United States's withdrawal from Central America, a satire on Presidential news conferences, a celebration of Baby Doc's departure from Haiti and a warning about the possible consequences of depletion of the ozone layer. The band also does a garage-disco version of a 19th-century black folk ballad about the Ku Klux Klan. This isn't typical rock-and-roll by a long shot, but then Mofungo isn't your typical rock-and-roll band.</p>
        <p>Mofungo is celebrating the release of the new album with a performance tomorrow night at 11 o'clock at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, in Hoboken, N.J. (201-798-4064 or 201-656-9632). Tickets are $6. The Scene Is Now, a band that works in related musical styles and includes one musician who is also in Mofungo, Chris Nelson, is playing at Performance Space 122, First Avenue and Ninth Street, on Sunday at 9 P.M. Tickets are $5 (477-5288).</p>
        <p>The present-day Mofungo is the result of some eight years of growth, beginning in the early days of New York's ''no-wave'' scene. Mr. Sietsema and Willie Klein were in a band called Blinding Headache at the end of the 70's, playing in clubs like Max's Kansas City and CBGB alongside Mars, the Contortions, Teen-Age Jesus and the Jerks, and DNA, the four original no-wave bands that appeared on the influential compilation album ''No New York.'' When Blinding Headache's drummer left to join Information, the remainder of Blinding Headache became Mofungo. Mr. Nelson, a friend of the band members, played on early recordings, and became a full-time member a few years later. The fourth member of the current lineup, Elliott Sharp, a composer and multi-instrumentalist is a more recent addition. Inventing Structures</p>
        <p>''We all admired the original no-wave bands,'' Mr. Sietsema recalled. ''They showed us that any normal person who is not a musical virtuoso can pick up an instrument and, by dint of abbreviated application, play well enough to be in a band. They also showed us that the structure of the music doesn't have to be conventional or preordained, that people can get together and just invent structures based on what they hear. A lot of our early songs came out of that sensibility.''</p>
        <p>One of Mofungo's early recordings, ''End of the World,'' was among the first cassette-only albums. Calling the new album ''End of the World Part Two'' underlines both continuity and change in Mofungo's music. The apocalyptic imagery of some of the group's early material has carried over into newer songs, but there's been a growing tendency to examine the issues and forces at work in the world.</p>
        <p>''In the old days, we used to sing a lot about murder and mayhem,'' Mr. Sietsema said. ''Then we became more and more interested in issues like the war in Central America, more interested in conveying a message. During certain eras of rock there was no political rock music at all, which really used to bug me. People still say rock can't have a political message and be any good, but that's nonsense, and if we can do just a tiny bit to demonstrate that it's nonsense, then I'll be happy. I really think that rock can take anything as its text. That's just one of the many things that makes the music interesting.''</p>
        <p>''You start thinking about issues and it makes you interested in what kind of tradition you might be in,''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nelson said. ''You become interested in developing more of a historical perspective.'' This interest has led to original songs like ''Frederick Douglass,'' a portrait of the 19th-century black anti-slavery advocate, as well as to Mofungo's versions of Depression-era protest songs. ''We read a lot in these areas,'' Mr. Klein said, ''and when you write lyrics, you tend to write about something you're currently interested in.'' A Variety of Textures</p>
        <p>This growing lyrical sophistication has been part and parcel of Mofungo's overall musical growth. The abrasive edge of the early Mofungo is now one element among many. Textures from garage-band rock, free jazz, folk music, and various regional and ethnic styles coexist and collide, but all the music retains an appealingly off-center looseness.</p>
        <p>''The no-wave attitude,'' Mr. Sietsema said, ''was something like this: 'I'm going to do whatever I want, and I'm going to do it real loud, and I'm going to sound as weird as possible and try to shock the listener.' We've evolved from that toward wanting to communicate something more directly, and also wanting to please ourselves. In the current Mofungo era, one of the things we want to do is play as broad a range of styles as possible. Over the years, there's been a willingness to add new people as guest musicians and members, and there's been the willingness of certain members to quit and run off, or to go crazy. This has led to a dynamic in the band that's been very helpful: It's kept making us revise our music over and over again.''  POP/JAZZ</p>
