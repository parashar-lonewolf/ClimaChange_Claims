      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial notes that discussion about upcoming Senate race in New York is focusing mostly on personalities of likely candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; says state has economic and social problems, and deserves campaign that includes full discussion of important issues; calls on candidates, as they announce, to commit themselves to series of issue-based debates throughout campaign</p>

        <p>It is not surprising that almost all the discussion about the upcoming Senate race in New York concerns personalities. The cast of characters is, after all, larger than life. First Lady Hillary Clinton has all but officially announced her candidacy, as has Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. If Mr. Giuliani has to fight for the Republican nomination against Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, chances are that the Mayor's combative persona will be the focus of that primary as well.</p>
        <p>But New York is a state with more than its quota of economic and social problems. It deserves a campaign that includes a full discussion of the issues that will affect it in the next millennium.</p>

        <p>It is not surprising that almost all the discussion about the upcoming Senate race in New York concerns personalities. The cast of characters is, after all, larger than life. First Lady Hillary Clinton has all but officially announced her candidacy, as has Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. If Mr. Giuliani has to fight for the Republican nomination against Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, chances are that the Mayor's combative persona will be the focus of that primary as well.</p>
        <p>But New York is a state with more than its quota of economic and social problems. It deserves a campaign that includes a full discussion of the issues that will affect it in the next millennium.</p>
        <p>Education is a critical concern, and even at this early date, Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton have been sparring gingerly about school vouchers, which the Mayor supports and the First Lady opposes. But New York deserves a broader debate about how to improve the quality of its educational system. What is the proper role for the Federal Government in supporting local public schools? Should there be national standards to measure teacher qualifications and student success? What part could a United States senator play in debates about social promotion, remedial education and the proper role of teachers' and principals' unions?</p>
        <p>Candidates for the Senate always promise to bring home more bacon, but Mrs. Clinton will have to explain why it would be in the state's interest to have two Democratic senators when the Republicans appear to have a hold on majority control. Her opponent should be challenged to describe what he would do when his Sunbelt-dominated party pushed legislation that threatened the Northeast on matters like acid rain and transportation spending.</p>
        <p>The welfare reform bill, which Mr. Lazio supported and Mr. Giuliani opposed in part, is now the law of the land with wide backing even among the Democrats. But New York's role as a haven for immigrants and the presence here of so many second- and third-generation welfare recipients will make it hard for the state to proceed to the next step, when time limits kick in and families start being ejected from the system. The candidates should tell us what changes they would endorse to help states with large populations of recent immigrants and the very poor.</p>
        <p>Past experience suggests that when it comes to foreign policy, the Senate campaign will focus on the Mideast, with each candidate trying to grab the mantle of best friend to Israel. We would like to see a broader discussion that focused on the proper international role for the United States. Under what circumstances should Americans intervene in other countries' affairs? How much should we rely on the United Nations and NATO to represent our interests? How important are human-rights issues when it comes to relations with trading partners like China or Indonesia?</p>
        <p>On campaign finance reform, Mrs. Clinton would have a great deal of explaining to do about the abuses of existing laws that went on during  her husband's Administration, some of which involved her close associates, including her senior political adviser, Harold Ickes, and members of her White House staff. Mr. Giuliani ought to discuss how far he would be willing to buck his party, which has been blocking serious reform in Congress. Mr. Lazio, who has voted to strengthen the campaign finance laws, would have to tell voters why he declined to join his party's reform wing to force those bills to the floor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has already said that she would not try again to create the sort of sweeping solution to the nation's health care problems that she advocated in her early days as First Lady. But about 43 million Americans remain uninsured, including 3.1 million New Yorkers, and many of those who do have coverage express dissatisfaction with the restrictions of managed-care programs. Last year, during the exciting but not always enlightening Senate race between Charles Schumer and Alfonse D'Amato, the candidates were asked how health care costs could be kept down if insurance companies were forced by Congress to cover more and more procedures. The candidates, who had been vying to appear toughest on health maintenance organizations, both avoided the query and went back to arguing about who was more of a liar. With more than a year and a half before the Senate election, the candidates should have plenty of time to answer serious questions.</p>
        <p>Personalities are not irrelevant to this race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio would have every right to question whether Mr. Giuliani has the temperament to be an effective senator. Mr. Giuliani, who has already been harping on the carpetbag issue, is not out of line in wondering whether New York should be represented by someone who has actually lived here. Voters would naturally want to know how Mrs. Clinton plans to balance her role as Senate candidate with her duties as First Lady, and we have confidence her opponent will bring the matter up on their behalf.</p>
        <p>But it would be a shame if this contest, which may be the focus of almost as much attention as the Presidential race, should degenerate quickly into a sound-bite battle. Besides being national personalities, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani are intelligent and thoughtful political veterans with very different takes on the proper role of government. Mr. Lazio, who seems intent on depriving the national media of their dream race, is a serious legislator who has surprised people in the past with his ability to topple a high-profile politician.</p>
        <p>It is not too early to ask that the candidates, as they announce, commit themselves to a series of issue-based debates throughout the campaign, each focusing on a single topic, like education or foreign policy. The campaign will inevitably make compelling theater, but the candidates will need to give serious topics their due.</p>
