        <p>Pedro Sanchez, a Cuban-American soil scientist who pioneered methods for reviving tropical agriculture while saving threatened rain forests, was named the winner of the $250,000 World Food Prize yesterday at ceremonies in Toronto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanchez, 62, is chairman of the United Nations Task Force on World Hunger, but the award recognizes his decades of work to improve agricultural yields from depleted soil while protecting the environment in South America, Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanchez was cited for ''having played a critical role in establishing real alternatives to slash-and-burn farming, which has destroyed millions of acres of rain forest, as well as his work in driving the international effort to establish agroforestry as a means of mitigating global warming.''</p>
        <p>Educated at Cornell University after leaving Cuba in 1958, Mr. Sanchez first made his mark working in South America. He helped Peru improve its rice yields in the 1970's and then developed a soil management program for western Brazil, helping bring into production 75 million acres of cropland.</p>
        <p>As director of the International Center for Research in Agroforestry in Nairobi, Mr. Sanchez developed a method to replenish soil with nutrients from local rock phosphate and by planting trees on cropland, helping the poorest farmers fertilize their soils naturally without using expensive chemical fertilizers that can cause environmental damage.</p>
        <p>The practice has helped to eliminate slash-and-burn agriculture, expanded the forests of Africa and increased food production for many African farmers by as much as 400 percent.</p>
        <p>A professor emeritus of soil science and forestry at North Carolina State University, Mr. Sanchez is the author or editor of books in English, Spanish and Portuguese on tropical soil and forestry.</p>
        <p>He is a fellow of the American Society of Agronomy and is chairman of the Soil Fertility and Plant Nutrition Commission of the International Soil Science Society.</p>
        <p>The World Food Prize was established in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, the Nobel Peace laureate in 1970 for his work in world agriculture, and honors contributions to improving the world's food supply.</p>
