        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman (column, April 17) quotes President Clinton as saying to President Jiang Zemin of China: "The greatest threat to our security that you present is that all of your people will want to get rich in exactly the same way we got rich. And unless we try to triple the automobile mileage and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, if you all get rich in that way we won't be breathing  very well."</p>
        <p>Exactly, except that tripling the gasoline mileage is a misleading goal. The  Government's corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) mileage standards have been in force for 20 years; their effect has been to increase vehicle miles traveled and to increase car numbers in excess of the rate of human population increase.</p>
        <p>Gasoline consumption has increased steadily since these standards were imposed because the standards have tended to reduce the cost of fuel.</p>
        <p>The United States has almost 40 percent of the world's automobiles and trucks. They consume 20 percent of the world's oil supply and produce a disproportionate share of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>There is much that should be done. Legislation should be sponsored to remove  driver's subsidies. Property and sales tax yields should be sequestered so that  they could be used only for the legitimate needs of local government -- not for  traffic signals, traffic officers, accidents, repair and maintenance of roads and highways. These costs should be paid by drivers.</p>
