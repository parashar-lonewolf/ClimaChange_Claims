        <p>DISCOVERIES of dinosaur and plant remains in near-polar latitudes are revolutionizing concepts of how dinosaurs lived toward the end of their reign, 65 million to 100 million years ago.</p>
        <p>The finds suggest that some dinosaurs, chiefly duckbilled hadrosaurs, lived in great herds, exploiting the rich flora that flourished in the constant daylight of polar summer. The fossils that have led to this new view have been found in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, the island of Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean, and the Soviet Union, as well as in Antarctica and southern Australia.</p>
        <p>The accumulating evidence shows that dinosaurs were not just sedentary, tropical creatures. Great numbers inhabited both polar regions, the evidence shows and may even have migrated hundreds of miles in spring and fall, an idea that has prompted lively debate among paleontologists.</p>
        <p>At the time dinosaurs thrived near the poles, conditions there were radically different from those today. The entire planet was warmer, especially in the polar regions, although it apparently began to cool toward the end of the dinosaur era. It also appears that northern Alaska, where some of the richest dinosaur finds are being made, may have been far closer to the North Pole than it or any other land is today, allowing for four months of constant daylight and phenomenal plant growth.</p>
        <p>The Alaskan fossils were first discovered in 1961 in bluffs along the Colville River, near where it empties into the Arctic Ocean. But they were not recognized as dinosaur remains until 1983. Since then more than 1,000 bones and teeth have been collected by groups under Dr. Roland Gangloff of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, Dr. William Clemens of the University of California at Berkeley, collectors from other universities, museums and the United States Geological Survey.</p>
        <p>Most specimens are noncrested hadrosaurs with duckbill-like mouths. The bone beds have also yielded Pachyrhinosaurus, a plant-eating horned dinosaur with a huge bone pad above the eyes, and hypsilophodontids, whose long legs were obviously built for high speed, and teeth or other fragments of two carnivores: a troodontid and a tyrannosaurid not comparable to the Tyrannosaurus Rex of lower latitudes, but still fierce.</p>
        <p>Dr. Judith Parrish of the University of Arizona, who has studied plant remains from the Alaskan deposits, has found an "unbelievably rich" fossil flora. "The productivity was just astonishing," she said in a telephone interview. No place on earth today has comparable vegetation.</p>
        <p>Many of the plants were vinelike cycads that grew rapidly and carpeted the landscape, she said. In the continuous daylight of summer, the grazers were able to browse on them 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>There may have been some conifers, but most, if not all the plants shed their leaves and needles in the fall. This left a largely barren landscape in the four months of continuous darkness at that latitude. Tree rings in fossil wood from that period show that they were apparently leafless and dormant in winter.</p>
        <p>Like many other paleontologists who have studied the deposits, Dr. Parrish thinks it likely that the dinosaurs left the area during the long winter night. But she said the possibility that they could "grit it out" could not be ruled out.</p>
        <p>For example, Dr. Clemens said very small dinosaur teeth had been found in northern Alaska. They could have come from a very small dinosaur. But if they came from dinosaur babies, the finds suggest their parents lived year-round in the far north and bore their young there, he said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>No nests or eggs have yet been found, but it is not certain whether duckbills were egg layers, Dr. Clemens said. It is generally agreed that even in the winter night temperatures never went far below freezing and he suggested that dinosaurs endured the lack of food by greatly reduced energy consumption, the way bears endure the winter today.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Robert T. Bakker of the University of Colorado Museum in Boulder said the fossil bones did not show evidence of an annual no-growth period seen in the skeletons of present-day animals that become inactive each winter. In terms of annual growth, he said, the duckbill skeletons are typical of migratory animals like caribou and wildebeests.  Debate on Migration Theory</p>
        <p>Dr. Philip Currie of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Drumheller, Alberta, which has a major dinosaur collection, said he was "very strongly" in favor of the migration theory. The crowded fossil remains in some Alberta deposits suggest big herds, communal behavior and migration, he said.</p>
        <p>He said the discovery of closely related dinosaur species as far apart as Asia and North America indicated that they were highly mobile. Dr. Clemens agreed that evidence suggested the dinosaurs lived in herds but said that did not necessarily mean migration.</p>
        <p>Among the most recent discoveries are finds in Scoresby Sound, Greenland, made by Farish Jenkins of Harvard University, and on or near James Ross Island, off the Antarctic Peninsula, reported by Argentine and British researchers. Dinosaur footprints have been found on Spitsbergen in the Arctic Ocean, but in deposits formed when that land was attached to continents farther south.</p>
        <p>Remains of a hadrosaur, a member of the duckbill family, have also been found in Bylot Island, north of Baffin Land in the Canadian Arctic and today even farther north than Alaska. In describing the finds, Dr. Dale Russell of the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa said he was firmly on the side of migration. The alignment of the continent was "just built for north-south migration," he said.</p>
        <p>Excavations by Dr. Thomas Rich and Dr. Patricia Rich of Victoria University and Monash Museum in Melbourne, Australia, have found dinosaur fossils they believe lived in the Early Cretaceous Period, 95 million to 110 million years ago. Reached by telephone, Dr. Thomas Rich said Australia was attached to Antarctica in that period and might have been as far south as 85 degrees latitude, now deep within Antarctica.</p>
        <p>He said he doubted that these dinosaurs, creatures that ranged in size from that of a chicken to a small person, migrated, in part because their path to warmer areas would have been blocked by an inland sea over what is now the Australian interior. Further, he said, the skull suggests that the brain area dealing with vision was particularly large, as though adapted to seeing in the dark.</p>
        <p>At a recent conference in the Soviet Union, scientists there reported finding dinosaur remains in north-central Siberia, well inside the Arctic Circle. Discoveries have also been made in northwest China.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gangloff, noting that the evidence was not conclusive, said he believed the best explanation for such high-latitude finds was the migratory theory.</p>
        <p>Sea levels were very high in the Cretaceous Period and a seaway is thought to have split North America from north to south. The peaceful duckbills and those that preyed on them lived near the shores of rivers and waterways. They appear to have been good swimmers.  Range of Migration</p>
        <p>Dr. Currie said the three-toed feet of the duckbills were so heavily padded that they resembled elephants' feet. While the dinosaurs may have migrated as far as 1,200 miles, the range for most was 500 to 700 miles, he added.</p>
        <p>Dr. Martin Lockley of the University of Colorado in Denver has found several "dinosaur freeways" extending hundreds of miles.</p>
        <p>In each case, the footprints of large numbers of dinosaurs have been found in the same formation. One "megatrack" extends from Boulder, Colo., south to northern New Mexico, formed by iguanodontids, ancestors of the duckbills. The footprints, however, did not prove migration, Dr. Lockley said.</p>
        <p>Collecting along the Colville River has so far only revealed "the tip of the iceberg," Dr. Gangloff said during a recent interview in his laboratory. Nevertheless, in view of what has been found so far, he said, one can no longer think of dinosaurs as sedentary dwellers of the tropics.</p>
