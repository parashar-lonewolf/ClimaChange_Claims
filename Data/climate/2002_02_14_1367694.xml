        <p>Bush and Pakistani Leader Meet  President Pervez Musharraf, whom the United States treated as an outcast after he seized power in a coup two years ago, was welcomed to the White House by President Bush as a ''leader of great courage and vision'' who would continue to receive economic and military aid for his help in the war on terrorism.</p>

        <p>Bipartisan Coalition Holds In Campaign Finance Votes  Advocates of new limits on money in politics won a series of critical votes, putting the House near approval of the most comprehensive changes in decades in the way political campaigns are financed.

        <p>Kickback Demand Alleged  A lawyer who worked for Representative James A. Traficant Jr., left, testified at the Democratic congressman's racketeering trial that Mr. Traficant had required the lawyer to kick back half of his $60,000 salary as a condition of employment.</p>

He also proposed raising the cigarette tax by $1.42 a pack and borrowing $1.5 billion to close the gap.</p>

        <p>Accounting Changes Proposed  Regulators, legislators and the chief accounting rulemaker proposed changes in the way companies do business and report finances, including closing the loophole that Enron used to hide hundreds of millions of dollars of debt and inflate profits.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron executive who warned that the company's accounting practices could bring it down, is expected to tell Congress today that Enron's questionable handling of partnership deals was widely known within the company.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Investment bankers at big Wall Street firms helped create and find investors for the complex partnerships Enron used to mask its financial condition. Then they started helping other companies in the same way.</p>
