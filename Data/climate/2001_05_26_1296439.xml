        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts liberal whom Republicans love to vilify, is planning a swift vote on increasing the minimum wage. Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico wants to limit plans for more oil drilling in Alaska and instead encourage conservation. And Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut has his eye on President Bush's plans to relax rules on arsenic in drinking water, forest roads and mining sludge.</p>
        <p>Although they are working on short notice -- Democrats learned just Thursday they will take control of the Senate for the first time since 1995 -- the men who are expected to lead the Senate's 15 committees are already busy shaping the year ahead.</p>
        <p>With Democrats in charge, many of them liberals, President Bush can expect new emphasis on election reform by Senator Christopher J. Dodd  of Connecticut, who has called it an early priority. Judicial nominees face a gantlet of skeptics on the Judiciary Committee, who fear many of Mr. Bush's picks are too conservative and who are still stinging from Republican inaction on President Bill Clinton's selections.</p>
        <p>Just today, Representative Christopher Cox, a conservative Republican of California asked President Bush not to nominate him for a federal judgeship, saying it was now unlikely that he could win confirmation without a long battle.</p>
        <p>Also today, Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is expected to take over the Armed Services Committee, criticized President Bush's missile defense program, saying it could do more harm than good. But on the other hand Mr. Levin is likely to be more open than Republican leaders to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's ideas about reshaping the military.</p>
        <p>And, while appropriators all share a great love for doling out money, with Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia in charge of the Appropriations Committee, the White House will face considerable pressure to increase spending. Mr. Byrd, it is said, never saw a piece of pork he did not like.</p>
        <p>Assuming Senator James M. Jeffords, who announced this week that he was leaving the Republican Party, votes with the Democrats on most issues, they will hold only a 51-to-49 majority. So ramming through an agenda is nearly impossible, especially considering the 60 votes required to end a filibuster. Nevertheless, chairmen, with their power to hold hearings, shine the light on particular issues and block a rival's agenda, hold an extraordinary amount of power. The Democratic chairmen will now choose what agenda to talk about in committee, something that interferes considerably with the White House's game plan.</p>
        <p>''Democrats taking over the committees in the Senate is the equivalent of the Bolsheviks taking over from the czar during the Russian Revolution,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a conservative analyst for the Hudson Institute. ''It's less about legislation and more about the show, what is going to be highlighted front and center. What is going to be showcased. The president's agenda won't be showcased. It will be the Democratic agenda. And that is very important.''</p>
        <p>As painful as the transition will be for Republicans, corporate lobbyists and representatives of the health care, energy and pharmaceutical industries can also expect less congeniality from Democrats.</p>
        <p>Health care lobbyists have been fighting for years to block Mr. Kennedy's managed care legislation. That is likely to be the first bill to reach the floor, and Democrats are close to securing 60 votes to prevent a filibuster.</p>
        <p>''This is not great news for tobacco companies,'' said Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, ''or for broadcasters trying to expand their ownership, or for pharmaceutical companies. It is not a very good week for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who is expected to become head of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, has long been interested in consumer and environmental protections, something his chairmanship is likely to reflect. One of his first acts will be to follow up on a letter he sent a month ago to Andrew H. Card Jr., Mr. Bush's chief of staff, expressing concern about plans to alter certain regulations, including those governing standards on arsenic in drinking water, roads in national forests and the cleanup of mining waste.</p>
        <p>''They have been very slow in responding,'' Mr. Lieberman said, adding that he would possibly hold hearings on the issues. ''This is a classic example of what government affairs should be doing.''</p>
        <p>The committee also has some jurisdiction over energy, and Mr. Lieberman said he wanted to plunge ahead with an examination of high energy prices and what could be done to lower them.</p>
        <p>Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, is expected to take the helm of the Judiciary Committee, now headed by Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a position that will serve as a flash point for conservatives and liberals. Conservative nominees will face a difficult time before the committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy would like to see fewer nominees being dealt with at each hearing. An American Bar Association peer review report of potential judges would be available before hearings, not after. ''The federal judiciary should not lurch like a pendulum, too far to the left or too far to the right,'' he said. ''It should stay somewhere in the mainstream.''</p>
        <p>But, beyond the judiciary, Mr. Leahy also has his sights set on pushing his bipartisan bill to overhaul of the death penalty system. The bill seeks to ensure that defendants get competent representation and that convicted felons can submit DNA testing to prove their innocence.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Bush's priorities as president is building a national missile defense program, and in this quest he will face a formidable opponent in Mr. Levin as head of the Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin, who has criticized the missile defense shield, said on CNN today that Mr. Bush would be forced to rethink his approach. ''The real concern is that the reaction to a unilateral deployment of a missile defense in violation of a treaty would lead to a less secure world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The concern, Mr. Levin said, ''is that Russia and China will end up having more nuclear weapons, more nuclear material on their soil, that they wouldn't be willing to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, and therefore that the threat of nuclear weapons would grow.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levin has advocated a military overhaul, something that Mr. Rumsfeld is now pursuing and that Republican leaders, eager to protect military contracts in their home states, were not keen on supporting.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Kennedy at the helm of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, it is unlikely that much antiunion, antiworker legislation will fill the docket. Instead, Mr. Kennedy said he would turn his sight on securing more health insurance for the uninsured and the disabled.</p>
        <p>First, he must finish work on the bipartisan education bill the Senate is still debating, followed by the long-delayed bill on overhauling managed care.</p>
        <p>He said he was also interested in getting better treatment for stroke, heart and cancer patients, as well as reducing medical errors and making it less expensive to process health claims. He will also champion raising the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bingaman, the expected chairman of the Energy Committee, said he would back a bill to control electricity prices in California. A conservationist and an opponent of oil drilling in the Alaskan wildlife refuge, Mr. Bingaman said his energy agenda was at odds with Mr. Bush's recently announced energy plan, which emphasizes oil, coal and nuclear energy production.</p>
        <p>For one, Mr. Bingaman said he would keep a careful eye on global climate change. ''Anything we do in the energy area, we need to do with the recognition that it impacts on this global climate change issue,'' he said. ''If we're going to be committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, much of that would be implemented through energy policy.''</p>
        <p>On the Foreign Relations Committee, which Democratic aides say is likely to be led by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a new regime is likely to increase support for NATO and its involvement in the Balkans, as well as call for greater engagement with North Korea. Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, was known for his distaste for the United Nations and Cuba, which are unlikely to generate much hostility from Mr. Biden.</p>
        <p>But, the Democratic chairmen also say they do not want to overreach or overstate their power now that they are in control.</p>
        <p>''It's significant in that chairmen set the agenda and control the timing of the legislation moving to the floor,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who is expected to head the Budget Committee. ''But it can also be overstated. Ultimately, what matters in the Senate is who has got the votes, and there is is no shift in votes.''</p>
