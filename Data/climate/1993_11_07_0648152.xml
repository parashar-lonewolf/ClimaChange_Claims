        <p>LAURA S. SCHER graduated from Harvard Business School near the top of her class in 1985, smack in the middle of the Decade of Greed.</p>
        <p>Most of her classmates were seduced by the gaudy salaries and vainglorious life style of Wall Street. But not Ms. Scher, who was "put off by the idea of making so much money, by the insane hours, the New York life and the cultishness of it" and whose career goals included "wanting to do something I could believe in."</p>
        <p>So she took an unpopular path in those "Bonfire of the Vanities" days and signed on as chief executive of what was then a brand new San Francisco-based company, Working Assets Funding Service, whose mission was to do well by doing good.</p>
        <p>The company began by offering a donation-linked credit card, thought to be the first of many that followed, and then added a similar long-distance telephone service, which has recently vaulted Working Assets Funding Service and its 34-year-old chief to success.</p>
        <p>A spin-off of Working Assets Money Market Fund, although now a separate and thriving entity, Ms. Scher's company is based on the premise that generosity can be painless if it is linked to purchases people are already making and bills they regularly pay.</p>
        <p>Thus holders of Working Assets credit cards "donate" a nickel on each purchase to a group of charities, all eco-leftist in outlook, and customers of Working Assets long distance give away 1 percent of each monthly bill, and more than that if they elect to round up their payment to the nearest $5 or $10.</p>
        <p>The last two years have marked a breakthrough for Working Assets, which was recently named one of the 500 fastest-growing privately held companies in America by Inc. magazine. Revenue jumped from $2 million in 1991 to $15 million in 1992 and is expected to hit $35 million this year, the bulk of it from long distance, which has seen its subscriber list grow from 5,000 to 130,000.</p>
        <p>While these figures hardly put Working Assets in the ranks of telecommunications and banking mega-companies, they are impressive, and a credit to Ms. Scher's ability to translate a simple idea into a complex operation.</p>
        <p>"They have a clear mission, an effective game plan and have made more and more money," said Michael A. Levett, president of Businesses for Social Responsibility, a 15-month-old association of companies with similar interests. "They tapped in early to a growing movement to judge corporations by their reputation as well as their product. And there are a growing number of people -- enough to make real profits -- who are saying, 'This is the way we want to spend our money.' "</p>
        <p>The reason for Working Assets' recent growth spurt is three-fold, said Ms. Scher, who lives in suburban Tiburon with her husband, Ian Altman, an employee-benefits consultant, and their 3-year-old daughter, Alison. The first is sociological: the changed climate of this decade, when many baby boomers have turned from hectic have-it-all consumers to more sober let's-give-some-of-it-back members of the community.</p>
        <p>"We're doing well because of what the 90's are about," said Ms. Scher, seated in her office beneath a wall of posters from the charities that Working Assets supports -- including Planned Parenthood, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the Rainforest Action League and the Coalition of the Homeless.</p>
        <p>THE other two reasons for Working Assets' newfound success are technical and prompted by sea changes in telecommunications, which allowed Working Assets long distance to switch from being a sales agent for Sprint to being a reseller.</p>
        <p>In the first incarnation, from 1988 to late 1990, Working Assets got a tiny marketing fee, about equal to its 1 percent charitable donation. As a reseller, the company buys telephone time in bulk at a deep discount, sells it to its customers at competitive rates and pockets the difference. It also has a discount program similar to MCI's "family and friends" promotion that cuts 25 percent off the cost when one subscriber calls another.</p>
        <p>Also, as a reseller, Working Assets controls its own billing and has created a customized document that Ms. Scher said is her company's greatest innovation. "No one else thinks of the bill as a product," said Ms. Scher. "They think of the bill as a transaction. This is the crux of our whole operation, and this is where we have fun."</p>
        <p>The bill, produced and processed by EUR Data Center in Mechanicsburg, Pa., allows Working Assets long-distance customers to round up their bills, paying, say, $35 instead of the $32.56 owed. "It's like the penny jar next to the cash register," Ms. Scher said.</p>
        <p>Padding the payment this way is not possible with the Working Assets Visa or Mastercards, because they are issued and billed through the Fleet Bank of New York. The only customization with these bills, which carry a 15.4 percent interest rate, are the inserts, among them instructions on how to avoid abusing credit cards. "We'd rather they had the card for 10 years than go bankrupt in two," Ms. Scher said.</p>
        <p>The proceeds from the round-ups -- which are tax-deductible for customers -- of the telephone bills, an average of $50,000 a month, are usually added to the charitable pot, which is distributed at year's end to several dozen groups selected by a vote of Working Assets customers and winnowed down by the directors. Since its inception, Working Assets has donated $2.5 million, with $1 million of that raised last year.</p>
        <p>Some bill round-ups have focused on specific issues, like one last summer to buy and retire pollution credits. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, utilities that cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, below the federally mandated level can sell the remainder of their allowance. The Working Assets program bought $60,000 worth of credits and took them off the market. That worked out to 600,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, which Ms. Scher said was "a drop in the bucket" but perhaps "a catalyst for other people to do the same."</p>
        <p>The customized phone bill also allows Working Assets to promote timely causes and tell subscribers which corporate and political decision-makers to call or write to have their opinions heard. Those calls are free on the first Monday of each month and discounted the rest of the time.</p>
        <p>Leaders contacted this year, at the rate of 25,000 calls and letters a month, include the chief executive of McDonald's (supporting veggie burgers), the chairman of the Federal Reserve (opposing red-lining), the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (opposing toxic-waste incinerators near schools) and the Governor of California (opposing proposals to penalize immigrants).</p>
        <p>"Now we have a lobbying tool as opposed to just a fund-raising tool," Ms. Scher said.</p>
        <p>Working Assets Funding Service was the brainchild of Peter Barnes, one founder of the Working Assets money market fund. Mr. Barnes was marketing vice president for the fund, which was founded in 1983, when he decided that a product or service linked to charitable donations might be a more popular way for consumers to back what they believe in because people spend more than they save and because many people lack the $1,000 needed to open a money market fund.</p>
        <p>He hired Ms. Scher as chief executive of a fledgling company that would launch a donation-linked credit card and then figure out what other avenues to pursue. Then, in 1988, Working Assets Funding Service split from the parent company, eager to use its revenues to market its own products rather than the money market fund, which has about $250 million in assets. In 1991, the money fund was sold to Sophia Collier, founder of Soho Soda, who still uses the name under a licensing agreement with Ms. Scher's company.</p>
        <p>"It makes sense for them to be separate," said Mr. Levett. "Their socially responsible component is all that blends them. They're really no more alike than Bear, Stearns and the Baby Bells."</p>
        <p>BUT customers drawn to the company are not as a rule comparing prices. "People that would be joining aren't likely to be penny-pinchers," said Daniel Briere, president of TeleChoice, a New Jersey consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Working Assets understands exactly who its target customers are. According to a recent survey, more than a quarter are from California and 10 percent from New York, 98 percent vote (most of them for Democrats), 7 of 10 are college-educated (more than a third have graduate degrees), and more of them listen to National Public Radio than watch television.</p>
        <p>And the marketing strategy preaches to that choir. Working Assets long distance, for instance, bills itself as the only telephone company that is endorsed by Ralph Nader and Gloria Steinem, the only one to offer a free pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream to new subscribers, the only one to print its bills on 100 percent post-consumer recycled paper with soy-based ink, the only one to plant 17 trees for each ton of paper used. And the only one with a woman as chief executive.</p>
        <p>MS. SCHER, a native of Clifton, N.J., comes to the task naturally, in terms of both business and politics.</p>
        <p>Her father owned a small chemical company that is now, after his death, run by her older brother, who says he would rather be rock climbing or cross-country skiing. Her mother is a professor of economics at Montclair State College in New Jersey and a former head of the economics department.</p>
        <p>Ms. Scher describes her family, including a younger sister who is a family doctor in the rural reaches of Northern California, as "liberal and concerned" and recalls a childhood of licking stamps for local candidates and celebrating Earth Day on the banks of the Passaic River.</p>
        <p>To the extent that she had an epiphany about her own career, Ms. Scher said, it came during recruiting season at Harvard Business School, when the best and brightest at the Wall Street firms came courting the star students.</p>
        <p>"I would go to all these dinners with people who told me how much money they made," she said. "It didn't excite me at all."</p>
        <p>Ms. Scher will not disclose her pay at Working Assets, a privately held 45-member company. In general, she said, lower-ranked employees make competitive wages while those at the upper echelons pay dearly for their career choice.</p>
        <p>"What I earn is lower -- much, much lower -- than anyone at a comparable-sized company," she said. "But there's a lot of job satisfaction other than salary."</p>
