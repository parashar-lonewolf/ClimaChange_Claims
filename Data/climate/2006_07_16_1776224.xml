        <p>If Marilyn Monroe were alive, she'd be 80. And photographers might still be hounding the poor woman. Hundreds and hundreds of photographs are the subjects of ''MARILYN MONROE: STILL LIFE,'' an ''American Masters'' special on PBS (Wednesday, check local listings). Some are reassuringly familiar, some are rarely seen, and a lot are breathtaking. New York plays a major role. Those famous billowing-white-dress shots for ''The Seven Year Itch,'' for instance, were taken on a subway grate at Lexington and 52nd, an intersection that looked very different in 1955. One photographer shows what he says are the only pictures taken when Monroe was pregnant, during her marriage to Arthur Miller. Notable admirers, including NORMAN MAILER, GLORIA STEINEM and HUGH HEFNER, wax poetic. Monroe speaks, too, in audio and video interviews. In one, she recalls growing up and beginning to be noticed by men. ''The world became friendly,'' she says. ''It opened up to me.''</p>
        <p>For those who haven't seen the Al Gore global-warming documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' -- or who just can't get enough of the bad news about the future of our planet -- TOM BROKAW covers a lot of the same territory in ''GLOBAL WARMING: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW'' (Discovery Channel, Sunday at 9 p.m.). The two-hour special starts out by showing what Manhattan skyscrapers and high-rises will look like sitting in 80 feet of water.</p>
        <p>''FABULOUS! THE STORY OF QUEER CINEMA'' (IFC, Sunday at 10 p.m.) is a serious history of gay characters and themes on film. Subjects include the political power of drag; movies with lesbian scenes made to titillate heterosexual men; the impact of the video store; and late-20th-century titles like ''Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,'' starring Sean Hayes before he was famous for ''Will &amp; Grace''; ''The Living End,'' a drama about two H.I.V.-positive men; and Gus Van Sant's early feature ''Mala Noche.''</p>
