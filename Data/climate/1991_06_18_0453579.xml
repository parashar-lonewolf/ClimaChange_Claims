        <p>Methane gas in the atmosphere, a contributor to global warming, is building up more slowly than it was nine years ago, scientists from the University of California at Irvine say.</p>
        <p>From 1978 to 1982, atmospheric methane was increasing at a rate of 18 parts per billion a year, but the increase has slowed to slightly less than 1 percent a year at 12 to 13 parts per billion, the scientists said. They estimate that methane concentrations in the atmosphere are now 1.72 parts per million, which is 14 percent higher than measurements taken in January 1978.</p>

        <p>Methane gas in the atmosphere, a contributor to global warming, is building up more slowly than it was nine years ago, scientists from the University of California at Irvine say.</p>
        <p>From 1978 to 1982, atmospheric methane was increasing at a rate of 18 parts per billion a year, but the increase has slowed to slightly less than 1 percent a year at 12 to 13 parts per billion, the scientists said. They estimate that methane concentrations in the atmosphere are now 1.72 parts per million, which is 14 percent higher than measurements taken in January 1978.</p>
        <p>"Methane is still going up, but the rate has been decreasing," said Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland, a chemistry professor who led the research. He announced the findings in May at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rowland said the findings were good news for people concerned about global warming. Scientists estimate that atmospheric methane is responsible for 25 percent of global warming caused by gases in the atmosphere that trap the sun's heat. Chlorofluorocarbons are responsible for about 25 percent, and carbon dioxide for most of the rest.</p>
        <p>But unlike chlorofluorocarbons, which have a lifetime of 100 years in the atmosphere, or carbon dioxide, which continues to increase in the atmosphere as a result of deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, methane is removed from the atmosphere naturally after about 12 years, he said.</p>
        <p>"Cutting methane's increase down to zero is the best hope for reducing global warming," Dr. Rowland said.</p>
        <p>Since January 1978 Dr. Rowland's team of scientists have been taking measurements of atmospheric gases from Alaska to New Zealand about every three months. But, he said, explaining the change in methane's accumulation is difficult. Scientists are unsure if less is being released into the atmosphere or if more is being removed from the atmosphere, he said. Most methane originates from biological sources like cattle, swamps and rice paddies, he said.</p>
