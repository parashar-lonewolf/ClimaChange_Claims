        <p>All slimmed down after his illness, Boris Yeltsin told President Clinton that his suits were now too big. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's giant van was too big for the driveway at dinner on Friday.  Everyone at the summit meeting of the heads of major industrial nations thought the agenda was, well, too big.</p>
        <p>But biggest of all was what participants took to be the egotism of Mr. Clinton and his aides, who arrived declaring that the United States had the answer to the world's economic problems. Europeans and Japanese were irritated by this pre-summit propaganda, and Mr. Clinton had to tell aides to ''cool it,'' one said later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton himself became the soul of accommodation. ''You know, the French have a lot of things that we Americans admire,'' he told reporters at a meeting with President Jacques Chirac. He mentioned not wine or cheese but France's ''wonderful network of child care.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac's revenge for the Americans' economic boasting came on the last day of the meeting. Though chastened by his defeat in the recent elections, he peered imperiously at Mr. Clinton and assailed the American record on curbing the carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. The average Frenchman, he declared starchily, produces one-third the emissions of the average American.</p>
        <p>Behind the high-toned officialese of summit declarations, the personal chemistry at these sessions is often glimpsed through such exchanges. The summit participants are, after all, merely a collection of politicians with one-upmanship in their blood. Equally powerful is their need to perform for home audiences.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin and his aides, for example, ceaselessly reminded listeners that in Denver, Russia was more integrated into the proceedings than ever. Since the economic crises of the 1970's, when these meetings began, the participants had been confined to the United States, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Canada. Mr. Yeltsin, of the big suit, kept referring to this summit as ''The Big Eight.'' He dismissed the one-hour session of the original seven, from which he was excluded, as a minor sideshow, even though that meeting forged new mechanisms to avoid future financial collapses like the one in Mexico a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan insisted that the original Big Seven countries meet at least part of the time by themselves. His motive was more than economic, since the Japanese still resent Moscow's refusal to hand over a group of islands off Japan's northern coast seized at the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>If the newly elected and boyish-looking British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, had an image problem at home, it was symbolized by his being the only summit participant to be given a small chair at the conference table on the first day. You obviously cannot meet with the Big Eight without a big chair, and embarrassed officials rushed one to him forthwith.</p>
        <p>In the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, the setting prompted a Zen-like exchange that showed the deftness of Mr. Hashimoto and Chancellor Kohl. The German leader, an advocate of saving the world's forests, was chiding Japan about the dismal record of Japanese timber companies in destroying the rain forests of Brazil and Asia. Like something out of a Beckett play, it went like this:</p>
        <p>Mr. Hashimoto: As you know, I like to climb mountains.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl: Then you must like forests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hashimoto: There are many mountains without forests. There are ice mountains, and there are rock mountains.</p>
        <p>In such big and little ways, national honor was defended in Denver.</p>
