        <p>With the latest bad news about the thinning of the ozone layer and the increased threat of skin cancer, everyone should at least think about using a sunscreen every day. No one needs it more than those who work or play in the sun.</p>
        <p>Athletes in particular have typically been frustrated in efforts to protect their skin. The more they perspire, the more their sunscreens wash into the eyes, causing stinging and irritation.</p>
        <p>Now there are two new products formulated to stay where they are applied and resist washing away. Coppertone Sport, made by Schering-Plough Healthcare Products , bonds to the skin on contact, the company says, making it waterproof and resistant to sweat so that it won't run into the eyes.</p>
        <p>Because it leaves no greasy film on the hands, it won't interfere with a tight grip on a golf club or tennis racquet. It is free of PABA, a sunscreen ingredient to which a small percentage of the population is sensitive. It is available in a four-ounce plastic container in S.P.F. 4, priced at $5.99, or S.P.F. 15, for $7.99</p>
        <p>Bain de Soleil Sport Lotion by Richardson-Vicks is a fragrance-free PABA lotion that promises to maintain effectiveness for six hours even in the water. It absorbs instantly, contains no oil, and will not run into the eyes even with excessive perspiration, the company says. It comes in a six-ounce container of S.P.F. 8 for $7.50, or S.P.F. 15 for $7.75.</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 16, 1991, Tuesday</p>
        <p>An article on the Consumer's World page on Saturday about sunscreens described Procter &amp; Gamble's Bain de Soleil Sport Lotion incorrectly. It is a PABA-free lotion, not a PABA lotion.</p>
