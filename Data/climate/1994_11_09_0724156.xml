        <p>The World Bank today approved its first loan to Russia aimed at cleaning up some of the country's contaminated rivers, polluted industrial sites and toxic waste dumps, and said it was the first step in a broad program to undo seven decades of environmental mismanagement.</p>
        <p>By international standards the loan is small, about $110 million. But bank officials, who have been heavily criticized for financing huge infrastructure projects in the developing world with little regard for their environmental effects, insisted today that the loan symbolized a change of direction that took place several years ago in the bank's lending, and is being speeded.</p>
        <p>The loan, combined with $45 million in investments from newly privatized businesses in Russia and $90 million in donations from the United States, the European Union and other other nations, would soon be felt in some of Russia's most fouled urban areas.</p>
        <p>"This is an important first step that focuses on a few areas where the need is critical," said Roger Batstone, the bank's principal environmental engineer for the project. "This is the first installment of a large program of environmental lending for the Russian Federation."</p>
        <p>Russia's environmental problems are tied directly to decades of central planning that ignored environmental concerns in the failed effort to increase the country's industrial output. Underpriced energy, economists say, only worsened the problem, as economically inefficient factories spewed enormous amounts of untreated exhausts and chemical wastes into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The bank said today that 43 Russian cities were in urgent need of relief from air pollution, and that Russian industry discharged more sodium dioxide, the substance that causes acid rain, than all the factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France combined. Deforestation is widespread, largely because so many trees are still harvested for firewood, and fish harvests are declining because of pollution and the diversion of water for irrigation.</p>
        <p>The World Bank program will focus on three regions: the Upper Volga, the North Caucasus and the Urals. "These are areas where there is some local commitment to cleaning things up," Mr. Batstone said, "so we believe they are good test areas."</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, nearly half the project funds will be spent outside of Russia, for foreign environmental cleanup equipment and foreign consultants. The first step will be to establish a database of environmental hazards, and to develop plans for water-quality management in several regions.</p>
        <p>The bank's president, Lewis Preston, is traveling in Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan this week to discuss their transition to market economies. Mr. Preston has been arguing in recent months that the bank's critics have overblown its past lack of interest in environmental issues, noting that in the last four years it has spent $2.7 billion for environmental projects. Nearly half that figure, however, was spent last year. The bank issues about $17 billion in loans each year.</p>
