        <p>Use of Carbon Fuels Falls, Despite Global Expansion  Even as an expanding population and economic growth increase atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide that scientists say are warming the planet, the world is moving away from the carbon-rich fuels that produce the gas. The question now, experts say, is whether the trend can be accelerated enough to stave off global warming.</p>

        <p>Witchcraft on the Rise  Encouraged by Federal court rulings, an increasing number of books on the subject and the continuing concern for the environment, witchcraft has been growing in the United States and abroad.</p>

        <p>Census Fight Is Put on Hold  After three years of wrangling over the 2000 census, Republicans and Democrats have halted their fight over the use of a method called statistical sampling.</p>

        <p>Gore's Friends, the Lobbyists  Vice President Al Gore's closest confidants -- the lobbyists Tom Downey, Peter Knight and Roy Neel -- have continued to play central roles in his 2000 Presidential campaign, even while they have continued to aggressively lobby members of the Administration and, in some cases, Mr. Gore himself, on behalf of their corporate clients.</p>

        <p>Biggest Donors Stood to Gain From Brooklyn Art Exhibit  The ''Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art has been financed by companies and individuals with a direct commercial interest in the works of the young British artists in the show, according to court documents and interviews with people involved in the exhibition. The museum raised money from those who stood to profit, a practice other museum executives say is almost unheard of and ethically problematic.</p>

        <p>A Real Contest, for Once  Off-year elections are usually uneventful in Nassau County, the kind of perfunctory exercises that bring few people to the polls.

After apprenticing in Europe, he spent years crafting iron bars into artistic shapes that adorn buildings throughout the United States. Late in life, he taught his techniques to young smiths.</p>
