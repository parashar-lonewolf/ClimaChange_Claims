        <p>The reduction of fresh air in airline cabins since the mid-1980's brought complaints from passengers and airline crews who said that poor ventilation exposed them to viruses, bacteria and other contaminants, resulting in headaches, nausea, influenza and other health problems, especially after long flights.</p>
        <p>Now a study commissioned by the airline industry has found no harmful effects from the reduction, from 100 percent fresh air pumped in every three minutes, to half fresh air and half recirculated air every six or seven minutes. The study found that the air quality in airline cabins exceeded Federal standards for office and factory workers.</p>

        <p>The reduction of fresh air in airline cabins since the mid-1980's brought complaints from passengers and airline crews who said that poor ventilation exposed them to viruses, bacteria and other contaminants, resulting in headaches, nausea, influenza and other health problems, especially after long flights.</p>
        <p>Now a study commissioned by the airline industry has found no harmful effects from the reduction, from 100 percent fresh air pumped in every three minutes, to half fresh air and half recirculated air every six or seven minutes. The study found that the air quality in airline cabins exceeded Federal standards for office and factory workers.</p>
        <p>"Both older aircraft, with an all-fresh air system, and newer aircraft that have a combination of fresh and recirculated air, meet or exceed standards that are designed to insure a healthy environment," said Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines and paid for the study.</p>
        <p>But the study is unlikely to put the matter to rest. A flight attendants' group said that Federal air quality standards for offices and factories should not be used to judge the more crowded confines of fully loaded airplanes. And Aaron Sussell, an industrial hygienist with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, said Federal standards for the workplace were less stringent than those that protected the general public, and noted that passengers included infants, the elderly, sick and those with disabilities.</p>
        <p>A case in point: The study found carbon dioxide levels as high as 1,395 parts per million, well below the Federal workplace maximum of 5,000 but above the 1,000 parts per million set for the general public by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers.
