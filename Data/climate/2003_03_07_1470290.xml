        <p>There may be no deal this week on bank secrecy and withholding taxes on foreign accounts in Europe after all.</p>
        <p>Last-minute differences between Switzerland and the European Union are threatening to disrupt a compromise reached in January among the union's 15 members and Switzerland, which is not a member, over the problem of tax evasion using foreign bank accounts.</p>
        <p>The compromise would allow Switzerland and three European Union members -- Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria -- to keep their bank secrecy laws at least for a time provided they imposed a withholding tax on foreign account holders' interest earnings. Other European Union members would begin exchanging information on accounts held by each country's citizens. The agreement was scheduled to be ratified on Friday by a council of union finance ministers.</p>
        <p>The current chairman of the council, Nikos Christodoulakis of Greece, met with the Swiss finance minister, Kaspar Villiger, and the union's commissioner for tax issues, Frits Bolkestein, for three hours in Brussels today without resolving questions raised by Switzerland over the agreement.</p>
        <p>Speaking shortly after the meeting this morning, Mr. Christodoulakis said there remained ''a few outstanding issues'' with Switzerland, but he declined to give details. Asked in an interview about the likelihood of concluding a savings tax law on Friday, he said, ''I'll do my best,'' adding that a regional agreement was ''closer than ever.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Villiger told reporters after this morning's meeting that ''all but one'' of the problems had been resolved. The remaining issue for the Swiss is company taxation. It wants to be able to apply other European Union laws that exempt companies from paying tax on dividends and royalties, and from double taxation on funds transferred between subsidiaries and headquarters.</p>
        <p>European Union diplomats said today that Spain, France and Italy might refuse to allow Switzerland to take advantage of those laws, fearing a loss of tax revenue.</p>
        <p>Other cracks are also appearing. Belgium appears to be having second thoughts about the savings tax agreement. One diplomat said Belgium might try to reopen negotiations on the law so that it could extend a tax break it offers to multinational companies that operate regional headquarters in Belgium.</p>
        <p>Italy is also threatening to block the adoption of the savings tax law in a move to win better terms for its truck drivers in a separate proposed law on energy taxes, which was also scheduled to be adopted Friday by the finance ministers, diplomats said.</p>
        <p>The European Union has been working on a new energy tax law since 1997, meaning to raise the minimum tax a member nation must assess on fuel by about 20 percent. The proposed law would also extend to electricity, coal and natural gas for the first time; it is intended to help the European Union meet targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Italy wants to delay the introduction of the higher excise duties on diesel fuel to help its struggling trucking industry, an Italian diplomat said, adding that there is no solution being offered ''that is acceptable to us'' on the proposed energy tax.</p>
        <p>''It is not impossible that the finance ministers fail to agree on both these tax issues,'' one diplomat said. In that case, there is a chance that the council would be reconvened on March 19 to try again to work out an agreement, in time for a meeting of the union's heads of state a few days later.</p>
        <p>''It always looks a bit silly leaving such worthy but routine issues for the heads of state to sort out'' themselves, the diplomat said.</p>
