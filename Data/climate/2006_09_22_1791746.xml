        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ASYLUM: THE STRANGE CASE OF MARY LINCOLN' This musical telling of the real-life tale of the former first lady and how her son had her committed to an asylum in 1875 has some structural problems and could use more exposition by June Bingham, the book writer, but some of Carmel Owen's songs are decent, and the saga has a pull to it (1:45). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'THE MAN HIMSELF' Ami Dayan stars in his own adaptation of Alan Drury's play about an average man's slide into religious fanaticism. An unsettling tale of everyday alienation and its potentially dangerous consequences (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting a series of fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'I  3/5sheart 4/5 KANT' Ken Urban's nimble, knowing one-act is about four women (a graduate student, a heroin addict, a depressive and a bombing victim), the men in their lives and the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily existence (1:10). Linhart Theater at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'intellectuals' Scott C. Sickles's comedy about a woman who decides to try lesbianism and how it affects her husband has lots of great lines, though the director, David Gautschy, and some of the actors aren't up to the pacing challenge. Ellen Dolan of ''As the World Turns'' is appealing in the lead, though (2:05). The Workshop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 695-4173. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'nami' Chad Beckim's well-acted but overheated drama is about two dysfunctional couples whose fates intersect tragically (2:00). Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Spectacles</p>
        <p>'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'FOGGY BOTTOM'  James Armstrong's comedy about a Washingtonian who seduces women by promising them green cards has a nice sense of the ridiculous, but sometimes the action is unbelievable, even by the standards of farce (2:00). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'FRINGE NYC ENCORES' Ten hits from the New York International Fringe Festival return for a second run at two theaters. Shows include ''Billy the Mime,'' ''Walmartopia,'' ''Broken Hands,'' ''Danny Boy,'' ''Open House'' and others. The 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village; Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>

        <p>'AMERICAN HARDCORE' (R, 98 minutes) The documentary history of the American hardcore punk rock movement that flourished as an underground in the first half of the 1980's is as swift and jagged as the defiant music it remembers with an encyclopedic thoroughness. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'AURORA BOREALIS' (R, 110 minutes) Miserable in Minneapolis, a damaged slacker finds his life heating up when he connects with the nurse looking after his grandfather. Juliette Lewis stirs up this affable rubbish with a performance that hints that she can play more than sexpots and psychopaths. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, this film is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'CONFETTI' (R, 94 minutes) In this mildly amusing mock documentary, three engaged couples compete in a British bridal magazine's contest for most original wedding concept. ''Best in Show,'' the movie's obvious inspiration, it's not. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'AL FRANKEN: GOD SPOKE' (No rating, 90 minutes) This portrait of the comedian turned liberal polemicist is interesting as a case study in ideological celebrity, but not illuminating enough to be of interest to anyone but Mr. Franken's die-hard loyalists. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'HAVEN' (R, 98 minutes) Class, race and preposterous narrative contrivance mix it up in the Cayman Islands in this nonlinear nonsense from the producer of ''Crash.'' (Lee)</p>
        <p>'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'HOME' (No rating, 78 minutes) In Jeffrey M. Togman's marvelously revealing documentary, Sheree Farmer, a single mother of six, is offered the opportunity to escape her gang-infested neighborhood in Newark. An affordable new home in a safe area awaits; but as the mortgage deadline approaches, and Ms. Farmer's troubles mount, the movie brilliantly illuminates the psychological damage inflicted by years of deprivation. When survival hinges on trusting no one but yourself, the kindness of strangers can seem too good to be true. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'KEEPING MUM' (R, 90 minutes) Maggie Smith stars as a homicidal housekeeper and a Mary Poppins type in this British black comedy. An old-fashioned movie, it exudes the comfy familiarity of a vintage episode of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ARTIE LANGE'S BEER LEAGUE' (R, 86 minutes) Mr. Lange, Howard Stern's radio sidekick, somehow manages to make beer-league softball seem no fun at all in this extremely lowbrow comedy. High point: a brief appearance by the guy who played the beloved and now dead Edgar on ''24.'' (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>* 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'MAN PUSH CART' (No rating, 87 minutes) The Sisyphean daily grind of a Pakistani immigrant who sells coffee, doughnuts and bagels from a cart in Midtown Manhattan is an exemplary work of independent filmmaking carried out on a shoestring. At its best, it suggests an American ''Bicycle Thief.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'MUTUAL APPRECIATION' (No rating, 110 minutes) Andrew Bujalski's wonderful independent film about friendship in the modern world looks like something that came out of a time capsule, but there's nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, it is the sort of unassuming discovery that could suffer from too much big love, and while it won't save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'OLD JOY' (No rating, 76 minutes) Two old friends drive out of Portland, Ore., one day and into a strained reunion in Kelly Reichardt's ''Old Joy,'' a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest American films of the year. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark epithet. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED' (No rating, 97 minutes) Kirby Dick, with the help of a private detective, investigates the mysterious workings of the Motion Picture Association of America, a highly secretive, deeply irrational organization with enormous influence over what we see -- and don't see -- on movie screens. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE U.S. vs JOHN LENNON' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Using archival clips -- including some great ''Dick Cavett Show'' appearances and in-bed news conferences -- and talking-head interviews with Noam Chomsky, G. Gordon Liddy and many people in between, this documentary makes the case that John Lennon was a much better person than Richard Nixon. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'VAJRA SKY OVER TIBET' (No rating, 89 minutes) Limited almost exclusively to tourist attractions, this documentary glimpse at the sights and sounds of occupied Tibet amounts to a rhetorically inflated vacation video -- but what a vacation! (Lee)</p>
        <p>'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS  (Through Monday) Film Forum's eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) ends Monday night with ''The Cameraman'' (1928), about a man trying to impress a pretty office worker at MGM, and ''Spite Marriage'' (1929), about a dry cleaner in love with a stage star. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>ÉCLATS DE RIRE  (Through Oct. 31) The French Institute Alliance Française is currently screening French comedy classics every Tuesday. This week's film is Francis Veber's odd-couple story ''La Chèvre'' (1981), starring Gérard Depardieu and Pierre Richard as a detective and a publicist on a kidnapping case. Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6160; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>MADE IN NY (Through Dec. 31) Tomorrow, just in time for autumn in New York, the Museum of Modern Art begins a three-month series of notable films made in the city. This weekend's five movies include Woody Allen's ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), whose Manhattan locations include Mia Farrow's Upper West Side apartment, and Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' (1989), set in a racially charged Brooklyn neighborhood. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>PYTHONALOT (Through Oct. 5) Film Forum's two-week Monty Python festival begins today with a weeklong run of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' (1975), the Arthurian lunacy that inspired the Broadway musical ''Spamalot.'' Other films in the series include the group's ''Life of Brian'' (1979), Terry Gilliam's ''Brazil'' (1985) and ''A Fish Called Wanda'' (1988), with Michael Palin and John Cleese. 209 West Houston Street, south of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

        <p>AGENT ORANGE, REAGAN YOUTH (Tomorrow) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the legendary Bowery dive that was the cradle of punk: after a protracted dispute with its landlord, the club must vacate by the end of October. Its last few months have been shaping up as a reunion of the mid-80's class of Hardcore High, which continues tomorrow with the Southern California skate-punk of Agent Orange and members of Reagan Youth, a New York ''anarchy peace punk'' band that, among other things, equated ''the sons of Reagan'' with Nazis. (Its leader, Dave Insurgent, died 13 years ago.) Also on the bill are Freeze, Slacktone and Apple. At 7 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $20. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOSEPH ARTHUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's haunting songs, which can float in a gorgeous but eerie acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. His fifth album, ''Nuclear Daydream,'' has just been released on his own label, Lonely Astronaut. With Annie Stela. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ASHFORD AND SIMPSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Steve and Eydie of pop-soul still put on a convincing and musically solid show of being the world's happiest show-business couple. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $60, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BOBBY (BLUE) BLAND (Tomorrow) Mr. Bland's voice is a cornerstone of Memphis soul singing. In tones that are velvety, humble and long-suffering, he begs for affection with suave melancholy and smoldering fury. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JUSTIN BOND AND THE FREUDIAN SLIPPERS (Tonight) Fresh from a run on Broadway, Justin Bond, the peerlessly raunchy cabaret satirist better known as the Kiki half of Kiki &amp; Herb, offers an account of his career, in music and video. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CIBELLE (Tonight and tomorrow) Cibelle, a young Brazilian who lives in London, follows sensuous melodies into slippery electronic dream realms. And when she interprets the classics, she does it with a free hand: her version of Caetano Veloso's expatriate lament ''London, London'' on her new album ''The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves'' (Six Degrees) seizes on the line about ''flying saucers in the sky,'' adding more than a minute of psychedelic, sci-fi sound effects. Tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. Tomorrow night at 10:30, with Barra Libre, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI (Thursday) Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the grassroots rock success story of 2005 -- this band from Brooklyn sold tens of thousands of CD's of jerky, Talking Heads-inspired art-pop without a record label -- adds another trophy to its case with a performance at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. At 5 p.m., midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171; $32.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ERIC CLAPTON (Thursday) This evergreen guitar hero, now 61, is touring with a repertory stretching back to his Derek and the Dominos era. Also on the bill is Robert Cray, the slick guitarist who was the great commercial hope of the blues in the 1980's. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $154.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DENGUE FEVER (Tonight) If you missed Cambodia's wildly eclectic psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's and early 70's (which came to a sudden end with the arrival of the Khmer Rouge), this adventurous Los Angeles band offers the next best thing. Featuring the forceful and entrancing vocals of Chhom Nimol -- a former Cambodian pop star who had been singing in a restaurant in Long Beach, Calif. -- it plays vintage hits and original songs in Khmer and English, toying with a listener's sense of exoticism and familiarity. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FLAMING LIPS (Sunday and Monday) The first sign that it will not be the usual rock concert: the place fills with oversize balloons. Next: dancers seemingly dressed as Hebrew prophets. And if another is necessary, the highlight of the night is a cathartic, audience-participation version of ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $40. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>HEM, FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) A night of songwriting versus atmosphere. Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, luscious arrangements that it doesn't matter. Mr. Johnston is a master miniaturist whose elegant, deadpan stories of the lovelorn and the cruel are set to generic and innocuous folk-pop. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $23.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JET (Wednesday) Determined to boil rock down to its AC/DC-meets-Guns-N'-Roses essence, this Australian band dismisses anything that distracts from that goal -- including innovation. With Diamond Nights. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tomorrow) A reggae band founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Club D'Elf and Haale. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, boweryballroom.com, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Kelefa Sanneh)</p>
        <p>* JACK JONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) In full command of his formidable vocal technique, Mr. Jones, at 68, is arguably the most accomplished singer still standing to work in a Sinatra-descended lounge style as demanding as it is easily parodied. At 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden)</p>
        <p>LOS LOBOS (Thursday) Los Lobos started out in Mexican music, went on to dig deeply into Americana, from blues to country to rhythm and blues to salsa, and then added some twists. Lately a new Latin percussionist has been revitalizing the band. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>MEGADETH, LAMB OF GOD, OPETH, ARCH ENEMY (Thursday) The vanguard of heavy metal, past and present. Megadeth's members were steely, cynical soothsayers at a time when the dominant style was poofy hair and power ballads, and they haven't changed a bit. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Opeth, from Sweden, adds intriguing depth to the usual histrionics of black metal with gentle acoustic parts and tough, growly sounds. Arch Enemy, with former members of Carcass, Carnage and Candlemass, reaches back to the glory days of guttural death metal. At 4:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $43. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK GYPSY FESTIVAL (Sunday) With a thriving rock scene in New York inspired by Gypsy and Eastern European music, a full festival that brings major Gypsy artists from overseas has been badly needed. Most of the action of this second annual series begins next Friday, but on Sunday night a preview offers two bands: Café Antarsia Ensemble, a New York four-piece that plays Greek and Balkan styles and features Ruth Margraff, a playwright and performance artist (7:30 p.m., $15); and Kal, from Serbia, which incorporates rap, Indian bhangra beats, tango and flamenco guitar (9:30 and 11:30 p.m., $22). (Through Oct. 8.) Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com or nygypsyfest.com. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRAD PAISLEY, CARRIE UNDERWOOD (Thursday) Knowing the value of terse composition and sly wordplay, Mr. Paisley scored one of country's biggest hits last year with ''Alcohol.'' A droll defense of grog from the drink's point of view (''I've been known to cause a few breakups/And I've been known to cause a few births''), it is one of the rare novelty songs that outlives its novelty. Ms. Underwood won the fourth season of ''American Idol'' and has sold more than three million copies of her country-pop album ''Some Hearts'' (Arista). At 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $25 to $53. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Monday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. With Dub Is a Weapon. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $42. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Tuesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite 70's rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's self-titled new album, on ATO Records, includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Natalie Walker. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROLLING STONES (Wednesday) It took a fall by Keith Richards from a palm tree in Fiji -- and his subsequent brain surgery -- to slow them down, and even then it was for only a few months. The Stones continue the world tour for ''A Bigger Bang'' (Virgin), their leanest and most acclaimed album in decades. At 8 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $62 to $452. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* REGINA SPEKTOR (Wednesday and Thursday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin. With Only Son. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme song from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Holden)</p>
        <p>SUNSET RUBDOWN (Sunday and Monday) A solo enterprise of the prolific Spencer Krug, who sings and plays keyboards in the Montreal indie-arty band Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown is one of those weirdly fascinating bedroom noise projects characterized by stompy lo-fi backing tracks and evocative stream-of-consciousness lyrics (''Shut up, I am dreaming of places where lovers have wings''). With Beaver. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YAT-KHA (Tuesday) Led by musicians from Tuva in southern Siberia, Yat-Kha features the sound of throat singing, the simultaneous production of guttural low notes and their eerily pure overtones. But its leader, Albert Kuvezin, started out playing in rock bands, and Yat-Kha puts some rock beats behind songs about steppes, reindeer, ancient conquerors and pretty girls. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>LES YEUX NOIRS (Thursday) This French band finds the common ground between Gypsy music and klezmer: modal dance tunes taken at breakneck speeds, from the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 and $26 in advance, $25 and $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>MICHEL CAMILO AND TOMATITO (Monday through Wednesday) Six years ago, the Dominican pianist Michel Camilo and the Spanish flamenco guitarist known as Tomatito released an ebullient and well-received album called ''Spain'' (Verve). They now have a sequel, fittingly titled ''Spain Again'' (Emarcy); they will reprise their collaboration in a club setting for three nights next week. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>* DIET COKE WOMEN IN JAZZ FESTIVAL (Tonight through Thursday) This monthlong festival of female jazz artists rolls on this weekend with the pianist and singer Eliane Elias, performing music from her recent album, ''Around the City'' (RCA Victor). On Monday and Tuesday the club features the pianist Patrice Rushen in a group with the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington; on Wednesday and Thursday the spotlight shifts to a pair of superb singers, Karrin Allyson and Nancy King, backed by the Bruce Barth Trio. (Through October 1.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

        <p>JACKSON MOORE DOUBLE TRIO (Tomorrow) The alto saxophonist and composer Jackson Moore is a musician of deep concentration, with an attraction to slippery rhythmic conceits.

        <p>* MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH PHAROAH SANDERS (Tonight through Sunday) The pianist McCoy Tyner and the tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders are indelibly associated with the 1960's output of John Coltrane, though each enjoyed a productive period as a solo artist in the 70's and beyond.

        <p>* WYNTON AND LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S HOT FIVES (Thursday) The recordings made by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five in Chicago in the 1920's are an ageless and inviolable achievement. So while the order of names in this concert title suggests some hubris on the part of Wynton Marsalis, he is indeed the person best suited to give the music a fresh airing. He'll be joined by colleagues like the clarinetist and saxophonist Victor Goines, the trombonists Wycliffe Gordon and Vincent Gardner, the banjoist Don Vappie and the pianist Jonathan Batiste.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of New York City Opera's best productions, and some fine young talents should make this run of it worth hearing. Shu-Ying Li, the Mimi, has shown a really striking soprano on past occasions; James Valenti, her Rodolfo, was a promising Met Council winner in 2002; Elizabeth Caballero, the Musetta, made a very good City Opera debut last season; and Daniel Mobbs, the Marcello, has been proving himself reliably at Caramoor and elsewhere for several years. George Manahan, the company's music director, conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'La GiocOnda' (Tuesday) Ponchielli's 1876 ''Gioconda'' can be seen as stuck on a crossroads of Italian opera history. On one level it is a grand opera in the manner of ''Aida.'' Yet in its conventional structure of arias and ensembles it harkens to days of Donizetti. It also anticipates the move toward realism, with its melodramatic story of the street singer Gioconda. The work used to be a staple of all opera houses. The Met is bringing it back for the first time in more than 15 years, with a glittering cast topped by the soprano Violeta Urmana as Gioconda and the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina as Laura. Bertrand de Billy conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'Idomeneo'  (Thursday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's solid old production of Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera with Ben Heppner singing the title role; Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's son Idamante; Dorothea Röschmann as Ilya; and Olga Makarina as Elettra. James Levine conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Monday) To open its season, the Met returns to Puccini's weepy masterpiece, with big guns firing. The new production is Anthony Minghella's. The company's music boss, James Levine, conducts. And Cristina Gallardo-Domâs, Marcello Giordani and Dwayne Croft take the principal roles. Unsurprisingly, the performance is sold out. At 6:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive and beloved, the sexagenarian Amato Opera proves that, in opera, tradition and devotion can prevail over quality. It's remarkable that all of Mozart's characters can fit on the theater's tiny stage. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'SEMELE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The New York City Opera's Handel series continues with a first-rate update evoking Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedys and the kind of sex and violence that Ovid's original gods and goddesses might have understood. Elizabeth Futral takes the title role. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* 'die tote stadt' (Sunday and Wednesday) Erich Wolfgang Korngold's renown as the composer of swashbuckling film scores for Hollywood hits of the 1930's like ''Captain Blood'' and ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' has understandably overwhelmed his early work as an early-20th-century German modernist. At least his 1920 opera ''Die Tote Stadt'' lingers at the margins of the repertory. The New York City Opera revives Frank Corsaro's production of this psychological mystery about a man obsessed with his saintly dead wife, Marie, and who is spooked when he chances upon a look-alike, a sultry temptress and actress named Marietta. Sunday at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>

        <p>JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its enterprising founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and either familiar works or lesser-known scores by well-known composers. This week the fare includes Heinrich Baermann's arrangement of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto for clarinet quintet; Beethoven's Piano Quartet in D (WoO 36, No. 2); a flute trio by Kuhlau; and a string octet by Raff. At 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259, jupitersymphony.com; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>S.E.M. Ensemble (Monday) The alluring Spiegeltent has been host to a parade of adventurous performers and music this summer as part of the Darmstadt Classics of the Avant-Garde series.

        <p>* FALL FOR DANCE (Thursday) Only in its third year but clearly the king of New York's late summer/early fall dance samplers, Fall for Dance is offering its regular 30 companies and 6 programs, but this year expands to 10 performances, with 4 of the programs repeated. Each program, from Thursday through Oct. 8, includes five wildly diverse and often famous companies in short dances that ideally build to a satisfying whole, aside from the excellence of any individual offering.

        <p>NOÉMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA II' (Tomorrow, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently, Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for 1,000 bodies.''

        <p>ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance, to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8, Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561, rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* SHEN WEI DANCE ARTS (Tuesday through Thursday) This Chinese-born, New York-based choreographer of visually arresting dance-art spectacles makes his Joyce Theater debut with a new piece, ''Re-,'' which evokes Tibetan spirituality, and his 2003 ''Rite of Spring,'' set to the four-hand piano version of Stravinsky's score. (Through Oct. 1.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>TAKE DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Takehiro Ueyama, who danced with the Paul Taylor Dance Company for eight years, presents the world premiere of ''ONE,'' a collaboration with the artist Paul Hunger that is based on Gregory Colbert's ''Ashes and Snow'' photography exhibit. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, takedanceny.com. General tickets, $25; students, $20; tickets including tonight's opening reception, $35. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>ELIZABETH WARD AND HEATHER VERGOTIS (Thursday) A semi-improvised collaboration, ''Love Cervere'' explores the myth of the love cervere, a pantherlike, sweet-breathed medieval mythological creature. With choreography by Ms. Ward, who has danced with downtown types like D D Dorvillier and Cathy Weis, and music by Ms. Vergotis, a saxophonist and composer. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15, but Queens residents pay what they wish. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Dec. 27. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,'  through March 5. Dia:Beacon has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Ms. Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>The Met: 'CÉzanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde,' through Jan. 7. The come-on title of this show turns out to be slightly misleading. The star is not any of the artists. It is a dealer, Ambroise Vollard, born in 1866, arrived in Paris in 1887 from the Île de la Réunion. The works in the show are eye candy, sure, but they also passed through Vollard's hands. Picasso bought a Matisse still life and a Renoir bather from Vollard. They're both here. So is Cézanne's ''Bathers,'' which Monet bought; and Cézanne's ''Battle of Love,'' which Renoir got. What's worth noting are less the landmarks than the byways: a Renoir portrait of Vollard dressed as a torero. And some Matisses, from before 1904, when Vollard organized a Matisse show, which tanked, document a genius whose imminent breakthrough Vollard missed. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN,' through Dec. 16. From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum. (Smith)</p>
        <p>National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam,' through Dec. 31. Mr. Suydam is remembered, if at all, as a 19th-century American Luminist painter whose reputation has all but sunk quietly into the New England salt meadows that he loved to paint. This exhibition has a few aims, one of which is a kind of art historical search and rescue operation. Mr. Suydam's early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were an extremely talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)</p>
        <p>NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Oct 9. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Nadine Robinson: Alles Grau,' 'Quid Pro Quo: Rashawn Griffin, Karyn Olivier and Clifford Owen: 2005-06 Artists-in-Residence,' and 'Beyond Sight,' through Oct. 22. The Studio Museum in Harlem is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon, with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile. And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of the 14 teenagers. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseuminharlem.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Queen Sofía Spanish Institute: 'Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Paintings, 1950-2005,' through next Friday. This institute has devoted its two galleries to a half-century survey of the Spanish painter Albert Ràfols-Casamada. Blocky, indistinct shapes floating in broad expanses of watery color are the rule, for Mr. Ràfols-Casamada is a devotee of a brand of soft-edge, gesture-oriented, color-loving abstraction that was very chic in the 1950's and 60's. If there is something original about Mr. Ràfols-Casamada's work, it is his feathery layering of paint. In 1963 he started making use of collage. His ambition is nothing much greater than this: eye-pleasing pictures suffused with harmony, rhythm and balanced color relations. 84 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 628-0420, queensofiaspanishinstitute.org.

        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,  through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the Chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&amp;M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through Oct. 7. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface (Smith). DC Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 247-2111, through Oct. 7. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. The best are full of strange squiggles and doodles that suggest the elements of an Yves Tanguy Surrealist landscape swept into a messy pile, like entrails. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* AXEL KASSEBÖHMER Not all German painters come from Leipzig. This New York debut and 15-year sampling introduces one whose work suggests the painting-as-paint strictures of Gerhard Richter (with whom he studied) filtered through the blunt land- and seascape abbreviations of artists like Emil Nolde and (to American eyes) Milton Avery. They convey a mystical yet flat-footed physicality, a penchant for sly references to the history of textiles and ceramics and an impressive range of causes and effects. Klemens Gasser &amp; Tanja Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-6594, gassergrunert.net, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'Street Poets &amp; Visionaries: Selections from the UbuWeb Collection' Poetic is the word for the text-based work that Kenneth Goldsmith has assembled for this group show. Printed copies of shaped poems by David Daniels, a West Coast artist now in his 70's, make up about half of what's here. Most of the rest is anonymous urban ''outsider'' material picked up over the years by Mr. Goldsmith from the street and digitally archived as the UbuWeb Collection (ubu.com). Over all, the content is idiosnyncratic, to say the very least: obessional, paranoic, splenetic, militant, millenarian and just plain psychically intense in a way that art in Chelsea rarely feels. Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Alison Elizabeth Taylor This artist's wood veneer inlay images dwell on the darker side of the suburban idyll. Sexual tension, waste, bigotry and violence underlie their luxurious-looking surfaces, along with a gnawing estrangement from nature: in this case, mostly the desert landscape around Las Vegas, where Ms. Taylor grew up. Couples and small groups of people embody fractured, ambiguous relationships in her carefully constructed marquetry ''paintings.'' James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Sept. 30. (Genocchio)</p>

        <p>'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. A vital part of the show is the section devoted to the body in motion. It reveals how the work of Eadweard Muybridge, the English-born, California-based photographer who did studies of humans and animals in movement, played an important role in the development of motion pictures. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast,and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 9. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* STUART HAWKINS: CUSTOMS The latest series of daffy photographs by this American artist working in Nepal rarely reflects well on Western tourists. Too stagy to be snapshots and too haphazard to be completely planned, they parlay familiar travel terms like ''Day Driver,'' ''Field Notes,'' ''Welcome Drink'' and ''Medicine Kit'' into bizarre sitcoms. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools, much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi.

(Johnson)  * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED' In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this season, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me' Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the avid, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Constantine Maroulis, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ASYLUM: THE STRANGE CASE OF MARY LINCOLN' This musical telling of the real-life tale of the former first lady and how her son had her committed to an asylum in 1875 has some structural problems and could use more exposition by June Bingham, the book writer, but some of Carmel Owen's songs are decent, and the saga has a pull to it (1:45). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel that wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING' Bill Bowers's zestful, endearing one-man show is about his life as a mime, an actor and a gay boy growing up in Montana (1:15). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, off Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'LEMKIN'S HOUSE' The man who invented the word genocide, Raphael Lemkin, turns out to have an unsettled afterlife in this compelling drama by Catherine Filloux. He learns, through visitations by Tutsis and others, that the international law he campaigned for against genocide may not have accomplished anything. John Daggett is impressive as Lemkin (1:20). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'THE MAN HIMSELF' Ami Dayan stars in his own adaptation of Alan Drury's play about an average man's slide into religious fanaticism. An unsettling tale of everyday alienation and its potentially dangerous consequences (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'RICHARD II' Michael Cumpsty plays the ineffectual king who loses a crown and gains a soul in Brian Kulick's middling production for the Classic Stage Company. Mr. Cumpsty traces Richard's worldly downfall and spiritual ascent with affecting clarity, but the production is a little glib and a little bland (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'SEVEN GUITARS' (2:45). Life and death dance cheek to cheek in this fine new revival of August Wilson's drama from 1996. Directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and acted with absorbing restraint and immediacy, this is a truly life-size production, which means it is big indeed (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'THEOPHILUS NORTH' Matthew Burnett's adaptation of the Thornton Wilder novel about a young man's not quite interpersonal relationships in 1926 Newport is affable if sometimes oversentimental (2:00). Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE TREATMENT' A new play by Eve Ensler (''The Vagina Monologues'') depicting a series of fraught encounters between a traumatized war veteran and a military psychologist. Fervently acted by Dylan McDermott and Portia, it is an overwrought amalgam of psychodrama and political sermonizing (1:05). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983, impactfestival.org. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'I  3/5sheart 4/5 KANT' Ken Urban's nimble, knowing one-act is about four women (a graduate student, a heroin addict, a depressive and a bombing victim), the men in their lives and the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily existence (1:10). Linhart Theater at 440 Studios, 440 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'intellectuals' Scott C. Sickles's comedy about a woman who decides to try lesbianism and how it affects her husband has lots of great lines, though the director, David Gautschy, and some of the actors aren't up to the pacing challenge. Ellen Dolan of ''As the World Turns'' is appealing in the lead, though (2:05). The Workshop Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 695-4173. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'nami' Chad Beckim's well-acted but overheated drama is about two dysfunctional couples whose fates intersect tragically (2:00). Kirk Theater, Theater Row Studios, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Spectacles</p>
        <p>'ABSINTHE' Think Cirque du Soleil as channeled through ''Rocky Horror'' and painted by George Grosz. Part cabaret, part circus, ''Absinthe'' aims for a kind of seedy decadence that's mingled with the simple, aw-shucks wonder of knife-jugglers, sword-swallowers and a man creating constructions out of soap bubbles. It's the main event at the Spiegeltent, a vintage European tradition visiting South Street Seaport this summer (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'REVEREND BILLY AND THE CHURCH OF STOP-SHOPPING' Reverend Billy (a k a the performance artist Bill Talen) struts and preaches his way across the Spiegeltent stage accompanied by a choir and a fine seven-piece band. Radical political theater has rarely been more thoughtful or fun (1:30). Spiegeltent, at the former Fulton Fish Market site, Pier 17, South Street, under the Brooklyn Bridge, (212) 279-4200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). 2005 New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin stir up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT'  A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'FOGGY BOTTOM'  James Armstrong's comedy about a Washingtonian who seduces women by promising them green cards has a nice sense of the ridiculous, but sometimes the action is unbelievable, even by the standards of farce (2:00). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'FRINGE NYC ENCORES' Ten hits from the New York International Fringe Festival return for a second run at two theaters. Shows include ''Billy the Mime,'' ''Walmartopia,'' ''Broken Hands,'' ''Danny Boy,'' ''Open House'' and others. The 14th Street Y, 344 East 14th Street, East Village; Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>

        <p>'AMERICAN HARDCORE' (R, 98 minutes) The documentary history of the American hardcore punk rock movement that flourished as an underground in the first half of the 1980's is as swift and jagged as the defiant music it remembers with an encyclopedic thoroughness. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'AURORA BOREALIS' (R, 110 minutes) Miserable in Minneapolis, a damaged slacker finds his life heating up when he connects with the nurse looking after his grandfather. Juliette Lewis stirs up this affable rubbish with a performance that hints that she can play more than sexpots and psychopaths. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE BLACK DAHLIA' (R, 119 minutes) Brian De Palma drains the life out of James Ellroy's take on the spectacularly cruel 1947 murder of a young Los Angeles woman known as the Black Dahlia. The stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Aaron Eckhart don't help matters, though Hilary Swank is dandy. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, this film is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'CONFETTI' (R, 94 minutes) In this mildly amusing mock documentary, three engaged couples compete in a British bridal magazine's contest for most original wedding concept. ''Best in Show,'' the movie's obvious inspiration, it's not. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE COVENANT' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The director Renny Harlin proves that ''Exorcist: The Beginning'' was not the nadir of his career with this thriller about boy witches fending off a nefarious transfer student. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'CRANK' (R, 83 minutes) A poisoned hit man rampages in Los Angeles, doling revenge on his nemesis and misanthropy on all. Basically a broken-down retread of ''Speed,'' with Jason Stratham as the bus. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'CROSSOVER' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Bling is bad, and friends are good in this story of temptation, rivalry and cheerleaders, set in the world of Detroit street basketball. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'EVERYONE'S HERO' (G, 88 minutes) Animated in name only, ''Everyone's Hero'' follows a 10-year-old baseball fanatic as he tries to return Babe Ruth's stolen bat. Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting, the movie is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. But since this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve, the movie's sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn't deserve. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'FACTOTUM' (R, 94 minutes) Matt Dillon goes deep to play Henry Chinaski, the familiar alter ego of the great Charles Bukowski, who survived countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing jobs. The Norwegian filmmaker Bent Hamer directed. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'AL FRANKEN: GOD SPOKE' (No rating, 90 minutes) This portrait of the comedian turned liberal polemicist is interesting as a case study in ideological celebrity, but not illuminating enough to be of interest to anyone but Mr. Franken's die-hard loyalists. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'GRIDIRON GANG' (PG-13, 120 minutes) Set in a California juvenile detention center, ''Gridiron Gang'' stars Dwayne Johnson, best known as the Rock, as Sean Porter, the real-life probation officer who fights recidivism with football. Jumping from heartwarming to murderous, this is a sports-as-rehab movie that wants to have its gangbanging and cure it, too. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'Half Nelson' (R, 107 minutes) In their beautiful bummer about the relationship between a white teacher (Ryan Gosling) and a black student (Shareeka Epps), the gifted young director Ryan Fleck and his writing partner, Anna Boden, offer a lament for the radical fires of the 1960's and a suggestion for life and politics after the new left. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'HAVEN' (R, 98 minutes) Class, race and preposterous narrative contrivance mix it up in the Cayman Islands in this nonlinear nonsense from the producer of ''Crash.'' (Lee)</p>
        <p>'HOLLYWOODLAND' (R, 126 minutes) A fictional look at the life and downward-spiraling times of George Reeves, the man who played Superman on television and is here played by a fine Ben Affleck. Allen Coulter directs Paul Bernbaum's screenplay, which features a dead-end parallel plot about a detective (Adrien Brody). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'HOME' (No rating, 78 minutes) In Jeffrey M. Togman's marvelously revealing documentary, Sheree Farmer, a single mother of six, is offered the opportunity to escape her gang-infested neighborhood in Newark. An affordable new home in a safe area awaits; but as the mortgage deadline approaches, and Ms. Farmer's troubles mount, the movie brilliantly illuminates the psychological damage inflicted by years of deprivation. When survival hinges on trusting no one but yourself, the kindness of strangers can seem too good to be true. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS' (PG, 98 minutes) The worms go in, the worms go out, but mostly the worms go into the frying pan in Bob Dolman's engaging and yucky adaptation of the Thomas Rockwell book. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'IDLEWILD' (R, 120 minutes) André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, a k a André 3000 and Big Boi of OutKast, play friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. The joint doesn't jump; it twitches and stumbles. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE ILLUSIONIST' (PG-13, 109 minutes) This film tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900 with his supernatural magic shows. A terrific yarn, it rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'INVINCIBLE' (PG, 99 minutes) The latest addition to the Disney stable of sports-underdog movies, ''Invincible'' is the true story of Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg), a substitute teacher and part-time bartender, who in 1976 realizes his dream of playing for the Philadelphia Eagles. The director and cinematographer, Ericson Core, counters the story's predictably inspirational trajectory with close attention to historical detail and blue-collar hardship. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'KEEPING MUM' (R, 90 minutes) Maggie Smith stars as a homicidal housekeeper and a Mary Poppins type in this British black comedy. An old-fashioned movie, it exudes the comfy familiarity of a vintage episode of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ARTIE LANGE'S BEER LEAGUE' (R, 86 minutes) Mr. Lange, Howard Stern's radio sidekick, somehow manages to make beer-league softball seem no fun at all in this extremely lowbrow comedy. High point: a brief appearance by the guy who played the beloved and now dead Edgar on ''24.'' (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>* 'LASSIE' (PG, 100 minutes) Everything old is new again in the 11th film about the beloved pooch with the I.Q. of a grad student and the instincts of a boomerang. Blissfully restored to the period and location of Eric Knight's original novel -- pre-World War Britain -- the movie balances humor and pathos with old-fashioned charm and not a trace of satire. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE LAST KISS' (R, 104 minutes) Tony Goldwyn's remake of a popular Italian film is thin and clumsy, but nonetheless unusually candid in its treatment of human sexual misbehavior. Zach Braff plays a young man who, on the brink of turning 30 and about to become a father, panics and cheats on his girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett). (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'Little Miss Sunshine' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'MAN PUSH CART' (No rating, 87 minutes) The Sisyphean daily grind of a Pakistani immigrant who sells coffee, doughnuts and bagels from a cart in Midtown Manhattan is an exemplary work of independent filmmaking carried out on a shoestring. At its best, it suggests an American ''Bicycle Thief.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'MUTUAL APPRECIATION' (No rating, 110 minutes) Andrew Bujalski's wonderful independent film about friendship in the modern world looks like something that came out of a time capsule, but there's nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, it is the sort of unassuming discovery that could suffer from too much big love, and while it won't save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'OLD JOY' (No rating, 76 minutes) Two old friends drive out of Portland, Ore., one day and into a strained reunion in Kelly Reichardt's ''Old Joy,'' a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest American films of the year. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'Scoop' (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SNAKES ON A PLANE' (R, 105 minutes) Snakes + plane + Samuel L. Jackson. David R. Ellis provides the fine B-movie-style direction, while Mr. Jackson supplies the cool and his trademark epithet. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED' (No rating, 97 minutes) Kirby Dick, with the help of a private detective, investigates the mysterious workings of the Motion Picture Association of America, a highly secretive, deeply irrational organization with enormous influence over what we see -- and don't see -- on movie screens. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE U.S. vs JOHN LENNON' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Using archival clips -- including some great ''Dick Cavett Show'' appearances and in-bed news conferences -- and talking-head interviews with Noam Chomsky, G. Gordon Liddy and many people in between, this documentary makes the case that John Lennon was a much better person than Richard Nixon. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'VAJRA SKY OVER TIBET' (No rating, 89 minutes) Limited almost exclusively to tourist attractions, this documentary glimpse at the sights and sounds of occupied Tibet amounts to a rhetorically inflated vacation video -- but what a vacation! (Lee)</p>
        <p>'the WICKER MAN' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In remaking a 1973 British horror classic, Neil LaBute once again demonstrates his misogyny and, worse, his technical incompetence. (Scott)</p>

        <p>THE BEST OF BUSTER: KEATON COMEDY CLASSICS  (Through Monday) Film Forum's eight-week festival of the silent comedies of the brilliantly stone-faced Keaton (1895-1966) ends Monday night with ''The Cameraman'' (1928), about a man trying to impress a pretty office worker at MGM, and ''Spite Marriage'' (1929), about a dry cleaner in love with a stage star. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10.

        <p>MADE IN NY (Through Dec. 31) Tomorrow, just in time for autumn in New York, the Museum of Modern Art begins a three-month series of notable films made in the city. This weekend's five movies include Woody Allen's ''Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986), whose Manhattan locations include Mia Farrow's Upper West Side apartment, and Spike Lee's ''Do the Right Thing'' (1989), set in a racially charged Brooklyn neighborhood.

        <p>PYTHONALOT (Through Oct. 5) Film Forum's two-week Monty Python festival begins today with a weeklong run of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' (1975), the Arthurian lunacy that inspired the Broadway musical ''Spamalot.''

        <p>AGENT ORANGE, REAGAN YOUTH (Tomorrow) The clock is ticking for CBGB, the legendary Bowery dive that was the cradle of punk: after a protracted dispute with its landlord, the club must vacate by the end of October. Its last few months have been shaping up as a reunion of the mid-80's class of Hardcore High, which continues tomorrow with the Southern California skate-punk of Agent Orange and members of Reagan Youth, a New York ''anarchy peace punk'' band that, among other things, equated ''the sons of Reagan'' with Nazis. (Its leader, Dave Insurgent, died 13 years ago.) Also on the bill are Freeze, Slacktone and Apple. At 7 p.m., 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $20. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOSEPH ARTHUR (Tuesday and Wednesday) Romance, despair and the struggle for faith intermingle in Mr. Arthur's haunting songs, which can float in a gorgeous but eerie acoustic reverie or flare up in electrified anger. His fifth album, ''Nuclear Daydream,'' has just been released on his own label, Lonely Astronaut. With Annie Stela. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, maxwellsnj.com; $15. Wednesday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ASHFORD AND SIMPSON (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Steve and Eydie of pop-soul still put on a convincing and musically solid show of being the world's happiest show-business couple. At 8:30 and 11, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095, feinsteinsattheregency.com; $60, with a $40 minimum. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BOBBY (BLUE) BLAND (Tomorrow) Mr. Bland's voice is a cornerstone of Memphis soul singing. In tones that are velvety, humble and long-suffering, he begs for affection with suave melancholy and smoldering fury. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JUSTIN BOND AND THE FREUDIAN SLIPPERS (Tonight) Fresh from a run on Broadway, Justin Bond, the peerlessly raunchy cabaret satirist better known as the Kiki half of Kiki &amp; Herb, offers an account of his career, in music and video. At midnight, Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CIBELLE (Tonight and tomorrow) Cibelle, a young Brazilian who lives in London, follows sensuous melodies into slippery electronic dream realms. And when she interprets the classics, she does it with a free hand: her version of Caetano Veloso's expatriate lament ''London, London'' on her new album ''The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves'' (Six Degrees) seizes on the line about ''flying saucers in the sky,'' adding more than a minute of psychedelic, sci-fi sound effects. Tonight at 7:30 and 9:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. Tomorrow night at 10:30, with Barra Libre, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, ARCHITECTURE IN HELSINKI (Thursday) Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, the grassroots rock success story of 2005 -- this band from Brooklyn sold tens of thousands of CD's of jerky, Talking Heads-inspired art-pop without a record label -- adds another trophy to its case with a performance at Rumsey Playfield in Central Park. If the musical segments on ''Sesame Street'' were made with a chamber orchestra and choir and intended for an audience of hyperintelligent prodigies, they might sound something like Architecture in Helsinki, from Australia: frolicsome and inventive, as if every instrument were being played for the first time. At 5 p.m., midpark at 70th Street, (212) 307-7171; $32.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ERIC CLAPTON (Thursday) This evergreen guitar hero, now 61, is touring with a repertory stretching back to his Derek and the Dominos era. Also on the bill is Robert Cray, the slick guitarist who was the great commercial hope of the blues in the 1980's. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $49.50 to $154.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* DENGUE FEVER (Tonight) If you missed Cambodia's wildly eclectic psychedelic rock scene in the 1960's and early 70's (which came to a sudden end with the arrival of the Khmer Rouge), this adventurous Los Angeles band offers the next best thing. Featuring the forceful and entrancing vocals of Chhom Nimol -- a former Cambodian pop star who had been singing in a restaurant in Long Beach, Calif. -- it plays vintage hits and original songs in Khmer and English, toying with a listener's sense of exoticism and familiarity. At 11:30, Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FLAMING LIPS (Sunday and Monday) The first sign that it will not be the usual rock concert: the place fills with oversize balloons. Next: dancers seemingly dressed as Hebrew prophets. And if another is necessary, the highlight of the night is a cathartic, audience-participation version of ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' At 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, mcstudios.com; $40. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>HEM, FREEDY JOHNSTON (Tomorrow) A night of songwriting versus atmosphere. Hem plays somewhat prosaic alt-country, but in such delicate, luscious arrangements that it doesn't matter. Mr. Johnston is a master miniaturist whose elegant, deadpan stories of the lovelorn and the cruel are set to generic and innocuous folk-pop. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $23.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JET (Wednesday) Determined to boil rock down to its AC/DC-meets-Guns-N'-Roses essence, this Australian band dismisses anything that distracts from that goal -- including innovation. With Diamond Nights. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOHN BROWN'S BODY (Tomorrow) A reggae band founded in Ithaca, N.Y., John Brown's Body plays old-fashioned reggae, sometimes updated with dub-inspired electronic effects; the results are less ham-fisted than you might think, which isn't saying much. With Club D'Elf and Haale. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, boweryballroom.com, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Kelefa Sanneh)</p>
        <p>* JACK JONES (Tonight and tomorrow night) In full command of his formidable vocal technique, Mr. Jones, at 68, is arguably the most accomplished singer still standing to work in a Sinatra-descended lounge style as demanding as it is easily parodied. At 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331, algonquinhotel.com; $60 cover; $60 prix fixe dinner required at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows. (Holden)</p>
        <p>LOS LOBOS (Thursday) Los Lobos started out in Mexican music, went on to dig deeply into Americana, from blues to country to rhythm and blues to salsa, and then added some twists. Lately a new Latin percussionist has been revitalizing the band. At 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $30. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>MEGADETH, LAMB OF GOD, OPETH, ARCH ENEMY (Thursday) The vanguard of heavy metal, past and present. Megadeth's members were steely, cynical soothsayers at a time when the dominant style was poofy hair and power ballads, and they haven't changed a bit. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Opeth, from Sweden, adds intriguing depth to the usual histrionics of black metal with gentle acoustic parts and tough, growly sounds. Arch Enemy, with former members of Carcass, Carnage and Candlemass, reaches back to the glory days of guttural death metal. At 4:30 p.m., Nassau Coliseum, 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., (631) 888-9000, nassaucoliseum.com; $43. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK GYPSY FESTIVAL (Sunday) With a thriving rock scene in New York inspired by Gypsy and Eastern European music, a full festival that brings major Gypsy artists from overseas has been badly needed. Most of the action of this second annual series begins next Friday, but on Sunday night a preview offers two bands: Café Antarsia Ensemble, a New York four-piece that plays Greek and Balkan styles and features Ruth Margraff, a playwright and performance artist (7:30 p.m., $15); and Kal, from Serbia, which incorporates rap, Indian bhangra beats, tango and flamenco guitar (9:30 and 11:30 p.m., $22). (Through Oct. 8.) Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com or nygypsyfest.com. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BRAD PAISLEY, CARRIE UNDERWOOD (Thursday) Knowing the value of terse composition and sly wordplay, Mr. Paisley scored one of country's biggest hits last year with ''Alcohol.'' A droll defense of grog from the drink's point of view (''I've been known to cause a few breakups/And I've been known to cause a few births''), it is one of the rare novelty songs that outlives its novelty. Ms. Underwood won the fourth season of ''American Idol'' and has sold more than three million copies of her country-pop album ''Some Hearts'' (Arista). At 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698, artscenter.com; $25 to $53. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LEE (SCRATCH) PERRY (Monday) Mr. Perry's quirks are inseparable from his inspirations. He is one of reggae's most important producers, using the studio to fill arrangements with distortion, ghostly echoes and disorienting silences. As a performer, he sings and rants, with lucid nuggets surrounded by malarkey as he discourses on space aliens, sex, the International Monetary Fund and marijuana. With Dub Is a Weapon. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052, cbgb.com; $42. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>RODRIGO Y GABRIELA (Tuesday) Once thrash-metal bandmates in Mexico, this guitar duo discovered what the Gipsy Kings have long known: Europeans and Americans go crazy for virtuosic acoustic renditions of their favorite 70's rock ballads. The Gipsy Kings did it with ''Hotel California,'' and Rodrigo y Gabriela's self-titled new album, on ATO Records, includes a lush ''Stairway to Heaven.'' With Natalie Walker. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROLLING STONES (Wednesday) It took a fall by Keith Richards from a palm tree in Fiji -- and his subsequent brain surgery -- to slow them down, and even then it was for only a few months. The Stones continue the world tour for ''A Bigger Bang'' (Virgin), their leanest and most acclaimed album in decades. At 8 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900, meadowlands.com; $62 to $452. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* REGINA SPEKTOR (Wednesday and Thursday) Rhapsodic and sweet, Ms. Spektor's fantasies veer from the childlike to the erotic, in endearingly idiosyncratic piano and vocal parts that can resemble P J Harvey, Billie Holiday or Chopin. With Only Son. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ELAINE STRITCH (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The third autobiographical go-round by this feisty 81-year-old legend features 10 astutely chosen new songs (including the theme song from ''The Sopranos'') performed with verve and humor. But her between-song patter finds her at a loss to come up with amusing or enlightening new stories from her glittering show business life. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600, thecarlyle.com; $125; dinner required. (Holden)</p>
        <p>SUNSET RUBDOWN (Sunday and Monday) A solo enterprise of the prolific Spencer Krug, who sings and plays keyboards in the Montreal indie-arty band Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown is one of those weirdly fascinating bedroom noise projects characterized by stompy lo-fi backing tracks and evocative stream-of-consciousness lyrics (''Shut up, I am dreaming of places where lovers have wings''). With Beaver. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YAT-KHA (Tuesday) Led by musicians from Tuva in southern Siberia, Yat-Kha features the sound of throat singing, the simultaneous production of guttural low notes and their eerily pure overtones. But its leader, Albert Kuvezin, started out playing in rock bands, and Yat-Kha puts some rock beats behind songs about steppes, reindeer, ancient conquerors and pretty girls. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200, joespub.com; $20. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>LES YEUX NOIRS (Thursday) This French band finds the common ground between Gypsy music and klezmer: modal dance tunes taken at breakneck speeds, from the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 and $26 in advance, $25 and $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>* JOHN COLTRANE 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Tonight and tomorrow) Countless tenor saxophonists have adapted John Coltrane's sound and style, but few have personalized it more effectively than Joe Lovano, who headlines here with the pianist Steve Kuhn, who briefly worked with Coltrane, and the serious-minded rhythm team of Henry Grimes, bassist, and Andrew Cyrille, drummer. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>THE FOUR BAGS (Thursday) The instrumental palette of this collaborative quartet -- trombone, accordion, guitar and reeds -- suggests a contemporary sort of chamber jazz.

At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>ROBIN HOLCOMB (Tuesday) Ms. Holcomb seeks out meditative spaces as both a pianist and a singer, and she softens her experimental urges with an enveloping sort of lyricism. For this rare solo performance she revisits old pieces and introduces some new ones. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>WALLY SHOUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Shoup, a saxophonist known for his intensity in free improvisational settings, leads a quartet with the cellist Brent Arnold, the bassist Reuben Radding and the drummer Toshi Makihara. At 8:30 p.m., Roulette at Location One, 20 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 219-8242, roulette.org; $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ESPERANZA SPALDING (Wednesday) Ms. Spalding is a gifted young bassist and vocalist whose recent debut, ''Junjo'' (Ayva), finds her calmly guiding a trio with the pianist Aruán Ortiz and the drummer Francisco Mela. She performs with that group in an early set; for the later set she leads a quintet consisting of the trumpeter Christian Scott, the saxophonist Mike Tucker, the pianist Leo Genovese and the drummer Lynden Rochelle. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CLARK TERRY QUINTET (Tuesday through Thursday) Clark Terry's buoyant trumpet style and comic vocalizing have long made him one of jazz's most beloved personalities, and at 85 he draws from an extraordinary wealth of jazz experience. (Through Oct. 1.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* MCCOY TYNER TRIO WITH PHAROAH SANDERS (Tonight through Sunday) The pianist McCoy Tyner and the tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders are indelibly associated with the 1960's output of John Coltrane, though each enjoyed a productive period as a solo artist in the 70's and beyond. They combine their searching energies here in a quartet with Charnett Moffett on bass and Eric Kamau Gravatt on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVE WECKL BAND (Through Sunday) Energetic fusion, driven by the sleek proficiency of the drummer Dave Weckl, with some longtime partners: the keyboardist Jay Oliver, the bassist Tom Kennedy and the saxophonist Gary Meek. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JAMES WEIDMAN (Tonight) Mr. Weidman, a pianist with a broad résumé and a graceful style, inaugurates Fazioli Salon, a weekly solo piano series organized by Jim Luce at the Klavierhaus workshop near Carnegie Hall. At 8, Klavierhaus, 211 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 245-4535, pianoculture.com; $20 online, $25 at the door. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* WYNTON AND LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S HOT FIVES (Thursday) The recordings made by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five in Chicago in the 1920's are an ageless and inviolable achievement. So while the order of names in this concert title suggests some hubris on the part of Wynton Marsalis, he is indeed the person best suited to give the music a fresh airing. He'll be joined by colleagues like the clarinetist and saxophonist Victor Goines, the trombonists Wycliffe Gordon and Vincent Gardner, the banjoist Don Vappie and the pianist Jonathan Batiste. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $37.50 to $127.50. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) Updated to the years around World War I, this is one of New York City Opera's best productions, and some fine young talents should make this run of it worth hearing. Shu-Ying Li, the Mimi, has shown a really striking soprano on past occasions; James Valenti, her Rodolfo, was a promising Met Council winner in 2002; Elizabeth Caballero, the Musetta, made a very good City Opera debut last season; and Daniel Mobbs, the Marcello, has been proving himself reliably at Caramoor and elsewhere for several years. George Manahan, the company's music director, conducts. At 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'La GiocOnda' (Tuesday) Ponchielli's 1876 ''Gioconda'' can be seen as stuck on a crossroads of Italian opera history. On one level it is a grand opera in the manner of ''Aida.'' Yet in its conventional structure of arias and ensembles it harkens to days of Donizetti. It also anticipates the move toward realism, with its melodramatic story of the street singer Gioconda. The work used to be a staple of all opera houses. The Met is bringing it back for the first time in more than 15 years, with a glittering cast topped by the soprano Violeta Urmana as Gioconda and the mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina as Laura. Bertrand de Billy conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'Idomeneo'  (Thursday) Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's solid old production of Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera with Ben Heppner singing the title role; Kristine Jepson as Idomeneo's son Idamante; Dorothea Röschmann as Ilya; and Olga Makarina as Elettra. James Levine conducts. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $320. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' (Monday) To open its season, the Met returns to Puccini's weepy masterpiece, with big guns firing. The new production is Anthony Minghella's. The company's music boss, James Levine, conducts. And Cristina Gallardo-Domâs, Marcello Giordani and Dwayne Croft take the principal roles. Unsurprisingly, the performance is sold out. At 6:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>'THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive and beloved, the sexagenarian Amato Opera proves that, in opera, tradition and devotion can prevail over quality. It's remarkable that all of Mozart's characters can fit on the theater's tiny stage. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200, amato.org; $35; $28 for students and 65+. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'SEMELE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The New York City Opera's Handel series continues with a first-rate update evoking Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedys and the kind of sex and violence that Ovid's original gods and goddesses might have understood. Elizabeth Futral takes the title role. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $130. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* 'die tote stadt' (Sunday and Wednesday) Erich Wolfgang Korngold's renown as the composer of swashbuckling film scores for Hollywood hits of the 1930's like ''Captain Blood'' and ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' has understandably overwhelmed his early work as an early-20th-century German modernist. At least his 1920 opera ''Die Tote Stadt'' lingers at the margins of the repertory. The New York City Opera revives Frank Corsaro's production of this psychological mystery about a man obsessed with his saintly dead wife, Marie, and who is spooked when he chances upon a look-alike, a sultry temptress and actress named Marietta. Sunday at 1:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nycopera.com; $16 to $125. (Tommasini)</p>

        <p>Babi Yar Commemoration (Wednesday) The Museum of Jewish Heritage will commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Jewish massacre at Babi Yar in Kiev with ''Babi Yar Remembered: Yevtushenko and Shostakovich in Word and Song.'' The program features a reading by the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, while Misha and Cipa Dichter perform the world premiere of Shostakovich's two-piano version of his Symphony No. 13, ''Babi Yar,'' with full male chorus and Valentin Peytchinov, a bass. Patrick Gardner conducts the Riverside Choral Society, Rutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir and Rutgers University Glee Club. At 7 p.m., 36 Battery Place, Battery Park City, Lower Manhattan, (646) 437-4202, mjhnyc.org; $25 to $65. (Vivien Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Solo piano recitals frame the week's offerings at New York's favorite floating concert hall. Tonight Steven Beck juxtaposes Bach and Shostakovich preludes and fugues, then plays some Mozart sonatas; on Thursday Seymour Lipkin presents an all-Schubert program, including the Sonatas in A minor (D. 784) and A major (D. 959). In between, Bargemusic's president and executive director, the violinist Mark Peskanov, leads four other musicians in an all-Shostakovich program, including the Piano Quintet. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday nights at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083. Tonight and Thursday, $35; $30 for 65+; $20 for students; tomorrow and Sunday, $40; $25 for students. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>VLADIMIR FELTSMAN (Thursday) This pianist plays the first of five recitals devoted to the Mozart sonatas, performed on a modern copy of a Mozart-era Walter fortepiano. The works on this opening program are the Sonatas in C (K. 279), F (K. 280), E flat (K. 282), B flat (K. 281) and G (K. 283). At 7:30 p.m., Tishman Auditorium, the New School, 66 West 12th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 229-5488, newschool.edu/feltsman; $25; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>JUPITER SYMPHONY CHAMBER PLAYERS (Monday) In the spirit of its enterprising founder, Jens Nygaard, this feisty ensemble offers programs that combine oddities and either familiar works or lesser-known scores by well-known composers. This week the fare includes Heinrich Baermann's arrangement of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto for clarinet quintet; Beethoven's Piano Quartet in D (WoO 36, No. 2); a flute trio by Kuhlau; and a string octet by Raff. At 2 and 7:30 p.m., Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church, 152 West 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 799-1259, jupitersymphony.com; $10 to $25. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>S.E.M. Ensemble (Monday) The alluring Spiegeltent has been host to a parade of adventurous performers and music this summer as part of the Darmstadt Classics of the Avant-Garde series. The momentum continues on Monday with Petr Kotik's intrepid new-music S.E.M. Ensemble, which will play works including Xenakis's ''Dikhthas'' and ''Mikka''; Stockhausen's ''Zeitmasse''; A. Vincent Raikhel's ''go to, go by''; and Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra, with Joseph Kubera as soloist. One of Mr. Kotik's own works, ''Wilsie Bridge,'' is also on the lineup. At 8 p.m., Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $10. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>Kent Tritle (Sunday) Mr. Tritle, the music director of St. Ignatius of Loyola, opens the church's Sacred Music in a Sacred Space season with a recital on the four-manual, 68-stop N. P. Mander pipe organ, whose 1993 installation he supervised. The program will include Bach's Prelude and Fugue in A minor, Persichetti's ''Shimah B'Koli'' (Psalm 130), Mendelssohn's Sonata No. 3, Franck's ''Cantabile'' and Messiaen's Méditation V from ''Méditations sur le Mystère de la Sainte Trinité.'' At 4 p.m., 980 Park Avenue, at 84th St, (212) 288-3588, saintignatiusloyola.org; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Schweitzer)</p>

        <p>'AUTUMN MOON CHINESE DANCE FESTIVAL' (Tonight and tomorrow) Dance China NY, the resident troupe of the New York Chinese Cultural Center, will perform works by Jiang Qi, Dai Jian, Wan Jing, Wang Zhi Qiang and others, all drawing on traditional Chinese and Western modern styles. Tonight at 7:30, tomorrow at 2 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, (212) 322-3764, tribecapac.org; $25. (Jennifer Dunning)</p>
        <p>MARIANA BEKERMAN DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) ''Taro,'' created by Mariana Bekerman and the guest choreographers Keiko Fujii and Rebekah J. Kennedy, tells the story of a woman whose world is transformed when she encounters an evil spirit. At 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479, joyce.org/soho.html; $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>CAITLIN COOK (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Cook, a musician and dancer, presents her first evening-length performance, ''Skint.'' The piece blends highly physical movement with improvised, experimental music, and projections by Calder Martin. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11; $12. (Erika Kinetz)</p>
        <p>* FALL FOR DANCE (Thursday) Only in its third year but clearly the king of New York's late summer/early fall dance samplers, Fall for Dance is offering its regular 30 companies and 6 programs, but this year expands to 10 performances, with 4 of the programs repeated. Each program, from Thursday through Oct. 8, includes five wildly diverse and often famous companies in short dances that ideally build to a satisfying whole, aside from the excellence of any individual offering. Thursday's opening program, repeated next Friday, has the Korean Yi-Jo Lim Sun Dance Company, the Dutch National Ballet, Bill T. Jones, Trisha Brown and the Pennsylvania Ballet. At 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $10. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>KINETIC DANCE THEATER (Tomorrow and Sunday) Joanna and Ryan Greer, who direct Kinetic, explore the sleepy dreamscapes of night in ''Sleeping Giant,'' with help from Frida Kahlo, André Breton, Robert Desnos and Joyce Mansour. At 8 p.m., TADA! Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>NOÉMIE LAFRANCE'S 'AGORA II' (Tomorrow, Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday) Apparently, Ms. LaFrance, a tireless artistic explorer of public space, is a glutton for punishment. Having moved bureaucratic mountains last year to stage ''Agora'' in the enormous (and empty) McCarren Park pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, she now has a sequel, ''Agora II,'' which incorporates a number of guest companies and is described in the publicity materials as ''a choreographic game for 1,000 bodies.'' Good luck to them all. At 8 p.m. (arrive by 7:30), McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs and Bayard Streets, (718) 388-6309, sensproduction.org; $20 and $30. (Roslyn Sulcas)</p>
        <p>'LUNA' (Tonight and tomorrow) Max Luna III pays tribute to Alvin Ailey, whose company Mr. Luna once danced with, in his new ''Cold Song.'' The work, influenced by Ailey's choreography and by traditional Filipino dance, is to be performed by the Yangtze Repertory Theater of America. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; a benefit performance tomorrow at 3 p.m. Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park and Gold Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, yangtze-rep-theatre.org. Evening performances, $15; $12 for students and 65+. Benefit performance, $25 to $100. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* CONSTANZA MACRAS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Born in Argentina, trained in New York and Amsterdam and based in Berlin, this choreographer has arrived with her 18-member international company, Dorky Park, in the United States premiere of ''Back to the Present,'' originally presented over four hours in 2003 in an abandoned Berlin department store. At 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $20. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>RASTRO DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Back for the third consecutive season, Rastro will present dances by its company director, Julieta Valero. (Through Sept. 30.)

        <p>ELKE RINDFLEISCH (Tonight and tomorrow night) In Ms. Rindfleisch's new ''Damage,'' six dancers will struggle through a spreading inner disturbance, to rock music by Chris Woltmann, performed live. They end up nowhere, the choreographer says, or in places of unexpected tenderness in a set that fills the performance space with small alternative spaces. At 8, Wallabout Studio, 50 Taaffe Place, between Flushing and Park Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 251-4561, rindfleischdance.com; $15. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* SHEN WEI DANCE ARTS (Tuesday through Thursday) This Chinese-born, New York-based choreographer of visually arresting dance-art spectacles makes his Joyce Theater debut with a new piece, ''Re-,'' which evokes Tibetan spirituality, and his 2003 ''Rite of Spring,'' set to the four-hand piano version of Stravinsky's score. (Through Oct. 1.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $38. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>TAKE DANCE COMPANY (Tonight through Sunday) Takehiro Ueyama, who danced with the Paul Taylor Dance Company for eight years, presents the world premiere of ''ONE,'' a collaboration with the artist Paul Hunger that is based on Gregory Colbert's ''Ashes and Snow'' photography exhibit. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday night at 7, Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, takedanceny.com. General tickets, $25; students, $20; tickets including tonight's opening reception, $35. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>ELIZABETH WARD AND HEATHER VERGOTIS (Thursday) A semi-improvised collaboration, ''Love Cervere'' explores the myth of the love cervere, a pantherlike, sweet-breathed medieval mythological creature. With choreography by Ms. Ward, who has danced with downtown types like D D Dorvillier and Cathy Weis, and music by Ms. Vergotis, a saxophonist and composer. (Through Sept. 30.) At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com; $15, but Queens residents pay what they wish. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'LIONS, DRAGONS AND OTHER BEASTS: AQUAMANILIA OF THE MIDDLE AGES, VESSELS FOR CHURCH AND TABLE,' through Oct. 15. Cast in sturdy, glowing copper alloy, most often in the form of lions with serpents on their backs, aquamanilia are now having their first exhibition, complete with lavish catalog. The show has been drawn mostly from the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and overseen by the head of the museum's medieval department and its object conservator in collaboration with Bard graduate students. But don't worry about dryness. The aquamanile's triple function as totem, prestige object and pitcher lends it an undeniable energy. The show feels like a walk-in bestiary and is enhanced by striking abbreviations reminiscent of folk art; a versatile repertory of incised details and patterns; and a continuing, rarely resolved struggle between form and function. Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Culture, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum: 'Looking Back from Ground Zero: Images from the Brooklyn Museum Collection,' through Dec. 27. This show presents a historical picture of Lower Manhattan from early on to the present, with the building of the World Trade Center as the pivotal point. A short film, ''Building the World Trade Center,'' produced by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1983, is an invaluable document of the triumphalist spin surrounding the construction of the complex. A small selection of artworks produced in or just after 2001 hints at the profound and conflicted feelings the destruction of the twin towers has evoked. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>Dia:Beacon: 'Agnes Martin: A Field of Vision: Paintings from the 1980's,'  through March 5. Dia:Beacon has three permanent galleries devoted to the artist Agnes Martin. Over the last two years they have been used for a retrospective of her paintings, installed in decade-long increments. The fourth installment is now in place. If Ms. Martin's spare, lucid compositions of drawn lines and painted bands feel different from much of the art around them here, that is because she was not a Minimalist. In fact, she called herself an Abstract Expressionist, and she was adamant on this point. The 18 paintings here confirm her conviction, in a show as deep, light-glinting, restless and purposeful as the river flowing nearby. Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, www.diacenter.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>International Center of Photography: 'Ecotopia: The Second I.C.P. Triennial of Photography and Video,' through Jan. 7. Punctuated by big black oozing forms that are both comic and ominous, this edifying, entertaining, ecologically aware exhibition is a walk-through version of Al Gore's ''Inconvenient Truth.'' The work on view represents nearly 40 artists and photojournalists and portrays nature as variously ravishing, cute and enduring, and also increasingly dangerous and endangered, thanks to the widening scope of human indifference and exploitation. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Brush and Ink: The Chinese Art of Writing,' through Jan. 21. If painting and writing can be seen as modes of thinking, and they can, then this exhibition is as much a brainstorming session as an art exhibition, crackling with ideas and arguments every step of the way. It is also a sequence of moods, with impassioned voices calling out from the 80 scrolls and inscribed fans that line the galleries, which include colossal examples of contemporary 21st-century art that both depart from and preserve a tradition, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>The Met: 'CÉzanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde,' through Jan. 7. The come-on title of this show turns out to be slightly misleading. The star is not any of the artists. It is a dealer, Ambroise Vollard, born in 1866, arrived in Paris in 1887 from the Île de la Réunion. The works in the show are eye candy, sure, but they also passed through Vollard's hands. Picasso bought a Matisse still life and a Renoir bather from Vollard. They're both here. So is Cézanne's ''Bathers,'' which Monet bought; and Cézanne's ''Battle of Love,'' which Renoir got. What's worth noting are less the landmarks than the byways: a Renoir portrait of Vollard dressed as a torero. And some Matisses, from before 1904, when Vollard organized a Matisse show, which tanked, document a genius whose imminent breakthrough Vollard missed. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* THE MUSEUM AT F.I.T.: 'LOVE AND WAR: THE WEAPONIZED WOMAN,' through Dec. 16. From a museum known for elucidating both the erotic and architectural nature of clothing design, this characteristically handsome exhibition examines the influence of garments of love and seduction (lingerie) and of war (armor and military uniforms) on modern and contemporary couturiers. The Museum at F.I.T., Fashion Institute of Technology, Seventh Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 217-5800, fitnyc.edu/museum. (Smith)</p>
        <p>National Academy Museum: 'Luminist Horizons: The Art and Collection of James A. Suydam,' through Dec. 31. Mr. Suydam is remembered, if at all, as a 19th-century American Luminist painter whose reputation has all but sunk quietly into the New England salt meadows that he loved to paint. This exhibition has a few aims, one of which is a kind of art historical search and rescue operation. Mr. Suydam's early works were painted in a smooth Luminist style compatible with his material, pleasantly detached scenes of rural tranquillity or calm seas beneath hazy skies. His masterwork, ''Paradise Rocks, Newport'' (1860), is an expansive, low-tide view of a wide, flat beach, meadow and distant rising rocks along the Rhode Island shoreline. The paintings in this show remind us that Mr. Suydam -- and his fellow Luminists -- were an extremely talented group who helped bring a measure of sensitivity, subtlety and poetry to the American landscape tradition. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Benjamin Genocchio)</p>
        <p>NEUE Galerie: Gustav Klimt: Five Paintings From the Collection of Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer,  through Oct 9. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'I SEE NO STRANGER: EARLY SIKH ART AND DEVOTION,' through Jan. 29. Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest organized religion, but how many Westerners know that it was conceived as universalist in scope and radically egalitarian socially? Or that its holy book, far from being a catalog of sectarian dos and don'ts, is a bouquet of poetic songs blending the fragrances of Hindu ragas, Muslim hymns, and Punjabi folk tunes? This is precisely the information delivered by this small and beautiful show. Vivid and concentrated, it presents, mostly through miniature paintings, a kind of Sikh self-portrait, the image of a history shaped by hard work, pluralism and mystical transport, as well as by militancy. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Nadine Robinson: Alles Grau,' 'Quid Pro Quo: Rashawn Griffin, Karyn Olivier and Clifford Owen: 2005-06 Artists-in-Residence,' and 'Beyond Sight,' through Oct. 22. The Studio Museum in Harlem is looking sharp with three concurrent shows, the outstanding one being a single big sound-sculpture by Nadine Robinson. It expands her political purview from imperialism to Armageddon, with hundreds of speakers embedded in an 11-foot-high gray-black wall unit that generate a sampling of satanic film scores (''The Omen,'' ''The Matrix''), mixed with funeral chants and Rastafarian dance music. ''Quid Pro Quo'' is a showcase for the 2005-6 artists in residence, all interdisciplinarians with a sweet-and-sour Dadaist touch. Mr. Owens, with performance, looks intriguingly volatile. And you won't want to leave the museum without checking out ''Beyond Sight,'' the work of the 14 teenagers. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseuminharlem.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Queen Sofía Spanish Institute: 'Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Paintings, 1950-2005,' through next Friday. This institute has devoted its two galleries to a half-century survey of the Spanish painter Albert Ràfols-Casamada. Blocky, indistinct shapes floating in broad expanses of watery color are the rule, for Mr. Ràfols-Casamada is a devotee of a brand of soft-edge, gesture-oriented, color-loving abstraction that was very chic in the 1950's and 60's. If there is something original about Mr. Ràfols-Casamada's work, it is his feathery layering of paint. In 1963 he started making use of collage. His ambition is nothing much greater than this: eye-pleasing pictures suffused with harmony, rhythm and balanced color relations. 84 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 628-0420, queensofiaspanishinstitute.org.

        <p>* ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW,  through Dec. 10. Taking its name from a 1978 hit by the punk band Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea; their mediums include painting, drawing, sculpture, video, photography and performance. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>ANDY WARHOL: MAO Whoever added the colors and brushwork to Andy Warhol's silkscreen images of the Chairman, now 30 years dead, seems to have been having a good time. The surfaces have more life than usual for the master of art-as-business production, even if the show lacks one of Warhol's really, really big Maos. L&amp;M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through Oct. 7. (Smith)</p>

        <p>ALEXI WORTH: COUPLES A prominent bald head, somewhere between a boxed-in apple by Magritte and the smooth pate of a de Chirico mannequin, dominates several of these quirky paintings, which are as notable for the weirdness ascribed to both representation and human relations as for the discreet formalism of space, scale, tone and surface (Smith). DC Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 247-2111, through Oct. 7. (Smith)</p>

        <p>TOMOO GOKITA: DRUNKO A whiz at drawing, this Tokyo-based artist is making his New York solo debut with a show of his first paintings, executed in black and white gouache on canvas. The best are full of strange squiggles and doodles that suggest the elements of an Yves Tanguy Surrealist landscape swept into a messy pile, like entrails. ATM Gallery, 619 West 27th Street, (212) 375-0349, atmgallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* AXEL KASSEBÖHMER Not all German painters come from Leipzig. This New York debut and 15-year sampling introduces one whose work suggests the painting-as-paint strictures of Gerhard Richter (with whom he studied) filtered through the blunt land- and seascape abbreviations of artists like Emil Nolde and (to American eyes) Milton Avery. They convey a mystical yet flat-footed physicality, a penchant for sly references to the history of textiles and ceramics and an impressive range of causes and effects. Klemens Gasser &amp; Tanja Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-6594, gassergrunert.net, through Oct. 14. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'Street Poets &amp; Visionaries: Selections from the UbuWeb Collection' Poetic is the word for the text-based work that Kenneth Goldsmith has assembled for this group show. Printed copies of shaped poems by David Daniels, a West Coast artist now in his 70's, make up about half of what's here. Most of the rest is anonymous urban ''outsider'' material picked up over the years by Mr. Goldsmith from the street and digitally archived as the UbuWeb Collection (ubu.com). Over all, the content is idiosnyncratic, to say the very least: obessional, paranoic, splenetic, militant, millenarian and just plain psychically intense in a way that art in Chelsea rarely feels. Oliver Kamm/5BE Gallery, 621 West 27th Street, (212) 255-0979, 5begallery.com, through Oct. 14. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Alison Elizabeth Taylor This artist's wood veneer inlay images dwell on the darker side of the suburban idyll. Sexual tension, waste, bigotry and violence underlie their luxurious-looking surfaces, along with a gnawing estrangement from nature: in this case, mostly the desert landscape around Las Vegas, where Ms. Taylor grew up. Couples and small groups of people embody fractured, ambiguous relationships in her carefully constructed marquetry ''paintings.'' James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Sept. 30. (Genocchio)</p>

        <p>'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. A vital part of the show is the section devoted to the body in motion. It reveals how the work of Eadweard Muybridge, the English-born, California-based photographer who did studies of humans and animals in movement, played an important role in the development of motion pictures. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast,and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 9. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>COOPER HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION' A British sculptor of Nigerian descent organizes an absorbing small exhibition of objects related to travel from the Cooper Hewitt collection and adds his own oblique comment on 19th-century imperialism in the form of two headless female mannequins in Victorian-style dresses cut from African-patterned fabrics, poised on six-foot stilts strapped to their feet. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 or ndm.si.edu; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* STUART HAWKINS: CUSTOMS The latest series of daffy photographs by this American artist working in Nepal rarely reflects well on Western tourists. Too stagy to be snapshots and too haphazard to be completely planned, they parlay familiar travel terms like ''Day Driver,'' ''Field Notes,'' ''Welcome Drink'' and ''Medicine Kit'' into bizarre sitcoms. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Michael Heizer Sculptures in concrete representing prehistoric hand tools, much enlarged so that they resemble Modernist sculptures by a follower of Brancusi. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)  * MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED' In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this season, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; closes on Monday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Into Me/Out of Me' Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, gagosian.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
