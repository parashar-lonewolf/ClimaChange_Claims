        <p>"FOR, like any object of grand passion, the volcano unites many contradictory attributes. Entertainment and apocalypse. A cycle of substance displaying all four elements: starting with smoke, then fire, then flowing lava, ending in a lava rock, the most earth-solid of all."</p>
        <p>So Sir William Hamilton, the British diplomat of the late 18th century, regards Mount Vesuvius with awe in Susan Sontag's new historical novel, "The Volcano Lover."</p>
        <p>Today the object of his reverie would be Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which scientists expect to erupt again any day.</p>
        <p>Other disasters -- earthquakes, wildfires and tidal waves -- all have their devotees. But none have the romantic allure nor the deep sexuality of volcanoes. For most people, like Sir William, the volcano is nature's divine calamity. No one ever prayed to a tsunami or flung a virgin into the San Andreas Fault.</p>
        <p>Few disasters have shown the combination of worldwide reach and even political power of Pinatubo. This volcano ended the delicate U.S.-Philippine debate over closing Clark Air Base with a shower of pumice that left a high-tech Pompeii. Its dust cloud may have staved off global warming for a few years, and it may even have hurt ice cream sales at Coney Island -- some scientists say it cooled the East Coast's weather.</p>
        <p>Pinatubo's claims, however, pale against those attributed to other volcanoes by some scientists: The parting of the Red Sea (a post-eruption tidal wave); the destruction of a legendary civilization -- Atlantis -- and of a real one -- the Minoan; the spread of Hinduism (to Bali from Java, as believers fled an eruption).</p>
        <p>The first person to speculate that eruptions affected weather, said Robert Tilling, a government geologist in California, was Benjamin Franklin, who proposed it soon after an Icelandic volcano erupted. But it was the 1815 eruption of Mt. Tambora in Indonesia, the most powerful modern volcanic explosion, that confirmed Franklin's thesis. The next year, 1816, became known as "the year without summer." In New England and other places, frosts hit in August, destroying crops and causing famines.</p>
        <p>Such havoc has only enhanced the volcano's stature. Thousands annually visit bubbling Kilauea in Hawaii, view the tortured body casts unearthed in Pompeii or drive among the flattened forests surrounding Mount St. Helens. Inside St. Helens' still active crater is a scene of primordial splendor: a vast grey amphitheater, home to a new and tiny volcano, known as a lava dome, that regularly spits out freshly baked rocks.</p>
        <p>For some, like the writer John McPhee, it is this role as geological unifier that is so alluring. Scientists have discovered, for example, that the Hawaiian islands were formed one after the other as the floor of the Pacific Ocean slowly slid over a volcanic hot spot, through which magma wells up.</p>
        <p>"Volcanoes are an expression of the syncopation of the total system," said Mr. McPhee, who chronicled the battle to save an Icelandic village from lava in a series in The New Yorker in 1987.</p>
        <p>If Hollywood is any measure of obsessions, then volcanoes shame other catastrophes. True, "Earthquake" was filmed in Sensurround, an audio technique that surrounded the viewer with rumbles, crumbles and screams. But for sheer number of titles or plots where eruptions are central, there is no contest.</p>
        <p>The most recent entry was "Joe Versus the Volcano," a 1990 film in which a nerd gets to live briefly like a king so long as he throws himself into a volcano as payback.</p>
        <p>Classicists might prefer "Bird of Paradise," made twice and described this way in Movies on TV and Videocassette: "White man come to island. Native princess have eyes for him. Gods get angry. Volcano erupt. And the only method of lava stoppage at the time was for the princess in residence to jump into the volcano."</p>
        <p>Things being what they are, princesses are no longer the weapon of choice; earlier this year, American military helicopters tried using six-ton concrete blocks to redirect lava bearing down on an Italian village from Mt. Etna. It didn't work very well.</p>
        <p>Others look upon volcanoes as objects to exploit for financial gain, since volcanoes are sources of geothermal energy, diamonds and gold. An Object Lesson in Respect</p>
        <p>But in a few scattered places, some peoples still have the same reverence the Romans had for Mt. Vesuvius. In Bali, in Indonesia, Mt. Agung is viewed by some islanders as the navel of the world where the gods dwell, said Michael Rampino, who teaches applied science at New York University.</p>
        <p>Any skeptics got the message in 1963. That year, Eka Dasa Rudra, the most sacred of all Balinese Hindu sacrifices, held once every 100 years, was observed. And Mt. Agung suddenly came to life for the first time in 600 years.</p>
        <p>Priests raced to the mountain, but there was no appeasing Agung; it quieted only after leaving a quarter of Bali under lava and hundreds dead.</p>
        <p>Said Mr. Rampino: "People came away with the belief that it wasn't going to be a good year."</p>
