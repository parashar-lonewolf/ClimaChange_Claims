        <p>This time around, Washington couldn't be prouder. Twenty years ago, when the major provisions of the Clean Air Act were passed, the word ''cost'' was hardly mentioned. Now, with the bill in a House-Senate conference, the debate over amendments to the act is filled with figures purporting to capture the cost of the tiniest provision.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, it's all hot air. Nobody has any idea what it will cost -worse, there has been a conspiracy of silence on who will pay the bill.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of estimates of the total cost. Unfortunately, the range is large; respectable guesses run from $22 billion to more than $100 billion a year, and almost nobody is willing to declare any number definitive.</p>
        <p>As laughably flabby as the cost estimates are, at least they define the territory. Getting a grasp on the dollar number for the benefits is like charting Planet Debbie - virtually impossible. The problem is that the benefits from cleaner air are broad. They include everything from fewer deaths from lung cancer to more relief from sinus headaches.</p>
        <p>Thus, estimating the money saved has to take into account profound speculation - like the value of a life (perhaps $2 million to $5 million), savings in medical costs and days lost due to respiratory diseases. It should include, too, less profound categories such as less frequent house painting and reduced damage to national monuments. Toting this up is a mug's game; unsurprisingly, there are no reliable estimates of the benefits.</p>
        <p>Why, then, do we seem so eager to pass legislation that could be as expensive as $100 billion a year without knowing whether the benefits will justify the cost? Simply put, the discussion has not focused on who, ultimately, will pay; instead, there is an implicit promise that the Clean Air Act will be a free lunch.</p>
        <p>Ask who will pay the bill, and the answer is that business will have to ante up. Granted, the added cost will be felt first by the tens of thousands of businesses that must comply with new regulations on acid rain, toxic emissions and urban smog.</p>
        <p>Utilities will have to cut back on cheaper high-sulfur coal and use more expensive low-sulfur coal or install scrubbers to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Auto companies will have to limit tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide, and small businesses like bakeries, gas stations and restaurants will have to control their use of alcohol- and petroleum-based products that contribute to smog. Chemical and steel companies - and dry cleaners, auto body shops and pest control companies -will have to buy new equipment to control airborne toxic substances. But in the final analysis, business doesn't pay. We pay. Business will pass the increased cost along. Either consumers will pay in the form of higher prices for products or services, or workers will pay in the form of lower wages, or shareholders will pay in the form of lower dividends or stock prices.</p>
        <p>That means we all will pay more for electricity, gasoline, cars, bread and paint. Workers in affected industries, like steel and mining, will absorb the cost by receiving lower pay hikes or benefits. People who own stock in utility or oil companies will find their dividends are lower or their stocks are worth less. And owners of mom-and-pop dry cleaners will take out less profit.</p>
        <p>There is an indirect cost to all of us, too, because the economy won't grow as fast as it could otherwise. After all, money spent for pollution control cannot be spent to make widgets. Likewise, it cannot be spent for new equipment to produce widgets more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Finally, the added cost to business will diminish the attractiveness of doing business here, and companies will relocate to other countries, taking production and jobs with them.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the blank-check aspect of the Clean Air Act cannot be avoided. The law will mandate what experts agree are sensible goals, and incorporate efficient ways of achieving those goals; the cost will follow. But Congress, the Administration and environmentalists should come clean and point out who will ultimately cough up the money. Twenty-two billion dollars to $100 billion would buy a lot of research on breast cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease. That's a significant trade-off - one that ought to be considered since the direct cost could be $90 to $450 a person a year.</p>
