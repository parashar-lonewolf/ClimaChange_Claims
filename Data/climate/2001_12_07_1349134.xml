        <p>Even Mars, it seems, may be in the throes of global climate change.</p>
        <p>Photographs of the south polar ice cap of Mars, taken by a spacecraft in 1999 and again this year, have revealed a marked erosion of the year-round reservoir of solid carbon dioxide there, scientists reported in an article being published today in the journal Science.</p>
        <p>A comparison between the two sets of images, scientists said, suggested that large circular pits in the polar ice are growing and high ridges and mounds are shrinking. Many small features on the surface have disappeared. Up to half of the specific topography that was measured, researchers calculated, has been eroded by 3 to 10 feet in the past Martian year, roughly equivalent to two years on Earth.</p>
        <p>Scientists said the observations by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft provided evidence of substantial annual variations in the amount of carbon dioxide frozen in the polar caps and thus the amount that evaporates to increase atmospheric pressure.</p>
        <p>''This means that the climate is really dynamic and changing with time,'' said Dr. Michael C. Malin, a planetary scientist whose company, Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, built and operates the spacecraft's camera for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Scientists said they were not sure if the Martian global warming represented a profound trend or a passing phenomenon, a routine consequence of the planet's eccentric orbit and tilted axis and how that causes periodic changes in sunlight reaching the poles.</p>
        <p>The present loss of polar carbon dioxide ice could be increasing the mass of the Martian atmosphere at a rate of about 1 percent per Martian decade. Depending on the size of frozen carbon dioxide deposits at both poles, Dr. Malin said, the rising atmospheric pressure could become high enough to ''permit liquid water to persist at or near the surface for as long as the pressure is elevated.''</p>
        <p>A major challenge of Mars exploration is to learn when and how liquid water could have once existed on the planet, now cold and arid. The Martian surface appears to bear many traces of flowing water, and that possibility has revived speculation that in a warmer, wetter past, the planet could have supported some elementary forms of life.</p>
        <p>In another article commenting on the findings, Dr. David A. Paige, a planetary scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the dynamic behavior of the Martian polar caps and the exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and surface ''could have global-scale consequences for the stability of the Martian environment.''</p>
        <p>The Martian atmosphere is composed mainly of carbon dioxide gas with a surface pressure of less than one one-hundredth that of Earth's atmosphere. In a year, Mars exchanges up to a third of the carbon dioxide in its atmosphere with its surface at the polar regions. In each hemisphere's autumn and winter, the gas condenses to ice deposited over the polar caps. It evaporates back into the atmosphere in the spring and summer.</p>
