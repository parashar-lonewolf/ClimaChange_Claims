        <p>Something called the Committee to Restore American Values recently asked Republican Presidential hopefuls to fill out a sort of Standardized Litmus Test seeking their views on everything from gambling to gun control. One question asked if the would-be President would place a Nativity scene on the White House lawn even ''if ordered to refrain from doing so by the Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>Not to be outdone, the Coalition to Heal America's Karma, a splinter group of the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy, has prepared a similar survey for possible Democratic candidates:</p>
        <p>Whom do you admire more: Sacco or Vanzetti?</p>
        <p>Will you overturn Executive Order #35986, President Nixon's directive that the musical ''Hair'' never be staged at the Kennedy Center?</p>
        <p>Is your spouse or significant other willing to relocate to New York to oppose a Rudolph Giuliani Senate bid?</p>
        <p>Should the purview of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms be expanded to include any of the following? Check those that apply:</p>
        <p>[ ] Caffeinated beverages</p>
        <p>[ ] Nonnatural fibers</p>
        <p>[ ] The Archer Daniels Midland Company</p>
        <p>[ ] Both Bennett Brothers</p>
        <p>[ ] The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal</p>
        <p>How does one show contempt for the establishment and run it simultaneously? Can you effectively compartmentalize?</p>
        <p>Do you support real universal health care, or would you limit coverage to planet Earth?</p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be just perfect if Anita Hill were appointed Solicitor General? Check one:</p>
        <p>[ ] Yes</p>
        <p>[ ] Absolutely yes</p>
        <p>Do you believe the progressive tax structure can be made more fair by requiring Steve Forbes to pay 18 percent more than anyone else in the top tax bracket?</p>
        <p>A train leaves Cambridge, Mass., headed for Berkeley, Calif., traveling at 100 miles per hour. If a car simultaneously departs the Upper West Side at 60 m.p.h. and reaches Hollywood six days later, which mode of transportation has contributed more to the proliferation of global warming? (Show all work.)</p>
        <p>Since 1994, Kenneth Starr's fishing expeditions have needlessly killed thousands of dolphins. Will you call for a boycott?</p>
        <p>Do you believe America's Poet Laureate should be elevated to Cabinet rank?</p>
        <p>Which Toni Morrison novel are you currently reading?</p>
        <p>Will you fight to end the discriminatory practice of ''no shirt, no shoes, no service''?</p>
        <p>(1) When will the United States Postal Service honor the art of Robert Mapplethorpe with a postage stamp, and (2) do you know the home address of Senator Jesse Helms?</p>
        <p>Should the motto ''In God we trust'' be replaced with ''To whom it may concern''?</p>
        <p>Do you believe that the waste and fraud cut from the defense budget ought to be added directly to the waste and fraud of Social Security budget?</p>
        <p>Will you pardon the brave dissident in the Senate gallery last week who exclaimed, ''God Almighty, take the vote and get it over with!''</p>
