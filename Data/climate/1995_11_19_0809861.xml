        <p>HOPE, HUMAN AND WILD True Stories of Living Lightly on the Earth. By Bill McKibben. 227 pp. Boston. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $22.95.</p>
        <p>IN 1989, in "The End of Nature," Bill McKibben argued that humankind must abandon its obsession with unchecked economic expansion or environmental disaster would result; his remedy called for people to live more humbly. Now, in his new book, "Hope, Human and Wild," he writes that "my prescription was vaguer than my diagnosis," and sets out to discover whether there are ways to live that "produce decent human lives with less money, less energy, less wood. Less stuff."</p>
        <p>He finds three examples of communities that he says at least offer hope that  economies and societies can be retooled to do less damage to nature. One is the  Adirondacks, where Mr. McKibben lives and which, he writes, offers the promise that nature ravaged by man can be restored and can coexist successfully with a lower-octane regional economy and life style. The second is the city of Curitiba, Brazil, a place whose citizens, according to Mr. McKibben, have worked pragmatically, constructively and for the most part successfully to create a community whose virtues are simplicity and human scale. The third is the Indian  state of Kerala, which despite a low-income, low-consumption way of life has matched Western countries as a beacon of literacy, health, female emancipation and good family planning. Kerala, Mr. McKibben writes, suggests a way to solve the task "of living lightly on the earth, using fewer resources, creating less waste."</p>
        <p>Taken on their own terms, by themselves, the examples make for interesting and provocative reading. But public discourse on humans' impact on the environment is more sophisticated than it was in 1989, and more informed readers may have problems with "Hope, Human and Wild." In "The End of Nature," Mr. McKibben looked at the issue mainly through the prism of climate change. Now, as then, he argues that technology is not up to the job of reducing emissions of the heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide that scientists say with increasing  confidence are warming the atmosphere. Only a big change in our profligate way of life, he argues, will do the trick.</p>
        <p>But in fact, scientists and economists who have been studying that very question are concluding that technology in the form of more efficient energy devices, automobiles and alternative fuels can indeed bring substantial reductions with no appreciable impact on the way we live. Technology, in their view, brought on the problem and can also solve it if the will to apply it is there.</p>
        <p>Should policy makers concentrate on cost-effective ways to bring technology to bear? Or should they concentrate on the far more difficult and chancy task of changing people's behavior? Maybe the latter is desirable -- and in the future it may even be necessary -- but can we rely on it to cut down on energy use soon enough to head off what may be substantial and disruptive climate change? Mr. McKibben concedes that to emulate Curitiba, "the rest of the world would have to break some longstanding habits," and he raises the obvious question of whether the habits of Curitiba and Kerala can be replicated elsewhere. Common sense says it will be difficult at best, and in many cases impossible.</p>
        <p>More cogent is his argument that the modern appetite for material expansion must be moderated if we are to get a handle on the steady destruction and degradation of the landscape and the resulting loss of biological diversity. Here, Mr. McKibben sees his Adirondacks as a model for the restoration of nature and as a laboratory for a new kind of regional economy based on light exploitation of the forest rather than on industrial forestry.</p>
        <p>But he seems to assume that recovery is assured if humans just stop insulting nature. This appears to reflect the increasingly discredited view that the best  way to protect nature is to let it alone. This position in turn reflects a philosophical stance, also out of favor, in which nature is seen as independent of humans. Mr. McKibben himself, in "The End of Nature," helped consign this philosophical stance to history's dustbin, but most ecologists had  already long since jettisoned it.</p>
        <p>One practical corollary of this philosophical shift, now widely shared by conservation biologists, is that if nature is allowed to take its course in ecosystems disturbed by man, they will further decline and biodiversity will dwindle; if humans do not intervene to fix the damage humans have caused, failure will be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>As for the Northeastern forests whose resurgence Mr. McKibben celebrates, although there are more wooded acres than there were a century ago thanks to the decline of farming and logging, ecologists point out that the news is not all good. The complex fabric of the forest ecosystem has been weakened and its biological diversity threatened, not least by invasions of a few exotic, weedy plant species that choke out many native ones. Development, by carving up whole  ecosystems into isolated island fragments, also threatens the forest's integrity. Mr. McKibben recognizes the threat of fragmentation, but apart from a mention of exotic species in passing, he appears to take it for granted that the forest will continue to recover if people back off. But if that's all they do, many scientists say, the forest will inevitably decline.</p>
        <p>The natural re-proliferation of Northeastern trees in the absence of farming  and logging is an aberration anyhow: in few places do conditions allow this kind of spontaneous regeneration. What is going on in the Adirondacks seems not so much restoration, as Mr. McKibben would have it, as it is benign neglect. Mr. McKibben says nothing about the real, science-based restoration efforts going on across the country as thousands of dedicated volunteers and professionals undertake the hard work of putting natural processes back on track. If he is looking for hope, he can find a lot of it there.</p>
