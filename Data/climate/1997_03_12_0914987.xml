        <p>Bookkeeping gimmicks employed to simulate big reductions. Promises of a decisive decrease, but not until somebody else is in office. Borrowing against future generations. Sound like the old Reagan-era budget schemes? Actually, these statements describe the Clinton Administration's plan for curbing emissions of gases that may cause the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Not only is the Administration surprisingly irresolute on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, but it is also missing a golden opportunity to advocate a reform that would help the environment and increase industrial efficiency: a tax on the burning of fossil fuels that would be offset by cuts in other corporate taxes.</p>
        <p>A treaty signed by more than 150 countries in 1992 in Rio de Janiero committed them to reducing emissions that may cause artificial global warming. Two international summits in Kyoto, Japan, later this year will supposedly bring the agreement into force. But many countries hope to wriggle out of their commitments, and the United States is doing some of the most uninhibited wriggling.</p>
        <p>In its proposal, recently submitted to the United Nations, the Administration has set laudable long-term goals for reducing worldwide emissions. The catch is that the plan would not have teeth until 2010 -- long after President Clinton has left office (even a two-term Gore Presidency could have ended).</p>
        <p>For public relations purposes, the Administration is insisting that its proposal is ''binding.'' But the plan is backed up by little more than an honor system. It is as if the White House said there will be a ''binding'' law against speeding, but that no tickets would be issued until 2010.</p>
        <p>The Clinton proposal would even allow governments to appear to be making greenhouse progress by ''borrowing'' credits from future years -- claiming a decrease today through nothing more than a pledge to cut emissions in the distant future.</p>
        <p>During the 1992 Presidential campaign, Al Gore repeatedly excoriated President George Bush for failing to support binding reductions in greenhouse gases by 2000. Now, apparently not wanting to upset industry, the Administration says that short-term greenhouse gas reductions would unnecessarily burden manufacturers. It has defined ''short term'' as anything before the year 2010.</p>
        <p>If Vice President Gore really believed, as he once said, that the possibility of global warming is ''the worst crisis our country has ever faced,'' why is the White House plan so meek?</p>
        <p>The Administration plan does have a couple of good initiatives among its weaknesses. One is that companies would, as an alternative to cutting their own emissions, be able to buy greenhouse gas ''credits'' from other factories that cut their emissions to even lower levels than required. The model for this plan is a 1990 law that allows the trading of permits for emissions that produce acid rain. This has helped cut acid rain faster than expected and at about one-tenth the cost projected by the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>The White House plan would also allow corporations to gain credits for  greenhouse gas emissions by helping to reduce pollution in fast-growing countries like China. American companies could then forgo expensive renovations of their relatively efficient factories in the United States by, say,  paying for the modernization of hugely inefficient Chinese power plants. This would help cut overall global emissions while sending Western money and technology to other countries.</p>
        <p>Still, the Clinton plan overlooks a far more effective incentive to reduce greenhouse gases: imposing a tax on the burning of fossil fuels. At the same time, other corporate taxes could be reduced. You can be a skeptic about whether dangerous global warming has been proved -- I certainly am -- and still support these carbon taxes.</p>
        <p>Moderate taxes on the greenhouse emissions of power plants, factories and automobiles would create an incentive for improved energy efficiency, which is in the national interest regardless of whether the global temperature is rising, falling or doing nothing at all. A 1992 Bush Administration study found that greenhouse gases could be cut by up to 11 percent with no cost to the economy, considering the value of fuel savings.</p>
        <p>A levy on the consumption of fossil fuels is attractive because it shifts the tax burden toward pollution, a negative, and away from capital and labor, which are positives. That is why more than 2,000 economists from across the political spectrum, including six Nobel laureates, signed a statement last month calling for carbon taxes as part of a system of tradeable permits for greenhouse emissions.</p>
        <p>Carbon taxes would reward the efficient use of natural resources and cut greenhouse gas emissions without harming industry. Surely a President who cannot run again -- and a Vice President who believes global warming to be a serious threat -- could  support such progressive goals.</p>
