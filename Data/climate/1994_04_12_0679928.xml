        <p>NEWCOMERS ON WELFARE DOWN SHARPLY</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, according to fresh census findings, the flow of welfare applicants into New York City all but dried up. In stark contrast to the experience of a decade earlier, New York City appears to have become a net exporter of welfare families.

        <p>NEWCOMERS ON WELFARE DOWN SHARPLY</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's, according to fresh census findings, the flow of welfare applicants into New York City all but dried up. In stark contrast to the experience of a decade earlier, New York City appears to have become a net exporter of welfare families. It appears that the city's severe recession of recent years prompted poor families to seek opportunities elsewhere. A1.</p>
        <p>FOR GIULIANI, WHAT COST THE VICTORY?</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani emerged from his weekend confrontation with the Schools Chancellor largely with what he wanted: a mayoral appointee empowered to look into the inner workings and finances of the Board of Education. But with a confrontational style that briefly produced the resignation of Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, he irritated other city political leaders and used up some of the goodwill he needs to push through his long-term agenda. News Analysis. A1. NEW YORK CITY  BADILLO JOINS CHORUS OF FISCAL OVERSIGHT</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani's decision to appoint Herman Badillo as a special counsel to scrutinize the school budget adds a sixth observer of the financial management of the Board of Education. B3. MAYOR GETS A HOSTILE RECEPTION</p>
        <p>Faced with two competing camps of protesters at a town hall meeting on the Lower East Side, Mayor Giuliani was met with raucous heckling. Some objected to a vote by members of School Board District 1 not to renew the contract of its superintendent. Others were angered by reports that the Giuliani administration is considering cutting or eliminating the city's Department of AIDS Services. B3. SCRAP DEALER HELD IN TRUCK THEFTS</p>
        <p>In New York City, it has been said, they'll steal anything. But garbage trucks? Eleven were stolen over a five-month period -- 11 of your white, Department of Sanitation 25-cubic-yard rear-loaders -- which raised the question, why? The answer came with the arrest of a Jersey City scrap metal dealer, the police said. B2. REGION  SHOOTING VICTIM LEAVES HOSPITAL</p>
        <p>When Kevin McCarthy arrived at North Shore University Hospital on Dec. 7, one of the more than two dozen victims of a gunman on a Long Island Rail Road train, there did not seem much to hope for. The bullet that struck him had shattered his skull. But Mr. McCarthy confounded the experts and embarked on what doctors say has been a remarkable recovery. B6. TESTING FOR EARTHQUAKE VULNERABILITY</p>
        <p>Sometime this month, a team of state geologists equipped with steel plates, sledge hammers and listening devices will fan out through Columbia County to determine its vulnerability to earthquakes. B6. POLICE OFFICERS GET FIT TO FIGHT</p>
        <p>Because of all those doughnuts, there are police officers out there who can't seem to move with the greatest of ease. So about two dozen members of the Nassau County Police Department were jumping, marching and playing a kind of musical chairs with exercise machines, at a speed exhausting just to watch. Our Towns. B6. CHEAP POWER STALLS USE OF WIND POWER</p>
        <p>With the cost of the technology dropping, windmills could help the Northeast meet its energy needs more cleanly, experts said at a conference on renewable energy sources. B7. Chronicle B2</p>
