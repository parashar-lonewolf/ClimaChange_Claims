        <p>Federal and state officials on Monday committed $626 million over the next 50 years to protect some of the Colorado River's most imperiled wildlife. They hope that the move will allow them to keep tapping water for swimming pools and irrigation ditches across the arid Southwest.</p>
        <p>The conservation effort, more than a decade in the making, is intended to keep healthy 26 species of plants, fish, birds and other animals along 400 miles of the river below the Hoover Dam, in Nevada, Arizona and California.</p>
        <p>The water agencies expect to continue water and power operations on the river unburdened by concerns about endangered and threatened species.</p>
        <p>''Never before have we undertaken a program of this scope,'' Craig Manson, the assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks in the Interior Department, said at a gathering here near the dam. ''Fifty years from now, the communities of the lower Colorado River will still be thriving.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups, which were invited to join the 56 agencies involved in drawing up the effort, are highly critical of it. Most of the groups refused to participate in the planning because the 100 miles or so of the river in Mexico, where some of the richest and most threatened habitat exists, were excluded. Federal and state officials said it would have been impossible to control conservation activities across the border.</p>
        <p>Critics have also suggested the program does too little to account for climate changes because of global warming, which many scientists theorize will result in long-term reductions in water flows. Environmentalists want more of the water to remain in the river for wildlife, rather than have it siphoned off for agriculture and the 20 million people in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California who rely on it to fill their bathtubs and drinking glasses.</p>
        <p>''It's all about allowing agencies to continue business as usual, getting water to the cities without expecting significant conservation measures in return,'' said John Kostyack, senior counsel at the National Wildlife Federation, which opposed the final version of the program but was one of the few environmental groups that worked on the planning.</p>
        <p>''We like some of the restoration efforts in the plan,'' Mr. Kostyack said. ''But when you have major environmental threats that are not truly grappled with, that is a problem.''</p>
        <p>The program, formally known as the Lower Colorado Multi-Species Conservation Program, is an acknowledgment that decades of engineering along the Colorado, beginning with the construction of the Hoover Dam in the 1930's, has exacted a heavy toll.</p>
        <p>Six species in or around the lower Colorado are listed as threatened or endangered under federal law. Protections for those six and 20 other species have been included in the conservation program. Half the cost will be paid by the federal government, with the other half shared by the states and local agencies.</p>
        <p>By agreeing to the program, officials from urban and agricultural water agencies in the three states moved to head off restrictions that could have been imposed by the federal government under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>At the gathering here, an official from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which enforces the act, signed a permit that allows water and power operations for the next 50 years, provided that the conservation program is followed.</p>
        <p>Federal officials said one aim of the program is to prevent the tumult that has surrounded water flows in the Klamath River in Oregon. In 2001, the federal government cut off irrigation water to Klamath farmers in a year of record drought to protect the endangered suckerfish, a move that angered farmers and set off a flurry of attacks on the Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>Lorri Gray, a deputy regional director for the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dams along the Colorado, said many environmentalists would be satisfied only if the river returned to its natural state.</p>
        <p>''What we are trying to do is accommodate the species and the resources while also being able to accommodate the farms and cities of the Southwest,'' Ms. Gray said. ''We are trying to balance it, and their interests would not allow for that.''</p>
        <p>Herb Guenther, director of the Arizona Water Resources Department, said it was ''a tough sell'' to have so many organizations to agree to the program, even without the environmental groups' taking part.</p>
        <p>The list of participants includes six Indian tribes, six federal agencies and dozens of state and local water and power agencies. Some groups, Mr. Guenther said, were ''afraid to care'' about restoring habitats for fear of opening the way to limitless demands for water.</p>
        <p>''We are actually giving something back to the environment,'' said Mr. Guenther, who referred to the Hoover Dam as ''the birthplace of the Southwest.''</p>
        <p>In the cases of some endangered fish like the razorback sucker and the bonytail, the program calls for rearing hundreds of thousands of them in hatcheries for release in the river. For some birds and animals, like the Yuma clapper rail and the Colorado River cotton rat, the plan mandates the restoration of more than 8,100 acres of habitat, most of it on riverfront land to be bought from farmers.</p>
