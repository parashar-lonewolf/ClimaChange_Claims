        <p>The United States and 10 other nations agreed yesterday to reduce their requests for exemptions to a ban on methyl bromide, one of the last remaining ozone-destroying compounds being produced and used extensively in wealthy countries.</p>
        <p>The shift, at negotiations in Montreal, ended a stalemate that experts said threatened the integrity of the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty eliminating chemicals that have damaged the atmosphere's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Under the treaty, wealthy countries have already cut use of methyl bromide, a pesticide, to 30 percent of the amount used in 1991 and were to stop using it altogether by next year. But some agricultural and food companies said they had no affordable alternatives, and so treaty signers agreed several years ago to allow some ''critical use'' to continue.</p>
        <p>Developing countries generally have a 10-year grace period before the treaty's bans apply to them. The Bush administration had sought exemptions that would have increased use in 2005 to nearly 40 percent of 1991 levels. They agreed to a limit of 35 percent, with any amount above 30 percent coming from existing stockpiles and not new production.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups and some elected officials said the original American requests amounted to a subsidy to farmers in Florida and California, states that are important in the presidential election. They also said the exemptions would slow shifts to alternatives.</p>
        <p>Claudia A. McMurray, the deputy assistant secretary of state for the environment, said last night that the administration remained committed to ending use of the chemical, once affordable alternatives were available.</p>
