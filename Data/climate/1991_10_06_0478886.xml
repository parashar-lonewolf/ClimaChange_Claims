        <p>"In Cable's World of Boutiques, a Generalist Thrives," (Sept. 15), about USA Cable, says that "some in the industry jokingly refer to USA as the 'murder and mayhem' network because so many of its programs are about women in jeopardy or people getting killed." Why jokingly? Just as Brandon Tartikoff set ultra-violent national broadcasting standards at NBC with "Miami Vice," "Crime Story" and, most recently, "Nasty Boys," USA Cable showcases reruns of "Miami Vice" and assorted movies showing gratuitous violence as an "entertainment art form."</p>

        <p>For shame. Repetitive television violence is to society's future what chlorofluorocarbons are to the earth's ozone layer. There is evidence to show that the killings depicted on television cause harmful volatility in children's behavior.</p>
        <p>Pinning responsibility for such gratuitous violence on network executives has always proved difficult. The mounting prevalence of slasher movies on VCR's, and on cable and local television raises the stakes for all of us in a losing gamble. Until now, many of us have often been able to protect our children. But we apparently cannot protect all children from harmful and dangerous programming without resorting to censorship or moral posturing. Lacking responsible censuring by network executives, these latter choices unfortunately look more appealing. Perhaps USA Cable needs its $80 million profit. And perhaps this country deserves better.
