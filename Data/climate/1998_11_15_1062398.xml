        <p>WHAT the author Tom Wolfe did for radical chic in the 1960's, narcissism in the 70's, and greed in the 80's, he may now be doing for runaway real estate development in his new novel on America at century's end. Urban sprawl, with all its strip-mall excess and soul-deadening homogeneity, is not just a central backdrop, but almost a character in ''A Man in Full,'' the author's latest pen poke at contemporary life.</p>
        <p>''The only way you could tell you were leaving one community and entering another was when the franchises started repeating and you spotted another 7-Eleven, another Wendy's, another Costco, another Home Depot,'' Mr. Wolfe writes. He was describing the Bay Area of California, but it could have been any metro area in the country.</p>
        <p>On election day, voters from Southern California to New Jersey showed that the sprawl issue may have become a political driving force no less than a narrative function in the fictional world of Mr. Wolfe.</p>
        <p>Voters across the country and across party lines, from desert suburbs in the West to leafy cul de sacs in the East, voted to stop the march of new malls, homes and business parks at the borders of their communities, and to tax themselves to buy open space as a hedge against future development.</p>
        <p>For Vice President Al Gore, who has been ratcheting up the sprawl issue as a top green concern, edging aside more contentious and somewhat abstract environmental concepts like global warming, the votes are seen as the start of a winning national campaign. Who, after all, could be against what the Sierra Club now describes as an attempt to return to Beaver Cleaver's America, albeit with smaller lot sizes?</p>
        <p>Paving Paradise</p>
        <p>''I've come to the conclusion that what we really are faced with here is a systematic change from a pattern of uncontrolled sprawl toward a brand new path that makes quality of life the goal of all our urban, suburban and farmland policies,'' Mr. Gore said in an interview.</p>
        <p>But Republicans like Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, have also listened to the same complaints around the barbecue. At the very edge of what the author Joel Garreau famously labeled ''Edge Cities,'' people say their new communities have become too dependent on the automobile, too removed from nature, too close to the clutter of boxy retail stores.</p>
        <p>Paving paradise, almost a reflex reaction in Southern California, was halted by a huge majority in Ventura County, where voters approved a series of urban boundaries around the fast-growing new cities wedged between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, and stripped their elected supervisors of the power to approve new subdivisions and put it in the hands of voters instead.</p>
        <p>Developers now will have to get voter approval to push the flood of tile-roofed subdivisions any further into land that has some of the last big lemon groves in California. About 80 percent of the county will be off-limits to developers, unless voters say differently, supporters of the measure said. The Los Angeles Times heralded the vote as a ''revolution.''</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, the most-densely populated state in the nation, voters in 43 cities and six counties decided to raises their taxes to buy and preserve open space. Statewide, by a two-to-one margin, voters also approved spending nearly $1 billion over 10 years to buy half of the Garden State's remaining garden space.</p>
        <p>Grass Roots</p>
        <p>Nationwide, voters approved nearly 200 state and local ballot initiatives on curbing sprawl.</p>
        <p>The idea of Al Gore talking growth management for the next two years and beyond  may be no more appealing than hearing another flat tax speech from Steve Forbes.  The Vice President has been pounding the anti-sprawl bully pulpit for months, proclaiming the dawn of ''an American movement to build more liveable communities.''  The issue is seen by his supporters as a key to all those Jeep Cherokee driving suburbanites with few political passions beyond the afternoon traffic jam. The elections earlier this month, based largely on grass-roots initiatives, have only bolstered Mr. Gore's case, his aides say.</p>
        <p>But before Mr. Gore tries to lay a Democratic claim to an issue that cuts beyond most political lines, he will have to go through the Republican Governor of New Jersey. Just five years ago, Mrs. Whitman was held up by her party as a young Margaret Thatcher, with tax cuts as her banner.</p>
        <p>Now, a year into a second term, Mrs. Whitman has made protecting open space the primary issue -- and perhaps her legacy -- for the state. In what may be an act of heresy to the tax-cutting wing of her party, the Governor has been campaigning for tax increases to keep land out of the hands of developers. Initially, she proposed an increase in the gas tax, but has settled on the kind of selective property tax increases that were approved across New Jersey on election day.</p>
        <p>''We have got to understand that once land is gone, it's gone forever,'' said Mrs. Whitman while pushing the new open space measures. She could have been just another doorbeller from the Sierra Club, which, in response to a survey of members, has put  sprawl at the top of its list of environmental concerns. The club says 400,000 acres of open space are lost to development every year.</p>
        <p>The successful anti-sprawl campaigns  steered away from talk of Government control or zoning arcana. They dwelled instead on images of lemon groves and tawny hills in Southern California, pumpkin patches and horse farms in New Jersey, and wind-whipped dunes in Cape Cod -- all just beyond the exurban fringe.</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to subvert the American dream -- we're trying to get back to it,'' said Larry Bohlen, co-chairman of the Sierra Club's national campaign to fight sprawl. ''It's that 'Leave it to Beaver' town where all the kids walk to school.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of these measures, led in California by home builders and developers, say the new political calculation could change in the blink of an eye if the economy turns bad. In bad times, people are less likely to vote to restrict growth. But in Oregon, which pioneered boundaries around all its major cities in the 1970's, voters have upheld the state's far-reaching anti-sprawl laws even during  the depths of two recessions over the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>Developers say the votes this month were not so much an anti-growth chorus as they were a reflection of the frustration people feel over traffic and crowded schools.</p>
        <p>Still, the opponents say they are stunned by how quickly suburban growth has become a pejorative. ''We seem to be at a point now where the word sprawl has been totally demonized,'' said Clayton Traylor, vice president for political issues for the National Association of Home Builders, which has 195,000 members.</p>
        <p>Washington politicians may find it difficult to nationalize what is basically a local issue. Mr. Gore has raised the possibility of using the Federal tax code or major transportation bills to discourage growth that goes against community planning goals.</p>
        <p>''In the past, we adopted national policies that spend lots of taxpayer money to subsidize out-of-control sprawl,'' Mr. Gore said. ''They suck the life out of urban areas, increase congestion in the suburbs and raise taxes on farms.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is vague on what, precisely, could be done on a national level. But whatever he attempts to do will be met by stiff opposition if it ends up slowing development, Mr. Traylor said. Building lobbies for highways and some conservatives were outraged that the $217 billion transportation bill that was just approved by Congress contained a small amount of money for bike paths.</p>
        <p>''To the extent that the Vice President or anyone else at the Federal level tries to turn off the spigot for new infrastructure, we'll be there to fight them,'' Mr. Traylor said.</p>
        <p>In Maryland, however, turning off the spigot proved to be a winning political cry, as supporters of new developments were hastily dispatched on election day. A Republican who favored two huge projects in Anne Arundel County, County Executive John G. Gary, was voted out office, while Republicans who vowed to pull the plug on new water and sewage systems in neighboring Calvert County took control of the Board of Commissioners.</p>
        <p>Homebuilders Heartened</p>
        <p>In other states, developers have tried to co-opt the anti-sprawl movement. Arizona voters narrowly approved a measure, sponsored by the state's banking and building industry, that would set aside $20 million a year for 11 years to buy open space. But in return, the law would ban development fees and urban growth restrictions.</p>
        <p>The homebuilders were heartened by at least one of the sprawl votes that went the other way. In Georgia, voters turned down a measure to use a real estate transfer tax to preserve historical sites and open space. Georgia is the main setting for Mr. Wolfe's novel, a place where a huge, troubled development at the far edge of suburban Atlanta is at the core of one man's decline.</p>
