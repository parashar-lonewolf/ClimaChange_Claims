        <p>The Bush administration's decision last week to relax air-quality rules governing older coal-fired power plants is exasperating. It would have been one thing if the administration had unveiled its proposals in tandem with a strategy for dealing with the extra air pollution that the rollbacks will inevitably cause. But it offered no such strategy, beyond another vague promise to deliver its much-touted ''Clear Skies'' proposals. In effect, the president has asked the country to trade real health protections now for hypothetical gains later on.</p>
        <p>Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that her new rules commanded ''broad support,'' but she must have had a rather limited audience in mind. The power companies and the big refineries were thrilled. But the rollbacks inspired virtually unanimous condemnation from environmentalists, from state attorneys general up and down the Eastern seaboard and from James Jeffords, whose Senate committee will consider ''Clear Skies'' if and when it arrives on Capitol Hill. To Mr. Jeffords, the notion of exchanging existing law for a diaphanous promise represented a ''devastating defeat for public health and our environment.''</p>

        <p>The Bush administration's decision last week to relax air-quality rules governing older coal-fired power plants is exasperating. It would have been one thing if the administration had unveiled its proposals in tandem with a strategy for dealing with the extra air pollution that the rollbacks will inevitably cause. But it offered no such strategy, beyond another vague promise to deliver its much-touted ''Clear Skies'' proposals. In effect, the president has asked the country to trade real health protections now for hypothetical gains later on.</p>
        <p>Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that her new rules commanded ''broad support,'' but she must have had a rather limited audience in mind. The power companies and the big refineries were thrilled. But the rollbacks inspired virtually unanimous condemnation from environmentalists, from state attorneys general up and down the Eastern seaboard and from James Jeffords, whose Senate committee will consider ''Clear Skies'' if and when it arrives on Capitol Hill. To Mr. Jeffords, the notion of exchanging existing law for a diaphanous promise represented a ''devastating defeat for public health and our environment.''</p>
        <p>The main retreat involved a section of the Clean Air Act known as ''new source review.'' The provision compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they build new power plants or significantly upgrade existing units so as to produce more power (and, inevitably, more pollution). Written in 1977, the provision was aimed mainly at hundreds of aging, coal-fired plants that were exempted from the act's stringent regulations in the expectation that they would soon be retired.</p>
        <p>Most of these ''grandfathered'' plants are still going strong, contributing heavily to smog and acid rain. Plants in the Midwest send so much pollution eastward on the prevailing winds that it is almost impossible for states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to meet federal clean air standards. One of the few ways to get a handle on this pollution is to make sure that when the plants upgrade, they install controls.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the Clinton administration and Eastern states led by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York sued 51 power plants for illegally making major upgrades without installing the necessary controls. In short order two major producers in Ohio and Virginia agreed to make billion-dollar investments in new pollution controls, while the federal government reached a similar agreement with a Florida utility. Nevertheless, other companies continued to complain that the law punished them for making even routine repairs and discouraged them from expanding capacity to produce more electricity. Though Mr. Spitzer's investigation found no evidence that either charge was true, the complaints found a warm response in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which ordered a review.</p>
        <p>The net result is new rules that, through various complex definitional changes, will allow the utilities to upgrade their old plants without adding costly new antipollution equipment. The rules will be subject to public comment and, conceivably, court tests. We also recommend Congressional intervention. What the administration is doing is directly contrary to what Congress intended a quarter-century ago.</p>
