        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''America's Shame in Montreal'' (editorial, Dec. 13) doesn't point out that America wants to have it as though we were the only people on the planet and as though we were still a frontier nation.</p>
        <p>During our long frontier adolescence, a man or a woman was free to cut down trees, plow the land, hunt bear, reroute rivers and fill the skies with smoke. This was possible because there were many fewer people doing it.</p>
        <p>The rules of behavior, whether personal or corporate, that are perfectly acceptable for a small group of humans on a vast continent grow less and less reasonable when we are approaching 300 million and a lot of the land, air, water and other natural resources have been occupied or depleted.</p>
        <p>As Americans, we need to open our eyes to the facts of the effect of our behavior on others and on our world, before we foul the only nest we have.</p>
