        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a proposed regulation to control air pollutants that produce smog and acid rain and are released from power plants in the eastern United States, administration officials say.</p>
        <p>The proposal, submitted last week to the White House, would set a regional limit on the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide for 30 states, employees of the agency said.</p>
        <p>The proposal would let utilities buy and sell the rights to emit the gases so long as the total remained under the regional limit. In two stages through 2015, the agency would slowly lower the overall limit for the two chemicals, which it estimates cause tens of thousands of deaths a year.</p>
        <p>The program is similar to the highly successful national cap and trade program to control acid rain that began in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>The effort that will be announced soon would be aimed at further reducing acid rain in the East.</p>
        <p>It would be similar to an E.P.A. proposal announced on Tuesday to establish a similar cap and trade system for power plants that emit mercury. Although trading pollution credits for smog and acid rain would be a major improvement over current practices under the Clean Air Act, critics say the same trading system for mercury could be more harmful than forcing individual plants to reduce releases.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocacy groups, generally critical of the administration's record on clean air, generally applaud the new proposals for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. But they say that the agency should set more stringent limits and that they are wary that the proposal might never be finalized.</p>
        <p>''E.P.A.,'' Vickie Patton of Environmental Defense said, ''is poised to take an important step to begin addressing a pressing public health problem. But we expect that the pollution cuts E.P.A. proposes will fall well short of those necessary to protect children with asthma and the elderly who are most at risk from these harmful air pollutants.''</p>
        <p>The proposal would set an overall cap equivalent to a limit of 3.2 million tons in 2015. Environmental Defense, a group in Manhattan, says health studies show that limit should be set at the equivalent of two million tons.</p>
        <p>The proposals for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the market-based pollution programs for utilities that the administration seems to favor. The administration has made such approaches the centerpiece to the president's proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act that would put controls on mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>Although Congress has balked at amending the Clean Air Act along those lines, the administration has sought to put the market-based approach into effect through changes in regulations.</p>
        <p>''The cap and trade approach shows us again and again that people do more, and they do it faster, when they have an incentive to do what's in the public interest,'' Michael O. Leavitt, the new environmental administrator, said on Tuesday in a speech to agency employees. ''More. Better. Faster. Newer. That's the tune you'll hear from the administration over and over again.''</p>
