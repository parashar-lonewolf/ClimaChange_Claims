        <p>An article and a headline on March 22 about the debate over the costs and benefits of efforts to control acid rain, using South Carolina as an example, referred incorrectly to the makeup of the state's rainfall. Although there is debate over the extent of damage from the acidity, there is a scientific consensus that South Carolina indeed has acid rain. Increasingly detailed letters from readers over several months have pointed out the error; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.</p>
