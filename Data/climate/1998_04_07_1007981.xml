        <p>But with their eyes riveted on these surface displays of natural beauty, they remain oblivious to one of the most mind-boggling and unsettling facts that a geologist could possibly throw at a hapless tourist: If you are standing in Yellowstone Park and you could peer through the earth beneath your feet, you would see gigantic globs of partly melted rock and pressurized gas only about four and a half miles down. In effect, you would be standing on top of a molten plume that may extend  to the earth's liquid core and that may erupt to the surface at any time.</p>
        <p>The fact that Yellowstone is a geological hot spot -- a place where deep forces push through the earth's crust and violently alter the surface --  has only recently become accepted by geologists, said Nancy Hinman, a geologist at the University of Montana in Missoula who helped organize a symposium on the Yellowstone hot spot for the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco recently.  Most hot spots lie under oceans and give birth to island chains like the Hawaiian islands, Dr. Hinman said. But in Wyoming, a hot spot has created the Yellowstone caldera, a craterlike basin of a volcano, which measures 50 miles across. The last time it blew up, 600,000 years ago, ash landed in Iowa and California, making Mount St. Helens look like a hiccup.</p>
        <p>Awed by the magnitude of earlier eruptions, geophysicists have been taking a closer look at the caldera lately, and have realized that it is still active. The caldera  breathes fumes that kill plants and wildlife, rumbles and alters terrain -- and it is destined to explode again, they say. They regard the caldera as a natural laboratory, a window into learning about the earth's  composition, how convection moves the tectonic plates that form the earth's crust, how gases behave under pressure and even for finding clues about the origin of life.</p>
        <p>Europeans first explored Yellowstone in the early 1800's, but it was not until 25 years ago that geologists realized that it was built on a hot spot under the North American plate, and the plate was gliding over it at a rate of one inch per year, said Dr. Kenneth Pierce, a geologist at the United States Geological Survey in Denver.</p>
        <p>But when geologists looked down the Snake River Valley that extends from Yellowstone  west, they identified a string of extinct calderas running to Oregon. At least nine Yellowstone-like calderas running from Wyoming to Oregon have been discovered, Dr. Pierce said. The oldest is 16 million or 17 million years old and lies in southeastern Orgeon and northern Nevada. A caldera system near Pocatello, Idaho, called the Picabo Volcanic Field, is 10 million years old. The Heise caldera field in Idaho, about 100 miles west of Yellowstone, is five million years old.</p>
        <p>Yellowstone, as it exists today, is less than two million years old. It was formed by three eruptions, one of which may have been the largest eruption in the planet's history, said Dr. Robert Christiansen, a geologist at the geological survey in Menlo Park, Calif. The explosions blasted a total of 1,600 cubic miles of material into the atmosphere. By comparison, Mount St. Helens produced about a quarter of a cubic mile of ash and lava. The first and largest eruption was Huckleberry Ridge 2.1 million years ago. Ash as much as three feet thick blanketed the Western United States. The second occurred 1.3 million years ago at Island Park. The third, at Lava Creek, happened 600,000 years ago and formed the current caldera -- one that straddles the previous two.</p>
        <p>In the textbook model of these events, a plume or narrow chimney of magma, liquid or molten rock, travels from the core-mantle boundary of the earth until it hits the crust, which on the continents is 20 miles to 30 miles thick. As material continues to rise, it forms a large pool of melted basalt under the crust and slowly melts the overlying rock. As the heat causes it to expand, the crust gradually thins; melted crustal rock, called rhyolite, forms bulges near  the surface. These pockets of melted rock are rich in silica and release copious amounts of volatile gases that are held under high pressures.  As the gases rise, cracks form around the bulges and extend down toward the magma. At this point,  ''the gun is cocked and loaded,'' Dr. Pierce said.</p>
        <p>When the fractures encounter the magma chambers, the pressure is suddenly released, and giant fountains of 1,800-degree ash and tuff burst from the fractures. In hours, hundreds of cubic miles of material is blown out, traveling at hundreds of miles an hour, knocking down everything in its path. The roof of the caldera collapses, forming a huge depression. Magma pours into the depression, forming domes and other features. This is what visitors to Yellowstone see.</p>
        <p>But recently, Dr. Eugene Humphreys, a geophysicist at the University of Oregon in Eugene, used seismic tomography to obtain a three-dimensional image of the earth under a former hot spot near Pocatello. ''We thought we would see the flattened plume,'' under the crust, Dr. Humphreys said. But instead, they found pockets of partly melted rock with especially dense, cold material to each side -- and the pockets were aligned in a channel moving away from the Yellowstone hot spot.</p>
        <p>This finding led Dr. Humphreys and his colleagues to propose a new model of how hot spots are formed and how they propagate. Magma sources that are not directly linked to the core mantle boundary can form and rise toward the solid surface of their own accord, he said.  Once this process begins, pressure is released, more melting occurs, more upwelling occurs and the system begins to propagate itself. Huge rolls of magma move like corkscrews in the direction of plate motion, drawing fresh material from below. The system is created by local processes and does not need to be driven by heat from extremely deep sources, Dr. Humphreys said.</p>
        <p>Whatever mechanism explains it, the hot spot will continue to migrate north at a rate of 15 miles every one million years, the researchers said.  Eventually it will reach Billings, Mont., lift the city 3,000 feet, drop it, and move toward Hudson Bay.</p>
        <p>Back in Yellowstone, the hot spot today is rising and falling as if breathing heavily, Dr. Pierce said.  Measurements show that the caldera rose three feet from 1923 to 1985.  Since then it has been dropping half an inch each year. By looking at ancient shorelines of Yellowstone's lakes and rivers that rise and fall in concert, Dr. Pierce showed that the caldera rose and fell about five times over the last 9,000 years, each time by about 25 feet.</p>
        <p>The current swelling does not necessarily doom Yellowstone to a violent explosion soon, but the recent history of extensive volcanism, very high heat flow, and earthquakes warrants ''keeping an eye on the region,'' said Dr. Robert Smith, a geophysicist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake. Outside California, Yellowstone is the most seismically active region in the continental United States and is able to produce large earthquakes.</p>
        <p>This activity produces the familiar landscape in the park. The silica-rich soil in the caldera is not friendly to most plants but the lodgepole pine thrives on it, Dr. Pierce said. Miles of lodgepole pines grow in the caldera and nothing else, making it a kind of desert studded with hundreds of geysers, hot springs rings and other geothermal features.</p>
        <p>People love geysers, Dr. Pierce said. They are formed when heat from the caldera encounters water in permeable rock and pressure builds, venting steam. Some geysers explode every few hours while others require decades between eruptions -- and most are unpredictable. Steamboat Geyser erupts at intervals of five days to 50 years. Black Opal Pool in Biscuit Basin last exploded in the spring of 1925 and has since been quiet. Giant Geyser in the upper basin is springing back to life after being dormant for 40 years. It sends scalding water to a height of 185 feet or more.</p>
        <p>The most famous of the geysers,  Old Faithful, has lost its clocklike regularity. The geyser used to pop off roughly every 60 minutes but shifting forces beneath the ground have created a bimodal pattern of eruption, said Dr. Stuart Rojstaczer, a hydrologist at Duke University in Chapel Hill, N.C. It tends to erupt every 40 minutes or 70 minutes, depending on the recharge rates and how rock permeability changes with steam content, he said. The short and long intervals between eruptions occur randomly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rojstaczer and his colleagues last year placed matchbox-size instruments in six geysers to monitor eruption patterns. A theory, invented primarily by Chinese seismologists about 20 years ago, holds that hydrothermal areas are sensitive zones in the crust, he said. When the earth undergoes changes in strain just before a large earthquake, the theory goes, the behavior of the fragile geysers will change radically. The instruments are designed to test this idea, which, if true, could help scientists predict earthquakes.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the caldera can be deadly in other ways. New measurements show that the caldera emits as much carbon dioxide each year as 10 to 20 fossil fuel plants -- enough to kill small forests or ground dwelling animals. Much of the gas percolates through hot pools, bubbling like champagne. Such festive pools contain bacteria-like organisms that thrive on hydrogen and sulfur and are among the most ancient organisms on earth. Scientists say these exotic life forms are found in mid-ocean ridges and other extreme, hot environments, as well as Yellowstone -- making the park a window into the planet's darkest interior secrets.</p>
