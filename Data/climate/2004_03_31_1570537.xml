        <p>Pointing to California gasoline prices as high as $2.37 a gallon for premium, Senator John Kerry blamed the Bush administration's energy policies Tuesday for the nation's rising fuel costs, while the president's campaign introduced a television commercial attacking Mr. Kerry's past support of gas taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry seized on the rising gas prices, which have roused voters' ire, to begin a broad assault on areas where he believes President Bush is vulnerable, including Iraq and the environment.</p>
        <p>''Instead of reviewing a new set of attack ads, I think Dick Cheney ought to reveal who the oil executives are that he met in secret with to set the oil policy of the United States of America,'' Mr. Kerry told several hundred students at the University of California campus in San Diego.</p>
        <p>Offering his plan to expand renewable energy as an alternate to Mr. Bush's proposal for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Mr. Kerry added: ''The United States of America can't drill its way out of this predicament; we have to invent our way out of it.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Kerry worked this theme for a second day, the White House responded with the commercial and by blaming Congress's rejection of the Bush energy plan in 2001 for the rise in oil and gas prices. Administration officials suggested they would use the interest in bringing down gasoline prices to press the Senate to act on the legislation, which the House passed last year.</p>
        <p>''What we need are comprehensive solutions, not patchwork crisis management,'' Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry has proposed temporarily suspending purchases of oil for the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an idea his Senate colleagues supported in a vote earlier this month. But Mr. McClellan rejected the notion, saying it ''would have a negligible impact'' on prices and that it was ''important that we have the necessary resources in the event of a severe disruption of supply.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Kerry's vow to press the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase supply, Mr. McClellan said: ''We continue to engage in ongoing discussions with major producers around the world about the importance of letting the market determine the prices.'' On Tuesday, 28 senators wrote to Mr. Bush asking him to urge OPEC to expand production.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry's offensive on gasoline prices came on a day of fund-raisers at the Beverly Hills and San Diego homes of Ron Burkle, an investment banker, marking the infusion of Hollywood cash and cachet to a campaign that had been largely shunned by this important Democratic money source during the primaries. At the evening fund-raiser in Beverly Hills, which the campaign estimated took in $2 million to $2.5 million, the singer James Taylor entertained stars including the actors Barbra Streisand, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck.</p>
        <p>The back-and-forth on gas prices marked the candidates' efforts to translate their larger economic debate into a daily pocketbook issue for voters. Mr. Bush focused on taxes as the villain, while Mr. Kerry framed the high gas prices as a sign of weak economic stewardship.</p>
        <p>The Bush commercial, to run on cable stations starting Wednesday, says a 50-cent increase in the gasoline tax that Mr. Kerry supported a decade ago as part of a deficit-reduction package -- but never actually voted for -- would have cost families $657 a year. It says Mr. Kerry voted 11 times for the ''wacky idea'' of raising federal taxes on gasoline.</p>
        <p>The Kerry campaign responded with statistics showing that gas prices have risen 12 percent since Mr. Bush took office, costing Americans $24 billion, or $245 a family. Aides said that Mr. Kerry's votes for several small increases in gas taxes came as part of larger budget bills and that he had also voted at times to repeal such taxes. As for the 50-cent increase, they noted that a top Bush economic adviser had also expressed support for the idea in 1999.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest say-one-thing-and-do-another administration in the modern history of our country,'' Mr. Kerry said at the rally, where banners resembling gas station signs listed prices as high as $2.55 a gallon.</p>
        <p>Making the most of his visit to a region whose gas prices are among the nation's highest, Mr. Kerry's 13-vehicle motorcade pulled over at a Shell station, where unleaded premium was selling for $2.37 a gallon.</p>
        <p>There was only one voter for Mr. Kerry to greet: Kevin Burlingame, who does marketing for a roofing company. ''What do you think of the gas prices?'' the candidate from Massachusetts asked.</p>
        <p>''Boy, they are pretty high,'' Mr. Burlingame, 38, said. ''We ship a lot of stuff, so it affects every aspect of our business.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Burlingame told Mr. Kerry, ''I'm very positive about the economy,'' and, when asked by a reporter how much a president had to do with pump prices, said: ''He can introduce policy, but over all, I don't think he can affect gas prices.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 2, 2004, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about Senator John Kerry's criticism of the administration's energy policies over rising fuel costs referred incorrectly in some copies to California prices as high as $2.37 a gallon. They apply to premium gasoline, not regular.</p>
