        <p>Two Senate committees announced today that they would hold joint hearings next month on the Bush administration's plans to rewrite regulations that require all industries, including utilities, to upgrade their pollution control equipment when they upgrade their operations.</p>
        <p>Senators James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who heads the Environment and Public Works Committee and whose defection from the Republican Party last year cost the Republicans control of the Senate, and Senator Patrick J.

        <p>Two Senate committees announced today that they would hold joint hearings next month on the Bush administration's plans to rewrite regulations that require all industries, including utilities, to upgrade their pollution control equipment when they upgrade their operations.</p>
        <p>Senators James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who heads the Environment and Public Works Committee and whose defection from the Republican Party last year cost the Republicans control of the Senate, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said they would hold joint hearings on the matter.</p>
        <p>Also today, attorneys general from six Northeastern states came to Washington to protest the proposed changes. They said they would sue the administration if it weakened the rules.</p>
        <p>''We will, absolutely, go to court to forestall these rules and regulations,'' said Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York.</p>
        <p>The rules, part of the Clean Air Act of 1970, are known as new source review, and apply to old plants that were exempted from meeting new pollution standards. Under the current rules, when those plants update their equipment, they must update their pollution controls.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration and many of the Northeastern States sued several power plants, most of them in the Midwest, saying they were violating the new source review requirements. The suits argue that the companies have done extensive work upgrading older plants under the guise of routine maintenance and that they should meet the same standards as new plants.</p>
        <p>Many of the old coal plants produce up to 10 times as much nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide -- the major contributors to smog and acid rain -- as are permitted from new plants.</p>
        <p>Power companies say that the lawsuits misinterpret the law, and they contend that the requirement prevents them from doing needed maintenance, which leads to more breakdowns and less efficiency. One change under consideration would revise the definition of routine maintenance to allow for big overhauls without adding new pollution controls.</p>
        <p>Dan Riedinger, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, representing the power companies, said the requirement was akin to making a car owner who was buying new tires also buy a new engine. If the same car owner was then buying a new fan belt a week later, and engine standards had gone up in that week, he would have to buy another new engine.</p>
        <p>The suits could require the utilities to spend billions of dollars on new equipment, and last spring the Bush administration ordered a review of the lawsuits to see whether the Justice Department should continue prosecuting them. It also ordered a re-evaluation of the new source review requirement.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have said that the White House is leaning toward relaxing the rules, a move that Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said today amounted to a ''surrender to special interests and polluters.''</p>
        <p>Claire Buchan, a spokeswoman for the White House, said today that the administration had not yet received a final report from the agencies studying the matter.</p>
        <p>''It's purely speculation on anyone's part to assume they know what's in it,'' Ms. Buchan said, ''and no final decisions have been made.''  She said the agencies were taking into account both energy security and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>Senators Jeffords and Leahy said they would review the status of the lawsuits and the rules.</p>
        <p>''Polluters are supposed to reduce their total emissions as time goes by, not increase them,'' Mr. Jeffords said in a statement. ''The administration should consider itself put on notice that it will be held accountable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy praised the Clinton administration for filing the suits.</p>
        <p>''It would be a great injustice to the public for the Bush administration to irresponsibly reinterpret that historic legal action,'' he said. ''It would show a preference for bigger industry profits at the expense of Americans' air quality, environment and health.''</p>
