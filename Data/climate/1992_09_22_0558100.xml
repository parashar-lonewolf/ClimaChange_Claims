        <p>In case you didn't know it, skiers, you are one group that ought to be thinking about global warming.</p>
        <p>That, in part, forms the basis of a marketing theme for a new ski model by Lunatic Fringe, a division of K2 Skis. Lunatick Fringe says it will donate 5 percent of the net wholesale price of each pair of skis sold to three groups supporting the preservation of the world's rain forests and indigenous people: Rainforest Action Network, Cultural Survival and Africa NGO Environment Network.

        <p>In case you didn't know it, skiers, you are one group that ought to be thinking about global warming.</p>
        <p>That, in part, forms the basis of a marketing theme for a new ski model by Lunatic Fringe, a division of K2 Skis. Lunatick Fringe says it will donate 5 percent of the net wholesale price of each pair of skis sold to three groups supporting the preservation of the world's rain forests and indigenous people: Rainforest Action Network, Cultural Survival and Africa NGO Environment Network. (Suggested retail price of the skis is $535.)</p>
        <p>So why aim the environmental message at skiers? "If the world gets hot, there's no snow," said Tim Petrick, the vice president and general manager of Lunatic Fringe.</p>
        <p>The new model, Panther Dream, takes its name from a children's book written by BOB WEIR, lead singer and guitarist for the Grateful Dead, and WENDY WEIR, his sister: "Panther Dream: A Story of the African Rainforest." The model's logo borrows elements from the Grateful Dead's logo (a human skull with a lightning bolt running through it). In return for use of the band's name and its logo, the band's board agreed to donate its 7 percent royalty from ski sales to the three environmental organizations.</p>
