        <p>LEAD: THE morning of my 59th birthday dawned hot and humid, the summer air heavy and still, and the only sound the monotonous droning of my neighbor's pool pump.

        <p>THE morning of my 59th birthday dawned hot and humid, the summer air heavy and still, and the only sound the monotonous droning of my neighbor's pool pump. I woke early, (as I often do these days), made myself some coffee and took down the old brown leatherette-covered photograph album from the high closet shelf in the guest room.</p>
        <p>Sipping coffee, I slowly turned the pages, studying each photograph and reading the white-inked captions beneath them.</p>
        <p>The first few pages held snapshots of me in my parent's apartment in Queens, with appropriate titles lettered by my mother, ''Baby Asleep in Carriage,'' ''Smiling Baby in the Bath,'' ''Baby Baby and Mommy'' (how young my mother looked), ''Baby and Daddy,'' ''Baby,'' ''Grandma and Aunts'' and ''Baby's First Birthday Cake.'' Then the locales changed to Long Island and the home my father designed and built in a subdivision on what was still an unpaved street. There was a photo of me as a toddler, a birthday girl in a white dress with an enormous bow in my straight blond hair, standing framed in sunlight.</p>
        <p>I remember that birthday with fireworks saved from the Fourth of July and the long wait for darkness so my father could send off whistling skyrockets from a sandy field that is now filled with houses, many with ''For Sale'' signs on their lawns.</p>
        <p>In a later shot I flashed a freckled 9-year-old smile, my hair in tight braids and my tan arms encircling a bowl of blackberries I had picked that my mother would bake in a pie. The picture is in black and white, but I remember that my dress was green and white. This year my small grandsons will pick berries from those same bushes which were buried for 20 years, suddenly reappeared, and are now berry-laden again.</p>
        <p>Then there was a picture of my waving from a raft at a beach on the Great South Bay. I would swim out to the raft and lie lazily in the warm sun, untroubled by worries of skin cancer or a depleted ozone layer. I could look far down into the clean water and see the sandy bottom clearly.</p>
        <p>On the horizon there might have been a silent clammer, a small saiboat or cruiser, but not a jet ski or Cigarette boat in sight. The bay was so clean you could slip over the side of your boat, dig up a clam with your toes, cut it open, and eat it on the spot.</p>
        <p>Next in the album were photos taken when I attended elementary school in a district that grew from one building housing nine grades to a district with five elementary schools, a junior high school and a high school. One day both my husband and I would teach in that district and see it evolve through periods of crowded classrooms and split sessions, declining enrollments and austerity budgets.</p>
        <p>There were pictures of school friends and one of me and my Saturday afternoon ''movie date'' (he was often forced to take along his little brother). After the 35-cent movie, which included a cartoon and newsreel, we would have an ice-cream soda while we waited for my father to drive us home. The movies we saw were innocent and lighthearted - musicals with June Allyson, comedies with Cary Grant. At home before my mirror I would comb my hair like June Allyson's and practice making my voice sound husky, like hers.</p>
        <p>Soon we were watching war films that stirred patriotism, sentimental films like ''Since You Went Away.'' We would learn to recognize the stereotypes of the Kamikaze pilot and the brutal Nazi. We grew Victory Gardens, conserved fuel, used ration stamps, and bought War Bonds. We pressed orange pellets in bags of lardlike white margerine to simulate butter and used tan cosmetics on our legs when we could not buy stockings.</p>
        <p>Families were separated, careers put on hold. But with a brother too young for the draft and a father in a defense-related industry, for me the war seemed remote and distant until reports of the deaths of the brothers of friends began to appear in the local newspaper. A friend gave me a copy of John Hersey's ''Hiroshima,'' and the horror of it all came clear.</p>
        <p>Several pages of the album held pictures of me and my teen-age friends on our travels on Long Island and into New York City. We took the railroad to Wantagh and the bus to Jones Beach. We traveled by train to Coney Island, by boat to Bear Mountain, or to shows in Manhattan. We felt young, enthusiastic and sophisticated.</p>
        <p>When we shopped we shopped in ''the village,'' not in a mall. Our parents drove to Queens to see ''the relatives'' on uncongested parkways, and we rarely locked our doors. Today the doors and windows of my home are double and triple locked, programmed with alarms. When I travel to New York I carry my money in a small pouch under my clothing. I no longer ride the subway. Finally on the last page of the album was a photograph of my whole family, escorting me to college in Buffalo. We stand with Niagara Falls in the background, and my mother wears a worried look. Perhaps it was because I was barely 17 and she was leaving me in a temporary dorm hastily built on a burgeoning campus.</p>
        <p>Had she known that I would soon meet (and later marry) a veteran on the G.I. Bill, she might have whisked me home again. She may have worried about my virginity, but she wasn't concerned about drugs and she never heard of AIDS.</p>
        <p>I heard the clock radio click on, and my husband begin to stir. I returned from childhood memories, put the album back on the shelf and set about surviving my 60th year.</p>
