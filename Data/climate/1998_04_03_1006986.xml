        <p>With full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks increasingly popular, auto makers are falling short of Federal fuel-economy standards and scrambling for ways to avoid the embarrassment of paying millions of dollars in fines.</p>
        <p>Regulations imposed two decades ago to reduce reliance on imported oil require an average of 20.7 miles per gallon this year for each auto maker's fleet of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans, known collectively as light trucks. Auto makers are subject to fines if their mileage average over seven years is below the Government standard.</p>
        <p>The light-truck standard is much easier to meet than the 27.5 miles per gallon required for cars. But the popularity of big sport utilities and pick ups that manage only 15 miles or less per gallon has created serious problems for the Big Three auto makers.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company is predicting an average fuel economy of 20.1 miles per gallon for the 1998 model year and the Chrysler Corporation is forecasting an average of 20 miles per gallon, according to a new Federal statistical report. Both auto makers are close to falling below the Government standard for the last seven years, but officials at both companies said they would not actually fall below or pay fines.</p>
        <p>The General Motors Corporation has had the most fuel economy problems in recent years and is the closest to paying fines. But according to the Federal report, G.M. is predicting that its light trucks will have an average fuel economy of 21.2 miles per gallon this year, beating the Government standard and up from 20.2 miles per gallon in 1997. Sam Leonard, a senior G.M. fuel-economy official, said the jump in 1998 fuel economy would allow G.M. to avoid paying fines for now.</p>
        <p>But to achieve its increase from 1997, G.M. has resorted to some unorthodox moves that improve its average without actually raising the fuel efficiency of its vehicles.</p>
        <p>For example, G.M. has already cut short its 1998 model year for its biggest sport utility vehicles -- the Chevrolet Tahoe, the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans -- after less than six months of production. The company declared all such vehicles built after Jan. 31 to be 1999 models. Because fewer large vehicles with poor fuel economy are counted as 1998 models, the average mileage for G.M.'s light trucks rises.</p>
        <p>G.M. plans to introduce large pickup trucks for the 1999 model year that are slightly more fuel efficient than the models they replace. This  would allow the company to sell more of the four full-sized sport utility models that it has converted early to the 1999 model year. Ford and Chrysler have not moved any vehicles early into the 1999 model year.</p>
        <p>G.M., the world's largest auto maker, is taking several other actions. It quietly notified dealers last month that it planned to extend the 1998 model year for its mini-vans and small pickup trucks, which tend to increase the fuel-economy average.</p>
        <p>Last autumn, the company also quietly strengthened the suspensions on even the smallest Suburbans with four-wheel drive. The stronger suspensions give the Suburbans the capacity to carry enough weight to qualify as medium-duty trucks. Medium-duty trucks are exempt from fuel-economy calculations, so the four-wheel-drive Suburbans no longer drag down G.M.'s average. Mr. Leonard said customers were demanding more heated seats and other options on Suburbans, so the stronger suspension was needed.</p>
        <p>All three auto makers are looking at ways to install more diesel engines, which improve fuel economy by up to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists remain leery of diesels. While the cleanest  diesels now meet Federal clean-air standards for light trucks, and may soon even meet the standards for cars, they cannot be made as clean as the cleanest gasoline engines. Widespread adoption of diesel engines could prevent regulators from tightening standards someday, said Roland J. Hwang, director of the transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a research and lobbying group in Washington.</p>
        <p>Chrysler is selling light trucks that can run on both gasoline and ethanol; Ford plans to follow suit soon. Such vehicles, because they can run on ethanol, an alcohol commonly made from corn, qualify for Government credits that allow the auto makers to sell more gas-guzzling light trucks. Yet only 44 service stations nationwide sell ethanol.</p>
        <p>Fuel economy averages used by the Government are calculated by driving a vehicle on a test track under ideal conditions, not on roads where mileage would be lower. By this method, 20.7 miles per gallon on the test track translates to about 18 miles per gallon on the road, the number used on window stickers, according to regulators.</p>
        <p>United States auto makers have never been fined for fuel economy violations. They have consistently met the fuel economy standard for cars and forecast that they will continue to do so, while Japanese auto makers consistently meet the car and light truck fuel-economy standards, according to the report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Many European auto makers have fallen short of the car standards and paid penalties.</p>
        <p>Federal law sets the fines at $5 per vehicle for every tenth of a mile per gallon that a company's average fuel economy falls below the standard. If G.M. fell a tenth of a gallon below the standard, as would have been possible if nothing were done, it would have owed close to $10 million -- a pittance for G.M., the world's largest company, with $177.68 billion in sales last year.</p>
        <p>But the American auto makers worry that paying any penalties would be perceived as having flouted the law. This could hurt their image and increase political pressure to improve fuel efficiency. They also worry that they could be vulnerable to lawsuits by American shareholders if they knowingly violate a Federal law.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and some members of Congress say the auto makers should do more to improve fuel economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, which are used much more than pickups simply for shopping and commuting.</p>
        <p>''That is an area where the industry can and should do much more,'' said Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada.</p>
        <p>Concerns about American dependence on foreign oil prompted Congress to enact the fuel economy rules in 1975, but the impact of growing gasoline consumption on global warming is now a major issue.</p>
        <p>Auto makers respond that they are working on electric vehicles and other technologies that may improve fuel economy early in the next century. Auto executives and many economists also contend that the fuel-economy rules are a highly inefficient way to reduce gasoline consumption, forcing auto makers to sell small cars and small light trucks at a loss to meet the overall averages. They also point out that unlike gas taxes, the rules do nothing to discourage Americans from driving ever more miles and burning ever more gasoline.</p>
        <p>The system of fuel economy regulation ''just introduces distortions to the marketplace, and that's disastrous for the auto companies,'' John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said in a recent interview.</p>
