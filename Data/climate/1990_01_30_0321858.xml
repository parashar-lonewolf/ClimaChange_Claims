        <p>LEAD: Here are President Bush's budget proposals for major domestic programs for the 1991 fiscal year:</p>
        <p>Drugs and Crime</p>
        <p>Here are President Bush's budget proposals for major domestic programs for the 1991 fiscal year:</p>
        <p>Drugs and Crime</p>
        <p>The President's spending proposal would increase the Justice Department's budget by 19 percent from last year to nearly $9 billion, excluding funds set aside for a multiyear Federal prison construction program. The most significant increases, earmarked for anti-drug activities, were announced last week as part of President Bush's new plan to combat drug trafficking.</p>
        <p>Some agencies in the Justice Department would suffer reductions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, would receive a slight spending increase, but would lose nearly 400 positions. The decrease would probably result in a reduction in the number of agents assigned to areas like organized crime and white-collar crime.</p>
        <p>Education</p>
        <p>The Administration proposed $41 billion for education, training, and employment programs and ancillary social services, $400 million more than would be spent under current law and $3 billion more than is expected to be spent in the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>The budget proposed an $880 million increase to $10 billion in spending for elementary and secondary school education for the disadvantaged.</p>
        <p>The budget would also increase by $500 million the funds for Head Start, a program intended to prepare young children to succeed in school, for a total of $1.9 billion. The proposal would also increase by $1.2 billion, to a total of $19.7 billion, discretionary funds for education.</p>
        <p>The budget also proposed $239 million for adult literacy programs, a 25 percent increase over the current budget.</p>
        <p>Environment</p>
        <p>Continuing to reverse the pattern of budgets under President Reagan, Mr. Bush is proposing substantial new spending on environmental programs. Among the significant additions are $269 million for a program to provide money for acquiring parkland and for a major reforestation effort across the country. Mr. Bush is also calling for increased spending to protectwetlands, a hefty increase for research into global climate change and using nearly $780 million to clean up nuclear contamination and other pollution at Federal installations.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency's total proposed budget would rise by a modest $48 million dollars to $5.6 billion. But its important operating budget, with which it administers the anti-pollution laws, would rise by 12 percent to $2.17 billion.</p>
        <p>Health</p>
        <p>The Administration proposed reducing Medicare premiums by $60 a year for beneficiaries who join a Health Maintenance Organization. To further encourage membership in such programs, the Administration is developing a new program, ''Medicare Plus,'' that would combine membership in a Preferred Provider Organization with Medigap, the Medicare supplemental insurance.</p>
        <p>The proposal would also offer the states incentives to enroll people in such programs. An H.M.O. is a highly structured organization of doctors and others that offers a full range of medical services. A P.P.O. is a less structured group of doctors who have agreed to take lower fees than they would otherwise charge in exchange for a higher volume of patients.</p>
        <p>The Administration also proposed reducing the projected growth of Medicare by $5.6 billion, and obtaining $1.9 billion more in revenues. But Medicare expenditures are still expected to increase by $10 billion, to $116 billion.</p>
        <p>The budget would also provide a $109 million increase in AIDS research, prevention and other activities, for a total of $1.7 billion. Total spending on AIDS would be $3.1 billion.</p>
        <p>Labor</p>
        <p>For the Labor Department, the President proposes a small increase in spending, from $24.9 billion in the 1990 fiscal year to $26.3 billion. Most of the budget, $19.4 billion, represents benefits the Government pays to unemployed workers. If the unemployment rate is higher than the 5.3 percent the Government predicts for the year - a rate that some economists say is optimistic - that spending would rise.</p>
        <p>Still, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole obtained room for spending increases in areas that she has put high among her priorities, including an increase of $261 million, to $5.3 billion for employment and training, she told reporters today. She would reduce spending for special summer training programs, from $715 million to $220 million, but she would raise spending from $44 million in the 1990 fiscal year to $1.4 billion for longer-term programs, especially one designed to ease young people's transition from school to work.</p>
        <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would get 34 more inspectors, bringing to more than 200 the number that she has addeed since taking office.</p>
        <p>Science and Space</p>
        <p>A major theme of the proposed budget is investment in the future, and the Bush Administration, seeing the space program as a big part of that, wants to increase the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's budget to $15.2 billion. That would be a 24 percent rise from the previous year, which would be the largest percentage increase for any major agency.</p>
        <p>The additional $2.9 billion includes a 36 percent increase for the space station, alloting $2.6 billion for the manned space platform, which is to be launched in 1995, so that construction could begin on those parts requiring long lead times. The space agency also asked for $237 million to start an orbiting Earth Observing System, a program that would use a series of satellites and a computer network to measure and monitor environmental changes.</p>
        <p>Transportation</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department requested $26.9 billion, a figure that is 4.2 percent below this year's spending level. Big increases for the Federal Aviation Administration and the Coast Guard were offset by proposals to eliminate Federal subsidies for the Amtrak rail system and to cut operating subsidies for mass transport systems in large cities. In past years Congress has refused to make similar cuts in both programs.</p>
        <p>The department proposed to cover 77 percent of its budget through user fees, and proposed two increases in the user fees that help pay for aviation programs. The existing 8 percent tax on airline tickets would be raised to 10 percent, and local airports would be granted authority to impose their own taxes on passengers and could spend that money on airport improvements.</p>
        <p>Agriculture</p>
        <p>President Bush also proposed increasing spending at the Department of Agriculture by $500 million in the 1991 fiscal year to $48.7 billion. The Administration proposed changes in Federal law that would reduce spending for crop subsidy programs by $1.5 billion to $10.24 billion. The Administration has called for cuts in a broad array of programs administered by the Department of Agriculture including programs for feeding children which now cost $127 million, meat and poultry inspection costing $52 million, loans for farmers which would cost $848 million, and housing for rural families, costing $420 million.</p>
        <p>Several programs were identified by the Administration for modest increases. The Presidents asked Congress for $38 million for basic farm research. Several lawmakers criticized the small increase at a time when consumers are calling for more field studies on cultivation practices that produce food with fewer chemicals.</p>
        <p>Energy</p>
        <p>The Administration has asked for $1 billion more for the Department of Energy, for a total of $17.5 billion. Much of the extra money would go into improvements to make the network of deteriorating nuclear weapons laboratories and factories safer and to clean up decades of environmental contamination. Overall, the Administration has asked Congress to approve $3.3 billion to address environmental issues, making the Energy Department one of the Government largest managers of environmental programs. In comparison the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency is $5.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, a summary article yesterday about President Bush's budget proposals for domestic programs misstated the proposed budget for the Environmental Protection Agency. It is $5.8 billion.</p>
