        <p>IT was going to be a tough chip shot: 50 yards onto a tiny green with the ocean right behind, the sun hanging just above the horizon and casting a bright gold glow on the water. One o'clock in the morning, and the sun is in my eyes.</p>
        <p>I should have been asleep. I was at Lofoten Golf Links in Norway, the fourth or fifth northernmost golf course in the world, during the summer solstice last June. I'd just traveled for 26 hours straight: the flight from Newark to Oslo, then another to the northern city of Bodo, a quick dash to catch the coastal steamer for the six-hour passage to Svolvaer, the port town in the breathtakingly beautiful Lofoten islands, then a 45-minute drive to Hov, a farmstead on a single-lane road surrounded by ocean and snow-capped peaks. I was 95 miles above the Arctic Circle and exhausted. But the midnight sun was out, the temperature was a soothing 60 degrees, and a lush golf course was at my disposal, so why sleep?</p>

        <p>IT was going to be a tough chip shot: 50 yards onto a tiny green with the ocean right behind, the sun hanging just above the horizon and casting a bright gold glow on the water. One o'clock in the morning, and the sun is in my eyes.</p>
        <p>I should have been asleep. I was at Lofoten Golf Links in Norway, the fourth or fifth northernmost golf course in the world, during the summer solstice last June. I'd just traveled for 26 hours straight: the flight from Newark to Oslo, then another to the northern city of Bodo, a quick dash to catch the coastal steamer for the six-hour passage to Svolvaer, the port town in the breathtakingly beautiful Lofoten islands, then a 45-minute drive to Hov, a farmstead on a single-lane road surrounded by ocean and snow-capped peaks. I was 95 miles above the Arctic Circle and exhausted. But the midnight sun was out, the temperature was a soothing 60 degrees, and a lush golf course was at my disposal, so why sleep?</p>
        <p>''This time of year, you get spectacular bursts of energy,'' said Frode J. Hov, the course's founder and managing director, who grew up in this place. ''At 2 a.m. you suddenly decide you want to paint the walls, so you do, then three hours later you realize that you have to finish the whole room, and you wonder, 'What was I thinking?'''</p>
        <p>It may have been 1 in the morning, but I was not the only golfer on the course. Two local boys of about 18 were searching for a ball in the heather on No. 3. ''I play every day,'' one said. ''This is the best time -- midnight or later.'' On No. 5, an Australian named Ian trotted over to introduce himself. ''I work here at the shop,'' he said, ''and after I close at 12:30 or so, I come out and play nine holes. It's kind of ridiculous really, but I've worked here three summers now, and this is where I've learned to play golf.''</p>
        <p>But 90 minutes later, I was the only soul on the course. The mountains were standing out clearly in the Arctic three-quarters light, the Norwegian Sea was lapping against the rocks, sparrows and gulls were chirping and calling as if it was dawn, and just off a white sand beach less than half a mile away, a small red house stood alone in a deep green field of turf.</p>
        <p>Lofoten Golf Links stands on Frode Hov's family land. The idea to open a course here first occurred to a family friend and was embraced by Frode's father and by Frode himself, who thought about it further as a student of tourism at Lillehammer College in the mid-90's.</p>
        <p>Many found the idea quixotic -- there were very few golfers and courses then in Norway and Scandinavia in general, and the game was almost entirely unknown in the north. Frode's father died before he could start work on the course, but his grandfather, a fisherman like so many of the older generation in Lofoten, had given his blessing. '''As long as it makes money,' he told me,'' Frode recalled. ''He was a fisherman, so he knew what the important thing was.''</p>
        <p>In April 1998 work finally began on the seaside fields that would become the course. Using very little construction equipment, Frode and his associates went at it, right up to opening day on July 14. The result is a nine-hole course of just 2,172 yards -- par 31, with four par-4's and five par-3's -- incorporating all the natural features of the rocky headland and only rudimentarily manicured. The architect, a Sweden-based Englishman named Jeremy Turner, placed tees on promontories, fairways on narrow isthmuses and postage-stamp greens bare centimeters from sandy beaches. He left thick stands of gorse and clover everywhere. It's the kind of golf course the Scots might have made hundreds of years ago.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the wind was up out of the south. Huge clouds poured over the tops of the mountains. Greens I could hit with a seven-iron the night before now required a five-wood to reach. I played with Chris and Yvonne, a Dutch couple. Chris sliced his shot into the ocean. I hit mine onto the beach. Yvonne lost balls in the gorse, in a brook, in a lawn of enormous daffodils, in the rocks, on a waterside strand of old mollusk shells.</p>
        <p>''I am hitting the ball in silly places,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, I played with Frode. ''When the sun comes out for a whole day,'' he said, ''the grass just explodes. It grows like a couple of inches just in a few hours.'' On No. 2, he pointed to some rocks and shrub-covered peat marked off by four little white out-of-bounds stakes. ''That's a Viking grave,'' he said casually. ''There are a couple more over on No. 8.</p>
        <p>''When my grandfather, and his father, used to plow this land,'' he continued, ''they'd sometimes turn up skeletons and some artifacts -- a Viking sword, a gold ring, the foundations of a house, the outlines of a Viking ship.'' Hov, Frode said, comes from an Old Norse word meaning sacred place of offering.</p>
        <p>What did he think of people playing golf where Viking bones rest?</p>
        <p>''They'd probably think it's fun,'' he said. ''They were Vikings.''</p>
        <p>The day drizzled on, gray and chilly and wet. Others came into the clubhouse from Sweden, from a Norwegian town on the mainland about 180 miles to the north, from Lofoten itself.</p>
        <p>Paal-Tore, a midfielder for the local soccer team, clomped in. He is one of 450 dues-paying members of the Lofoten Golf Links and like many of them, his expectations have been warped by having this golf course form their entire experience of the game.</p>
        <p>''I had a good shot on 5,'' he said, ''and it was six inches short.'' Well done, I said.</p>
        <p>''No, no,'' he said. ''It was six inches short, and it rolled into the water.''</p>
        <p>Lofoten, one of only a half-dozen Norwegian courses north of the Arctic Circle (two, in Tromso and Narvik, are both 18 holes and set in the woods rather than on the water; another, at North Cape, is a muddy six-hole course at the most northerly point in continental Europe), plays host to between 2,000 and 3,000 nonmember rounds each season, mid-April to mid-October.</p>
        <p>From May 23 through July 24, the sun doesn't set at all, and it is light all night till the beginning of August. Late May to early August is the season of ''midnattgolf,'' when, supposedly, you can circle the course 16 times in 24 hours, as a South African guest claimed to have done in 2001.</p>
        <p>The 100-mile-long chain is first glimpsed as a massive sheet of mountains rising 3,000 feet out of the sea -- the so-called Lofoten Wall -- but as boats approach, the mountains part into innumerable fiords, bays and coves. In the main town, Svolvaer, a perfect harbor is set against towering mountains, and the last few years have seen the appearance of waterfront condos, a popular coffeehouse and several restaurants.</p>
        <p>A 10-minute boat ride from Svolvaer takes you to the island of Skrova, population roughly 300 -- most of which is involved in Norway's whaling industry. Whaling is legal in Norway, which puts a veterinarian on every whaleboat to monitor the humane hunting of the minke whale and ensure that the quota -- 790 this year -- is not exceeded.</p>
        <p>In August, when most of Europe is on vacation, Lofoten's narrow roads fill with camping Germans, Swedes and Norwegians who fish, scuba dive, hike, climb or just relax. Beaches, coves, cute but sturdy fishing boats and tidy farmhouses appear and disappear in bright light or foggy mists, each island linked by spectacular bridges that soar over surging tidal straits. Along the way beautiful fishing villages hug the fiords, and in the middle of the islands, in the town of Borg, site of the largest Viking manor house ever unearthed, a museum recreates the Norse world of a thousand years ago.</p>
        <p>A FOG rolled in from the sea. Frode and I were tromping down the second fairway, through a patch of little white flowers that in July produce the northern delicacy of Arctic cloudberries. ''People have gotten into fights over picking cloudberries on other people's land,'' he said. ''You go over to your neighbor's land to pick his berries in the fog so he can't see you. Then you sneak back to your land. And you run into him sneaking back from picking your cloudberries.''</p>
        <p>Later the clouds were high, leaving everything gray but perfect for golf. ''Two years ago I played in a midnight sun tournament in Tromso,'' said Kenneth, a Svolvaer hotel manager, before teeing off on No. 3. ''You were supposed to play four rounds of 18 holes in 24 hours. It was exhausting. I don't even remember playing the last round.''</p>
        <p>He and Arne, a Svolvaer insurance man, kept score closely. They knew all the rules, made sure to count all penalty strokes and handed in their scorecard at the end of the round. There were no mulligans, no gimme putts. ''It's for our handicap,'' Kenneth said. All the golfers from Lofoten kept score like this, and often their first question to me was ''What's your handicap?''</p>
        <p>In Scandinavia, the golf boom of the 90's was handled more formally than it was in the United States, explained the Lofoten club pro, Van MacDougall, an expatriate Canadian who has lived in Sweden and Norway for the last 30 years. Beginning golfers have to earn a ''green card'' in order to play at many courses; that involves passing a basic golfing test as well as a written test on the rules. ''As a result,'' Van said, ''most Scandinavians don't play golf the casual way you're used to playing. Especially up here -- they're all competing with each other, keeping an eye on each other, all the time. You've got to remember it's still new to them, but they've come a really long way in a short time.''</p>
        <p>On the par-3 fourth hole, I put my tee shot into a brook, but after a drop I got down for a bogey four. ''FEE-reh,'' I said in my best approximation of the Norwegian word for four. Kenneth and Arne had a brief conversation in their native language. ''Did you lose your ball in the brook?'' Kenneth asked. Yes, I answered. ''Then that should be a five?'' he said. He explained the rule. I changed my score to a five.</p>
        <p>At 1 a.m., the light was like late afternoon. The wild North Atlantic surged around a little 19th-century navigation cairn on the rocks off the shore. I was out with Ian, who'd just wrecked an excellent round by losing two balls in a row. ''Every time something goes wrong like this,'' he said, ''you look up and see what's around you, and you say, 'Right, what was I upset about?'''</p>
        <p>The next day it rained too steadily to go out on the course. Finally at 2 a.m., I went to bed in my room at the Lofoten clubhouse. But as I lay there awaiting sleep, the room suddenly went bright gold. Outside, the wind had blown the clouds away, and the sky was turquoise, the sunlight turning the mountainsides yellow and pink and green. I went out and stood on the road. The only sounds came from the oystercatcher birds, calling above the steady rush of the waves.</p>
        <p>In Norway, June 23 is Midsummer Day, when families gather to light evening bonfires, have barbecues and revel in the long, warm days and nights that offset the dark northern winters, which, for now, seem so far away. Across Lofoten fires were burning, black smoke curling up into the sky.</p>
        <p>The Hov family and various golf course workers set up a seven-foot-tall pyramid of driftwood and scrap on Hov's little white-sand beach. The workers huddled under umbrellas and poured wine and jibed one another about their various nationalities. Neighbors came with beer and wine and a Frisbee. Hot dogs and whale steaks were cooked on the grill. Someone brought out a guitar, and people gathered round to sing the tunes they knew, from Bob Dylan and Lou Reed to A-Ha and even Wig Wam, a Kiss-like band of thickset Norwegians that represented the country in the 2005 Eurovision song contest.</p>
        <p>At 11:30 the party was winding down, and since my plane wasn't leaving till 5:45 a.m. and the rain was letting up, we drew the logical conclusion, a bit tipsy as we were: there would be one more round of midnight golf.</p>
        <p>In a few minutes we were headed to the first tee, high on a rock overlooking the sea: myself, Ian, Van and Per-Christian, a young course worker who'd grown up a couple of miles down the road. Ian's girlfriend, Ursula, an Irishwoman and a fine golfer herself, was walking the course with us, carrying a box of zinfandel and a wine glass for moral support. The banter was thick and fast -- these were good friends in a remote place united by their enjoyment of golf.</p>
        <p>The moon was full, though we couldn't see it, making the high tide even higher. Sometimes we had to roll up our cuffs as the ocean ran across the little isthmuses that connect the fairways to the greens. Per-Christian looked up and said, ''It feels like it's going to rain.'' How did he know?</p>
        <p>''When you live here all your life, you can sort of sense these things,'' he said sagely. ''Also, I felt some drops a minute ago.''</p>
        <p>We made our way across the course in the drizzle. Ursula kept offering us sips of wine as reward for good shots and as fortification after bad ones. I sliced a tee shot into the ocean and muttered darkly. Van said don't worry; just take a look around you and try to remember what you see.</p>
        <p>I looked around. The sea was swelling against the shore. The snow-capped mountaintops were shrouded in mist. The gulls were drifting slowly above the deep green fairway. And the golfers were standing together, laughing at a joke someone told in the wee-hours light of Lofoten.</p>
        <p>A Midsummer Night's Green</p>
        <p>LOFOTEN</p>
        <p>The first stop for anyone interested in the Lofoten Golf Links is www.lofoten-golf.no/english.php. You can also contact the course at post@lofoten-golf.no or by calling (47) 7607-2002. Like most people in Norway, members of the staff at the course speak excellent English.</p>
        <p>Getting to Hov, site of the golf course, is rather involved. From Oslo, take a train or a flight 520 miles north to Bodo (Norwegian Air Shuttle has nonstops starting at about $200 this summer). From Bodo you can take either Wideroe's 40-minute flight to Svolvaer in Lofoten (lowest price for this month is $146) or the amazingly picturesque six-hour trip aboard a luxurious Hurtigruten coastal steamer ($62 at 6.7 kroner to the dollar), www.hurtigruten.com/index.asp. From Svolvaer, you'll need a taxi, (47) 7607-0600, post@lofoten-taxi.no, or a car rental (through Hertz, Avis or Europcar) for the 45-minute drive to Hov.</p>
        <p>Summertime green fees at the course are about $50 for all the golf you can play in eight hours. There's a full pro shop where clubs are available for rental, and you can eat and drink at the cafe on premises, called, in hoariest golf tradition, Hull 19. (A word of advice: If you have even a single beer, don't drive afterward -- Norwegian D.W.I. and speeding laws are far stricter than they are in North America.) You can also stay at the course, either in a single-room cabin with kitchen and porch, $104 a night, or in the clubhouse itself, a utilitarian former refugee-orientation center shipped down from Kirkenes in the far north. Summertime room rates start at $35 a person; apartments are $82 for a one-bedroom to $150 for three bedrooms.</p>
        <p>MORE MIDNIGHT GOLF</p>
        <p>There are a handful of other places to golf in the midnight sun, but only a select few are farther north than Lofoten Golf Links' 68-degree latitude (the Arctic Circle is at 66 degrees).</p>
        <p>In Norway, there are fine 18-hole courses at Tromso (69 degrees), tromsogolf.no, and Narvik (68 degrees), www.narvikgolf.no, and a good 9-hole course at Harstad (68 degrees, www.harstadgolfklubb.no). At North Cape, the most northerly point in Europe and an inconceivable 280 miles above the Arctic Circle, there is a muddy six-hole course (71 degrees), northcape-golfclub.no, which in late May still had some snow on it.</p>
        <p>The northernmost course in Sweden is in Bjorkliden, the nine-hole Bjorkliden Arctic Golf Course (68 degrees), www.bjorklidensgolfklubb.se, and there is also a nine-hole course at Kiruna (67 degrees), www.kirunagolfklubb.se.</p>
        <p>Finland has two northern courses of note. At the nine-hole Arctic Golf Club in Rovaniemi, the capital of Finnish Lapland (66 degrees), www.golf.fi/arg/english.php, you actually hit over the Arctic Circle itself on the sixth hole. At the 18-hole Green Zone Golf Club, which is actually a bit southerly at 65 degrees, you tee off on the first eight holes in the city of Tornio, then cross the border -- the Tornio River -- to hit the eighth green in Haparanda, Sweden, and go back and forth from one nation to the other three more times. Visit www.golf.fi/mlgk/english.php for the Finnish side of the course and www.haparandagk.com for the Swedish.</p>
        <p>In North America the midnight-golf pickings are slim. The North Star Golf Club in Fairbanks, www.northstargolf.com, is the northernmost course in the United States, but it lacks the drama of some of the Scandinavian courses and lies at a measly 65 degrees latitude. In Canada, there are approximations of golf courses on the tundra well above the Arctic Circle, at Holman in the Northwest Territories. www.arcticcharinn.com/arctic-golfing.htm, or set up temporarily on the pack ice in Nunavut at Kugluktuk, Gjoa Haven and Iqaluit, but without the Gulf Stream to warm things up, it is not the golf played in the Scandinavian north. That will have to wait for a few more years of global warming.</p>
