        <p>Former Gov. George E. Pataki has joined Chadbourne &amp; Parke, a law firm in Manhattan, the firm announced yesterday. Mr. Pataki, whose final term as governor ended last year and who has been widely viewed as a potential Republican presidential candidate, said in an interview that he had not yet made a decision about 2008. ''With Chadbourne, I am still going to be outspoken on policy, and helping to develop some helpful policy ideas for my party and for the country,'' Mr. Pataki said. He also said that he was not surprised that former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City had a large lead over other candidates in some recent opinion polls. ''He has been America's mayor since Sept. 11, and the American people are reacting to the strong leadership that he shows,'' Mr. Pataki said. The former governor will work on energy, environmental and corporate matters, focusing on renewable energy technology.</p>
