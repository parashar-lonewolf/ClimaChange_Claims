        <p>Takeoff is delayed for several minutes when the Global Positioning System locks up, apparently from the cold. Once the plane is airborne, the terrain below is a white swirling desert, sculptured of snow and ice. Then a sudden fog settles in.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty fuzzy today, not a lot of definition,'' Troy McKerral, captain of the DHC-6 Twin Otter, says matter-of-factly. ''It's not a whiteout, but it makes it difficult to pick up any specific spots or places.''</p>
        <p>The complications are not nearly enough to abort the flight to resupply a lead and zinc mine on Little Cornwallis Island, an otherwise uninhabited ice-encased landmass more than 600 miles north of the Arctic Circle, and even farther from the nearest tree.</p>
        <p>For Captain McKerral and his co-pilot, Erin McEvoy, and other Arctic fliers like them, it is just another day at the office.</p>
        <p>For a living they land on trackless floating ice or short gravel runways, sometimes made shorter by a herd of caribou. Their landings are usually uneventful, unless the skis attached to the underbelly of their craft break through the ice, as they are increasingly wont to do with global warming. Then there is the occasional polar bear who lurks around the hangar.</p>
        <p>The pilots buzz through steep foggy fjords to deliver the mail, fresh food and medical supplies to remote Inuit communities. They take explorers and scientific expeditions to the North Pole and medevac women in labor to the area's few hospitals. Basically, they keep Canada whole.</p>
        <p>More than a third of Canada is Arctic wilderness, and the Arctic pilots are vital to the development of the icy north. They are the modern equivalent of the country's fabled rough-and-tumble ''bush pilots,'' men who returned from World War I with enough gumption in their hearts and bile in their bellies to explore and chart the vast territory early last century.</p>
        <p>''When we go on the glaciers, we depend on them to bring us everything for our stays of two, three or four weeks,'' said Jocelyne Bourgeois, a government glacierologist studying global warming in the Arctic. ''And they are the ones who come back to get us.''</p>
        <p>Remote as it is, the Arctic is an area of rapid social and economic development. The dominant Inuit population has evolved in just two generations from migratory hunters dependent on dogs to get around to a more or less modern lifestyle in rural communities where children learn on computers and adults buy food at supermarkets and motor about on snowmobiles, and tourism, mining and transport services generate jobs.</p>
        <p>Such a world would be unthinkable without the pilots flying their Twin Otters, Dash-8's and Douglas DC-3's over vast frozen areas without roads. ''Everybody has something that makes them feel good,'' Mr. McKerral said. ''Mine is bringing people a few extra veggies that day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKerral, 41, was born in Edmonton but has spent the better part of his life in the great white north. His father was also an Arctic pilot. He met his wife, a registered nurse, in the Arctic town of Inuvik. Both his own sons were born there. He says the simple northern life is fine by him.</p>
        <p>''I like the remoteness,'' he said. ''It's unspoiled and, I mean, it's the last frontier. If I take a day trip into a city, I look forward to leaving. Bad drivers keep trying to run me off the road.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. McKerral is not flying he is living in an eight-room crew house with other pilots and flight personnel from Kenn Borek Air Ltd. , who rotate here for a few weeks at a time before heading home for a few weeks in the south.</p>
        <p>The crew house is reminiscent of a college dormitory, and everyone shares the cooking and cleaning chores. The kitchen is decorated with aviation maps and the cupboards are filled with jars of peanut butter, cans of jellied cranberry sauce, and packages of Kraft pizza and Shake 'n Bake. There is a frozen narwhal whale steak in the freezer, a gift from a grateful passenger.</p>
        <p>Part of a plane fuselage sticks out of the ice outside the kitchen window, a vivid reminder of the potential dangers of the job. Resolute Bay is virtually a graveyard of old planes, ranging from a Fairchild F-27 that crashed in the 1970's to an Avro Lancaster World War II bomber converted to deliver mail in the 1950's, before it met an untimely end.</p>
        <p>There is a helicopter fuselage on the ground, as well as the tail of a Douglas DC-3 poking out of the ice like a grave marker. Much of the wreckage can be seen by pilots and passengers while landing here.</p>
        <p>Still, the pilots insist that the grave danger of flying in these parts is now a thing of the past. The introduction of gas turbine engines in the 1960's and of antifreezing additives to fuel in the 1970's made the planes much more reliable. Global positioning revolutionized navigation in the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>The Arctic pilots today are heavily regulated, and employers carefully screen fliers with psychological tests to keep out the wilder crowd that flew around these parts in the early days. The fliers privately talk about bending some rules, like buzzing at low altitudes over remote national parks, flying overweight with extra fuel for long distances, and flying with G.P.S. systems not certified by the government.</p>
        <p>''G.P.S. has taken the romance right out of flying because it's made it so easy,'' said John Downey, 55, an experienced Arctic pilot who flies out of Iqaluit, while waiting between flights in his hanger office.</p>
        <p>But he quickly contradicted himself, while sipping from his cup of coffee. ''It's still exciting to land on a piece of ground with no tracks,'' he said. ''Nobody has been there.''</p>
