        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, Sept. 21) that Representative John T. Doolittle, Republican of California, has introduced a bill to postpone the target date for banning chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, from 1996 to 2000. He claims the connection between CFC's and human health is debatable.</p>
        <p>As the connection between chlorofluorocarbons, the ozone layer and skin cancer is well known, I would like to comment on an other health aspect of these refrigerants, aerosol propellants and solvents.</p>
        <p>Most handbooks (including my own Environmental Engineers' Handbook) state that CFC's are colorless, odorless, nontoxic, noncorrosive, nonflammable and chemically inert. This explains why we felt comfortable in using them as our working fluids in most air-conditioners, freezers and refrigerators. Yet they have another, less known property:</p>
        <p>A few years ago I testified as an expert witness in a trial involving an industrial accident. That case involved a chlorofluorocarbon (Freon-12) used in leak-testing a reactor. The testing was done by filling the tank with freon vapors and by using a halogen sensor to detect leaks.</p>
        <p>When the operator found a leak, he climbed back into the tank to seal the crack. This he did without first thoroughly purging the tank. As he inhaled some freon, his heart went into fibrillation, and he died. Fibrillations are rapid, irregular contractions of the muscle fibers that occur without coordination or synchronism and thereby destroy the heartbeat.</p>
        <p>Therefore, while CFC's are not toxic in the everyday sense of the word, Mr. Doolittle is wrong in claiming that their health effect is debatable. BELA LIPTAK Stamford, Conn., Sept. 21, 1995</p>
