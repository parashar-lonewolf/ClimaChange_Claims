        <p>EVERYBODY gambles in Long Beach, and the bet is always the same. It is that  the ocean will spare, at least for a few decades more, this most developed stretch of Long Island's Atlantic shore, a strikingly vulnerable beachfront on a barrier island, where high-rise residential buildings tower behind a two-mile-long boardwalk that the waves keep breaking nearer and nearer.</p>
        <p>Now, to better the odds against inundation from hurricanes, nor'easters and lesser tempests, Long Beach, a city of 35,000, is very close to signing off on a long-discussed $85.2 million Army Corps of Engineers project that will build dunes and beaches and rebuild groins, all in the name of storm protection.</p>
        <p>For the city, the huge project looks like a bargain. The federal and state governments will pay the largest share of the costs, and the Army Corps will replenish the beach every five years or as needed over the 50-year life of the project.  Long Beach, which is the lowest point on the barrier island, just barely above sea level, will chip in about $5.7 million for initial construction.</p>
        <p>There appears to be little opposition from environmental groups that have opposed groin construction and beach rebuilding to the east, most notably on Fire Island. In fact, one of Long Beach Island's most active environmentalists, Morris H. Kramer of Atlantic Beach, supports the project.</p>
        <p>But, city officials concede, there are some tradeoffs. After several years of construction, which could begin as early as the spring of 2004, the ocean beach, the heart and soul of the city, would be barely recognizable as sand closest to the boardwalk gives way to a new dune.</p>
        <p>The dune would crest at 15 feet above sea level, just two feet lower than the boardwalk planks. Although it would be separated from the boardwalk by a narrow maintenance area, it would still dominate the seaward view. People now reach the beach directly from the boardwalk. After the dune is built, they would get there via fingerlike projections from the boardwalk, projections added to the project at the city's insistence. The fingers would extend to just beyond the seaward toe of the dune. Walkers would be prohibited on the dune itself.</p>
        <p>''Aesthetically, the whole area is going to be a lot different,'' said Robert Raab, the city's commissioner of public works and a project supporter. ''It's going to take some getting used to.''</p>
        <p>Edwin L. Eaton, the city manager, said that dunes built west of the boardwalk, after Hurricane Gloria caused heavy flooding in 1985, had proved their worth. ''Since then we haven't had a drop of water in the streets,'' he said. ''Dunes do work. And I'm a guy who thinks dunes give more character to a beach than a flat expanse of sand.''</p>
        <p>Some city residents are less enthusiastic about the changes in store. ''There's almost a feeling of resignation,'' said Bruce Nyman, a former city manager and Nassau County supervisor. ''It's like doing root canal. You know deep down you need it, but nobody is happy about it. And we know the beach is never going to be the same.''</p>
        <p>In December, Mr. Eaton wrote to the State Department of Environmental Conservation to confirm the city's desire to proceed. But final authorization will be needed from the City Council, and the New York Department of State must also issue a permit.</p>
        <p>Anthony Ciorra, the project director at the Army Corps regional headquarters for New York, said that design changes, including the boardwalk fingers, must be added to a feasibility study the corps completed in 1999. He said that final plans and specifications would be in a cooperative agreement the state and the corps would have to reach before contracts were put out to bid.</p>
        <p>The project covers 6.8 miles of beachfront on the nine-mile-long island. Contractors are expected to pump a mountain of sand from offshore to build a 110-foot-wide oceanfront berm rising 10 feet above sea level. The new 25-foot-wide dune would run in back of the berm parallel to the boardwalk. It would have a footprint, or total width when adjacent planted areas are included, of 75 feet.</p>
        <p>Some residents have worried that the dune might grow still higher, but Mr. Eaton said that maintaining the 15-foot crest would not be difficult. ''The depth of the dune will be what's important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Along the beach, 16 groins would be rebuilt to replace existing wave-battered groins that the city and the corps say are so deteriorated they do little to hold sand on the beaches. Mr. Ciorra said that rocks from the old groins would be used along with new rocks that would probably be trucked to the beach.</p>
        <p>Four new groins would be added at the island's east end at Point Lookout, in the Town of Hempstead, which would pay a $3.15 million share of the entire project's cost.</p>
        <p>Three more groins, what the corps refers to as ''deferred groins,'' would be built to the west of the four new ones if unexpected erosion occurs. The corps added them to the project after a study requested by the town.</p>
        <p>Richard V. Guardino Jr., the town supervisor, said that last summer, the town passed a $40 million bond authorization for park improvements, including money for the project.</p>
        <p>He said that the town was committed to going ahead and that beachfront erosion problems at the town park near Long Beach Island's east end were growing worse. He and others said the western revetment at Jones Inlet, the inlet separating the Long Beach Island from Jones Beach, appeared to be depriving the eroded area of sand.</p>
        <p>Nassau County, which also owns parkland on the east end of Long Beach Island, would pay $105,000 for its share of the project.</p>
        <p>The Village of Atlantic Beach, on the west end of the island, chose not to participate. The village's oceanfront is already protected by groins and is not currently threatened by erosion.</p>
        <p>But the village beaches will probably benefit anyway, since sand generally washes from east to west along the South Shore -- in other words, from Long Beach toward Atlantic Beach.</p>
        <p>Under the cost-sharing plan for the entire project, the Army Corps would pay $55,377,000 and the State Department of Environmental Conservation would pay $20,873,000 for the initial construction. The City of Long Beach would pay $5,691,000.</p>
        <p>The corps describes these amounts as estimates that may be revised before construction begins.</p>
        <p>The Long Beach portion includes the cost of the boardwalk ''fingers.'' Mr. Eaton said the city's share for the project would cost an average taxpayer about $20 a year.</p>
        <p>The corps would dredge up sand offshore and deposit it onto the beach at an estimated cost of $16,658,000 every five years. Local governments would share about 10 percent of this cost. The $16.7 million dredging amount is not included in the $85.2  project total, which represents only construction costs.</p>
        <p>With the federal government reconsidering how much it will pay for coastal storm protection projects, the corps has pressed for local commitments, and local officials are feeling the heat. ''I think that unless we get started we are in danger of losing the money,'' Mr. Guardino said.</p>
        <p>Representative Peter T. King, Republican of Seaford, the project's champion in Washington, said he was optimistic that Congress would appropriate the federal share, but he also issued a warning.</p>
        <p>''Part of the problem is the delay in the last two or three years waiting for local approval,'' Mr. King said. ''There is always the danger that when a project is delayed, the money may not be there when you are ready to go ahead.''</p>
        <p>Congress authorized $46.8 million for the project in 1996 but has appropriated only $9.5 million so far. The most recent appropriation was in 1999. Additional appropriations could not come before 2003.</p>
        <p>State support for the project appears firm. ''We believe the project is important to prevent storm damage,'' said Jennifer Meicht, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>But Theresa Wescott, a spokeswoman for the New York Department of State, said that the department had not yet reviewed the project to see if it was consistent with state and local coastal planning.</p>
        <p>The five-member Long Beach City Council must also give final approval. Councilman Scott K. Nigro, a Long Beach lawyer, said he had reservations about the quality of the dredged sand that would be deposited on the city beach.</p>
        <p>''We don't want a beach full of rocks,'' Mr. Nigro said. He said he would wait until he sees the cooperative agreement between the state and the Army Corps before making a final judgment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer, the environmentalist from Atlantic Beach, said that residents of Long Beach Island had been lulled into a false sense of security because there had been no major storms in recent years.</p>
        <p>''Long Beach needs this protection,'' Mr. Kramer said. He said a calculation he made using federal projections showed that even without a major storm, the ocean would undermine the boardwalk within 23 years and the buildings behind it within 30 years.</p>
        <p>James T. B. Tripp, the general counsel for Environmental Defense,  a private advocacy group based in Manhattan, said that global warming and predictions of ''more unpredictable, more powerful storms on a more frequent basis'' raised the risks.</p>
        <p>''People have got to understand that living on a barrier island is risky,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the city's dense development has also worked in its favor. The state shied away from supporting an interim beach nourishment project on Fire Island, where second homes are the structures most at risk, but it has followed another policy on Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>''The state has taken the position that as an urban barrier island it will be treated differently,'' said Gerard Stoddard, the president of the Fire Island Association. ''They know they are never going to roll back development there.''</p>
        <p>But nobody has suggested that the Army Corps' Long Beach project would stop damage from a major storm. ''We don't belong here,'' said Mr. Eaton, the city manager. ''But the fact of the matter is, we are here now, and that being the case, we are going to have to come to terms with Mother Nature.''</p>
        <p>Army Corps maps show the entire city would be inundated by water in a Class 2 hurricane. Officials said that in more powerful Class 3, 4 or 5 hurricane, the berm and dune might delay the onslaught of water, possibly allowing more time for people to evacuate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kramer contends that the city's longer-term future is bleak. ''You are going to lose it,'' he said. ''It's just a matter of when.''</p>
