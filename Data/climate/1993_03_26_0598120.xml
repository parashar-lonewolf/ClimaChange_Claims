        <p>Four laws that help form the foundation of United States environmental policy are up for renewal in the next two years, and leading environmental advocates in Congress say they intend to use the opportunity to begin redefining how the nation safeguards its air, land and water.</p>
        <p>The Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Superfund law for cleaning up toxic wastes and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for disposing of hazardous chemicals all are under Congressional review. Calls for change from lawmakers focus on their desire for more rigorous science and better analyses of the costs and benefits. Several leading members said that too often Congress has moved from panic to panic and not developed a uniform approach to consider risks.</p>
        <p>"Costs are out of sight," and the benefits from many recent environmental programs are not apparent, said Representative Mike Synar, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of a House subcommittee on the environment. Now, he added, "we have a chance to end the quilt-patch form of environmental lawmaking."</p>
        <p>Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, said current policies had already controlled 90 percent of the pollution. "But now there is increasing recognition of the costs," he said. "It will cost twice as much or three times as much to get the last little percent. Do we want to do that?"</p>
        <p>Others in Congress, notably Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, see it as their job to make sure that cost savings do not compromise safety.</p>
        <p>Several members of Congress said that one lesson of environmental policy-making in the 1980's was that acting on the basis of being safe rather than sorry had unintended consequences. Not the least of them has been many costly rules that are not producing measurable improvements in public health or the environment.</p>
        <p>There is a higher premium on preventing such mistakes in the 1990's, and not only because of scarce financial resources. With even larger global environmental problems becoming apparent from climate change to deforestation, the nation could make even bigger mistakes if it acts aggressively without a measured, careful analysis of the consequences. 4 Laws as One Program</p>
        <p>This week, Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Committee on Environment and Public Works, began a series of hearings to develop a comprehensive and effective environmental program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baucus's effort is the first time a Congressional committee has attempted to consider four separate laws as related parts of a unified program of environmental protection. In an interview, he said that it was too early to make specific recommendations about amending the laws, but he also said that all would undergo some changes.</p>
        <p>Senator Baucus and Representative Synar said their work was guided by two main questions.</p>
        <p>First, what should lawmakers and regulators do after they discover a new environmental problem that seems dangerous -- but before careful scientific analysis has shown the degree of risk? Many environmentalists say waiting for more data might mean that the Government reacts only after people have begun dying.</p>
        <p>Second, what should be done about regulations enacted over the last 15 years that set inordinately strict standards for toxic compounds in air, water or the ground? Most were based on rodent studies now perceived to be flawed, and even scientists who conducted the studies say that as many as two-thirds of the compounds deemed carcinogenic would present no danger to humans.</p>
        <p>William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush Administration, said one problem was the air of crisis that surrounded every new environmental concern. 'Cost Considerations'</p>
        <p>"It is far past time when we become mature enough as a nation to address an environmental issue, mobilize to support it, and do so without acting in an emergency atmosphere," he said. "Not everything is a crisis that has to be corrected tomorrow. And we need to make clear that cost considerations are relevant to any remedy. Cities just aren't going to keep spending more on cleaning up toxic dumps, for instance, than they are on their schools."</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has introduced a bill that would require the Government to amass much stronger scientific proof and convene expert panels to consider a new environmental rule before it is issued.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists call that thinking a recipe for disaster.</p>
        <p>"As a scientist, we always hope to have more research to answer complex questions," said Dr. Adam Finkel of Resources for the Future, an environmental research group in Washington. "But in 1993 we don't have the scientific basis for rejecting the current approach, which says we should be prudent when faced with uncertainty."</p>
        <p>Many experts also assert that, just as damage from forest fires is reversible, so too is damage from many pollutants. At the same time, the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta say that even after a generation of study, there is no confirmed evidence that pollutants are causing epidemics of cancer, birth defects or other chronic diseases.</p>
        <p>The cancer institute says about 500,000 people die from cancer each year. Some institute officials estimate that between 1 and 3 percent of those deaths resulted from environmental pollutants. That would be between 5,000 and 15,000 people. Other scientists say that exposure to the panoply of chemicals in the environment causes other affects in people, among them infertility and nervous system disorders.</p>
        <p>Experts urging the most conservative course say environmental poisons may be causing as many as 15 percent of all cancer. The higher number takes into account research indicating that farm and factory workers exposed to high levels of toxic substances are dying at higher than normal rates from certain types of cancers.</p>
        <p>Senator Moynihan believes research like this can be improved and put to better use.</p>
        <p>"We're entirely capable of moving on to a more productive period of environmental protection that is based on clear factual assessments of what produces risks to human health and the environment," he said.</p>
        <p>If the Government decides to undo existing regulations it faces years of work, following much the same process of hearings and notification periods that led to the rules.</p>
        <p>"Once something is decided as being a threat, it is very hard to recognize that new information suggests that it's not," said Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Whatever new approach Congress or the Clinton Administration takes in the next two years, leading lawmakers say they want to be careful not to weaken a number of regulations that are widely believed to provide valuable protections for public health. High on that list are the landmark environmental laws passed in the 1970's like the Clean Water Act and the laws establishing protection for public lands.</p>
        <p>But environmental experts say many other programs do not offer clear benefits. With this in mind, Mr. Synar and other lawmakers have begun talking about some principles they hope to use as they consider the four major laws that are up for renewal:</p>
        <p>*Require the Government to consider the cost of a regulation before it is issued. Several environmental statutes, including the 1972 Clean Water Act, prohibit the Government from taking costs into account.</p>
        <p>*Increase spending on problems now regarded as more important, like protecting endangered plants and animals, and reducing financing for less dangerous problems, like cleaning up toxic waste sites.</p>
        <p>*Give businesses and cities more flexibility to decide how to comply with environmental standards, ending the expensive and rigid approach demanded under most laws.</p>
        <p>Even as they work toward these goals, the lawmakers said they were fully aware that 15 years from now that it was likely that Congress would look back and see that other kinds of mistakes had been made. But at least, they said, in the 1990's the United States would have begun to take more methodical steps based on better science to solve environmental problems.</p>

        <p>The Series: A Recap of the Articles</p>
        <p>The first article in this series, which appeared on Sunday, reported that leading scientists, economists and Government officials had reached the dismaying conclusion that much of America's environmental program had gone seriously awry. They said the nation's environmental policy had been allowed to evolve in reaction to popular panics rather than in response to sound scientific analyses.</p>
        <p>The article on Monday described how Congress banned the practice of dumping sewage in the sea after trash, industrial waste and worse washed ashore on the East Coast in 1988.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's article described the serious doubts being raised about the validity of rat and mouse studies, long the Government's most important tool for identifying environmental hazards and setting priorities for Federal regulation. Chemicals often have different effects in animals and humans.</p>
        <p>Wednesday's article described how a movement born in Columbus, Ohio, prompted the National League of Cities to call for an update of environmental laws.</p>
