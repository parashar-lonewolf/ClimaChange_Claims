        <p>LEAD:  In Maine, Not Just Small Potatoes</p>
        <p>In Maine, Not Just Small Potatoes</p>
        <p>ONCE they were just small potatoes, abandoned in the field or, more often, exiled to starch factories where they became the gluey stuff of stiff shirt collars.</p>
        <p>Now an innovative marketing strategy has brought new respect to small Maine potatoes. No longer shunned in favor of their larger counterparts, they have re-emerged as gourmet delights called Baby Maines.</p>
        <p>Packaged in designer 30-pound boxes (no potato sack this), sales of Baby Maines have climbed annually since the program began three years ago, said Gregory Jackson, whose South Portland advertising agency came up with the concept.</p>
        <p>Drawing on the food industry's romance with miniature vegetables, the agency sold the idea to the Maine Potato Board, which saw it as a way to salvage the virtually unsaleable spud. ''Historically this hasn't been a popular item,'' said Stanley Greaves, the board's associate director. To get rid of them, he added, ''we would dump them on the starch factories.</p>
        <p>In the first weeks of this year's harvest more small potatoes than expected are coming up, especially in southern Aroostook County, a key potato area. But demand for the smaller variety is increasing as well, driving the wholesale price to about 18 cents a pound as against 13 to 14 cents a pound for larger potatoes.</p>
        <p>Last year almost a million pounds were sold of the small white potatoes, which range in size from golf balls to billiard balls. At the same time, about two billion pounds of Maine's 3- to 4-inch potatoes were sold.</p>
        <p>The only hitch in the program, Mr. Greaves said, is that most packers lack the equipment needed to sort out the small potatoes.</p>
        <p>''About 10 percent of Maine's annual potato crop falls into the Baby Maine category,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''but we'll be lucky if we get 1 percent.''  Philadelphia Loses and Wins</p>
        <p>WHETHER it is called the battle of the bulge or the battle of the badge, this contest's winners were losers.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, the Philadelphia Police Department and Fire Department battled each other and their waistlines in a competition sponsored by Weight Watchers of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The Fire Department was declared the winner last week with an average loss of 2.34 pounds per week per firefighter. Police Department participants lost an average of 1.93 pounds per week.</p>
        <p>Total loss in 12 weeks: 3,312 3/4 pounds - almost a ton and a half. Sixty firefighters lost a total of 1,086 pounds and 166 police officers lost 2,226 3/4 pounds. Officer John Fleming of the 39th Police District lost 52 1/2 pounds - winning the biggest loss. Officer Fleming, now 180 1/2 pounds, has vowed to stay trim.</p>
        <p>The weight-loss competition was the first of its kind between the two departments. Its popularity, a spokesman said, might make it an annual event. It has also stimulated many men and women in uniform to stay slim, he said.</p>
        <p>The winners (or losers) weren't the only beneficiaries. A check for $5,000 in the name of the winning side was presented by Weight Watchers to a scholarship fund for children of police officers or firefighters who have been killed or permanently disabled.  Vermont Says No To Plastic Plates</p>
        <p>POLYSTYRENE foam cups, plates and bowls have been banned in state offices and institutions in Vermont, a step the state says will help the environment and set an example for private industry.</p>
        <p>The state will spend twice as much to buy paper products instead of polystyrene foam, according to Michael P. Wilson, an economist with the Vermont Office of Policy Research and Coordination.</p>
        <p>Plastic foam plates, he said, are manufactured using chlorofluorocarbons, which are thought by scientists to deplete the earth's ozone layer. Other polystyrene foam products, including cups and bowls, are manufactured without chlorofluorocarbons, but, Mr. Wilson said, they are not biodegradable and put a strain on the state's landfills.</p>
        <p>The state has been spending about $13,300 annually on polystyrene foam products used in offices and institutional cafeterias. The switch to paper will double that bill, said a state purchasing agent, Stephen Rixford.</p>
        <p>Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, who announced the ban last week, said the extra cost was well worth it. She said she hoped private industry would follow the state's lead.</p>
        <p>Walter J. Gurzenda, account manager for the Dart Container Corporation of Mason, Mich., which manufactures the polystyrene foam products used by the state, said that plastic foam will decompose when exposed to the ultra-violet rays of the sun. When buried in a landfill, he said, the cups will stay intact indefinitely. But he said the same is true for much waste, including paper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gurzenda said that his company is the largest manufacturer of polystyrene cups in the world and among the leading manufacturers of other types of plastic-foam dinnerware. The company uses chlorofluorocarbons only in making the plastic plates, he said, and it is working on other methods.</p>
        <p>Food containers account for 1 percent of the chlorofluorocarbons used in the nation, he said. Large users are refrigeration, air-conditioning and the computer industry.</p>
