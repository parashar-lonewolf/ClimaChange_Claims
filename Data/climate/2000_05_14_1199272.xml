        <p>TECHNICALLY, the views of Long Island villages that Guy Powers has photographed wouldn't be possible unless street after street of buildings were razed. ''It's the way the block really is, but you can't see it that way when you walk down the block,'' Mr. Powers, 53, of Bellerose Village, said recently. ''It's an impossible view.''</p>
        <p>During the past year, Mr. Powers has taken hundreds of digital photographs of 52 Long Island main streets. He captures the images one storefront and single house at a time. Entire blocks just won't fit in a frame.</p>
        <p>Concentrating on historic neighborhoods and architecturally significant buildings, he strings them together in his computer, printing out main streets in one sweeping image. Mounting the two-dimensional panoramas on canvas and framing them in limited editions adds a painterly aura. Then the digital images are uploaded to his Web site, www .seelongisland.com, an archive of local downtowns.</p>
        <p>''Main Street is an endangered species,'' Mr. Powers said recently, sidestepping his way down Main Street in Mineola as he snapped photographs every few feet. In 15 minutes, he filled three disks -- about 60 images -- capturing every detail. ''The strips malls, I think, become generic. They are good for bigger businesses but they hurt the mom and pop operations.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Powers wants to do is bring out the crowds -- sometimes there's nary a soul strolling down the block he photographs -- but not just to the villages. He plans to someday link the Web sites from the brick and mortar shops on the virtual ones on his Web site.</p>
        <p>''You can bring business to the main street store that has been taken away by the mall,'' he said. ''The site could become a visual Yellow Pages for Long Island and the towns can link their sites to it and it will be a nice directory.'' He plans to include links to museums and performing arts theaters like the Tilles Center in Brookville.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers is editor of The Bellerose Village Bulletin and a commercial artist and photographer. He has a studio in Manhattan and a penchant for shooting pinups, furniture and food. And he had no intention of venturing past the 20 blocks in his own village when he was asked by Mayor Tom Van Buskirk to photograph its 367 homes for a 75th anniversary journal. When Mr. Powers suggested that a panorama of each block would give a better sense of the town, the mayor agreed.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Powers's wife, Carmel, who suggested trying the technique elsewhere. First, they headed to Cold Spring Harbor. Its main street was so long that Mr. Powers created three separate panels, each just over 34 inches long. And he was so charmed by the sense of sanctuary the stretch offered that he starting exploring other local towns.</p>
        <p>Among the villages in Mr. Powers's collection are Greenport, Montauk, Orient Point, Easthampton, Patchogue, Amagansett, St. James, Glen Head, Southampton and Seventh Street in Garden City. He made sure to include landmarks like the Fantasy Theater in Rockville Centre, the Clock Tower in Roslyn, Jobs Lane in Southampton and the firehouse in Farmingdale. But it was Southold that held the most charm.</p>
        <p>''Southold was very interesting because it started with a group of stores, an old-fashioned house with a porch and then a church; that was Americana, like a New England town,'' he said, likening the resulting panorama to a Norman Rockwell painting.</p>
        <p>But he has taken some creative license. In Mineola, where he started at the 1862 bank building that now houses The Davenport Press and Restaurant, Mr. Powers stopped shooting while a Long Island Rail Road train roared past. Then he photographed the empty tracks and put two toy engines from his 9-year-old son Vincent's basement model train collection on the rails. In Great Neck, where he photographed the main drag so early in the morning that only a single car is parked on Middle Neck Road, he plopped in an image of Dixie the Dalmatian and added a graphic of a cat on the roof of a jewelry store.</p>
        <p>''It's a time period that you are capturing,'' he said, pointing out his whimsical tendency to add signs of the times, like Jaguars and lime-green Volkswagen Beetles, to his displays. He plans to complete his millennial archive after shooting an additional 20 villages this year. The panoramas are available at $95 canvas, $145 framed, through the Wilkes Gallery in Northport.</p>
        <p>''When people look back 100 years from now, they'll get a picture of what life was like,'' Mr. Powers said. ''I try to get a block that's near and dear to people in every town.''</p>
        <p>An Energetic Life</p>
        <p>Michael Berthold was talking about the future. Photovoltaics, hydrogen fuel cells for non-polluting, energy-conscious houses. Earthberms, solid east-west walls, radiant slab heat, sky-lighted atriums, insulated attic floors and other ecological, environmentally friendly ways to build.  ''It's the 21st century,'' he told the fifth-year architecture students in his energy conservation class at the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury on a recent evening. ''Energy is the future. Energy conservation technologies must constantly improve, but will they keep pace with the growth and ever-increasing hunger for energy?''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berthold, 49, an architect who grew up in Freeport and resides in Sea Cliff, may not live long enough to find out. He has a stage-four brain cancer known as glioblastoma multiform. The tumor inside his head doubles in size every seven days. He has had brain surgery twice in the last eight months to remove it, but the tumor keeps growing back. He is undergoing radiation and has just started chemotherapy. If it doesn't work, he said, he could be dead by June.</p>
        <p>During his career, Mr. Berthold has designed thousands of residential and commercial projects on Long Island. Since the 1970's, his tendency has been to take a solar/ecological approach to design. When oil prices plummeted in the early 80's and solar design fell out of vogue, he was forced to turn to workaday architecture. Additions, extensions and renovations paid the bills.</p>
        <p>But with oil prices higher than they've been in years, and renewed concerns about global warming and preserving the planet, photovoltaics and hydrogen fuel cells that make and store electricity from natural gas are the rage. The Long Island Power Authority is beginning to experiment with photovoltaic cell panels that can be mounted on a rooftop to convert solar energy into electricity.</p>
        <p>''I have been waiting 20 years for this kind of work,'' Mr. Berthold said, instructing his students to redesign the homes they live in an energy-efficient manner as a final project. ''If I can survive and actually live, maybe I can get back to work and do 21st-century work. I know all this is going to change in the next 100 years. Buildings use 30 percent of the energy in this country.''</p>
        <p>Because he is on disability, Mr. Berthold is no longer paid as a part-time professor. So he recently created the Michael Berthold Conservation Design Award at the New York Institute of Technology. The money he would have received to teach will now go to an architecture student who shares Mr. Berthold's passion for ecologically friendly design.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berthold's own pet conservation project is the 400-square-foot earth tone shingle studio-garage he built two years ago to blend in with the small Victorian home he shares with his wife, Laura Campbell, 47, a parent educator, and his two daughters -- Kate, 16, and Emily, 11. That's where, until his illness forced him to stop recently, he did all his designing.</p>
        <p>Before his cancer was discovered last summer, he added to the roof solar water collectors, salvaged from his mother's house 25 years ago, that store the heat in the studio's radiant slab floor. The solar collectors also provide hot water to the house all summer long. On top of the studio is a cupola that allows ventilation and brings in natural light.</p>
        <p>Heating, cooling, light and electrical costs for the year have been under  $100, Mr. Berthold said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berthold, who was self-employed, has no pharmaceutical insurance. He must pay for his own chemotherapy. The tab is $2,000 a month. The Sea Cliff United Methodist Church has started the Michael Berthold Fund to help with his expenses. Ms. Campbell has had to stop working to care for her husband. Sometimes, when he's feeling up to it, Mr. Berthold still plays the drums with his local band, Midlife Crisis.</p>
        <p>Anxious to continue teaching future architects about energy-conscious design, he is hoping the treatments will stunt the tumors' growth. ''I have good work to do in this century,'' Mr. Berthold said. ''I just hope for our children and the future of our children's children that energy conservation will mean a change over to photovoltaics and hydrogen fuel cells, the clean fuels of the future.''</p>
