        <p>TWENTY years after the United States and several European nations restricted the use of lead in gasoline to reduce levels of the pollutant in the soil and air, there is direct evidence that the policies are paying off on a global scale: concentrations of lead have dropped significantly in the Greenland ice cap.</p>
        <p>The study, reported last week in Nature, also showed the levels of zinc and cadmium, pollutants produced in the burning of coal and the manufacture of iron and steel, have also dropped, although at a lesser rate than lead over the same period.</p>

        <p>TWENTY years after the United States and several European nations restricted the use of lead in gasoline to reduce levels of the pollutant in the soil and air, there is direct evidence that the policies are paying off on a global scale: concentrations of lead have dropped significantly in the Greenland ice cap.</p>
        <p>The study, reported last week in Nature, also showed the levels of zinc and cadmium, pollutants produced in the burning of coal and the manufacture of iron and steel, have also dropped, although at a lesser rate than lead over the same period.</p>
        <p>The lead concentrations measured in the Greenland snow were 7.5 percent lower than the 1970 levels, according to the study led by Dr. Claude F. Boutron, a researcher at the Laboratoire de Glaciologie et Geophysique de l'Environement in St. Martin- d'Heres, France. The current lead levels approximate the concentration in Greenland during the early 1900's, before widespread use of alkyl-leaded petroleum.</p>
        <p>Although several studies in the past few years have demonstrated a drop in lead concentration in the United States since the 1960's, the recent results provide some of the strongest evidence that the lead restrictions are having a global effect, said Dr. Joel Schwartz, a senior scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>But, said Dr. Schwartz, "We still have a long way to go. Even though we have taken the lead out of gasoline, there is still a lot of contamination." Lead, a highly toxic metal, is still used in the United States in several areas, such as the manufacture of batteries, and is a byproduct of the smelting of metals.</p>
        <p>And while some nations in the Northern Hemisphere have followed the lead of the United States in reducing lead use, most have taken little or no action, said David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Leaded gasoline, which was introduced in the 1930's to help car engines run smoother, came under government regulation in the United States in 1970 after a series of studies showed that long-term exposure can cause neurological problems. The phase-out of leaded gasoline will be complete in 1995.</p>
        <p>By digging deep into the core of the ice cap, scientists had previously determined that the level of lead concentrations had increased approximately 300 percent since 800 B.C. But 99 percent of the lead found in the Greenland snow is a product of human activities that originated in the middle part of the 20th century, the study said.</p>
        <p>The study reported that the levels of zinc and cadmium were reduced by approximately 2.5 percent over the 20-year period. Despite a lack of governmental restrictions on the emissions of these two elements, scientists said that improved manufacturing processes for metal, steel and iron were responsible for the decline.</p>
        <p>Zinc and cadmium are also a byproduct of the incineration of garbage and the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
