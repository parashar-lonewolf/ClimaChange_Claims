        <p>LEAD: The Senate, upholding the President and its own leadership by the slenderest of margins, rejected a proposal today for special aid to coal miners who would lose their jobs if clean air legislation was passed by Congress.</p>
        <p>The Senate, upholding the President and its own leadership by the slenderest of margins, rejected a proposal today for special aid to coal miners who would lose their jobs if clean air legislation was passed by Congress.</p>
        <p>The $500 million special assistance package was rejected by a vote of 50 to 49.</p>
        <p>At least two Senators who said they planned to vote for the proposal reversed themselves after they were told by the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, that President Bush would veto the clean air bill if the proposal was included.</p>
        <p>A veto would have killed the compromise bill negotiated between the White House and Senate leaders and probably would have ended the prospects for clean air legislation this session. The White House said the provision for financial help for miners would make the clean air legislation too costly.</p>
        <p>Quick Action Seen on Bill</p>
        <p>The defeat of the amendment, which was offered by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, the former majority leader, removes the last major obstacle to Senate passage of the legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act of 1970. Final action in the Senate is expected by Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The House is still drafting its clean air bill and has not yet addressed the acid rain issue and the problem of miners or other workers who might lose jobs. The miners' jobs would be in jeopardy because the provisions dealing with acid rain would encourage utilities to shift to a type of coal that would reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>Biden Changes His Mind</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Byrd appeared to have the necessary votes to carry his amendment. But Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. a Delaware Democrat who supported the proposal to assist the miners, voted against it after he left the floor during the vote to take a call from Mr. Sununu.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biden reported after the vote that the White House chief of staff warned him that the amendment would break the compromise agreement between the White House and Senate leaders and ''guaranteed the President would veto the bill.''</p>
        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said in a telephone interview that he decided to vote against the amendment after Mr. Sununu had told him its passage would compel a Presidential veto. ''That wouldn't have been in the interest of my state, which is suffering from air pollution,'' Mr. D'Amato said.</p>
        <p>Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, who Mr. Byrd said would have voted to help the miners, was attending a funeral and did not vote.</p>
        <p>Thirty-seven Democrats and 12 Republicans voted for the amendment, while 16 Democrats and 34 Republicans voted against it.</p>
        <p>The Byrd amendment was opposed by the majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the minority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who both argued that providing special assistance to the coal miners would set a bad precedent and that workers in other industries would demand the same relief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd, who remains one of the most influential members of the Senate, made an extraordinary personal effort to win passage of his amendment. After he lost, he told reporters: ''I made the supreme effort. I did everything I could and, therefore, I don't feel badly about it.''</p>
        <p>The Senate bill, as well as legislation being prepared in the House, would require require a reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions of 10 million tons a year, which, along with nitrogen oxides, is the chief component of acid rain. All the reductions would be made by coal-fired power plants, most of whuch are in nine Midwestern states.</p>
        <p>The reductions could be made by installing devices on smokestacks to remove sulfur. But a less expensive approach likely to be adopted by many utilities is to shift from coal with a high sulfur content to low-sulfur coal. Such a shift is expected to result in the closing of a number of high-sulfur coal mines, particularly in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.</p>
