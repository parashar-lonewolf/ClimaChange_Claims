        <p>Re ''Alaska, No Longer So Frigid, Starts to Crack, Burn and Sag'' (front page, June 16): Even as Alaska experiences the adverse effects of climate change, the state is the second-highest producer of crude oil in the United States, after Texas.

        <p>Re ''Alaska, No Longer So Frigid, Starts to Crack, Burn and Sag'' (front page, June 16): Even as Alaska experiences the adverse effects of climate change, the state is the second-highest producer of crude oil in the United States, after Texas. According to the E.P.A., the burning of crude oil's refined products is the greatest single contributor to rising temperatures.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's continued failure to address the causes of global climate change will lead to more perverse outcomes in Alaska. The Minerals Management Service plans to offer up untouched offshore areas in Alaska for oil drilling including lower Cook Inlet, which would contribute to climate change and increase the risk of oil spills in an area still not fully recovered from the Exxon Valdez spill.</p>
        <p>While forgoing this drilling will not eliminate climate change, wouldn't our human energy be better directed toward promoting alternatives to oil?</p>
