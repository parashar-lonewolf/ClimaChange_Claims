        <p>As cornstalks lie withered on baked soil and dams show perilously low levels of water, southern Africa is in the grip of its worst drought this century, and meteorologists warn that it is spreading north to engulf the entire eastern side of the continent.</p>
        <p>While drought is commonplace in certain regions of Africa, weather and food experts say this year's dry spell is extraordinary for its sweep through food-exporting countries, which normally escape severe drought. Kenya Needs Imports</p>
        <p>"There is now a major drought from the Cape to Cairo that is really a serious, serious matter," said Harold Norton, the representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Kenya, who has worked in Africa for the last 25 years. "All the countries from South Africa to East Africa, all the way to Cairo, will be importing grains this year."</p>

        <p>As cornstalks lie withered on baked soil and dams show perilously low levels of water, southern Africa is in the grip of its worst drought this century, and meteorologists warn that it is spreading north to engulf the entire eastern side of the continent.</p>
        <p>While drought is commonplace in certain regions of Africa, weather and food experts say this year's dry spell is extraordinary for its sweep through food-exporting countries, which normally escape severe drought. Kenya Needs Imports</p>
        <p>"There is now a major drought from the Cape to Cairo that is really a serious, serious matter," said Harold Norton, the representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Kenya, who has worked in Africa for the last 25 years. "All the countries from South Africa to East Africa, all the way to Cairo, will be importing grains this year."</p>
        <p>To feed its own people, Kenya, which usually exports food, will have to import 500,000 tons of food this year and ask for humanitarian aid to feed refugees from Somalia, Mr. Norton said.</p>
        <p>With the nations of the former Soviet Union making bigger than ever demands on the West's food supply, Mr. Norton and officials of the United States Agency for International Development said allocations of food aid would have to be adjusted if the normally self-sufficient African countries are to be helped.</p>
        <p>"The United States is beginning to reassess food needs worldwide in order to help southern Africa," said Ted Morse, the director of the United States Agency for International Development's office in Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>The failure of rains, accompanied by unseasonally hot temperatures for the planting seasons in South Africa and Zimbabwe, means that these two food-exporting countries will have to import vast amounts of grain for the first time in memory, food experts said.</p>
        <p>In Zimbabwe, the hardest-hit country, acute water shortages are threatening the shutdown of industries centered around the town of Bulawayo, and schools have already started to close.</p>
        <p>In the arid north of Kenya at Marsabit, cattle belonging to the nomadic Turkana and Boran tribes, are dying, and thirsty people stand by the roadside begging for water from passing vehicles.</p>
        <p>An urgent warning by the World Meteorological Organization's drought-monitoring center for eastern and southern Africa says the coming seasonal rains will be weak in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia. The head of the center, Dr. Workneh Degefu, said poor rains in Ethiopia would also affect Egypt because the major source of the Nile River is in western Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>The Sudan, which from time to time exports grain, will be importing food this year because of drought, Mr. Norton said.</p>
        <p>Weather experts said the poor rainfalls resulted from the meteorological phenonmenon known as El Nino, which refers to unusually warm waters in the Pacific Ocean, which affect global atmospheric circulation.</p>
        <p>Peter Usher, the head of the climate-change unit of the United Nations Environmental Program based in Nairobi, said that when El Nino occurs, there is often drought in northwest Brazil, East Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia.</p>
        <p>So far, there is no evidence to suggest that global warming is affecting the weather in Africa, Mr. Usher said. "Shorter-term weather phenomena like El Nino are able to have a greater effect than global warming in Africa."</p>
        <p>The long rains that usually come in December and January to aid planting in southern Africa did not materialize, he said. And the short rains, meaning more violent, abrupt rains across equatorial eastern Africa, were very weak in the latter part of last year, he said. Food Reserves Already Low</p>
        <p>In southern Africa, the drought has hit at a time when food reserves were already low because of poor harvests last year. The Southern African Development Co-ordination Council said in a bulletin in January that all or parts of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe were affected by the drought and were suffering food shortages.</p>
        <p>The region may have to import more than seven million tons of food from August this year to May 1993, compared with normal imports of two million tons, according to F.A.O. and A.I.D. estimates.</p>
        <p>South Africa alone, usually the world's sixth-largest exporter of grain, will have to import four million tons of corn, according to the F.A.O. Estimates of the corn crop run as low as 25 percent of normal.</p>
        <p>In neighboring Namibia, the deputy director of agriculture, Lutz Matthiesen, said 80 percent of the commercial corn crop had been lost. "Whether widespread rains fall in March and April or not will only make a marginal difference to the situation," he said.</p>
        <p>But in Zimbabwe, where it is already difficult to buy corn meal, the dietary staple, the effects of the drought have extended far beyond the crops.</p>
        <p>In Bulawayo, the western industrial center, water rationing in homes permits a little over 420 quarts a day. "That allows a small bath and some left over for washing," said Daniel Kinnear, an environmental expert who lives there. "People are obeying the rationing because they are scared."</p>
        <p>Only 12 weeks of water supply is left in the local reservoirs, and industries, including the big textile mills, face closure, officials say.</p>
        <p>The once vibrant Zimbabwean dairy industry is in ruins.</p>
        <p>"In just two years we have been reduced from a sophisticated first-world dairy industry to one of subsistence and mere survival," said Alan Burl, the president of the Commercial Farmers Union.</p>
        <p>About 30 percent of the commercial cow herd may be slaughtered because stockfeeds will have to be imported and thus will be too expensive, said Doug Pascoe, the director of the National Association of Dairy Farmers.</p>
        <p>And Zimbabwe's food shortage has a ripple effect on surrounding countries. Mozambique, for instance, has relied on Zimbabwe's corn to feed the large number of people displaced by the civil war, and food for more than one million Mozambican refugees in southern Malawi has come from Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>Farther north, in Kenya, the drought has aggravated already low farm production caused by marketing or pricing factors, many say. In the capital, Nairobi, the effects of drought have been clear for the last month. Butter has disappeared from the grocery stores, and milk is difficult to buy because of low output in the dairy industry. Many residential homes are without water as the water authority tries to distribute what is left of the supply fairly.</p>
