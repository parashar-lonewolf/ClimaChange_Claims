        <p>LEAD: ''Forever Plaid,'' Stuart Ross's zany new revue at Steve McGraw's (158 West 72d Street), spoofs the same insipid 1950's pop iconography that recent cabaret shows featuring mythical groups named the Taffetas and the Cardigans have celebrated with a more subdued tongue-in-cheek humor.</p>
        <p>''Forever Plaid,'' Stuart Ross's zany new revue at Steve McGraw's (158 West 72d Street), spoofs the same insipid 1950's pop iconography that recent cabaret shows featuring mythical groups named the Taffetas and the Cardigans have celebrated with a more subdued tongue-in-cheek humor.</p>
        <p>The quartet that is the focus of the show consists of four archetypal squares who met in their high school's audio-visual club and attended the Osterizer School of Harmonic Theory, where they learned how to ''blend, puree, mix and chop'' their sound. In early 1964, just as they were about to establish themselves professionally, they were killed in a collision with a bus full of teen-age Beatlemaniacs. Their posthumous appearance, we are told, is being made possible by a warp in the astral plane in combination with a hole in the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>An evening that begins as a concert with an expert parody of the Four Aces' version of ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' becomes increasingly surreal, as the Plaids wield plungers like stand-up microphones while singing an early Crew Cuts hit, hammer a spoon on a ketchup bottle to create the sound effects for ''Chain Gang,'' and don wide-brimmed sombreros for a kitschy calypso medley. The antic nonsense reaches its peak in a three-minute parody of ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' in which they become ventriloquists, fire-eaters and jugglers as well as singers.</p>
        <p>Because the Plaids - Stan Chandler, Guy Stroman, Gabriel Barre and Jason Graae - are all experienced actors and singers, and because the arranger, James Raitt, is well versed in the Mitch Miller tradition of 50's pop, the musical caricatures have a wicked accuracy. As staged by Mr. Ross, who also wrote the dialogue, ''Forever Plaid'' has an impromptu, chaotic feel. But on the tiny stage of Steve McGraw's, where the show plays most weekends, the free-for-all frat-house exuberance tends to work in its favor.</p>
