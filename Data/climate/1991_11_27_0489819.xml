        <p>IT used to be so easy. The expensive stuff was in the regular bottles and the cheap stuff was in the jugs.</p>
        <p>Today, Hearty Burgundy, once the proud if modestflag-bearer of the Gallo line, is sitting there on the shelf in the same-size bottle as Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and you can't even unscrew the cap.</p>
        <p>The jug wine market has been shrinking for more than a decade. The wine industry and its gurus tell us that everyone is moving upscale. The jug, they intone, is declasse.</p>
        <p>They may be right -- though they have been wrong about so many things in recent years, one wonders. Still, the numbers don't lie: jug sales are off. For purposes of this column, we will lapse into industry jargon: jug wines are called generics; classier wines, identified by their grape variety, are called varietals.</p>
        <p>Generics accounted for 81 percent of all California table wine shipments in 1985, according to Impact, a trade publication, and varietals for 19 percent. By 1990, generics had slipped to 60 percent of the California market and, in the total American table wine market, they accounted for 48 percent, the first time they failed to make up at least half of the country's table wine.</p>
        <p>The total market for California table wine last year, in terms of shipments, was 111.4 million cases. Still, 60 percent of that is almost 67 million cases of wine. One could safely say that reports of the death of jug wine may be premature.</p>
        <p>Much of the varietal surge of the last few years has come from the product known as white zinfandel. In fact, one of every three bottles of California varietal wine now sold is white zinfandel. The wine is not white, of course, but, depending on who makes it, one of several shades of pink. In the industry's jargon, it is a "blush" wine. This denotes something more than white but less than rose.</p>
        <p>Because the predominant grape in white zinfandel is zinfandel, the industry defines it as a varietal. But with its added sweetness and slight carbon dioxide fizz, it is closer in style to such successful Gallo oddballs as Blush Chablis, Chablis Blanc and Red Rose, all of which are defined as generics.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, the E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery continues to have a formidable lock on the generic wine business, even though its brands have suffered fairly serious market erosion in recent years. The top three generics in 1989, the last year for which figures are available, were all Gallo wines and all white: Carlo Rossi Chablis, Gallo Chablis Blanc and Carlo Rossi Rhine. Of the top 15 generics in that year, Gallo wines were also in 7th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th and 15th places.</p>
        <p>The gap between generics and varietals has narrowed in other ways. A 750-milliliter bottle of Gallo's Limited Release Hearty Burgundy lists for $2.75; low-end chardonnays and sauvignon blancs and zinfandels often are discounted for $3.99 or $3.50. Trading up is not the quantum leap it once might have been; Californians like Sebastiani, Glen Ellen, Sutter Home, Fetzer Vineyards' Bel Arbors line and Robert Mondavi's Woodbridge line have democratized the once-elite end of the wine business with their usually well-made, low-priced varietals. These "fighting varietals" -- read competitive for fighting -- sell from $3 to about $6.</p>
        <p>There is also a separate category of generics that, while not quite jug wines -- most of them have never been bottled in jugs -- served to blur even further the line between jugs and varietals. They are low-priced blends made by well-known wineries, and some not-so-well-known, that often outperform more prestigious varietals. Marietta Cellars nonvintage Old Vine Red is such a wine; so is Liberty School's 1990 Three Valley Select, a white. The first, a blend of zinfandel, petite sirah and carignan, sells for around $4.50 for 750 mililiters; the second, which consists of muscat, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay, has been discounted for as little as $3.50. Liberty School is a second label of Caymus Vineyards in the Napa Valley.</p>
        <p>More and more wineries make generic blends that are sold simply as red or white wine or, in a few instances, echoing the jugs, burgundy and chablis. Among these are Beaulieu Vineyards 1989 burgundy, Raymond Vineyards 1987 Vintage Select Red, M. J. Vallejo California Red, Hop Kiln Winery's Marty Griffin's Big Red, Heitz Cellars' Ryan's Red, Haywood Winery's Spaghetti Red, Seghesio Winery's Sonoma Red and Fetzer Vineyards' Premium Red. Whites include Wente Brothers California Chablis, Beaulieu's Chablis, Pat Paulsen's Refrigerator White and Glen Ellen's Proprietor's Reserve California White. These generics -- no one bothers to call them "fighting generics" -- are in the same price range as the low-priced varietals, from $3 to about $6.</p>
        <p>The wine industry is well aware of the old marketing saw about selling the sizzle, not the steak; the perception of quality is all important. Clever restaurateurs, recognizing that customers will not buy the cheapest wine on the list, periodically raise the price of that wine and place it third or fourth on their wine list so it will sell.</p>
        <p>The image of jug wines is more of a problem than the wines themselves. Indeed, the wines have improved dramatically in recent years. If you haven't tasted Hearty Burgundy in a while, you are in for a surprise. A mild surprise, but a surprise nonetheless. But if the consumer has an attitude about jugs, put the wine in something smaller, 750 milliliters or a liter, and, if possible, sell it as a varietal.</p>
        <p>It is not easy to invent new varieties of grapes, but new varietals are a different matter. Have you ever heard of white grenache? You will. Twenty years ago, it didn't exist, except perhaps in a laboratory. In 1987, according to Impact, it accounted for 1 percent of California varietal shipments. Last year, it accounted for 9 percent or about four million cases.</p>
        <p>Well, why not? After all, they make a very interesting white wine from pinot noir. Been doing it for years. It's called Champagne. TASTINGS Joseph Phelps Vineyards, Vin de Mistral Syrah, 1986, Napa Valley. About $13.</p>
        <p>Well before Rhone Valley-style wines became fashionable in California, Joseph Phelps was making one. Syrah has been a Phelps wine since the days when it had to be explained that the fine syrah grape was not to be confused with the petite sirah (known in France as the durif, and not highly regarded). Now Mr. Phelps has come out with a line of Rhone-style wines called Vin de Mistral, incorporating his syrah into it. This is the grape of the fine northern Rhone Hermitage and Cote-Rotie and, with shiraz, of a variety of tasty Australian wines. Mr. Phelp's syrah is no Hermitage, however. It's less intense than the French wine, but there is plenty of flavor here, good depth, good color and a nice bouquet; a respite from standard Calfornia fare, and a worthy competitor for some overrated zinfandels. And if you are unfamiliar with the Rhone wines of Etienne Guigal and Paul Jaboulet, this a fine introduction.</p>
