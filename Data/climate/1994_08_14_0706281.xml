        <p>Edward P.

        <p>Edward P. Bass, the billionaire whose Biosphere 2 project in the Arizona desert went awry amid secrecy and intrigue, is completing a major restructuring of the $150 million effort by forging close ties to Columbia and Harvard Universities and throwing open the glass domes to the scientific world.</p>
        <p>For Columbia and Harvard, it is as if a shiny new scientific toy suddenly fell into their laps. "It's a whole new ball game," said Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a prominent geochemist at Columbia who is assisting in the renewal effort. "They're really interested in good science. There's a wonderful opportunity to do some really good stuff with the place."</p>
        <p>Only time will tell whether the project's credibility, which sagged despite earlier shake-ups, can be restored. But the Ivy League ties should go a long way toward reassuring potential teams of scientific users. Already some prominent scientists who abandoned the seven-year-old project as misguided have returned to work on its behalf. Announcement Due Tomorrow</p>
        <p>The miniature, glass-enclosed world in the desert, designed partly for ecological studies and partly as a utopian refuge, is now inhabited by seven people, who have been inside for about half a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bass is to announce tomorrow that Columbia University and Biosphere 2 have formed a nonprofit group that will develop a scientific plan for the three acres of domes and create an institute through which universities, private teams and national laboratories can join in the research.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bass has also named a new scientific director, Dr. Bruno D. V. Marino, formerly a biogeochemist at Harvard University. Until this month, Dr. Marino directed a Harvard project to study fossil plants for clues to past atmospheres and climates, the better to judge the likelihood of future climate change.</p>
        <p>In preparation for new goals and administrators, the current crew of five men and two women in the Biosphere 2 domes is to end its stay next month, instead of next January, as previously planned. The first crew entered in September 1991 and left two years later, thin and tight-lipped about swarms of ants and cockroaches that had bedeviled its effort to mimic the earth's natural harmonies. An Agenda Open to Anything</p>
        <p>The new agenda is so completely open-ended, project officials say, that no consideration is off the table, not even the possibility of eliminating human crews from the domes and instead focusing on the subtle interactions of fauna and flora.</p>
        <p>The executive committee of the nonprofit research group consists of Dr. Marino; Dr. Broecker, of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.; Dr. Michael M. Crow, vice provost of Columbia, and Stephen K. Bannon, an investment banker who is acting head of Space Biosphere Ventures, the parent company of the Biosphere 2 project.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the research group's science committee is Dr. Michael B. McElroy, chairman of the department of earth and planetary sciences at Harvard. A Shaky Past</p>
        <p>Perched on an arid hillside northeast of Tucson, Biosphere 2 at its start was a quirky hodgepodge of style and substance, smoke and theater, openness and secrecy. Skeptics dismissed it as a pantheon of New Age flakiness. Some said any science was a facade for a survivalist cult bent on outliving what it saw as the impending death of planet Earth, which the project's organizers referred to as Biosphere 1.</p>
        <p>Some of the nation's top scientists said the project's leaders had neither the academic credentials nor the scientific experience to run so ambitious an endeavor. And a dozen or more project workers quit amid personality clashes and other internal disputes.</p>
        <p>In a legal showdown, Mr. Bass, the Texas oil heir who is the project's patron, had the top six officers of the operating company relieved of their duties in April. Ever since, the project has floated in scientific limbo.</p>
        <p>The new research group is taking a number of quick steps to put the place aright. A dozen or more white papers, written by prominent experts from around the world, are being commissioned to help spell out the best possible research. A study will start immediately to pinpoint sources of the domes' elevated levels of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas whose workings in the atmosphere are poorly understood.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit research group, financed by Mr. Bass, will also issue planning grants for various studies, will award three postdoctoral fellowships for research and will submit study proposals to Federal agencies for funds. Officials hope the research program will become financially self-sufficient in the long run.</p>
        <p>One prominent scientist who soured on Biosphere 2 was Dr. Walter H. Adey, director of the Smithsonian Institution's marine systems laboratory and the creator of Biosphere 2's miniature ocean. He is now returning to the project as a consultant and to participate in the deliberations of the research group.</p>
        <p>Another member of the research group is Dr. John C. Mutter, the acting director of the Lamont-Doherty observatory, whose 500 employees play a leading role in analyzing the workings of the earth.</p>
        <p>About two years ago, Lamont-Doherty and Dr. Broecker began forming a close but unpaid relationship with the Arizona project, discovering the cause of a mysterious oxygen drop that had endangered the lives of crew members and forced its leaders to inject huge amounts of oxygen into the domes. The problem, it turned out, was a glut of organic material like peat and compost in the soil inside the domes. That material had set off an explosive growth of oxygen-eating bacteria.</p>
        <p>For science, the blunder has a silver lining: the bacteria produce a surfeit of carbon dioxide in the domes, perhaps giving a glimpse of earth's fate. The future atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide from human activities is seen as perhaps warming the planet and stimulating the growth of plants, which are consumers of carbon dioxide. The Arizona project thus might serve as a kind of biological time machine.</p>
