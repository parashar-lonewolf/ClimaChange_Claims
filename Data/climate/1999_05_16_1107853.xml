        <p>SINCE Colonial times, winter flounder have generally been so plentiful in Niantic Bay that an angler could quickly fill the bottom of a small boat with the odd-looking but popular flatfish.</p>

        <p>SINCE Colonial times, winter flounder have generally been so plentiful in Niantic Bay that an angler could quickly fill the bottom of a small boat with the odd-looking but popular flatfish.</p>
        <p>But since the 1970's the catches have been noticeably dwindling, and some environmentalists blame it on the Northeast Utilities nuclear plants at Millstone Point, on the east shore of the bay, which suck in millions of gallons of water each minute -- and many billions of fish larvae over the years -- in the process of cooling the reactors.</p>
        <p>''I've been fishing in Niantic Bay since I was 10, and back then we used to fill bushel baskets with flounder,'' said Martin T. O'Rourke of Willimantic who was recently fishing in the bay. ''Now, you're lucky if you catch three if you stay out all day.''</p>
        <p>Late last month, Judge Robert Hale of Connecticut Superior Court in Hartford agreed that the environmentalists might have a case.</p>
        <p>Despite the impending approval of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission that Millstone 2 could restart after sitting idle for three years because of safety problems, the judge ordered that the plant wait until after the flounder spawning season had ended.</p>
        <p>Though the judge has since lifted the injunction, critics of the power plants said that the eight days that Millstone 2 remained shut down because of the judge's order has created ripples that will spread out from Niantic Bay and around the world.</p>
        <p>''It's an issue that is still in its infancy, but it will continue, and grow,'' said William N. Smith, executive director of the Long Island-based Fish Unlimited, one of the organizations that filed suit against Millstone. ''You can already see signs that the nuclear industry in general is watching this fight very closely. They realize how vulnerable they are, that this is something they're going to have to deal with. This is their Achilles' heel.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Burton, the Redding, lawyer who argued the case for the environmentalists in court, said that the preliminary court order barring the restart of the plant would encourage environmental groups to take action against other industries anywhere in the world that kill fish through large cooling water intakes.</p>
        <p>''For eight days, Millstone 2 was shut down for the sake of winter flounder larvae,'' Ms. Burton said. ''That is unprecedented in the history of nuclear power in this country, and was an absolutely amazing victory by itself.''</p>
        <p>Already, she said, officials from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency are talking about putting stiffer standards in place for industrial cooling water intakes to prevent fish larvae from being killed. ''This is now an issue we've put on the front burner for environmental groups around the country,'' Ms. Burton said.</p>
        <p>Northeast Utilities had fought to bring the plant back on line after a long shutdown for safety issues. The company estimates that each month the 880-megawatt reactor is out of service costs it $20 million. The company said it was now preparing the plant for the weeks-long restart process.</p>
        <p>Joseph T. Pillittere, a spokesman for Northeast Utilities, said the company was considering installing a system that would return to the bay adult fish caught on the intake screens, and it would continue the environmental monitoring program that has provided state fisheries experts with what they call some of their most comprehensive data on a specific winter flounder population.</p>
        <p>''We want to become the best, whether that has to do with operations or the environment,'' Mr. Pillittere said. He also said it was the company's contention that overfishing of adult flounder, not the destruction of larvae, had been the greatest contributor to the decline in the fish population. He said it was also important to recognize that the nuclear plants allow the state to avoid the use of oil-  or coal-burning plants. ''If we didn't have nuclear, we'd have to be using fossil fuels, and that has its own associated environmental effect, in terms of air emissions.''</p>
        <p>Anglers agreed that the flounder population in Niantic Bay is in trouble.</p>
        <p>Arnold F. Costello of Waterford, who was putting his boat into the water last weekend, said the problem affected all species.</p>
        <p>''I used to catch 8-  and 10-pound weakfish in the river, and 30-  or 40-pound striped bass between the bridges,'' Mr. Costello said ''The last time I caught a weakfish was probably 30 years ago. My grandson here, he probably doesn't even know what a weakfish looks like.''</p>
        <p>But anglers seem split over the cause of the decline.</p>
        <p>''We've seen commercial boats dragging in eight feet of water right in the bay,'' Mr. Costello said. ''They do at least as much damage as Millstone, but no one is trying to shut them down.''</p>
        <p>Wayne H. Maheu, who owns a summer house in Niantic, said he never believed the plant could cause such problems either, until he saw some of the statistics on fish mortality that came out during the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''Then you start to wonder -- could it be true?'' Mr. Maheu said.</p>
        <p>Joseph B. Young of Meriden, as he prepared his boat for a day on the water, said it was easy to blame overfishing or Millstone, but a look around the bay shows a lot of residential development, so there are also issues such as sewage runoff and sedimentation that could be affecting the fish population.</p>
        <p>''The fact is, everyone wants air-conditioning and all kinds of appliances -- where do they think all that electricity is going to come from?'' Mr. Young said. ''I think there's a lot more than Millstone affecting the fish, but even if it was Millstone, we can't shut it down.''</p>
        <p>The state's Department of Environmental Protection estimates there are no more than 7,200 adult flounder in the bay now, down from more than 60,000 in 1991.</p>
        <p>And it's undisputed that Millstone 2, which draws in 2 million gallons of cooling water from the bay every minute it is in operation, kills a lot of flounder larvae: 514 million in 1992, the worst year, and 87 million last year, according to the utilities' own environmental reports. About 5 billion larvae were killed from 1986-96, and billions other species were also killed, according to the reports.</p>
        <p>Penelope T. Howell, a senior state fisheries biologist, said those larvae represent an average of 12 percent of the larvae population per year. But she said one could not correlate that to a 12 percent decrease in adult fish.</p>
        <p>''There's the issue of compensation, which means the ones that are left have a greater chance for survival because there is less competition for the food that is there,'' Ms. Howell said. ''It's not a nice, clear-cut situation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Howell says Millstone is just one of the factors causing the Niantic Bay flounder population to collapse, and is not even the major factor. But she said that if Millstone 2 stopped killing larvae, the flounder population would recover faster if other factors, such as overfishing, were also addressed.</p>
        <p>The judge's injunction came as a result of a lawsuit filed on March 11 by four environmental groups, three of them from Long Island and one from Connecticut, and the New York Assemblyman, Representative Fred Thiele of Sag Harbor, Long Island. The suit claimed that Millstone 2 was responsible for decimating the flounder population in Niantic Bay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thiele said he believed Connecticut anglers and even regulators might be trying to balance the environmental impacts with the benefits of having a large taxpayer and employer along the coast.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that this is an economic issue for Connecticut residents,'' Mr. Thiele said. ''Those plants, that industry, is such a large part of the economy, it tempers any environmental considerations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thiele said he has been a strong supporter of efforts to clean up Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay. He said the five towns on the north shore of Eastern Long Island have spent $40 million in the last 20 years preserving open space.</p>
        <p>''That's why the issue of Millstone is so maddening for us,'' Mr. Thiele said. ''At the time the government is spending so much money and there is real progress being made, we have reports of radiation in the sediment and fish kills off Millstone. I think people involved in environmental issues see Millstone as the biggest threat to Long Island Sound today.''</p>
        <p>The plant had already been shut down for nearly three years when the groups filed the suit. On April 27, Judge Hale agreed it should remain shut down until June 15, after the spawning season. Two days after that order, the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the plant was safe enough to be put back into operation, pending the outcome of the environmental case.</p>
        <p>Less than 24 hours after testimony in the court case ended on May 6, the judge ruled that overfishing is a more likely cause of the fish decline and lifted the injunction against starting the plant.</p>
        <p>''This is a temporary setback, but it's definitely not the end of this battle,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burton, the lawyer for the four groups, said she hoped the appeals court would decide that the judge relied too heavily on the company expert witnesses, who worked at the Millstone environmental lab. Her own expert witness, a fisheries biologist from Rhode Island, estimated that 60 percent of the flounder mortality in the bay is the result of the Millstone nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>In fact, the latest survey by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute showed that flounder populations along most of the coast have increased because of state and Federal fishing restrictions, she said.</p>
        <p>When Northeast Utilities was issued a permit for Millstone 2 in 1970, the company estimated an impact of no more than 6 percent on the flounder population, she said.</p>
        <p>''Their best numbers show the impact has been at least twice that,'' Ms. Burton said. ''This permit was based on seriously flawed predictions. Maybe we would have said no to the plant back then if we knew how many fish it was going to kill. Or maybe we would have required a closed cooling system.''</p>
        <p>A closed system uses a tower to cool water from the plant, rather than continuously drawing cooling water from the bay and discharging the heated water back into Long Island Sound. The company's experts testified during the trial that such a system would be feasible, and would cost about $100 million.</p>
        <p>''It's a small victory that the judge says a closed system would be desirable, but he says that's up to the licensing authority,'' Ms. Burton said. ''Unfortunately, those kind of license changes will take years to accomplish.''</p>
