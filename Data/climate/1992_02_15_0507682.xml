        <p>The Department of Defense, which uses millions of pounds of ozone-destroying chemicals each year in its weapons, plans to step up efforts to eliminate their use.</p>
        <p>The new policy, which could be made public as early as next week, directsArmy, Navy and Air Force contracting officers to take more aggressive steps to purchase new military equipment that can be manufactured and maintained without using the ozone-destroying chemicals.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Pentagon is preparing to add technical experts to an existing project to rewrite thousands of specifications for the design, manufacture and maintenance of military hardware so that the use of the chemicals can be eliminated.</p>
        <p>The new policy was prompted by President Bush's decision on Tuesday to eliminate by 1996 virtually all United States production of chlorine- and bromine-based chemicals, including chlorofluorocarbons and halons, the two most widely used chemicals that cause the destruction of the ozone layer. The layer, in the upper stratosphere, protects against the sun's ultraviolet rays.  Cancer and Cataract Risks</p>
        <p>Scientists have warned that damage to the ozone layer will cause hundreds of thousands of cases of skin cancer and additional cases of cataracts, and will change the growth patterns of plants in the oceans and on land.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's approach to dropping CFC's and halons will have a sweeping influence because its standards for manufacturing electronic equipment and firefighting systems are considered the world standard.</p>
        <p>Stephen Anderson, a researcher in the global change division at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the Pentagon's standards were used by the military of most of America's allies and in the manufacturing of consumer and industrial electronic equipment.</p>
        <p>The Defense Department had planned to eliminate the use of the compounds by the year 2000, the previous deadline set by the Clean Air Act of 1990 and by an international treaty the same year. The military bought and used 16 million pounds of the ozone-destroying chemicals in 1990, roughly 4 percent of the total manufactured in the United States.</p>
        <p>The nation's armed forces are directly and indirectly responsible for half the use worldwide of CFC-113, a liquid solvent used to clean electronic components, Mr. Anderson said. About 200 million pounds of CFC-113, or 15 percent of the total amount of CFC's, are used around the world. If the Pentagon eliminates the CFC-113 by 1996, that could amount to an annual reduction of 100 million pounds, he said. Slow Progress Cited</p>
        <p>The military's use of the ozone-destroying chemicals, especially of halons in firefighting equipment and chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's in electronics, has come under criticism for years by national environmental groups, most recently this week by the National Toxics Campaign Fund, based in Massachusetts. In addition, the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, published a report in November saying that although the Pentagon had taken important steps to phase out the chemicals, the work was moving very slowly.</p>
        <p>The existence of the new orders was confirmed by spokesmen for the Defense Department and by executives of companies that manufacture electronic equipment for the department.</p>
        <p>"We have been working on a policy all along," said Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman. "The President's statement has made us work at a faster pace. But I'm not in a position to talk about the specifics of a policy before it is approved."</p>
        <p>Military officers said the Defense Department began in the mid-1980's to address the threat to the ozone layer caused by its use of CFC's and halons. Basic Operations Challenged</p>
        <p>But the effort to eliminate the chemicals has challenged some of the military's most basic operational foundations because large amounts of battlefield hardware either contain or were designed to incorporate the use of compounds. Removing the chemicals from use means changing how this equipment is designed, built and used; this involves turning the Pentagon's purchasing, contracting and design bureacracy inside out.</p>
        <p>The General Accounting Office says the Pentagon has 9,600 military specifications and standards that call for the use of ozone-depleting chemicals; roughly 900 specifications specify the uses of CFC's, halons and chlorinated solvents. Last year the Defense Department completed its first revision of a standard, allowing manufacturers of electronic components to clean electronic components with nine substitutes of CFC-113, including one solvent made from Florida oranges.</p>
        <p>But the accounting office said the successful changes to reduce the use of CFC's were offset by the extraordinarily deliberate pace of modifying new specifications, or in programs in which the use of ozone-depleting chemicals is encouraged.</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. investigators found that the Navy was replacing portable fire extinguishers that contained carbon dioxide, which does not harm the ozone layer, with halon extinguishers. The Navy was also replacing old air-conditioning systems that use CFC's as a refrigerant with new air-conditioners that also use CFC's, even though there are effective and less ecologically destructive substitutes.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 19, 1992, Wednesday</p>
        <p>A subheading on Saturday with an article about Defense Department efforts to eliminate the use of some chemicals described the chemicals incorrectly. The chemicals, among them chlorofluorocarbons and halons, damage the upper atmosphere's ozone layer, which protects against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays; the chemicals themselves do not directly cause cancer.</p>
