        <p>For centuries, scientists have known that the Sun has seasons, storms and rhythms of activity, with its sunspots and flares appearing in cycles roughly 11 years long. But only in the last decade or so have researchers begun to tie solar variations to climate shifts on Earth.</p>
        <p>Today, a growing number of scientists contend that the Sun's fickleness might rival human pollution as a factor in rising global temperatures. And some research, though sketchy and much debated, suggests that the Sun's variability could account for virtually all of the global warming measured to date.</p>

        <p>The nations of the world are to meet in December in Kyoto, Japan, to try to negotiate cuts in emissions of the heat-trapping gases. Not surprisingly, given the sketchiness of the science and the political difficulty of trying to curb industrial growth, debate is rising on whether such cuts are warranted.</p>
