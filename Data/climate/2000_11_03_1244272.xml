      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Vice President Al Gore has labored long and hard to make environmental protection his signature issue, but in the closing days of the presidential campaign, he is finding himself in an unexpected position.</p>
        <p>With the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, on one side and the Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, on the other, Mr. Gore is being forced to defend himself as neither a heretic nor a zealot.</p>
        <p>That dynamic has made it more difficult for Mr. Gore to delineate the deep differences over the environment between himself and Mr. Bush.  Indeed, on oil drilling, pollution control, global warming and timber policy, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have offered starkly different views. Mr. Bush is emphasizing state regulations, voluntary guidelines and greater access to public lands for mining, logging, grazing and drilling. Mr. Gore is pressing for more federal control, mandatory guidelines and more protection for public lands.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the debate has raised questions about how the support that each candidate has voiced for the environment might translate into practice. Mr. Gore, for example, is being backed by most major environmental groups, but in other quarters, his past statement that environmental protection should become ''the central organizing principle for civilization'' is being portrayed by his opponents as evidence of either betrayal or bad judgment.</p>
        <p>''This administration tries to take credit for our economy, but they seem to have forgotten what makes it turn,'' Mr. Bush said over the summer, in outlining what he has portrayed as a more practical view. ''Even today, in our new, high-tech economy, America runs on oil and gas and coal gained from the earth and water held behind our dams.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore still clearly sees the environment as a winning issue, and his campaign has tried to focus attention on Mr. Bush's environmental record in Texas, which Gore aides say  should raise deep doubts about the governor's commitment to protection. ''When it comes to the environment, I've never given up, I've never turned back, and I never will,'' Mr. Gore said at recent rallies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader, with his calls for an end to all logging in the national forests and his insistence that all international trading agreements should include environmental protections, has succeeded in driving home the notion that Mr. Gore's true colors are far less green than he has made out.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is suffering from election-year delusion if he thinks his record on the environment is anything to be proud of,'' Mr. Nader said recently. ''He should be held accountable by voters for eight years of principles betrayed and promises broken.''</p>
        <p>Even though the Clinton administration has disappointed them on some issues, such as its failure to tighten automobile fuel-economy,  most leading environmentalists have rallied to Mr. Gore. He, more than anyone else, they argue, deserves credit for the administration's environmental achievements. Furthermore, as president, they reason, he would finally have the freedom to put his own agenda in place.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Nader himself admitting that he has no chance of winning election, all three of the major environmental organizations that endorse presidential candidates have signed up for Mr. Gore, even while expressing what Brent Blackwelder, who heads Friends of the Earth, called ''environmental disappointments with Gore.''</p>
        <p>Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, the country's largest environmental organization, wrote recently in urging members to cast their lot with Mr. Gore: ''When Clinton and Gore were elected eight years ago, many environmentalists thought that internal revolution would be handed to them. It was not, and frustrated hopes have left many in a grumpy mood, as pessimistic about the possibilities of enlightened governance as any libertarian Texan. But past disappointments should not blind us to the historic opportunity before us to clean up our air and water, heal our cities and protect our natural treasures. Real people, forests and wild creatures will be significantly better or worse off depending on what happens Nov. 7.''</p>
        <p>In their public statements, both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have cast themselves as committed to environmental protection, but in laying out their views, they have left little doubt that they would move in very different directions. Mr. Bush has called for ''a new era'' in which he, as president, would ''maintain a strong federal environmental role but return significant authority to states and local communities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has sees the federal government as the dominant force in the quest for environmental protection. He has called for a ban on logging in all remaining roadless areas of the national forests, including the Tongass in Alaska, a position that goes beyond even a draft plan being reviewed within the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>That approach -- along with another Gore-backed effort that has set aside millions of additional acres of federal lands as national monuments as a barrier against future development -- has been sharply criticized by Mr. Bush, who has accused the Clinton Administration of riding  roughshod over local opposition.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the starkest difference between the two major candidates in the environmental arena has been their stance on the Kyoto Treaty, the 1997 pact that was designed to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases blamed for global warming. Mr. Gore helped broker the accord, and he has remained a strong proponent of its ratification by the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said that global warming poses a problem but that there is not yet sufficient evidence to point to a solution. He opposes the Kyoto Treaty in large part because it requires industrialized nations to move more quickly than developing ones in reducing outputs of so-called greenhouse gases, an approach that Mr. Bush has called ''ineffective, inadequate and unfair to America.''</p>
        <p>The two main candidates have also offered very different ways to combat higher gas prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has called for increased exploration for domestic sources of energy, and has said that as president he would allow oil drilling to begin in parts of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Gore, who would put a higher priority on energy conservation, has vowed to oppose drilling in the refuge.</p>
