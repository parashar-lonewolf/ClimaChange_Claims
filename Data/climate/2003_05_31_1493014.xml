      <abstract>
        <p>Paul Lewis letter expresses concern that, while political pendulum will eventually swing back to Democrats and centrist policies, serious damage will have been done by Republicans'radical agenda (May 25 and 26 articles)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With Republicans seeking ''an era of dominance'' and Democrats in desperate need of money and a focus (''State of the Party'' series, front page, May 25 and 26), American politics has hit a dangerous low. Though this could be seen as a normal swing to the right (as in the 1950's) that will be followed by a swing to the left (as in the 1960's), one fears the lasting consequences of the ascendant reactionary trend.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With Republicans seeking ''an era of dominance'' and Democrats in desperate need of money and a focus (''State of the Party'' series, front page, May 25 and 26), American politics has hit a dangerous low. Though this could be seen as a normal swing to the right (as in the 1950's) that will be followed by a swing to the left (as in the 1960's), one fears the lasting consequences of the ascendant reactionary trend.</p>
        <p>If we were not facing complex and vexing problems (including global climate change, terrorist plotting, economic stagnation and poorly financed social services), the zeal with which national Republicans are impoverishing our federal and state governments might be correctable.</p>
        <p>But no swing back to the political center will allow us to correct mistakes that cause sea levels to rise, expose us to increasingly toxic attacks and leave so many children behind.</p>
