        <p>JESSICA ABEL may have gone to extremes when she collected seawater from Long Island Sound and boiled it down to make two cups of salt. But people who are determined to eat only food made within 100 miles, give or take, sometimes find themselves reaching for creative solutions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abel and her husband, Matt Madden, cartoonists who work at home in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, have given three strictly enforced local-only dinner parties over the past year. A fourth scheduled for next month will feature fiddleheads, ramps, new fresh cheese and baby lamb.</p>
        <p>''Last summer it was goat stew with peaches and onions, and in the middle of winter it was an all-butter, all-the-time meal,'' she said. ''We all missed white flour and sugar.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Abel and Mr. Madden are dabblers in a small but increasingly popular effort to return to a time before the average food item traveled 1,500 miles from farm to table. In that sense, the only thing new about the phenomenon is its name, locavore, which was coined two years ago in California. But the appearance of the word seems to have given shape to a growing subculture. Weeklong locavore challenges have been popping up all over the country, even in places like Minnesota and Vermont, where it would seem to be pretty hard to eat local foods in the dead of winter.</p>
        <p>Many drawn to the movement say they have been eating that way for years and had never thought about the implications beyond the flavor. ''Initially it was the taste thing for me,'' said Robin McDermott, who lives in Waitsfield, Vt., where locavores call themselves localvores. ''But now when I think about what it takes to get lettuce across the country so I can eat it in the middle of winter, between the fuel costs and the contribution all the transportation is making to global warming and climate change, I just can't do it. It's not sustainable and I don't want to contribute to it.''</p>
        <p>Those who think this is another harebrained scheme of the food fringe may be surprised to learn that locavores are poised to move into the mainstream. Barbara Kingsolver, the best-selling novelist, has written one of three books out this spring about eating locally.</p>
        <p>''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' (HarperCollins) recounts her family's adventures during the year they spent eating food raised in their corner of southwest Virginia. Her book and others are successors to several earlier books including ''Coming Home to Eat'' by Gary Paul Nabhan and ''Full Moon Feast: Food and the Hunger for Connection'' by Jessica Prentice, who coined the word locavore and founded the Web site locavores.com.</p>
        <p>Ms. Prentice's group claims to have started the grass-roots locavore challenges that sprang up in California in 2005. Participants exchange recipes and advice.</p>
        <p>Some locavores follow the 100 Mile Diet, created by Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon, authors of the just-released ''Plenty'' (Harmony). They spent a year in British Columbia eating only food grown within a 100-mile radius.</p>
        <p>It wasn't easy. Faced with potatoes, once again, for lunch, Ms. Smith recounts her feeling that ''I'd kill for a sandwich.'' When Mr. MacKinnon said he would make her one, she couldn't imagine what he had in mind because they had no local flour for bread. But soon enough he produced greenhouse-grown red peppers and fried mushrooms with goat cheese between two golden brown slices of something. Something turned out to be turnips.</p>
        <p>The authors held so strictly to their plan that when they eventually found locally grown wheat they took it even though it was filled with mouse droppings. Mr. MacKinnon painstakingly separated the droppings from the wheat with the edge of a credit card.</p>
        <p>The plan outlined in Ms. Kingsolver's book is much less strict than the one in ''Plenty.'' The author said that in her attitude toward food she is something between a Puritan (''I'm going to be holy right now'') and a toddler (''I want absolutely everything every minute and the idea of not having fresh peaches in January is sort of horrifying'').</p>
        <p>Each member of her family was allowed one luxury item that came from far away. Her husband chose coffee, her children hot chocolate and dried fruit. Spices were Ms. Kingsolver's indulgence.</p>
        <p>''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' gives no sense of privation or even boredom. Ms. Kingsolver spent a fair amount of time putting foods by when they were in season so that the larder was stocked.</p>
        <p>But most readers would have trouble following her program, which included raising much of what the family ate on their farm, including chickens and turkeys.</p>
        <p>''We undertook this project because it brings together so many compelling issues of the moment: carbon footprint, global warming, the local economy, the nutritional crisis and community,'' said Ms. Kingsolver. ''Community is very important to me and every book I've ever written is on this subject: what is the debt of the individual to the community?''</p>
        <p>''We wanted to see if we could show that it's possible and even a lot of fun, not just an experiment in sacrifice,'' she said. ''It was so much more fun than we expected it to be.''</p>
        <p>Most locavores are not strict constructionists. They tend to make exceptions for coffee, pasta, spices, salt and flour.</p>
        <p>While West Coast residents can use olive oil, Ms. McDermott had to substitute sunflower oil made in Vermont, which has obvious drawbacks. ''It definitely tastes like sunflower seeds,'' she said, ''but another alternative is to make ghee from local butter.'' Wheatberries take the place of rice, and ground cherries or gooseberries, she said, ''can kind of pass for raisins.'' A birthday cake of mashed parsnips was sweetened with maple syrup and maple sugar.</p>
        <p>Ms. McDermott, who designs Web-based training for manufacturing companies with her husband, Ray, started one of the several localvore groups in Vermont last year in the Mad River Valley. During their first event in September, 150 participants took the pledge to eat locally for a week. Only slightly fewer tried it again this January, and more events are planned this year.</p>
        <p>''The two biggest barriers to eating local are time and cost,'' she said. ''A lot of people think this is somewhat elitist because if you buy a local chicken it is $3.50 to $4 a pound and you can get them for a lot less in the supermarket. If you want boneless chicken breasts you'll go broke, but if you buy a whole chicken it's affordable because you will use it all. The same thing with lesser cuts of meat. You do need time and a desire to cook something.</p>
        <p>''And you need a freezer, something like a root cellar. Last year I got into making kimchi and sauerkraut as a way of preserving of food.''</p>
        <p>By far the most pragmatic of these locavores is Ms. Prentice. ''To restrict yourself to eating locally is an interesting exercise,'' she said. ''It's consciousness raising to see what you'd be living on, but I don't think of it as a necessary or practical solution of our globalized food system. I am not opposed to any importation, but what we can grow locally we should grow locally.</p>
        <p>''We have a situation in California where we export as many strawberries as we import. It's gotten ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>People who have tried to eat a strictly local diet, even those like Ms. Abel who are dabblers, say it has been a life-changing experience. ''One of the things about having this party is becoming aware of how far things have come,'' she said. ''So now we are eating differently. Having a dish of eggplant, tomatoes and zucchini in February is weird to me. We are eating a lot of kale and root vegetables in winter and buying a lot of stuff at the Greenmarket year round. It's not a life philosophy but it's not a game.''</p>
        <p>Though eating locally can be a difficult feat, in many parts of the country it is easier than it was five years ago. Farming land continues to disappear as larger farms go under, but the number of small farms that cater to their neighbors has increased 20 percent, to 1.9 million in the last six years. The number of farmers' markets and farm stands, food co-ops and community-supported agriculture groups is growing. In his new book ''Deep Economy,'' (Times Books) Bill McKibben writes that the number of farmers' markets has increased from 340 in 1970 to 3,700 in 2004.</p>
        <p>New Seasons, an eight-store supermarket chain in Portland, Ore., has made its name as a place where local food is king. Byerly's and Lunds in Minneapolis also feature local products.</p>
        <p>Schools are catching on to the idea. In 2002 400 school districts in 22 states had farm-to-cafeteria programs that provided students locally grown food. Today 1,035 districts in 35 states participate.</p>
        <p>But before locavores take too much credit for the phenomenon, there are a bunch of back-to-the-landers in Vermont who ate local foods 30 years ago. ''There are a lot of people here who call themselves yokelvores,'' Ms. McDermott said. ''They get their food from within 100 feet of their homes -- homesteaders who have their own cows, chickens and grow their own vegetables. They consider people like us as Johnny-come-latelies.''</p>
