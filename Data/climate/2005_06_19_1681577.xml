        <p>The new Hilton Vancouver Washington, below, is to become the first hotel in the United States to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification from the United States Green Building Council (www.usgbc.org). The certification is awarded to buildings built and operated with environmentally sustainable methods. The seven-story Hilton was scheduled to open June 15 and to receive its certification soon afterward.</p>
        <p>Designed by the Portland, Ore., firm of Fletcher Farr Ayotte, the hotel was built with recycled steel and brick, and will run on 30 percent less energy than local building codes require. Its white reflective roof will help dissipate heat. All 226 guest rooms have operable windows. Carbon dioxide sensors will switch off heating and cooling when people aren't present. Transportation alternatives are encouraged with only 160 parking spaces available (employees will be urged to bus to work), but drivers of electric cars will find ample plug-ins.</p>

        <p>The new Hilton Vancouver Washington, below, is to become the first hotel in the United States to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification from the United States Green Building Council (www.usgbc.org).

Transportation alternatives are encouraged with only 160 parking spaces available (employees will be urged to bus to work), but drivers of electric cars will find ample plug-ins.</p>
        <p>Mike Shea of Fletcher Farr Ayotte, the sustainability manager for the Hilton project, said additional costs to qualify for certification were only about $125,000 higher and were expected to pay for themselves within eight months. ''Over 20 years they'll save I don't know how many millions in energy costs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The United States Green Building Council's certification program is five years old with 231 certified buildings, according to Taryn Holowka, a spokeswoman for the council. Hotel participation is expected to perk up, she said. Several other hotel or resort projects have registered to follow the Green Building Council's construction standards.</p>
        <p>The Hilton, in downtown Vancouver, Wash. (just across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore.), is on the recently restored 5.2-acre Esther Short Park.  SUSAN G. HAUSER</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 21, 2005, Sunday  A report in the Advisory column on June 19 about the Hilton Vancouver Washington referred incorrectly to its expected certification by the United States Green Building Council. Although the Hilton said it expected to become the first hotel in the United States to receive the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification, another establishment -- the University of Maryland University College Inn and Conference Center in Adelphi -- was certified by the council on June 9 and thus became the first. A letter dated July 22 from OPX, the architecture firm for the Maryland center, reported the error. It was addressed to a freelance writer and did not reach the editors until Aug. 8. The Hilton hotel is still awaiting certification.</p>
