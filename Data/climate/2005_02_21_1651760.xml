      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Pres Bush's trip to Europe is being greatly anticipated on both sides because European leaders realize they must deal with Bush for four more years, and because America wants Europe to become more involved in Iraq; says each side perceives threats differently now, but each side needs other, and leaders must show that when they need to, US and Europe can still be partners</p>

        <p>Rarely has a visit to Europe by a U.S. president generated as much anticipation as the one by George W. Bush that gets under way today. The reason is obvious: trans-Atlantic discord has escalated over the last four years, raising doubts about the validity of the North Atlantic alliance, and even over whether the term ''Western'' still connotes a shared vision of the world. We believe that it does, and that NATO can remain the premier instrument for guaranteeing the security and freedom of countries that buy into the values that bind Europe and America. But it will take a lot of hard work to undo the damage of these four years. Banquets and speeches about shared histories are good, but Iraq, Iran, Syria, North Korea, China, Africa and a host of other places need joint attention.</p>
        <p>The choreography of the visit is, indeed, impressive. President Bush will spend quality time with three active opponents of the war on Iraq: France's Jacques Chirac, Germany's Gerhard Schröder and Russia's Vladimir Putin, and he will visit both the European Council and the European Commission to prove that he is all for European unity. Several factors explain the yearning on both sides to make so public a show of camaraderie. One is simply that Mr. Bush has four more years, whether the Europeans like it or not. Another is that America would dearly like Europe to become more involved in Iraq. The U.S. military is overstretched. Of course, the Europeans believe that means Mr. Bush is therefore not likely to attack Iran or anywhere else anytime soon. So the Europeans believe they have a window to advocate the ''soft power'' they favor in resolving conflicts.</p>

        <p>Rarely has a visit to Europe by a U.S. president generated as much anticipation as the one by George W. Bush that gets under way today. The reason is obvious: trans-Atlantic discord has escalated over the last four years, raising doubts about the validity of the North Atlantic alliance, and even over whether the term ''Western'' still connotes a shared vision of the world.

        <p>The choreography of the visit is, indeed, impressive. President Bush will spend quality time with three active opponents of the war on Iraq: France's Jacques Chirac, Germany's Gerhard Schröder and Russia's Vladimir Putin, and he will visit both the European Council and the European Commission to prove that he is all for European unity. Several factors explain the yearning on both sides to make so public a show of camaraderie. One is simply that Mr. Bush has four more years, whether the Europeans like it or not. Another is that America would dearly like Europe to become more involved in Iraq. The U.S. military is overstretched. Of course, the Europeans believe that means Mr. Bush is therefore not likely to attack Iran or anywhere else anytime soon. So the Europeans believe they have a window to advocate the ''soft power'' they favor in resolving conflicts.</p>
        <p>The real question is whether anything will be resolved. Mr. Schröder declared last week that NATO was no longer viable as the main venue for trans-Atlantic communications, and recommended that a panel of high-level officials study the problem. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's prompt reaction -- that there was no need for ''another high-level thing'' -- showed Washington's reluctance to tamper with an alliance that it can control or disregard. Beyond that, Mr. Bush's recent speeches have made no retreat from the good vs. evil view of the world that the Europeans hate.</p>
        <p>These differences will be on display in talks about the Iranian nuclear program. Germany, Britain and France will lean heavily on Mr. Bush to support their negotiations with Iran instead of pressing now for Security Council sanctions. This is one on which the president should give way, especially since sanctions and military action are always available should Iran balk. Mr. Bush may also have to soften his stance against the arms embargo on China, which the Europeans want lifted. Mr. Bush is right in principle, but the embargo is doomed in any case and lifting it now would enable the United States to set limits and conditions on weapons sales to Beijing.</p>
        <p>The Europeans need to bend too. They should commit themselves to a much greater role in training Iraqi security forces. And they must join the United States in declaring Hezbollah a terrorist organization, because it is, and because the message to terrorists must be one and only one.</p>
        <p>There are many other issues on which Americans and Europeans disagree, from global warming to third-world debt and Darfur, and there will always be more. Times have changed since the United States and a far smaller Europe were bound by a common threat from the Soviet Union, and each side perceives threats differently now. But each side still needs the other. Now the leaders must show that when they need to, the United States and Europe can still be partners.</p>
