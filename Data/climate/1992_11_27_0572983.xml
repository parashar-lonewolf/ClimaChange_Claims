        <p>Management of the nation's environmental policy is a mess. The Interior and Agriculture Departments oversee natural resources like fish and wildlife, national parks and forests. The Environmental Protection Agency worries about air and water pollution and toxic wastes. The Commerce Department concerns itself with the weather.</p>
        <p>President-elect Clinton isn't likely to squander political capital in a bruising fight to create one big environmental agency. But a recent report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace offers a more achievable proposal that would strengthen environmental management. The proposal calls for elevating the E.P.A. to cabinet status and moving other agencies into it.</p>
        <p>Jurisdictional jealousies on Capitol Hill thwarted President Bush's attempt to elevate the E.P.A. One result was that William Reilly, Mr. Bush's E.P.A. director, lacked clout in internal negotiations on crucial issues like clean air, wetlands preservation and global warming. Mr. Reilly wasn't regarded as the equal of cabinet secretaries.</p>
        <p>An upgraded E.P.A., the Carnegie report says, should also have wider responsibilities. One easy way to accomplish that is to give it the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, now in Commerce. NOAA supervises policy over the atmosphere and the oceans -- everything from the ozone layer to coastal estuaries. It also has a superb scientific staff familiar with global environmental problems, something the E.P.A. lacks.</p>
        <p>Losing NOAA would cost Commerce half its budget. But Commerce would gain in focus what it loses in size -- becoming, finally, an agency devoted primarily to helping American business compete effectively in world markets.</p>
        <p>NOAA was located in Commerce only through an act of pique. Created in 1970, it was originally ticketed for Interior. But President Nixon, annoyed at Interior Secretary Walter Hickel for voicing doubts about Vietnam, gave NOAA to Commerce. It's been an orphan ever since.</p>
        <p>Upgrading the Environmental Protection Agency and transferring NOAA would begin to bring coherence to environmental policy. If Mr. Clinton likes the idea, he would be well advised to adopt it now -- before choosing a Commerce Secretary who might resist giving up half his agency. If Mr. Clinton delays, turf wars could defeat an eminently sound idea.</p>
