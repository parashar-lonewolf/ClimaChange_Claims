        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article, ''Don't Tell Anyone, but There's This Rich Joke Going Around . . . ,'' Sept. 5, about the high cost of living in New Jersey inspires comment. Apparently the median family income in New Jersey is now the highest in the nation at $70,263.00. I'm single, earn more than that, and I still can't afford to buy a home in Hoboken, where I live.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article, ''Don't Tell Anyone, but There's This Rich Joke Going Around . . . ,'' Sept. 5, about the high cost of living in New Jersey inspires comment. Apparently the median family income in New Jersey is now the highest in the nation at $70,263.00. I'm single, earn more than that, and I still can't afford to buy a home in Hoboken, where I live.</p>
        <p>But if I could afford a home here, I don't think I could psychologically bear to pay the ridiculously high taxes. Unfortunately, I can afford a home in New Jersey towns or sections of towns where I don't feel safe, or which are remote from the community I've built. I can't be the only person with semi-deep pockets facing this problem. Is there a politician or developer listening? So, while I'm not eager to move out of state, Ohio, with it's median income of $51,522, looks very attractive. There I'll truly be rich, happily relaxing in the shade of my buckeye trees, and content in the knowledge that if global warming continues along its simmering path, I'll be the proud owner of waterfront property just in time for retirement.</p>
