        <p>HEUSSER--Calvin J., Professor Emeritus, age 82, died peacefully on November 11, 2006 after a long illness. He was a professor of biology at NYU (1974-1991), and a pioneering researcher in Paleoecology and Stratigraphic Palynology. His field work studying fossil pollen from the Pacific Northwest, Argentina and Chile provided empirical support for current theories of global climate change. His 54-year-long career included research at Oregon State, Yale, The American Geographical Society (which awarded him the David Livingstone Centenary Medal in 1987), Universidad de Chile, and the University of Cambridge (UK). He was a passionate and eloquent devotee of the natural world, the arts (particularly music), and the craft of teaching. He is remembered by his wife and colleague, Dr. Linda Heusser; his children, Eric, Kristin, Herb, Faith, and Benjamin; his grandchildren; and many students and colleagues.</p>
