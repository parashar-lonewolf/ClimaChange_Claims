        <p>City Councilman David Yassky letter on Walter Olson's February 6 Op-Ed article on New York City law holding out-of-state gun dealers liable for irresponsible sales</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Wrong Target'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 6), Walter Olson objects to a recent New York City law holding out-of-state gun dealers liable for irresponsible sales, calling the law, of which I am the sponsor, ''an act of aggression against citizens of other states.''</p>
        <p>If guns sold in North Carolina or Georgia stayed in those states, then Mr. Olson would be right. But just as the acid rain created by Midwestern power plants falls in New York, the lax gun laws of states in the Southeast allow interstate gun trafficking networks to flourish. As a result, 9 out of 10 guns used in crime in New York are brought here from other states.</p>

But just as the acid rain created by Midwestern power plants falls in New York, the lax gun laws of states in the Southeast allow interstate gun trafficking networks to flourish. As a result, 9 out of 10 guns used in crime in New York are brought here from other states.</p>
        <p>These ''source states'' could greatly reduce the flow of illegal guns with a few simple regulations: prohibiting multiple gun sales, requiring background checks for sales at gun shows, and tighter oversight of retail gun stores. The failure by source states to rein in the gun industry is a true ''act of aggression,'' and New Yorkers have every right to protect ourselves.</p>
