        <p>In 1887, William Henry Jackson's photographs of Yellowstone were a critical factor in the United States Government's decision to make it the country's first national park. Now the United Nations Environment Program is holding a large photography competition that it hopes will aid its efforts to save the planet from those who inhabit it.</p>
        <p>The contest, "Focus on Your World," is in conjunction with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro from June 1 to 12. Winning photographs will be exhibited at the conference, and afterward, 206 of them will be shown around the world.</p>
        <p>"The processes of environmental abuse are as destructive as nuclear war and far less easy to avert," said Dr. Mostafa K. Tolba, executive director of the Environment Program.</p>
        <p>On the entry form for the contest, the organization says it expects that many entries will be preserved in a photographic library that will provide "a powerful visual presentation of today's most pressing environmental problems."</p>
        <p>For would-be contestants who need ideas on what to cover, these are among the subjects the United Nations conference will address next year: the protection of the atmosphere (climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, air pollution); protection of land resources (combating deforestation, soil loss, desertification and drought); conservation of biological diversity; protection of freshwater resources, and of oceans, seas and costal areas, and the use and development of their living resources.</p>
        <p>Other topics are environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous wastes; prevention of illegal traffic in toxic products and wastes; improvement in the quality of life and human health, and improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating poverty and stopping environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>Canon is a major sponsor of the contest. Other supporters are Japan Airlines, Varig Brazilian Airlines, Eastman Kodak and the International Photographic Council.</p>
        <p>U.N. officials are asking contestants to look at their pictures as donations to a cause rather than a commercial promotion. Indeed, entrants should examine the contest's rules carefully because if their pictures win, they will have to release all long-term rights to them. But the contest does not skimp on prizes, which will be given in three divisions.</p>
        <p>In the professional division, the first prize will be $20,000; second prize, $10,000; third prize, $5,000, and 20 honorable mentions, $1,000 each. Winners of the top three prizes will also receive Canon EOS-1 cameras; each person meriting honorable mention will get a Canon EOS-100.</p>
        <p>In the amateur division, the first prize will be $10,000; second prize, $5,000; third prize, $2,000, and 70 honorable mentions, a Canon Sure Shot Max.</p>
        <p>In the children's division (under 16 years old), first prize will be $1,000 and second prize, $500. In addition, there will be special prizes for 100 photographs by children, with details to be announced later.</p>
        <p>First- and second-prize winners in all categories will be invited on an expense-paid trip to the awards ceremony in Brazil. The children who win first and second prize may be accompanied by one parent each.</p>
        <p>All pictures must have been taken between Jan. 1, 1990, and the entry deadline, Feb. 29, 1992. Entrants under the age of 21 must have a parent's signature on the entry form.</p>
        <p>Entry forms and more information are available from Canon distributors or the United Nations Environmental Program at (800) 677-6645. Rules on picture returns are specific: "No entries, prints or slides will be returned to entrants. No receipt of entry will be sent to the entrant."
