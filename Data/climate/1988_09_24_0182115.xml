        <p>LEAD: Some say we can have either a clean environment or a thriving economy, but not both. But I see our challenge very differently. We can't have sustainable economic development without careful and sensitive protection of our natural resources.</p>
        <p>Some say we can have either a clean environment or a thriving economy, but not both. But I see our challenge very differently. We can't have sustainable economic development without careful and sensitive protection of our natural resources.</p>
        <p>As President, I would:</p>
        <p>* Establish and enforce strict environmental standards for air and water quality and insure that an adequately funded Environmental Protection Agency vigorously enforces our environmental laws and makes the polluters pay.</p>
        <p>* Work with the Congress and through the E.P.A. to stop acid rain pollution. I would establish national standards to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide - the two major components of acid rain. Even under existing Clean Air Act regulations, proper regulation of tall stacks by the E.P.A. could cut sulfur dioxide emissions by nearly five million tons per year.</p>
        <p>* Require safe disposal of hazardous, solid and radioactive wastes, insure prompt clean-up of existing waste sites and reduce the generation of additional hazardous chemicals.</p>
        <p>* Encourage recycling and the reduction of wastes at the source on a national level, and assist states and regions to establish stable national markets for recycled material.</p>
        <p>We must manage Federally-owned lands in the long-term public interest. This means protecting national forests and grazing lands from excessive grazing and cutting. It means conserving wilderness areas, old growth forests and fragile wildlife habitats. And it means managing national parks in the interest of all the people.</p>
        <p>The current Adminstration has tried to turn the public lands of the national forests into opportunities for private profit. As President, I would end this giveaway. I would:</p>
        <p>* Work with Congress to designate the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a wilderness area.</p>
        <p>* Halt below-cost timber sales in national forests.</p>
        <p>* Direct the forest service to take immediate measures to protect old growth forests.</p>
        <p>I will continue to oppose offshore drilling in critical environmental areas and productive fishing grounds, as I did for Georges Bank off the New England coast. Pending lease sales in environmentally critical areas must be stopped.</p>
        <p>We must not only protect existing wetlands, but restore part of the vast endowment of wetlands that America has lost.</p>
        <p>I support strong enforcement of the wetlands protection provisions of the Clean Water Act, the cornerstone of an effective national policy on wetlands management.</p>
        <p>Preserving our nation's farmlands is not only an environmental issue but an economic issue. In Massachusetts, we've invested in one of the most aggressive farmland protection programs in the nation.</p>
        <p>Congress has made progress towards conserving America's farmland and reducing soil erosion and wetlands filling by passing the Sodbuster, Swampbuster, and Conservation Reserve provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill. I strongly support these programs.</p>
        <p>Environmental problems do not respect national boundaries. Acid rain, global warming from the greenhouse effect, stratospheric ozone depletion, the destruction of tropical rain forests and the pollution of the ocean are problems which require cooperative, international solutions.</p>
        <p>As President, I will immediately call for an international environmental and conservation summit to bring together world leaders to confront these urgent problems.</p>
        <p>I would immediately rescind the current Administration's misguided Mexico City policy, which forbids private organizations receiving Agency for International Development funding from providing a full range of family planning services to families who need them.</p>
        <p>Uncontrolled population growth in developing countries contributes to desertification, deforestation, climatic disruption and the destruction of plant and animal habitat.</p>
        <p>America should help solve, not exacerbate, these problems.</p>
