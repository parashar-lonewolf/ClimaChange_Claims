        <p>A large ice shelf that has jutted into the Arctic Ocean from northernmost Canada for at least 3,000 years has broken up over the last two years, providing fresh evidence that the region is warming past thresholds that can produce abrupt changes, scientists said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The scientists, from Laval University in Quebec and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, described the changes in a paper published in the Geophysical Research Letters.</p>
        <p>The disintegration of the ancient ice shelf -- the largest in the Arctic -- appears to have been caused both by a century-long warming trend and, more recently, by an accelerated rise in temperatures, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>They said it was not yet possible to say whether the melting was related to rising atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from human activities. But they added that the breakup was just one of many signs of enormous climate shifts in the Arctic that merited careful monitoring.</p>
        <p>''It is part of a long-term process, we believe,'' said Dr. Warwick F. Vincent, a biologist specializing in arctic ecology at Laval University and an author of the new study. ''But the most recent changes are substantial and correlate with this recent increase in warming that we've seen from the 1960's to the present. It's an example where a critical threshold has been passed.''</p>
        <p>The other authors were Derek R. Mueller of Laval and Dr. Martin O. Jeffries from the University of Alaska.</p>
        <p>The 150-square-mile region of floating ice, called the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, had formed a cap across the mouth of the 20-mile-long Disraeli Fjord on Ellesmere Island, in Nunavut. That caused a rare condition in which a 140-foot-thick layer of fresh water accumulated atop the denser seawater in the 1,200-foot-deep fjord, forming an isolated floating freshwater lake.</p>
        <p>The trapped fresh water harbored a unique ecosystem of rare plankton and other life that has collapsed now that its basin has broken up and the fresh water has flowed into the Arctic Ocean, Dr. Vincent said.</p>
        <p>The ice of the Ward Hunt shelf is up to 100 feet thick, making it far larger than the 10-foot slabs of floating sea ice that form a milling cap on the Arctic Ocean.</p>
        <p>The pieces could persist for many years as they start to drift in Arctic waters, the authors said. For the moment, they exist as free-floating jigsaw pieces, in part held near the coast by Ward Hunt Island. The island is a popular jumping-off spot for expeditions over the sea ice to the North Pole.</p>
        <p>It was the last large remnant of a much more extensive shelf that once fringed all of Ellesmere Island, Dr. Vincent said. Over all, he continued, that fringe has shrunk by more than 90 percent over the last century.</p>
        <p>Ellesmere's projecting ice shelves broke off at a rapid rate through most of the last century, but the erosion essentially stopped in 1982. The breakup of the last section, around the Disraeli Fjord and Ward Hunt Island, began in 2000, the researchers said, when big new cracks were detected in satellite images.</p>
