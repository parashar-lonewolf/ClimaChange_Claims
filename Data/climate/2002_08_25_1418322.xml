        <p>The news this year has offered Americans the chance to become connoisseurs of disillusionment.

Some scandals, like the priestly abuse of children, cause nausea. Others -- the big-money kind -- embitter. But just when the public must feel that it has sampled every vintage of deception, along comes the story of Princeton University's office of admission and its illicit visits to a Web site maintained by its counterparts at Yale to allow applicants to the freshman class to check whether they've been accepted. The staff poked through the files of several hopefuls, including that of Lauren Bush, the president's niece, who applied to both schools.</p>
        <p>To what end, this bout of hacking?

        <p>The news this year has offered Americans the chance to become connoisseurs of disillusionment. We've learned that high-level corruption, like fine wine, has an assortment of characteristic top notes, subtle accents and distinctive mouth feels that make for a range of tastes and aftertastes. Some scandals, like the priestly abuse of children, cause nausea. Others -- the big-money kind -- embitter. But just when the public must feel that it has sampled every vintage of deception, along comes the story of Princeton University's office of admission and its illicit visits to a Web site maintained by its counterparts at Yale to allow applicants to the freshman class to check whether they've been accepted. The staff poked through the files of several hopefuls, including that of Lauren Bush, the president's niece, who applied to both schools.</p>
        <p>To what end, this bout of hacking? To gain some advantage in the competitive game of landing top talent and boosting the school's ratings in US News &amp; World Report's next college guide? Or, as Princeton's own investigation of the incident suggests, were they merely testing the Yale site's security? (Or lack of it?)</p>
        <p>Whatever the motives behind the furtive keystrokes, which Princeton promptly dealt with by reassigning and censuring the hackers, it seems unlikely to blight the school's prestige, either among those who dream of studying there or the parents who have mortgaged their homes to make this possible. This was a near-miss, as scandals go, an embarrassing unmasking that didn't quite happen. And yet it offers a chance to reconsider the peculiar mystique of the Ivy League itself, one of the last sacred national monuments still standing in this season of crumbling clay feet.</p>
        <p>As the solemn doormen who guard the V.I.P. rooms of the American meritocracy, Ivy League admissions committees exist on a exalted social plane somewhere between Mount Olympus and the ozone layer. As inscrutable as the National Security Agency, as seemingly omniscient as the College of Cardinals and as secretive as the chemists at Coca-Cola, these obscure bureaucratic Magi decide, by means of esoteric formulas that you imagine are written in Aramaic and stashed in the subbasements of Gothic clock towers, precisely what combination of College Board scores, altruistic community involvement and ability to return a kickoff should qualify someone for a junior membership in the power elite. Their authority is intimidating and final, like the Federal Reserve's. They're the unmoved movers behind our human economy.</p>
        <p>The wonder is that, with all their influence, we agree to leave them alone in their maneuverings. While most other powerful social institutions, both public and private, must answer to an array of politicians, consumers, lawyers, inspectors general and organized pressure groups, the Ivies retain an aristocratic autonomy that the public seems loath to challenge or to second-guess. It's odd. Since who goes to Harvard this fall may substantially determine who runs the country 20 years from now, we all, in a sense, have an interest in Harvard's decisions -- and yet it's not an interest we pursue. Instead, we trust Harvard to come to its own judgments. Such blind faith just isn't like us.</p>
        <p>When so many Americans decline to exercise their right to be cynical, particularly nowadays, it can only be because there's something huge at stake -- a myth we sense we can't afford to tamper with. Here, it's the myth of the Ivy League degree as a real reflection of human excellence and as something for all young Americans to shoot for, even if it's assumed that most will miss and many others will give up before trying. It's a reason for immigrants' children to finish their homework. It's a reason for middle-class parents to buy savings bonds. Its intrinsic desirability and prestige are cultural counterweights to rather less noble but more relentless drives for money and fame and power for their own sakes. When the country loses its faith in C.E.O.'s, stock prices sink, but should it grow convinced that the system of meritocratic advancement itself is broken or corrupt, ambition and morale plunge.</p>
        <p>Our faith in any exclusive organization depends, of course, on how it has treated us personally. I'm a Princeton graduate myself, and for years I've harbored the self-serving belief that those who offered me a place there were indeed infallible judges of human potential who plugged my statistics into their patented formulas and sat back, stunned at the results. Had I been shown the door, I might think differently, but I doubt many people would have wanted to hear my gripes -- least of all those who were cramming for the College Boards that week or practicing jump shots from dawn to dinnertime. Sure, we suspect that the game is rigged at some level (Lauren Bush, best known to the public as a fashion model and a political relative, got yeses from both Yale and Princeton -- surprise!); but that's different from believing that it's a sham and that only a fool would would take his chances playing it.</p>
        <p>Princeton will be forgiven its little trespass, both because it appears that no harm was done to anyone and because when its new freshmen arrive for classes, their parents, younger siblings and high-school English teachers will want to -- will need to -- feel the trip was worth it. They, or someone they love and want the best for, may be dreaming of making it, too.</p>
