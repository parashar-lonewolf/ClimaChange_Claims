        <p>Cholera in the United States: curiosity or clarion? Cholera is spreading in the Americas, and scientists have now found a possible link with global warming. Your Feb. 18 editorial and "Lead Us to Rio, Mr. President" by Michael Oppenheimer (Op-Ed, Feb 22), on the United Nations conference on the environment and development, the so-called earth summit, in Rio de Janeiro next June, both urge the United States to join an international treaty on carbon emissions, a pact essential for our health.</p>
        <p>Researchers on diarrhea in Bangladesh have long associated cholera cycles with the spring blooms of algae and plankton. Dr. Rita Colwell of the University of Maryland and others have isolated resting forms of cholera in a wide range of marine life. Exposed to unfavorable conditions, the bacteria "hibernate"; with warming and increased nutrients, they emerge.</p>
        <p>Plankton and algae also proliferate with warming (absorbing carbon and making oxygen through photosynthesis). The current called El Nino is warming the eastern Pacific; unusually large algae blooms are reported at sea, and samples of marine life from the harbor of Lima, Peru, contain cholera.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis, then: having possibly arrived in the bilge of a Chinese freighter docked in Lima (Nature magazine), cholera was carried in the abundant coastal sea life to neighboring countries. From this reservoir, it penetrated societies whose water and sanitation systems had become vulnerable from economic hardship and rapid urbanization.</p>
        <p>Health professionals are increasingly concerned with the health impact of climate changes. Next June's Rio conference will offer an opportunity to begin a worldwide project to curb greenhouse gases. The United States cannot escape its responsibilities by adopting half measures or by merely contributing to international funds. PAUL R. EPSTEIN, M.D. Cambridge, Mass., March 3, 1992 The writer plans to represent the World Federation of Public Health Organizations at the Rio conference.</p>
