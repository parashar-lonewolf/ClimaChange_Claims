        <p>LEAD: A Justice Department spokesman today described Whitney North Seymour Jr., the special prosecutor in the perjury case against Michael K. Deaver, as ''a bull in the china shop'' who was threatening relations between the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>A Justice Department spokesman today described Whitney North Seymour Jr., the special prosecutor in the perjury case against Michael K. Deaver, as ''a bull in the china shop'' who was threatening relations between the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Patrick Korten, said in an interview that the department would go to court Thursday and might request a judge's order barring Mr. Seymour from unauthorized contacts with the Government of Canada and its Ambassador here.</p>
        <p>The Canadian Embassy has protested an Oct. 2 letter from Mr. Seymour to an embassy lawyer. In the letter, Mr. Seymour warned that unless Ambassador Allan E. Gotlieb testified at Mr. Deaver's trial, prosecutors would be ''forced'' to ''place much greater emphasis at the trial on the unlawful acts engaged in by Deaver when he was working for the Canadian Government.''</p>
        <p>Both the Justice Department and State Department have sided with Canada against Mr. Seymour, who, as a special prosecutor, operates independent of the Reagan Administration. 'Created Significant Crisis'</p>
        <p>''This guy is a bull in the china shop when it comes to international relations,'' Mr. Korten said of the special prosecutor. ''He's created the second significant crisis in our relations with Canada in a matter of months.''</p>
        <p>Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Seymour had no comment on the statements by Mr. Korten.</p>
        <p>Last May, Mr. Seymour attempted to subpoena Ambassador Gotlieb and his wife, Sondra, to testify at the trial of Mr. Deaver about their dealings with him before he left the White House in 1985.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver, who is scheduled to go on trial Monday, is accused of lying under oath when he said he could not remember conversations that took place regarding acid rain, which has emerged as a significant issue between the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>The subpoena for the Ambassador was quashed by a Federal judge who found that the Gotliebs were protected by diplomatic immunity.</p>
        <p>The State Department has protested Mr. Seymour's attempts to deal directly with Canadian officials, which the department describes as a violation of protocol.</p>
