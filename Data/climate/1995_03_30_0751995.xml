        <p>LIKE the vast region in and around New York City, the six counties of northeastern Illinois forming the Chicago sprawl have a wretched summer smog problem. And both do not have many years to address the problem before the Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to impose harsh sanctions that would slash economic development.</p>
        <p>Unlike New York, however, Illinois is gung-ho to use market forces to cut the cost of the solution.</p>
        <p>The state's proposal -- a trading plan allowing the few hundred largest polluters to buy and sell limited rights to pollute -- aims at getting the maximum bang for an emissions control buck. Perhaps as important in the conservative Age of Newt, the market trading approach is geared to minimizing the role of government in enforcement. "People care as much about keeping Big Brother out of the picture as keeping down the cost," says Joseph Goffman, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington.</p>
        <p>The brown-yellow haze that blankets many cities on summer days is created by still poorly understood reactions between nitrous oxide gas (NOX) and a diverse family of chemicals called volatile organic compounds (VOC's). The nastiest byproduct -- the one that gives asthmatics fits -- is colorless, odorless ozone. (Pay attention to those initials; the differences matter.)</p>
        <p>In the cities of the East, including New York, Philadelphia and Atlanta, ozone creation is "NOX limited." That means a reduction in VOC's will not do much to curb ozone unless the greater effort is focused on cutting NOX emissions.</p>
        <p>Environmental scientists thought Chicago's ozone smog was similar. Indeed, in 1993, a team of experts worked out a plan for creating marketable permits in NOX for Chicago, much like the marketable allowances now in place nationwide for emissions of sulfur from power plants.</p>
        <p>But that all changed after computer simulations were completed implying that the annoying VOC's were the key to controlling ozone in Chicago. That immensely complicated planning because VOC's come in many flavors and from a wider variety of sources than NOX. Southern California postponed efforts to create an emissions trading system for VOC's in part because planners could not agree on, say, how much paint thinner equaled how much cleaning fluid.</p>
        <p>But Illinois persevered. Major corporate emitters of VOC's -- Caterpillar, Abbott Laboratories, Amoco and Corn Products -- were added to the planning group. And it was agreed that all volatile organic compounds would be treated as a single, interchangeable pollutant for purposes of creating a market in emissions.</p>
        <p>All VOC's are not created equal, of course. Phil O'Connor, a consultant and a member of the design team, acknowledges that in an ideal world the various chemicals would be weighted according to the damage they inflict. "But the best cannot be allowed to become the enemy of the good," he argues.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, some 300 polluters who emit more than 10 tons of VOC's during the annual smog season would be obliged to participate. Another hundred spewing 5 to 10 tons into the air could also join, thereby escaping micromanagement of their control technology by state regulators. Each year, the emissions rights initially granted to polluters on the basis of historical experience would be ratcheted down. By 2007, total allowable emissions from stationary sources would be reduced by 60 percent.</p>
        <p>The appeal is that polluters would have maximum incentives to find cheaper pollution control technology, slow production in summertime or even spend money to eliminate other sources of pollution at less cost.</p>
        <p>One possibility suggested by officials is that industrial polluters could meet requirements in part by retiring old cars. "Cash for clunkers is a gold mine," says Mary Gade, director of the Illinois E.P.A.</p>
        <p>While hardly painless, VOC controls may end up having only a modest impact on the cost of doing business in Chicago. Daniel Dudek, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund, says that compliance costs for emissions in the acid rain program are running at a quarter of the original estimates. "Emissions trading has worked better than we ever dreamed," he said.</p>
        <p>The Illinois initiative, which is expected to be blessed by the State Legislature this spring, reinforces the politically fashionable idea that the states are better at carrying out policy than Washington. But for all the advantages of local initiatives, the Federal Government remains the driving force. "The Clean Air Act is forcing the hands of the states," says Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who is an adviser to the Illinois E.P.A. And they are responding creatively. "Local politicians -- not the Feds -- will take the heat," he adds, "for expensive, obtrusive cleanups."</p>
