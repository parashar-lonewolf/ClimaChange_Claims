        <p>Political Memo: Vice Pres Al Gore is following tradition of defeated presidential candidates by retiring from public stage and public life and from party politics; his silence has raised questions among many former campaign staff and allies over his commitment to fighting the good fight, but other say he is doing smart thing politically (M)</p>

        <p>By tradition, defeated presidential candidates are a retiring lot. They press the mute button on themselves, keep their heads down and their activities private. This is largely a matter of good taste. You do not invite yourself along on someone else's honeymoon, especially if you are the rejected suitor.</p>
        <p>Al Gore has rigorously followed this custom. After his concession speech last December, he left the public stage and public life. As he teaches, travels and writes, he has offered no public comment on current events and has largely withdrawn from party politics, which he never liked much anyway.</p>

        <p>By tradition, defeated presidential candidates are a retiring lot. They press the mute button on themselves, keep their heads down and their activities private. This is largely a matter of good taste. You do not invite yourself along on someone else's honeymoon, especially if you are the rejected suitor.</p>
        <p>Al Gore has rigorously followed this custom. After his concession speech last December, he left the public stage and public life. As he teaches, travels and writes, he has offered no public comment on current events and has largely withdrawn from party politics, which he never liked much anyway.</p>
        <p>But some are questioning Mr. Gore's silence, saying that he is allowing President Bush to trample on the environmental issues that he has long championed. How could Mr. Gore, who might run for president again, not seize the microphone and stand up for the earth, which, he has written, is so precariously in the balance?</p>
        <p>Richard Cohen, a columnist for The Washington Post, began the recall for Al Gore last month, saying that no one else spoke on environmental matters with Mr. Gore's authority.</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Gore's former campaign staff and allies share the sentiment. A former aide said the silence raised questions of Mr. Gore's commitment to fighting the good fight. ''He was in politics for a reason, because he cared about the issues,'' the former aide said.</p>
        <p>But many others say that Mr. Gore is doing the right thing politically by keeping quiet. The chief reason: the election was so close that a vocal Mr. Gore could easily look like a sore loser and undo the good will of his statesmanlike concession.</p>
        <p>Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said Mr. Gore was ''very smart to stay out of the limelight,'' largely because speaking up would have linked him in the public mind with President Bill Clinton's messy exit.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Goeas said, poll results to be released on Monday show that 50 percent of the public views Mr. Gore favorably, 42 percent  unfavorably. This is essentially unchanged since the election.</p>
        <p>Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, had dinner with Mr. Gore last week and said the former vice president seemed inclined to wait until the fall before speaking out. ''He still needs time to relax,'' Mr. McAuliffe said, citing not only the campaign and Florida recount but also 24 years before that in the public eye.</p>
        <p>And some say the issues are clear enough for people to grasp on their own. Ed Sarpolus, an independent pollster in Michigan, said: ''Gore is right to remain silent. Bush is his own worst enemy, especially among women.''</p>
        <p>But the longer Mr. Gore stays out, the more momentous his re-entry becomes. Allies are already mulling what role he might take during the midterm elections next year, mindful that his participation itself could become an issue.</p>
        <p>''If it's a close election, you don't want to risk nationalizing it and having a Gore-Bush replay,'' said one former adviser. ''When the time comes, the calculation will be, where is he most helpful?''</p>
        <p>In the near term, Mr. Bush is facing several environmental decisions, including how aggressively to search for oil on public lands and how to respond to global warming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore will have some opportunities to address them. On May 14, for example, he is scheduled to attend a dinner in New York for the New York League of Conservation Voters. It is not clear whether he will speak there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's allies in the environmental movement are sympathetic to his dilemma but say his emergence before the election has fully receded could prove a distraction.</p>
        <p>Phil Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group, said: ''I think it's perfectly appropriate that he hasn't spoken out. Almost anything he said would be seen as trying to refight the election.''</p>
        <p>Allies fear that Mr. Gore's silence is leaving a void in party leadership, and they are watching other presidential aspirants like Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John Kerry of Massachusetts try to fill it. The longer Mr. Gore stays silent, they say, the stronger those rivals become and the harder it is for Mr. Gore to maintain his base.</p>
        <p>Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said that if Mr. Gore sought the Democratic nomination again, he would not automatically have the league's backing. The league, keeping with its normal practice, did not endorse him last year until he had won the nomination over a challenge by former Senator Bill Bradley.</p>
        <p>''John Kerry probably has the second-highest environmental score in the Senate, after Russ Feingold,'' Ms. Callahan said. ''It would be foolish of us to choose among our heroes during a primary season. No one gets an automatic check.''</p>
