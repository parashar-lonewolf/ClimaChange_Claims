        <p>In issuing its report last week on the use of genetically engineered growth hormone to boost milk production in cows, the Office of Technology Assessment didn't shrink from controversy.</p>
        <p>The Congressional agency issued a point-blank declaration that the hormone poses no danger to cows or to humans who drink their milk, a view at odds with what some consumer groups and state regulators have argued. By so doing, the agency increased the chances that the Government will approve the new drug for widespread commercial use and that Congress will concur.</p>
        <p>Armed with a tiny budget of $6 million, the agency's director, John H. Gibbons, has made the office important by taking strong stands.</p>
        <p>In February, for example, it issued a toughly worded report arguing that the Department of Energy had "neither the capability nor the credibility" to meet its goal of cleaning up radioactive waste from weapons plants in 30 years. In another report that month, the agency argued that policies for disposing of medical waste remain mired in "confusion and inconsistency."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons, a 62-year-old physicist with a longstanding interest in energy conservation, is modest about the impact the agency has had in his 12 years as director. "We don't claim to have a big influence," he said. "We're really catalysts. Our job is to provide the movers and shakers with wisdom that is tough to get."</p>
        <p>Yet beyond simply answering technical questions, the agency's reports attempt to address the social and economic implications of a technology. Thus, the report on bovine growth hormone went to great lengths describing how the drug could hurt small dairy farmers by lowering milk prices. Likewise, a report on global warming tried to frame strategies for dealing with the problem that would be economically feasible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons admits the conclusions don't always satisfy everyone, but he says most sides to a debate usually agree with the underlying facts cited in the agency's reports.</p>
        <p>"We're trying to give members a sense of where all the parties to a debate can stipulate," he said. "It's a heavy weight."</p>
