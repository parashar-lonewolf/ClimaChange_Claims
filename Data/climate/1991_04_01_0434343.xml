        <p>The Congressional debate over U.S. energy policy is taking place 4,000 miles from an area that lies at the heart of the issue -- the coastal plain of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups, for whom the refuge is a cause celebre and fund-raising gold mine, are trying to exploit that distance by obscuring the debate with charged rhetoric and old-fashioned misinformation.</p>
        <p>It's time to fight back with the facts: The coastal plain of the Alaska refuge is the most promising area on U.S. soil for the discovery of oil reserves. Government scientists place the probability of finding oil there at 46 percent. Their mean estimate is that the area may contain 3.6 billion barrels of oil -- enough to make it the third-largest U.S. onshore field ever.</p>
        <p>Knowing whether the oil exists is an essential starting point for any comprehensive energy plan.</p>
        <p>The President's national energy strategy makes this clear: Without oil from the coastal plain, there can be no comprehensive U.S. energy plan. Alternative technologies are not yet capable of replacing fossil fuels. Conservation can reduce energy consumption but it cannot eliminate it. A new Alaskan field would provide domestic oil supplies while alternatives are developed.</p>
        <p>In fact, in both the President's plan and a national energy proposal by Senator Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, revenues from the coastal plain are considered crucial to financing new conservation incentives and alternative energy research.</p>
        <p>U.S. oil production is in a disconcertingly deep decline. Even production at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay field, which accounts for a quarter of our nation's oil production, has been dropping by 10 percent a year. At that rate, and without new fields, the Energy Department estimates that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System will have to shut down within 20 years.</p>
        <p>The Persian Gulf crisis highlighted our dependence on foreign oil. We import about half of our oil at a cost of approximately $55 billion a year. In fact, 1990 imports were responsible for 54 percent of our annual trade deficit.</p>
        <p>Though the U.S. still uses more oil than anyone else in the world, its consumption has plateaued. Meanwhile, oil use in the third world is expected to increase dramatically -- up to 170 percent by the year 2010. Because oil is a universally high-value, nonrenewable commodity, competition among nations will inevitably drive up its cost.</p>
        <p>Given this situation, it would be foolish for us not to take appropriate steps to learn the extent of our own oil resources.</p>
        <p>What of the charge that development of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge would destroy our last pristine wilderness?</p>
        <p>The area covers 19 million acres, about the size of South Carolina. Within it, eight million acres of designated wilderness (about the size of Massachusetts) is off-limits to development. An additional 9.5 million acres is also protected from development. Only 1.5 million acres are even being considered for oil exploration. Indeed, the projected area of full development is only 12,500 acres. In all, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the refuge would be affected by drilling.</p>
        <p>Those opposing development charge that the region is not worth exploring because it contains only a 200-day supply of oil. Such rhetorical acrobatics assume the refuge would be the only oil source available and that it would be physically possible to pump it dry in that time. But neither geology nor the industry works that way. The area wouldn't be our only source, and oil has to be extracted at a steady pace. The fact is, the coastal plain could supply a significant portion of U.S. needs over 20 to 30 years.</p>
        <p>The same tactic was used against Alaska's Prudhoe Bay field, which was said to have only a 600-day supply. Prudhoe has been pumping steadily for 14 years.</p>
        <p>Although it may take months to finish the debate, a key vote on exploration in the coastal plain is expected next month in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The risks of an environmentally sound leasing program in a small sliver of the refuge are fewer, and the potential rewards greater, than many people realize. Alaskans know the facts. The President knows the facts. And it's time for Congress and the rest of America to know them, too.</p>
