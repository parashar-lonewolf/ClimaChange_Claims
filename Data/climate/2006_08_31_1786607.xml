        <p>SILICON VALLEY POWER ALLIANCE When Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, left, was named to Apple Computer's board this week, the announcement touched off a wave of speculation about the motives of the man behind the move: Apple's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>CALIFORNIA EMISSIONS BILL California's political leaders announced an agreement that imposes the most sweeping controls on carbon-dioxide emissions in the nation, putting the state at the forefront of a broad campaign to curb the man-made causes of climate change despite resistance in Washington. [A1.]</p>
        <p>FILLING UP ON CORN A 2,100-mile drive through the region where ethanol fuel is most popular revealed that despite all the good will toward E-85, as the corn-based fuel blend is known, its success is far from assured. [C1.]</p>
        <p>LOOPHOLE FOR FLEXIBLE FUEL As car companies promote E-85 as an alternative to gasoline, they are benefiting from a loophole that allows them to receive credits toward environmental standards when they sell flexible-fuel vehicles that run on the ethanol-based fuel. [C4.]</p>
        <p>ECONOMY EXPANDED IN QUARTER The economy grew more quickly in the second quarter than initially estimated and inflation was slightly lower, the Commerce Department reported. [C1.]</p>
        <p>STOCKS EDGE UP The Dow average and the Nasdaq rose slightly in thin trading, helped by a government report showing economic growth remains reasonably strong. [C13.]</p>
        <p>JITTERS OVER HURRICANES All along the coasts, from Texas to New England, insurers suffering from hurricane jitters are raising rates and cutting back on coverage. But nowhere is the crisis more severe than in Florida, where storms in recent years have added billions to the insurers' losses. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PESSIMISM AMONG WORKERS Three new opinion polls found deep pessimism among American workers, with most saying that wages were not keeping pace with inflation and that workers were worse off in many ways than a generation ago. [A21.]</p>
        <p>ALCATEL DEFENDS LUCENT DEAL With a week to go before a crucial vote on a deal that would reshape the telecommunications equipment industry, Alcatel disputed criticism about its planned takeover of Lucent and insisted that the deal would benefit shareholders. [C3.]</p>
        <p>COKE EXECUTIVE LEAVES The president of Coca-Cola's North American unit, Donald R. Knauss, resigned abruptly to become chairman and chief executive of Clorox. [C3.]</p>
        <p>G.M. DROPS 'SURVIVOR' ADS General Motors has decided not to advertise on the CBS reality show ''Survivor'' for the upcoming season, one that has attracted criticism because teams of contestants are being pitted against each other based on race. Advertising. [C3.]</p>
        <p>NEW ALUMINUM GIANT Alcoa may face a rival for global dominance if a tentative merger of two Russian aluminum companies and a major Swiss commodity trader comes to fruition. Should Alcoa drop from its No. 1 spot it would be partly a reflection of wider industrial shifts that now favor Russia's commodity-driven economy. [C5.]</p>
        <p>TiVo'S LOSS CLIMBS TiVo reported a quarterly loss that was seven times the size of its loss a year ago, largely because of hefty legal costs associated with a high-stakes intellectual property patent dispute. [C4.]</p>
        <p>NOT GUILTY PLEA IN OPTIONS CASE The former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, Gregory L. Reyes, pleaded not guilty to 12 counts of securities fraud and other charges that he improperly backdated employee stock option grants. [C11.]</p>
        <p>NO ACTION ON SHELL'S EX-CHIEF The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided to take no action against Sir Philip Watts, the former chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, over the 2004 scandal involving the overbooking of oil reserves. [C11.]</p>
        <p>REVERSAL OF VIOXX AWARD Merck won the first reversal of a damage award over its Vioxx painkiller when a judge said that a $51 million verdict was ''grossly excessive.'' [C11.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>DEALBOOK Daily news on mergers and acquisitions, I.P.O.'s, venture capital and more is at nytimes.com/dealbook.</p>
        <p>HUGE APARTMENT SALE With a target price of nearly $5 billion, the sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village would be the biggest deal for a single U.S. property in modern times. A report is at nytimes.com/realestate.</p>
        <p>UNLIKELY DORM MATES Barnard College has built a dormitory where faculty members occupy the same floors and share laundry facilities and common space with students. A report is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>ONCE AND FUTURE MILEAGE KING Can an automobile be ahead of its time and yet be obsolete? As it heads into retirement, the Honda Insight certainly looks that way. A report is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>BUSINESS AFTER KATRINA A year after Hurricane Katrina, many small businesses are open across New Orleans, but times are tough and their survival is in doubt. A multimedia report is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
