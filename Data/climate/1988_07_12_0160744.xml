        <p>LEAD: Ten weeks after the nation's corn crop was sown, heat and drought are disrupting the plants at the crucial, delicate stage when they develop flowers, achieve pollination and form kernels.</p>
        <p>Ten weeks after the nation's corn crop was sown, heat and drought are disrupting the plants at the crucial, delicate stage when they develop flowers, achieve pollination and form kernels.</p>
        <p>Across the 12 states of the Middle West and Great Plains where almost 90 percent of the nation's corn is grown, analysts say, the failure of billions of corn plants to successfully complete the ''tasseling'' stage, as the steps involved in pollination and kernel formation are called, means a fall harvest that is likely to be far less than the 7.3 billion bushels once expected.</p>
        <p>Dr. D. E. Alexander, professor of plant genetics at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, said ''a corn plant is a little factory out there,'' working to convert carbon dioxide to starch and cellulose. ''It's forming leaves and flowers and ears,'' he said. ''Under the stressed circumstances we have now, the factory just isn't working as well.''</p>
        <p>Corn, the largest and most important crop in the United States, is an annual in the grass family. Modern varieties of corn are descendants of a wild relative called teosinte that was domesticated thousands of years ago by farmers living in what is now Central America.</p>
        <p>Like its relatives in the family of grasses that produce cereal grains -wheat, sorghum, barley, rye, oats -corn produces male and female flowers. But unlike most of its relatives, corn does not normally pollinate itself. Reproduction is accomplished by joining pollen and silks, usually from different plants.</p>
        <p>The male flower, known as the tassel, forms at the top of the stalk, which under normal conditions is six to eight feet tall in July. Within the tassel are anthers producing grains of pollen. A healthy tassel sheds millions of yellow pollen grains.</p>
        <p>The female flowers form in the elbows where leaves and stalk join and in early July are ears no larger than thumbs. Each ear is surrounded by a husk from which a cluster of long, soft silks emerge.</p>
        <p>Normally in early July tassels release pollen and winds carry the pollen grains to the silks, where they germinate. A single grain of pollen grows down the center of each silk, forming a hollow tube, until it reaches the base, where male and female genetic material from silk and pollen combine and a single kernel begins to form on the ear. Healthy ears produce 500 to 1,000 kernels per ear. Modern varieties often produce two ears of corn per plant.</p>
        <p>But the drought and heat have weakened corn plants and altered their normal development. Hundreds of millions of plants simply did not germinate, according to scientists monitoring the crop in South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana and other states across the Corn Belt.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of millions of others have been stunted by lack of moisture. The young plants, unable to secure enough moisture, sharply reduced the rate at which they were converting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight into carbohydrates, organic compounds, and amino acids. With less energy available to form stalks, leaves and other structures, much of the crop is no more than four feet tall.</p>
        <p>Smaller, weaker plants also have less capacity to form tassels and ears properly, say scientists.</p>
        <p>The results are varied. In corn plants in Illinois and Indiana, tassels are simply not producing pollen. ''Usually, when you shake the tassel, you'll find pollen in your hand,'' said Dr. William Treese, a crop extension specialist with Purdue University in Indiana. ''Most of the fields I've been in - if you shake the tassel no pollen is shed.''</p>
        <p>In other fields, particularly those in Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, which have been withered by extreme heat, ears have shriveled and silks have not formed to accept wind-borne pollen.</p>
        <p>''The development of pollen is supposed to take place simultaneously with the development of silks,'' said Dr. Paul L. Crane, an agronomist at Purdue University in Lafayette. ''In many parts of Indiana, the silks just aren't emerging.''</p>
        <p>And across the Corn Belt, which stretches west from Ohio to Iowa and north from Missouri to South Dakota, drought and heat have dried up silks, making them unreceptive to pollen grains. Without pollination, kernels do not form in the ears. In test fields at the University of Illinois, which normally produce 160 to 180 bushels per acre, reproduction has been so disrupted by the dry spell that scientists do not expect even 30 bushels an acre. Rain Won't Help</p>
        <p>In many regions, where reproduction has been interrupted, rain will no longer save the crop. But even in areas where pollination was successful, the corn crop is threatened.</p>
        <p>The growth of the stalks and leaves stops soon after the formation of the tassel. Smaller, weaker plants are not likely to form the full ears of corn that farmers usually harvest, scientists said. The shriveled kernels and smaller ears may cause thousands of farmers to plow under stunted plants in the fall.</p>
        <p>''Even it rains here all week,'' said Dr. Alexander of the University of Illinois, ''we still aren't going to have half a crop in Illinois. If you asked me a week ago, I wouldn't have said that. Things have changed that quickly.''</p>
