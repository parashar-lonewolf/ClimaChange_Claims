        <p>Wall Street rediscovered oil today, as investors rushed to acquire stocks of major oil companies.</p>
        <p>Several major companies, including Exxon, Chevron, Amoco and ARCO, reported strong profits for the fourth quarter and oil prices soared by the largest one-day total in eight months.</p>
        <p>Analysts said higher oil prices were stirred by reports that key members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait, had agreed to support production cutbacks when the group meets in Vienna on Feb. 13.</p>
        <p>In the futures markets, the March contract for domestic light crude rose 83 cents, to $19.66 a barrel. It was the biggest one-day increase since May 27 last year, when prices rose $1.06 after Saudia Arabia threatened to curb production if the European Community raised taxes on fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Yet Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, said that weak oil prices were a much stronger stimulant than the threat of oil taxes for the newest leanings within OPEC for production cutbacks.</p>
        <p>"The reality is that something had to be done just in terms of self-interest of the Persian Gulf producers to shore up prices," Mr. Picchi said.</p>
        <p>He said the profit gains reported today by the four major oil companies reflected lower costs after thousands of employees were trimmed from payrolls last year, as well as higher natural gas prices, and widening profit margins in overseas refining and marketing operations.</p>
        <p>Exxon said net income rose 25 percent, to $1.4 billion, or $1.12 a share, from $1.12 billion, or 89 cents a share. Revenues fell slightly, to $30.2 billion from $31.0 billion.</p>
        <p>Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman and chief executive of the world's biggest oil company, said lower operating costs in North America, higher natural gas prices and sales increases for gasoline and other petroleum products, and for chemicals contributed to higher profits.</p>
        <p>Exxon's share price gained $2.50, to $60.625, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange</p>
        <p>Chevron said net income soared to $1.09 billion, or $3.30 a share, from $39 million, or 11 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues rose 9.6 percent, to $11.4 billion from $10.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Chevron's shares rose $2.25, to $70, in trading on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>Amoco said net income soared more than threefold, to $548 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with $153 million, or 31 cents, in the period a year ago that included a one-time charge of $47 million related to the Amoco Cadiz oil spill. Revenues were flat at $7.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Earnings tripled in United States exploration operations, to $323 million, and doubled in foreign operations, to $106 million. Amoco's share price rose $3, to $51.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>ARCO said net income rose 38.9 percent, to $372 million, or $2.30 a share, from $268 million, or $1.67 a share. Revenues rose slightly, to $5 billion from $4.8 billion. The fourth-quarter profits included a special gain of $75 million from a legal settlement with the Iranian Government. ARCO shares added $5.25, to $115, on the Big Board. Exxon Corp. (N)</p>
