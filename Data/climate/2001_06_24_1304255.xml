        <p>LAST Tuesday morning in the parking lot of Trader Joe's market in Mamaroneck, N.Y., one Lincoln Navigator, one Isuzu Trooper, three Chevy Suburbans, two Dodge Durangos, three Jeep Grand Cherokees, one Chevy Tahoe, one Toyota Land Cruiser, one Mazda Tribute and one Mercedes M-Class sport utility vehicle inched forward and back in an excruciatingly slow elephant ballet.</p>
        <p>It was 11:40, hot and still, just 10 minutes past the last school pickup of the year. The car silhouettes blurred in the heat, and the faces of the children who had clambered in minutes before faded behind the tinted windows. The fleet seemed monolithic, but the drivers' attitudes were anything but.</p>

        <p>LAST Tuesday morning in the parking lot of Trader Joe's market in Mamaroneck, N.Y., one Lincoln Navigator, one Isuzu Trooper, three Chevy Suburbans, two Dodge Durangos, three Jeep Grand Cherokees, one Chevy Tahoe, one Toyota Land Cruiser, one Mazda Tribute and one Mercedes M-Class sport utility vehicle inched forward and back in an excruciatingly slow elephant ballet.</p>
        <p>It was 11:40, hot and still, just 10 minutes past the last school pickup of the year. The car silhouettes blurred in the heat, and the faces of the children who had clambered in minutes before faded behind the tinted windows. The fleet seemed monolithic, but the drivers' attitudes were anything but.</p>
        <p>''I definitely feel weird about this car,'' said Tricia McRae (Suburban No. 1). Gas prices make her feel that way, as does the environmental cost of driving such a behemoth -- front-page news again after all these years. ''Maybe it's always felt a little weird,'' Ms. McRae said. ''But it feels worse now because of the gas crunch. We like to travel, and it's put a damper on all that. When the lease runs out in December, we'll probably go for a station wagon. My husband wants a Miata -- can you imagine? We'd go from the elephant to the ant -- but that doesn't make too much sense with three kids.''</p>
        <p>Heidi Hanley (Durango No. 2) has three children, too. ''It becomes a juggling act in your head,'' she said. ''Your concerns about your kids' safety with the horrible mileage. I have no conclusions. This is a leased vehicle, and I think about what other car I could get that doesn't guzzle gas. For me, this is definitely an issue connected to what's going on in the White House.''</p>
        <p>Because S.U.V.'s are less fuel efficient than cars, their runaway popularity has increased America's reliance on foreign oil -- average daily imports are twice as high as in 1981 -- and that has led in part to President Bush's call for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. S.U.V.'s also pump out nearly three tons more carbon dioxide than an average car in a year, a pollutant that is said to cause global warming, and that issue, too, is back in the news because of the administration's rejection of the Kyoto treaty to limit greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Americans love their S.U.V.'s, there's no question about it, but there are tiny pockets of what Alan Metrick, communications director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, calls ''dis-ease,'' little bubbles of guilt over what was once the very symbol of suburban success. These S.U.V. owners don't sound brazen when they talk about their vehicles; they sound embarrassed.</p>
        <p>''It's a terrible time to ask me about my car,'' said Ardith Plimack, 39, who lives in Marin County, Calif. She has two children and a new Toyota Land Cruiser. ''I have such a conscience, and at the same time I'm living my life. We used to have a Land Rover Discovery. I was in a terrible accident with it last year. Five kids on a field trip. In the rain. The car was totaled, and none of us had a scratch.</p>
        <p>''When you have a young family and you're schlepping kids all over the place, you know what starts happening? You start writing a lot of checks to the environmental organizations. Part of me thinks I'm paying Peter to keep robbing Paul.''</p>
        <p>Sales of S.U.V.'s slid almost 10 percent last year (sales of all cars were down a little over 6 percent, as the economy weakened). ''We know the S.U.V. market is softening,'' Mr. Metrick said. ''You have all these forces hitting this market: the gas prices, Ford making headlines every day. That can't be helping. Our guess is that there is a section of the S.U.V. market that is saying: 'Do I really need this? Isn't it a little bit silly to be driving this thing?' ''</p>
        <p>In Greenwich, Conn., the S.U.V.'s nestle together in little herds, two or even three to a family. Marybeth Manley has four children, one Lexus LX470 S.U.V. and a Chevy Tahoe. ''I do think it's excessive,'' she said. ''And I have thought we should be driving smaller cars. I didn't like it when Bush said Americans shouldn't have to change their lifestyle. I, for one, feel uneasy. My husband bought the cars.''</p>
        <p>Emmy Starr has three children and another on the way, a Land Cruiser, a Lexus S.U.V. and a Volkswagen New Beetle. She drives the Beetle to the market when the baby sitter has the children in the Land Cruiser. ''It's the biggest one,'' she said. ''It was the only one that you could fit three car seats across the middle. And it's very safe. But it gets terrible gas mileage. I'll probably have to cave to the minivan thing when we have our fourth.''</p>
        <p>In Martha's Vineyard, the sins of the S.U.V. are as much aesthetic as environmental. ''Here it's an awareness that they are a bit of a clich√©, something that goes hand in hand with the big trophy home,'' said Paul Schneider, an island resident and author of ''The Enduring Shore: A History of Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.''</p>
        <p>In March, AutoPacific, an automotive product and marketing consulting concern, conducted surveys of S.U.V. owners who had bought their cars since September. It has just compiled the results.</p>
        <p>''These people don't like their cars -- they love them, a lot,'' said James Hossack, a company vice president. ''They like to sit up high and see where they're going. They're not concerned about the environment or gas prices. Most people aren't seeing global warming, they're seeing less pollution than they ever did before. And if gas prices go up to $3 a gallon, who cares? These people don't. The press keeps talking about mileage, and nobody cares. No, sorry, it's not happening.''</p>
        <p>Is S.U.V. slippage wishful thinking on the part of environmentalists? Actually, the idea of what makes a car and what makes an S.U.V. is blurring. ''I don't think they're going to evaporate,'' said Jerry Hirshberg, founder of Nissan Design International in San Diego and the creator of the Xterra, an S.U.V. he described as ''blue jeans on wheels.''</p>
        <p>''People like the bigness,'' he said. ''On the other hand it would be naive to think that the image hasn't been tarnished. My own thinking is that something very interesting is about to happen in the car industry. You keep hearing the mantra about S.U.V.'s becoming more carlike. Well, what does that mean for the car? I think there's going to be a huge shift away from what used to define a car.''</p>
        <p>In designing the 2002 model of the Nissan Altima, a compact sedan, his team looked at what was ''rational'' about the S.U.V.'s, he said. ''We know people love the high-command seating. And so in the Altima we've raised the seats over an inch. That's a big thing. Changes like that can really stimulate the idea of what a car might become.''</p>
        <p>James Hall, vice president for industry analysis at AutoPacific, said the market was still S.U.V.-happy, but he noted that ''customers are fickle.''</p>
        <p>''Personally, and this is my bet, not my company's, I think there'll be a shift and it will come from the next cluster, the so-called Generation Y, the oldest of which are 23 right now. This is the first generation whose parents drove S.U.V.'s. And you know what? No generation before them has wanted to drive its parents' cars if it had an alternative.''</p>
