        <p>Having endured arctic storms, dangerous fissures in the ice pack, polar bear intrusions and a year of crushing pressure while frozen into a drifting floe, the Canadian icebreaker Des Groseilliers reached Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, over the weekend. Aboard the vessel was a rich cargo of data expected to reveal subtle mechanisms that drive changes in the world's climate.</p>
        <p>The ship's arrival on Saturday marked the end of a yearlong round of experiments paid for mostly by the National Science Foundation, with support from the Office of Naval Research and the Japanese Government. The $19.5 million project, called Sheba, for Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean, was a detailed measurement of heat flow among the water, ice and air of the Arctic, and the results are expected to improve the mathematical modeling of global climate change.</p>
        <p>Sheba, administered by the University of Washington, was the largest and most complex project ever supported in the Arctic by the National Science Foundation.</p>
        <p>In a telephone call from the ship, Dr. Richard E. Moritz of the University of Washington, director of the project, said the atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical scientists who spent part of the year aboard the floating laboratory would spend several months compacting and analyzing the data collected by thousands of sensors on and around the ship. The investigators will meet in Tucson, Ariz., at the end of January to begin consolidating their findings, Dr. Moritz said.</p>
        <p>Some preliminary results include indications that the entire year was markedly warmer than past years. The ocean was open much farther north than normal, and the ice began breaking up sooner than normal in the spring. Moreover, the salinity of ocean surface water was low, indicating that the water was mixed with an unusually large proportion of fresh water from melting ice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Moritz said the warming trend may have been mainly the result of the recent El Nino climate event in the Pacific Ocean, but could also reflect a global warming trend.</p>
        <p>Dr. Donald Perovich, Sheba's chief scientist on loan from the Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, in Hanover, N.H., said the research year had been eventful.</p>
        <p>''We had a real scare during the winter when our headquarters floe started to break up,'' he said. ''One of our ice camps near the ship broke away and drifted a half mile from the ship in less than an hour.''</p>
        <p>From the point at which the ship was intentionally embedded in ice 320 miles north of Deadhorse, Alaska, a coastal village 200 miles southeast of Point Barrow, the icebreaker drifted about 1,800 miles before her powerful engines were started and the vessel headed for land.</p>
        <p>''Toward the end of the summer,'' Dr. Perovich said, ''the ice had melted so much that thin patches barely covered the water.''</p>
        <p>''Scientists were constantly falling through into the nearly freezing water -- 11,000 feet deep -- so everyone took to wearing flotation devices while working,'' Dr. Perovich said.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes we had polar bear visits,'' he added. ''Once, a mama bear was instructing her cub how to floss its teeth with a cable strung out to one of our sensors, and we had to chase them away with a tractor.</p>
        <p>''But it was a wonderful project.''</p>
