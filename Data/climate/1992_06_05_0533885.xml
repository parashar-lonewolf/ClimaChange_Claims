        <p>In the first substantive act of the Earth Summit, a dozen nations signed a climate treaty today to curb gas emissions, but three European countries considered taking much stronger action on their own.</p>
        <p>The new declaration by the European nations would commit signers to stabilize the emission of gases that trap heat in the atmosphere at 1990 levels, and then to make further cuts. It would also set a deadline of 2000 to reach stabilization.</p>
        <p>If the new declaration gains widespread support, it would embarrass the United States, which plans to sign the climate treaty but does not want to see it tightened.</p>
        <p>Scientists fear that rising levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases could cause a potentially catastrophic warming of the Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands presented the new proposal.  U.S. Still Opposed</p>
        <p>A United States delegate said Washington was strongly opposed to the proposal, seeing it as an attempt to rewrite a key provision of the climate treaty governing specific commitments to be made by industrial countries. The United States had persuaded the Europeans to accept far weaker treaty language by threatening that President Bush would not attend the Earth Summit.</p>
        <p>For the nations that endorse it, the new declaration would be in addition to the climate treaty. Countries could sign both the treaty, which would commit them to a minimum course of action, and the declaration, which would commit them to go further.</p>
        <p>Hugo Haider, the Austrian Minister of Environment, said a decision on whether to offer the proposal formally would be made this week.</p>
        <p>President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil became the first head of government to sign the climate treaty, in a 20-minute ceremony at which Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the United Nations acknowledged that the agreement "falls short of the initial hopes of many negotiators." What Treaty Demands</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boutros-Ghali said the treaty contains important commitments. "One may hope," he said, "that its very modesty will motivate governments and observers to maintain constructive pressure" to strengthen the treaty as the nature of the warming threat and its economic implications become clearer.</p>
        <p>The treaty commits signatories to stabilize concentrations of heat-trapping gases at environmentally safe levels over the long term. Because concentrations are continuing to build up at present rates of emission, the objective could be achieved only by reducing emissions.</p>
        <p>As a first step, the treaty requires industrial countries, which emit most of the gases, to cap emissions at 1990 levels, but it sets no timetable. Instead, the industrial nations would simply recognize that returning to "earlier levels" of emissions by the end of this decade would advance the treaty's overall objective.</p>
        <p>The treaty also sets up a process for inspecting each nation's progress and for taking stronger action, if necessary, as more becomes known about the threat. The 12 That Signed</p>
        <p>In addition to Brazil, the treaty was signed by Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Belgium, Finland, Iceland, Israel, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Uruguay.</p>
        <p>Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, who offered the proposal to make the climate treaty more effective, were among the leaders in pushing for a stronger treaty in the first place.</p>
        <p>The three countries "are very frustrated and are trying to put the limelight on the countries that have weakened the treaty," said Richard Mott, of the World Wildlife Fund. "They are trying to defeat lowest-common-denominator politics."</p>
        <p>A separate agreement by the Europeans "would be very embarrassing to the United States," said Liz Barratt-Brown, of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Why U.S. Objects</p>
        <p>The United States objects that the initiative seeks to return the treaty to the discussion stage rather than put its provisions into effect.</p>
        <p>Washington maintains that energy-efficiency programs already under way will bring the United States very close to meeting a deadline of 2000, but that it does not want to be compelled to meet the deadline because it cannot be sure of doing so without cost to the nation's economy.</p>
        <p>The climate treaty will go into effect when 50 countries ratify it. Backers said they were confident that many more than 50 nations would sign it, the first step toward ratification, before the Earth Summit ends on June 14. It will remain open for signing for a year.</p>
        <p>THE EARTH SUMMIT  Correction:  June 6, 1992, Saturday</p>
        <p>An article yesterday about a climate treaty being signed at the Earth Summit included incorrect information from the Austrian delegation about the title of an Austrian official, Hugo Haider. He is deputy director general of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Youth and Family, not the Minister of Environment.</p>
