        <p>Dinosaurs were unlucky 65 million years ago when a meteor struck off the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico; they died out in the environmental cataclysm that followed. But dinosaurs were beneficiaries of an earlier mass extinction 200 million years ago that killed off a competing group of animals and enabled dinosaurs to flourish for the next 135 million years.</p>
        <p>New evidence from rocks in British Columbia indicates that the earlier extinction, which wiped out 80 percent of all species at the end of the Triassic geological period and the beginning of the Jurassic, happened in a geologic instant, in 50,000 years or perhaps as few as 100. The findings offer a tantalizing suggestion that another cataclysmic meteor impact might be to blame.</p>
        <p>During the Triassic, early dinosaurs competed with a group of mammal-like reptiles. While many dinosaurs died off at the end of the Triassic, none of the mammal-like reptiles survived.</p>
        <p>''For whatever reason the dinosaurs squeak through and the mammal-like reptiles don't,'' said Dr. Peter D. Ward, a professor of earth and space sciences at the University of Washington who led the research. ''It really opens the world to the age of dinosaurs as we know it.''</p>
        <p>The researchers have also found soccer-ball-shaped carbon molecules known as buckyballs in the layer of rock corresponding to the extinctions. Buckyballs, presumably formed in outer space and scattered over Earth's surface when the meteor struck, have recently been associated with two other mass extinctions, the dinosaur-killing impact of 65 million years ago at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and the Permian-Triassic extinctions of 250 million years ago.</p>
        <p>All three extinctions also coincided with massive volcanic eruptions, so if scientists verify the meteor impacts they would have to explain the highly unlikely coincidences.</p>
        <p>Large meteor impacts and massive volcanic eruptions, which spew out hundreds of thousands of cubic miles of lava over hundreds of thousands of years, are both very rare events, occurring once every tens of millions of years.</p>
        <p>Most geophysicists dismiss the obvious inference -- that meteor impacts set off eruptions -- because their calculations indicate the impacts could not possibly release enough energy to rupture in Earth's crust thousands of miles away.</p>
        <p>In the work reported in the current issue of the journal Science, scientists led by Dr. Ward examined levels of carbon in rocks from the Queen Charlotte Islands off British Columbia. The rocks, once sediments of a tropical ocean, are among the few of that era that have survived largely intact and unchanged.</p>
        <p>The relative abundance of various varieties or isotopes of carbon were ''consistent with a sudden and planetary die-off of plants,'' Dr. Ward said. ''This is the first time that this indicator has been found.''</p>
        <p>The rocks also record the disappearance of many species of marine plankton at the same time as the change in carbon levels. Both shifts are sudden and are similar to what is seen in rocks that correspond to when the dinosaurs died out.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it's 50,000 years or less,'' Dr. Ward said. ''Maybe it's 100 years or less. I'd be surprised if it's more than 50,000 years. I wouldn't be surprised if it were 100 years.''</p>
        <p>To kill so many species so quickly points to an asteroid impact or possibly a nearby supernova, the explosion of a nearby star that would have stripped away Earth's protective ozone layer and exposed the surface to deadly ultraviolet radiation, Dr. Ward said.</p>
        <p>At a conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, next month, Dr. Jozsef Palfy, a curator of the Hungarian Natural History Museum, will present data showing a similar swing in carbon levels in rocks from Hungary. Dr. Palfy has not estimated over what period of time the swing took place.</p>
        <p>Most scientists regard climate changes caused by the gases from the massive volcanic eruptions as the most likely suspects for the Permian-Triassic and Triassic-Jurassic extinctions. The eruptions would appear unlikely to cause the quick die-offs indicated by Dr. Ward's data.</p>
        <p>''People are really scratching their heads,'' Dr. Ward said. ''Before it made sense. Now it doesn't.''</p>
        <p>In February, Dr. Luann Becker, a visiting professor at the University of Washington, reported that she found buckyballs containing extraterrestrial gases at the Permian-Triassic boundary, the first direct evidence of a meteor impact coinciding with that mass extinction.</p>
        <p>Randall S. Perry, a graduate student of Dr. Ward's working with Dr. Becker's laboratory, found buckyballs in the British Columbia rocks at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, but not above or below the boundary. To date, however, those buckyballs have not contained any extraterrestrial gases.</p>
