        <p>IT is visible from outer space yet is mostly buried under dirt. It cost $600 million to build, but the value of its product is unknown. It is a fabulously futuristic device, yet it is designed to recreate something that may have existed for a flash at the Big Bang -- 15 billion years ago.</p>
        <p>Meet Long Island's newest and surely most unusual neighbor. It is RHIC, which is pronounced Rick and stands for Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. It is designed to smash gold ions to create a never-seen form of matter called quark-gluon plasma.</p>
        <p>But don't be intimidated by the high-tech name or the heavy-duty science involved. People all around the world will soon be hearing a lot more about RHIC as it finally begins operating at Brookhaven National Laboratory's gently rolling 5,300-acre campus here. The start-up is planned for later this month.</p>
        <p>RHIC's research will profoundly advance human understanding of the cosmos, scientists say. Experts also predict that RHIC will produce an academic and economic Big Bang for Long Island.</p>
        <p>''If they find quark-gluon plasma at Brookhaven, they'll be the nuclear physics capital of the world, at least for a while,'' said Phillip F. Schewe, chief science writer at the American Institute of Physics, the world's largest publisher of physics journals. ''Even if they find nothing else, that'll be a terrific achievement -- and we hope they'll find other exotic nuclear states as well. It'll open a new chapter in science, depending on how novel the discoveries are. It's nice to be in the limelight when you have the most energy, the most intensity, the very best machinery there is, and that's where Brookhaven Lab will be for 5 or 10 years'' until a bigger, better collider is completed in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>RHIC also marks a fresh start for Brookhaven Lab after a series of problems in recent years. Those difficulties culminated in a management shakeup and a recent federal decision to close the high flux beam reactor, the lab's centerpiece, which had leaked radioactive tritium.</p>
        <p>''It was a great victory for the lab to complete RHIC, a shot in the arm for a place that has been criticized for its past environmental behavior,'' said John H. Marburger, director of the lab since 1998. ''The lab needs a success like this to restore the confidence. It comes at an important time. The closing of the high flux beam reactor certainly was a blow to morale, and it removed a research tool from our arsenal. The RHIC machine is here because it builds on things done in the past, but it really is part of a new era.''</p>
        <p>When RHIC starts running, the scene will resemble something from a science-fiction movie.</p>
        <p>''There's a control room that is really more impressive than the flight deck on 'Star Trek,' '' Dr. Marburger said. ''The whole RHIC operation is simulated on computer screens, and when the time comes, they do push a button, and there will be the first ion collisions.''</p>
        <p>Those collisions will come at intersections of two opposing beams of ions. They will be whizzing around at nearly the speed of light inside a roughly circular 2.4-mile tunnel -- a track just a tenth of mile shorter than the Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- that is covered by a 13-foot high earthen berm. ''It's so big you can see it from outer space, in satellite pictures,'' Dr. Marburger said.</p>
        <p>Although champagne corks may pop as ions collide, there will not be a Hollywood-style eureka moment. That is because the digital data captured by four electronic detectors stationed around the ring -- two of them as big as three-story warehouses -- will produce so much data that computers will take hours or even a day or so to digest and confirm the first collisions. ''It's not like a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral where you see instantly whether it happens or doesn't happen,'' said Thomas W. Ludlam, the associate director of RHIC's construction.</p>
        <p>Besides pioneering in science, RHIC promises to usher in a new era for Long Island, its proponents say. RHIC epitomizes the high-tech future that business leaders envision for the Island, supplanting the faded aerospace industry of yore.</p>
        <p>''This gives Long Island boasting rights,'' Dr. Marburger said. ''Long Islanders contributed significantly to the technology that put a man on the moon. This is the physics equivalent of putting a man on the moon. This machine was made on Long Island, by Long Islanders. There are 1,700 magnets in that thing made by Grumman, and they all work. We should be just as proud of that as we are of the great airplanes Grumman made.''</p>
        <p>RHIC is also raising hopes for economic development. ''The collider has real dollar value as well as the esoteric scientific value,'' said the Long Island Regional Planning Board's executive director, Lee E. Koppelman. ''It fits right in with our plans to make Long Island a high-tech area, just as it was the cradle of aviation. It's very exciting. The potential is almost unlimited for spin-offs in research, new commodities, new industrial applications.''</p>
        <p>It is too early for experts to predict what advances RHIC may spawn. ''Will it cure cancer or feed starving people?'' said Dr. Schewe. ''From the time of Socrates and before, people have tried to understand how things work, and when they did, nobody asked Socrates, 'Are we going to have transistor radios soon because of what you're doing?' But many times, studying abstruse nature has resulted in life-saving and labor-saving devices.''</p>
        <p>Since its founding in 1947, Brookhaven Lab has acquired a long record of useful research. It includes the discovery or development of L-dopa to treat Parkinson's disease, maglev train technology, the link between salt and high blood pressure, multigrade motor oils, thallium-201 for heart stress tests, positron emission tomography (PET) medical imaging, synthetic insulin for diabetics, the first video game, a foam that eliminates asbestos in fireproofing without affecting fire resistance and bacteria that eat toxic waste.</p>
        <p>Brookhaven scientists are or recently have been working on Lyme disease, ozone pollution, the common cold, brown tide, AIDS, the greenhouse effect, cotton genes, a faster but quieter jackhammer, carbon dating of ancient bone flutes excavated in China and a drug that in animal experiments stops cravings for heroin, cocaine, alcohol and nicotine.</p>
        <p>But this record of research has been marred in recent years by a series of missteps and setbacks that have drawn a chorus of criticism from public officials and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Pollution caused by decades of bad practices and loose regulation earned the Brookhaven campus a designation as a federal Superfund site. It requires an estimated $260 million in cleanup efforts, which have begun. The discovery in 1997 of the tritium leak prompted a public outcry. The government tried to appease residents worried about the safety of their private wells by hooking them up to municipal water.</p>
        <p>Eventually the lab's owner, the U.S. Department of Energy, removed the site's founding managers, Associated Universities, Inc. Then the government installed a new team, Brookhaven Science Associates, which is a joint venture of SUNY-Stony Brook and Battelle Memorial Institute of Columbus, Ohio, which helps manage three of the Energy Department's eight other national laboratories. But even the new management suffered a reversal when Energy Secretary Bill Richardson decided last November against reopening the shuttered high flux beam reactor, whose shiny dome has served as the lab's photogenic icon.</p>
        <p>Not everyone welcomes RHIC or agrees that the laboratory has changed its stripes.</p>
        <p>''Our biggest concern is the danger of beam loss, resulting in the release of radioactivity,'' said Scott M. Cullen, counsel to an East End environmental group, Standing for Truth About Radiation. Beam loss occurs when the ion stream goes off course.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cullen accused the lab of failing to do a full-fledged environmental review for RHIC, and he voiced concern about the research being used for weaponry. As for the new management, he said: ''They are certainly more accessible than the old administration, but it's more P.R. fluff. It's one thing to get them to talk; it's another thing to get them to actually do something.''</p>
        <p>Laboratory officials say that all the environmental rules have been complied with, and that RHIC will not be used for the military.''There is a potential for beam loss,'' Dr. Ludlam said, but he added that  the equipment is heavily shielded and has numerous beam monitors, as well as monitored test wells. ''There is no danger to the general public,'' he said, ''not even to someone who would be right at the machine.''</p>
        <p>Residents around the laboratory are sharply divided.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is just very excited about having a cutting-edge research tool in our backyard, bringing a positive image to our area,'' said Janice L. Schaefer, president of the Mastic Beach Property Owners Association and a member of the lab's Community Advisory Council. After touring RHIC, she said: ''I was totally awed by it. It's mind-boggling.'' Her group has not criticized the lab in the past, even on its pollution problems, she said, adding, ''They're working diligently on the clean-up.''</p>
        <p>On the opposite side is Ginny Levin of Manorville, a leader in the anti-nuclear Shad Alliance. ''I live just about seven miles downstream and downwind from Brookhaven Lab,'' she said. ''I have no intention of taking the tour of RHIC. There's a lot of disinformation about it. They think it's the biggest, the glitziest, the latest, greatest thing. But they're still storing, shipping and leaking waste into the air and the water. I don't see much difference at the lab except they're a little more glib.''</p>
        <p>Academia is turned on by RHIC. ''Its very, very exciting in terms of just the fizz, not only because of the machines but also because of the people, the bringing of very bright scholars together in new ways,'' said SUNY-Stony Brook's president, Shirley Strum Kenny. ''There's a big thrust of Long Island getting it together, in terms of business, economic changes, research and new populations. It's a time of great energy and synergy.''</p>
        <p>Leading scientists are being drawn to RHIC, experts say. ''We've reversed the brain drain from Long Island,'' Dr. Marburger said.</p>
        <p>The laboratory hopes to repeat its coups of past decades when it recruited top researchers who won four Nobel prizes for their studies here. Three prizes were generated by work at just one accelerator, the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, a 40-year-old device that is still in use and will aid in RHIC's operations.</p>
        <p>Every year the Brookhaven lab draws about 4,000 visiting researchers, not just from universities but also from corporations like IBM, Exxon and pharmaceutical companies. So many researchers come that it is hard to house them all. ''In the summer we rent dorm space at Dowling,'' Dr. Marburger said, ''because we don't have enough room here.''</p>
        <p>Long Island's business community lobbied for the government funds that financed RHIC, and executives delight at the local spending that the laboratory stimulates. ''They've talked to us about building a hotel there or additional housing to handle the scientists who come from all over the world,'' said Mitchell H. Pally, vice president of the Long Island Association. ''RHIC raises the perception of B.N.L. as one of the premier research institutions in the world. It's a jewel in our crown.''</p>
        <p>In a study of the economic ripple effect, a 1995 Suffolk County planning report concluded that each job at the laboratory, which has a staff of 3,000, generates two other jobs off campus. The lab's annual budget has remained steady at about $400 million in recent years, and RHIC's operations will account for about a fourth of that total. About 1,000 scientists will be working on RHIC's research on a regular basis, 400 of them on site and the rest scattered in some 50 countries.</p>
        <p>What if RHIC doesn't work? Initial glitches that require fine-tuning are possible, as happened last summer when RHIC had a dress rehearsal by circulating the gold ion beams, though not colliding them. But suppose the theory or design behind RHIC is fatally flawed?</p>
        <p>''If they don't find quark-gluon plasma at RHIC, which is possible because it's hard to find, it'll just be one more step and some other machine will find it,'' said Albert Ghiorso, a nuclear scientist at Berkeley. But he added, ''I think it's going to succeed, and I'm very happy about it.''</p>
        <p>Most experts say it is highly unlikely that RHIC will flop. Stony Brook's vice president for Brookhaven Lab affairs, Robert L. McGrath, said: ''I think it's incredibly unlikely. We don't know enough about quark-gluon plasma to know exactly when, but the phenomenon almost surely has to happen.''</p>
        <p>One tantalizing indication that RHIC is on the right track came from an episode of friendly competition earlier this year when the CERN laboratory in Switzerland announced that it had found indirect, circumstantial evidence of the quark-gluon plasma.</p>
        <p>Was CERN, which is already building the ultimate successor to RHIC, trying to steal its cosmic thunder in advance? ''I don't blame them for making that claim,'' said Dr. Schewe. ''They wanted a piece of the glory, if that's coming. It was an exciting announcement.''</p>
        <p>At CERN, the chief of experimental physics, Giorgio Goggi, said: ''We feel that competition is one of the driving forces of research, but there is no envy. Collaboration takes place every day. We here at CERN found some evidence of a new state of matter. RHIC is a wonderful machine and is there to make the discovery and to prove what we saw as just a hint.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger said: ''It doesn't bother me. They did some interesting stuff, and it's really good. In fact, if they hadn't seen anything, that would have worried me.''</p>
        <p>Just as RHIC will someday be eclipsed, it owes its own existence to past institutional rivalries, policy reversals and leapfrogging projects.</p>
        <p>Back in the 1970's, Brookhaven spent $80 million digging a 2.4-mile tunnel and refrigeration system for what was to have been the Intersecting Storage Accelerator, known as Isabelle. But before the rest of the equipment was installed, scientists and government officials aborted that project to focus instead on a huge 54-mile-long accelerator in Texas. But that project, too, was abandoned in a budget cutback.</p>
        <p>As the nation's science planners were casting about for the next big project to build, they decided that its should be a collider. The leaders of Brookhaven Laboratory seized on the opportunity to redeem their thwarted efforts on Isabelle. They touted its dormant tunnel as a ready-made site, just sitting here waiting to be equipped and put to use. Their argument carried the day, although the work itself took nine years to finish.</p>
        <p>There was one mild regret on the Brookhaven campus about the RHIC project. It came from some staff members who had taken advantage of Isabelle's prolonged down time to use the empty track for private recreation. ''The only contentious thing,'' Dr. Ludlam recalled, ''was we had to convince people they could no longer use the tunnel for roller blading.''</p>
        <p>So now the world's new frontier of nuclear physics is about to open here, with gold ion beams zooming around the track where the banished skaters once played.</p>
