        <p>Stories of culture clashes captivated jurors and audiences alike at the Sundance Film Festival, as films featuring Sudanese refugees in the United States, Central American migrants in Mexico, a Chinese girl in Canada, a Korean girl in Japan and Latino-gay friction in Los Angeles all took home major awards Saturday.</p>
        <p>For the first time in the festival's 22 years, Sundance jurors and audience members gave the same two films grand prizes in the documentary and dramatic competitions. ''God Grew Tired of Us,'' a look at the so-called lost boys of the Sudan and their relocation to the United States, swept both documentary awards, and ''Quinceañera,'' the coming-of-age story of a Hispanic girl in a gentrifying Los Angeles neighborhood, won the dramatic prizes.</p>
        <p>''God Grew Tired of Us,'' directed by Christopher Quinn, shines a light on strife in southern Sudan, and follows three men from the Kakuna refugee camp in Kenya as they journey to Pittsburgh and Syracuse, cope with staggering culture shock and then try to adjust to their new surroundings while supporting friends and relatives left behind in the refugee camp.</p>
        <p>Beyond the prizes for its director, the film won a large donation for one of its three main characters: after a Sundance screening, a Texas woman wrote a $25,000 check to one of the men to help him build a medical clinic in his home village in Sudan. (This was not the only such gesture at the festival: after a screening on Tuesday of ''Black Gold,'' a documentary about the treatment of Ethiopian farmers who grow coffee for Starbucks, a Park City doctor wrote a $10,000 check to help finish building a village school for the farmers in the film.)</p>
        <p>''Quinceañera,'' written and directed by Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, follows Magdalena (Emily Rios), approaching her 15th birthday, as she is kicked out of her house when she finds she is pregnant and then forms a makeshift family unit with her great-grand-uncle and a gay cousin.</p>
        <p>Neither film had a domestic distributor as of Saturday night, but buyers were said to be actively pursuing both. For the most part, the awards honored films that had been similarly passed over by acquisition executives.</p>
        <p>Two other films, out of 120 in the festival, won multiple honors. ''A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,'' which received mixed critical reviews, won the dramatic directing award for Dito Montiel, who also wrote the screenplay, based on his youth in Astoria, Queens. The story of a difficult homecoming, with flashbacks to a harsh youth, the film was also given a special jury prize for best ensemble performance, by a cast including Robert Downey Jr., Shia La Boeuf, Rosario Dawson, Chazz Palminteri, Dianne Wiest and Channing Tatum.</p>
        <p>And James Longley, director of ''Iraq in Fragments'' -- a close-up look at Iraq through the eyes of an 11-year-old mechanic in Baghdad, a young Shiite revolutionary in the south and a Kurdish shepherd who wants to become a doctor -- received the documentary directing and cinematography awards. The film's editors -- Billy McMillin, Fiona Otway and Mr. Longley -- won the festival's first documentary editing prize.</p>
        <p>The dramatic screenwriting award went to Hilary Brougher, the writer and director of ''Stephanie Daley,'' an intense look at a pregnant psychologist (Tilda Swinton) and a defendant she must evaluate: a teenager (Amber Tamblyn) accused of killing her own baby.</p>
        <p>Tom Richmond, the director of photography for ''Right at Your Door,'' a thriller about a terrorist attack on Los Angeles that was picked up by Lionsgate, won the dramatic cinematography award.</p>
        <p>In the world cinema division, the jury prize for documentaries was awarded to ''In the Pit (En El Hoyo),'' by Juan Carlos Rulfo, about workers building the second deck of an enormous freeway that encircles Mexico City. Tin Dirdamal's ''DeNADIE (No One)'' about Central and South Americans and their arduous border crossings en route to Mexico and the United States, won the audience prize.</p>
        <p>Gela Babluani's ''13 Tzameti,'' a noir thriller with Hitchcock influences, won the world jury prize for drama. ''No. 2,'' directed by the New Zealander Toa Fraser, about an elderly Fijian woman (Ruby Dee) whose family has forgotten how to party and who demands that they have a giant feast, won the world cinema audience prize.</p>
        <p>Two special jury prizes for documentary were awarded: one to Michael Cain and Matt Radecki's ''TV Junkie,'' a harsh look at a drug addict's struggle that uses 3,000 hours of videotapes he made of his own life; and another to Ian Inaba, director of ''American Blackout,'' a provocative look at black disenfranchisement in the 2004 election.</p>
        <p>(Two other Sundance documentaries brought presidential elections to mind: ''An Unreasonable Man,'' about Ralph Nader, and ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' which features Al Gore delivering an alarming presentation on global warming. The Gore film was in a different category, so the Nader film, which was in competition, could not steal votes from it.)</p>
        <p>In keeping with this year's taste for culture clash, three Asian assimilation stories won special jury prizes. So Yong Kim's ''In Between Days,'' a minimalist look at a teenage Korean girl's dislocation in her new American home, won one for ''independent vision.'' Julia Kwan's ''Eve and the Fire Horse,'' about a Chinese girl in Vancouver in the 1970's, received one for world drama. And Yonghi Yang's ''Dear Pyongyang,'' a look at a pair of Koreans fiercely loyal to the North through the eyes of their Japanese-born daughter, was given one of two special jury prizes for world documentary.</p>
        <p>The other went to ''Into Great Silence,'' a quiet look inside a monastery in the French Alps, directed by Philip Groening.</p>
        <p>The $20,000 Alfred P. Sloan Prize, for the portrayal of science or scientists on film, was given to ''The House of Sand (Casa de Areia),'' directed by Andrucha Waddington, an epic drama set in the Brazilian desert.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 1, 2006, Wednesday  An article in The Arts on Monday about awards at the Sundance Film Festival misspelled the name of a refugee camp in Kenya that is shown in ''God Grew Tired of Us,'' which won the jurors' and audience's awards for best documentary. It is Kakuma, not Kakuna.</p>
