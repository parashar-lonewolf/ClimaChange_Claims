        <p>AGAINST THE TIDE</p>
        <p>The Battle for America's Beaches.</p>
        <p>By Cornelia Dean.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 279 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Columbia University Press. $26.95.</p>
        <p>Americans love the seashore. A growing majority of us (including this writer) live within an hour's drive of it. What is the source of this allure? Natural beauty and fresh seafood play a part, of course, but the main attraction probably is the beach. The pleasures of congregating in seminudity on hot sand are somehow vital to modern civilization. Cornelia Dean's ''Against the Tide'' warns, however, that Americans may not have beaches much longer or, at least, the public beaches that defined so much of 20th-century culture may fade as upkeep becomes more expensive.</p>
        <p>America's seashores are in trouble. Hundreds of miles are urbanized, wildlife is dwindling or contaminated and the destruction has accelerated since the trouble became obvious in the 1960's. Yet the environmental journalist who opens this Pandora's box faces a daunting task trying to describe it. Where to begin? Water pollution? Fisheries destruction? Wetlands loss? Dean, the science editor of The New York Times, addresses the problem adroitly by concentrating on the beach.</p>
        <p>Beaches are so important as social milieus that they may not seem natural, but they are. Dean does an excellent job of explaining how they evolve and function. Beaches are among the most dynamic geological phenomena, their workings so massive and subtle that scientists have yet to understand them. We know that they form as coastal currents transport sand flushed from river mouths and deposit it along the shore. The currents, and factors like tides and storms, remove sand from shores as fast as they deposit it, so beaches must be continually replenished by more sand eroded from the land.</p>
        <p>On the Pacific coast, where colliding tectonic plates push the land upward, most beaches form in bays between steep headlands. On the geologically more quiescent Atlantic and gulf coasts, most form at the seaward edge of long barrier islands. In all cases, they function as buffers between land and sea, protecting terrestrial habitats from flooding. Storms can destroy them overnight, but newly deposited sand quickly rebuilds them under natural circumstances.</p>
        <p>Wide beaches prevailed on North America's coasts when Europeans arrived. Dean's descriptions of them -- they lasted into the late 19th century -- are like something from another world. Long Island's were ''spectacular expanses of fine-grained, light gray sand, hundreds of yards wide, backed by grass-covered dunes as much as 15 or 20 feet high.'' Many stretched for scores of miles, and often were the main travel routes for settlers. Beaches began to dwindle, however, as urban Americans discovered the shore. The reason is simple and ironic. Beaches depend for existence on wide-open natural processes, but people cannot live in large numbers on the shore without interfering with those processes.</p>
        <p>Coastal processes include violent events such as storms, and burgeoning coastal communities quickly encountered terrifying situations. Dean makes the terror graphically clear in her first chapter, on the destruction of Galveston in 1900. The thousands who died in a September hurricane were strewn across the Texas coast so gruesomely that military authorities had to force laborers at gunpoint to collect them. Communities responded by ''armoring'' the shore, protecting houses and streets with sea walls, jetties, groins and other structures. But that armoring interrupted the flow of beach-nourishing waters -- not only coastal currents that bring sand to beaches but tides and waves that rebuild them. Starved of sand, beaches melted away. Where hundreds of feet of dry sand once separated communities from the surf, high-tide lines crept to the bases of sea walls, and strollers now must clamber over obstacle courses of concrete and steel.</p>
        <p>Americans responded with more technology, replacing lost sand artificially. Dean shows that many beaches where sunbathers congregate today are man-made, their sands pumped from elsewhere. Artificial beaches are vulnerable to the same erosion that destroys natural ones, so we are faced with a costly cycle of repeatedly replacing beaches. Storms can snatch away not only a new beach but the machinery that made it. The situation is heart-rending for hundreds of coastal communities, and Dean tries to be evenhanded about its complexities. Indeed, she cites so many specific cases that her narrative occasionally slows under the weight of detail. The upshot seems clear: America can't expect to preserve its beaches if it keeps destroying them with coastal construction -- especially at a time when a projected sea-level rise from global warming compounds the problem.</p>
        <p>The only lasting solution to loss of beaches will be a halt to (or even a reversal of) urban growth along them. Dean points to some hopeful trends. Communities and conservation groups are buying beaches to stop owners building on them. Ten national seashores protect several hundred miles of beach. (Only one is on the West Coast, unfortunately.) Government is less willing to subsidize beach development or bail out property owners. Insuring beach structures is getting harder.</p>
        <p>Yet conservation lags far behind growth, and the prospect of an urban withdrawal from the beach seems distant. As Dean points out, the consequences of wholesale coastal urbanization could be ghastly. If a ''worst case'' Category 5 hurricane hit southern Florida, for example, the havoc wreaked by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 would be small by comparison, since that weaker, Category 4 storm missed downtown Miami. ''Hurricane Andrew should be remembered as a narrow escape, a warning about what can happen when people overdevelop the coast,'' Dean writes. Hurricanes constitute only one threat. Dean overlooks a Western one -- tidal waves or tsunamis from earthquakes.</p>
        <p>Impending disasters point up a limitation of Dean's strategy of building her case against coastal urbanization around beaches. Controlling urbanization on beaches would save beaches, money and lives. It would not prevent huge destruction in a big hurricane or tsunami, since such events can reach well inland. Saving beaches will not save the coasts if urban proliferation continues unchecked nearby. Beach conservation could be a keystone for building a coastwide conservation system, but not the whole edifice.</p>
        <p>Such limitations probably are unavoidable, however, at a time when environmental problems have receded from the public's attention. Dean has done a first-rate job of making coastal conservation interesting. ''Against the Tide'' would be good beach reading.</p>
