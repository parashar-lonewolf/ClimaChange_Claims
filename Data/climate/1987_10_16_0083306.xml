        <p>LEAD: The Justice Department asked a Federal judge today to admonish the special prosecutor in the perjury case against Michael K. Deaver for attempting to coerce the Canadian Ambassador to testify at the trial of the former White House aide.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department asked a Federal judge today to admonish the special prosecutor in the perjury case against Michael K. Deaver for attempting to coerce the Canadian Ambassador to testify at the trial of the former White House aide.</p>
        <p>In a harshly worded court motion, the department said renewed attempts by the prosecutor, Whitney North Seymour Jr., to obtain trial testimony from the Ambassador were ''inappropriate and inimical to the foreign policy interests of the United States.''</p>
        <p>''Canada should not now be subject to what reasonably can be perceived as an attempt to coerce relinquishment of its rights,'' the motion said.</p>
        <p>The department joined with the State Department in protesting a letter, dated Oct. 2, that was sent by Mr. Seymour to a lawyer for the Canadian Embassy.</p>
        <p>In the letter, Mr. Seymour said that unless Ambassador Allan E. Gotlieb testified at Mr. Deaver's trial, prosecutors would be forced to ''place much greater emphasis at trial on the unlawful acts engaged in by Deaver when he was working for the Canadian Government.'' Meetings About Acid Rain</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver, the former White House deputy chief of staff, is scheduled to go on trial Monday on charges that he lied to a Federal grand jury when, among other things, he denied knowledge of meetings that occurred before he left the Administration in 1985.</p>
        <p>The grand jury had been investigating whether Mr. Deaver, who formed a multimillion-dollar lobbying business after he left the White House, violated Federal conflict of interest laws in his lobbying efforts. Among his clients was the Government of Canada.</p>
        <p>According to the perjury indictment, the meetings in question involved acid rain, an issue that has strained Canadian-American relations in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour, who has consistently refused to talk with reporters about the case, declined to comment again today.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration has been embarrassed by its inability to restrain Mr. Seymour, who, as a special prosecutor, is answerable to almost no one. And today's motion was a further sign of the Administration's frustration in dealing with an official who represents the United States but at the same time is essentially independent of the Government. Diplomatic Immunity Cited</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour, the former United States Attorney in Manhattan, caused a furor last May when he attempted to subpoena Mr. Gotlieb, describing him as an essential prosecution witness.</p>
        <p>In its eight-page motion filed in Federal District Court here, the Justice Department said the Ambassador was clearly protected by diplomatic immunity and could not be forced to testify at Mr. Deaver's trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour's Oct. 2 letter, the department said, ''caused a significant irritation in relations between the United States and Canada.'' It added, ''Canada understandably perceives the independent counsel's letter as an attempt to pressure it, under a threat to embarrass that government, to relinquish its rights under international law.''</p>
