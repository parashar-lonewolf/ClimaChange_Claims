        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Congresswoman Marge Roukema did not, in the end, vote for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by voting for an energy bill last summer, as your article (''Pushed to the Margins, She Stood Her Ground,'' cover, Jan. 6) suggests.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Congresswoman Marge Roukema did not, in the end, vote for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by voting for an energy bill last summer, as your article (''Pushed to the Margins, She Stood Her Ground,'' cover, Jan. 6) suggests. She joined every other member of New Jersey's Congressional delegation in backing an amendment to the energy bill that sought to remove the controversial Arctic drilling provision.</p>
        <p>Regrettably, she did support final passage of the legislation, which doled out more than $30 billion in tax breaks for big energy corporations like Enron and did nothing to increase the fuel efficiency or our cars and trucks or to require use of renewable energy resources. As a result of not tackling the demand side of the energy equation, her vote actually threatens to increase our dependency on the Middle East. Still, Mrs. Roukema at least made the right call when it came to the fate of the refuge.</p>
