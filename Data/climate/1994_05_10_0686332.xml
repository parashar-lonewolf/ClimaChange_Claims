        <p>THE waters of the Atlantic Ocean deep below the course of Christopher Columbus's 1492 voyage have warmed by nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit in the last 35 years, oceanographers have discovered, a finding that has important implications for the study of global climate change.</p>
        <p>The oceans are a critical part of the climate system because they absorb, store, move and eventually release heat, the system's main driving force. Mathematical models of the system predict that sea-surface temperatures should rise by 3 to 7 degrees if, as many scientists expect, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide double in the next 100 years. The gas, which traps heat in the atmosphere, is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of the ocean warming detected by the new observations is "broadly consistent" with model predictions of ocean warming for a doubling of carbon dioxide, the oceanographers say in an article in the current issue of the British journal Nature. But the researchers found that the greatest warming has taken place not at the surface, as the models predict, but rather at depths of half a mile to 1.6 miles. The average depth of the Atlantic is 2.2 miles.</p>
        <p>This warming in the deep ocean is "surprisingly large; it surprised us, anyway," said Dr. Harry Bryden, one of the researchers. Dr. Bryden is a physical oceanographer at the James Rennell Center for Ocean Circulation in Southampton, England.</p>
        <p>Equally surprising, Dr. Bryden said, the warming was remarkably uniform across the entire Atlantic basin along the latitude of 24 degrees north, the latitude of the Bahamas and roughly that of Columbus's first voyage. The scientific expedition took place in 1992 as an "oceanographic tribute" to Columbus and his crew.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bryden said it is too early to tell whether the ocean warming is being caused by the carbon dioxide or is a product of natural variability.  Models are Evolving</p>
        <p>The observations suggest that some of the models of the earth's climate should be corrected, he said.  Although the models are the principal tools for predicting climatic change, they are imperfect and evolving.</p>
        <p>Based on the results of the models' simulation of the climate, he said, "I would have expected the warming to be largest at the surface," but instead, "we see a certain pattern of temperature change that doesn't particularly agree with most of the current models."</p>
        <p>That pattern emerged from measurements of water temperature made by lowering instruments into the sea at 101 points along the 24th parallel. The readings were compared with others taken along the same track in 1957 and 1981.</p>
        <p>They revealed that since 1957, the waters at a depth of 800 to 2,500 meters (0.5 to 1.6 miles) had consistently warmed. The warming was greatest at a depth of 1,100 meters, about two-thirds of a mile, where it amounted to 58-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit, a rate comparable to nearly 2 degrees per century.</p>
        <p>It may be, Dr. Bryden said, that the upper layers of the ocean really are warmest, as most models predict.  But it is impossible to tell, he said, because the pattern of surface warming was obscured by the effect of varying seasonal temperatures in the atmosphere, which modify the temperature of the sea's top layers. The upper few hundred meters of the ocean displayed both warming and cooling that could be attributed to the fact that readings were taken in different seasons.</p>
        <p>If this is true, the new observations "may not be very inconsistent" with what the latest and most sophisticated climate models show, said Ron Stouffer, a climate modeler at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University.</p>
        <p>In any event, the broader impact of a warming ocean is unclear. Scientists know that when the temperature of the deep ocean changes, it can lead to radically different patterns in the circulation of worldwide oceanic currents, and with them, changes in patterns of surface climate as well.</p>
        <p>Is this warming in the Atlantic causing changes in ocean circulation? "We don't know," Mr. Stouffer said.</p>
