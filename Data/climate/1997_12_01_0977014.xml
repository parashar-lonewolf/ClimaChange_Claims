        <p>IN its 4.5 billion years of existence, the earth has withstood both deep cold that nearly turned the entire planet into a ball of ice and blazing heat that opened the Arctic to alligators and other warm-weather creatures.</p>
        <p>Compared with that, and even with far less extreme climatic swings in the 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age, today's climate -- for all its sometimes sharp variations -- is remarkably stable.</p>
        <p>Now, for the first time, humans are altering the atmosphere in ways that mainstream scientists believe are threatening to shatter that relative calm and set off a new round of climatic disruptions and extremes.</p>
        <p>Starting today, representatives of some 150 countries will meet in Kyoto, Japan, to take what they hope will be the first step in a decades-long effort to cope with the prospect of global climate change. Rarely, if ever, has humanity made an attempt like this one: to exercise deliberate, collective foresight on a risk whose full impact is unclear and will not be felt for decades.</p>
        <p>And rarely has any question on the global bargaining table been so difficult.</p>
        <p>The negotiators' task is to agree on measures that would begin to reduce emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Chief among these ''greenhouse'' gases is carbon dioxide, which is spewed into the air every day around the globe by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas in power plants, factories and motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>The world runs on these fuels, and any action to control their use would reverberate in every corner of the global economy. This attempt to manipulate the world's energy system has set off a complex clash of economic and political interests.</p>
        <p>Among other things, it pits rich countries against poor ones, rich countries against one another and the nations and industries that produce fossil fuels (as well as some industries that use them heavily)  against much of the rest of the world. Even as the great majority of players say they accept the need for common action, each is making its own calculation of cost and benefit, advantage and disadvantage.</p>
        <p>The panel of scientists from  around the world who advise the negotiators under United Nations auspices has said that if no action is taken, the average surface temperature of the globe will rise by two to six degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, and more after that. That might not sound like much, and it is a far cry from the deepest cold and hottest heat of the remote past. But it is not trivial; the difference between the average temperature now and that at the depths of the last ice age, some 20,000 years ago, is only five to nine degrees.</p>
        <p>IT would be more warming, coming more rapidly, than the planet has experienced in the last 10,000 years, the period in which human civilization arose. It could profoundly affect the earth's climate.</p>
        <p>The seas would rise, according to the panel of scientists, inundating many coastal areas and swamping small island nations. The world as a whole would become rainier, with most of the increase coming in the big downpours that cause floods. At the same time, drought-prone areas would get more droughts.</p>
        <p>Climatic zones would shift away from the poles, the scientists predict.  Since the warming would be unusually rapid, many natural ecosystems might be unable to adjust, and whole forest types could disappear. Growing seasons are already lengthening in northern latitudes, and temperate-zone agriculture might benefit in the long run. But in dry areas, like much of Africa, warming could bring agricultural and economic ruin. Tropical diseases like malaria and dengue fever could spread. And while temperate-zone winters would be milder, summer heat waves would be more intense and deadly. The list goes on.</p>
        <p>Such forecasts, of course, are rife with uncertainty. But many scientists believe that much of the impact is unavoidable. The implication is that preventive action to head off the risk, however uncertain, should have been taken years ago.</p>
        <p>But who knew? It has been only two decades since 20th-century scientists, with their computer models, first began to make numerical forecasts of climate change, only one decade since the issue first burst into the public consciousness and only five years since the nations of the world gathered at Rio de Janeiro and signed a treaty aimed at preventing dangerous climatic change.</p>
        <p>For much of the last two decades, scientists have cited a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations -- to 560 parts per million from 280 parts per million before the Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th century -- as a threshold of concern. If that threshold should be reached, they say, the air at the earth's surface would warm by anywhere from a relatively moderate  three degrees to eight degrees, a level at which the impact of some of the predicted climatic changes could assume catastrophic proportions.</p>
        <p>Now many are saying that it may not be possible to prevent a doubling late in the next century. The world's economic and political systems cannot turn on a dime, they say, and they argue that the real task now is to prevent concentrations from growing beyond a doubling, to possibly even tripling or quadrupling. Those concentrations, they say, would bring certain climatic catastrophe. In the meantime, the world may have to learn to adapt.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is so pessimistic. Environmentalists' goal is to stabilize carbon dioxide concentrations at about one and a half times the preindustrial level, then to begin to gradually reduce them. Although that might still cause some disruption, they believe, it would head off the most damaging effects.</p>
        <p>There remain contrarians who say  the problem has been overblown and may not exist. Given the uncertainty that permeates climate science, even many experts who are not skeptics argue for modest action until the extent of the problem is clearer.</p>
        <p>As has been the case all along under the 1992 Rio treaty that governs the Kyoto talks, the industrialized countries are expected to take the lead in setting specific targets for reducing emissions. The rationale, based largely on considerations of equity, is that they got rich by burning fossil fuels and are responsible for most of the problem. But developing countries are also to undertake specific commitments at some point because their emissions will probably surpass those of the rich nations in two decades or so.</p>
        <p>When that will happen, and how, will be a big issue in Kyoto, possibly a deal-breaker. If the talks collapsed, the process would not be over because discussions would certainly resume at some point. But proponents of action argue that valuable time  would be lost.</p>
        <p>AT Rio five years ago, the rich nations adopted the voluntary goal of stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. But many nations, including the United States, will miss that target. Proposals now on the table for the meeting in Japan call for legally binding reductions.  They range from reducing the rich countries' emissions to 1990 levels by around 2010 (proposed by the United States) to cutting them to 35 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 (proposed by the developing countries). None of the proposals would reduce emissions enough to keep overall atmospheric concentrations from rising.</p>
        <p>But, given the political reality,  those proposals probably define the range of what can be achieved just now. Some environmentalists believe that it is possible to emerge from the talks with cuts sufficient to preserve the option of eventually stabilizing concentrations at one and a half times preindustrial levels. They also say it is possible in Kyoto to send a signal to industry that business as usual must change. Some experts who argue caution, on economic grounds, believe likewise. But other interested parties, including oil-producing countries and many American manufacturers, argue that any action now risks unacceptable short-term economic damage. Environmentalists counter that by insisting that in the long run, cutting fossil fuels would make the economy more efficient.</p>
        <p>At most, Kyoto will be a beginning, not an ending.</p>
