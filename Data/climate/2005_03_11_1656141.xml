        <p>The tough new pollution rule issued in Washington yesterday will drastically cut smog and soot over most of the Northeast, but it will be especially welcome in New York and New Jersey, which have been choking on dirty air from the Midwest for years.</p>
        <p>Officially the Clean Air Interstate Rule, it will significantly improve the health of people living in the region, officials said, reducing premature deaths and the incidence of several respiratory diseases, like asthma. Scrubbing pollutants from the air is also expected to practically put an end to the poisoning of forests and lakes from acid rain.</p>
        <p>The new Environmental Protection Agency rule, which imposes the sharpest pollution cuts in a decade, ''will give this generation and generations to come a lasting legacy of health,'' said Kathleen C. Callahan, acting administrator for the agency's Region 2, which includes New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But the cuts may not be deep enough, or come quickly enough, to satisfy everyone. ''We're anticipating that we will be challenging the rules as less than what the Clean Air Act requires and less than what public health demands,'' said Peter H. Lehner, chief of the Environmental Protection Bureau in the office of New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer.</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. Spitzer reached a settlement with the operators of six coal-fired power plants in New York to reduce pollution by up to 90 percent several years before the deadlines in the new federal rule. Mr. Lehner said the health benefits of removing those harmful emissions were so compelling that the federal government should require utilities that produce most of the pollution to comply as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>Under the new clean air rule, 28 states in the Midwest, the Northeast and as far south as Florida along with the District of Columbia were assigned caps for emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can cause soot and smog that can cross state borders. The states then have to come up with a plan to meet those thresholds.</p>
        <p>The environmental agency completed the rule one day after Congress failed to act on the Bush administration's clear skies bill, which would have given utilities more time to clean up emissions and set up a system for trading pollution credits.</p>
        <p>Under the regulatory standards established yesterday, the pollution each state can produce is capped far below current levels. The agency expects the first targets to be met by 2009 and the standards to be fully implemented by 2015. This will reduce levels of sulfur dioxide, which causes fine soot, by 70 percent, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to both soot and smog, by 60 percent. There is also a provision for trading pollution credits.</p>
        <p>Ms. Callahan said the new standards were principally aimed at cleaning up coal-burning power plants in the Midwest. It will cost the electric utilities that run the plants as much as $17 billion to install the new pollution control devices, she said.</p>
        <p>The investment in pollution control technology will be worth it, Ms. Callahan said, because cleaner air causes fewer illnesses, premature deaths and work days lost because of sickness. Reducing pollutants will also limit acid rain, one of the most serious environmental problems in the region for many years.</p>
        <p>''The new rule will fix our problems,'' said John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, which watches over the six-million-acre Adirondack Park in upstate New York. One in four of the lakes inside the park's boundaries have been damaged by acid rain.</p>
        <p>Over the next decade, Mr. Sheehan said, the new pollution controls will make it possible for the lakes to recover completely.</p>
