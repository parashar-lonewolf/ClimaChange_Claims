        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, in the first of several clean-air rules being issued between now and the election, established regulations today that will eventually cut in half permissible emissions of sulfur dioxide, a chemical that causes acid rain.</p>
        <p>The rule, which will take until the year 2010 to reach its goal, also allows utilities to buy and sell pollution allowances.</p>
        <p>The details of the new regulation, which is a central element of the Clean Air Act of 1990, have been generally welcomed by environmental organizations since they were published for comment a year ago.</p>
        <p>The agency is late publishing the rule, but it appears that its issuance just before the election is not entirely driven by politics, because the E.P.A. is obeying a court order.</p>
        <p>The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, said that this will be a "banner week" for issuing such regulations. However, he declined to say to what extent politics affected the timing.</p>
        <p>The next rule to be issued, on Tuesday, seeks to limit emissions of nitrogen oxide, another chemical that causes acid rain. Environmental groups have criticized the rule, saying they expect the agency to accept the technology that is not the most effective available for cutting emissions.</p>
        <p>Other rules that could be issued include those governing inspection of automobiles, emissions from steel mill coke ovens, and hazardous pollutants given off by chemical plants.</p>
        <p>President Bush has cited passage of the Clean Air Act in 1990 as a hallmark of his Administration and justification of his claim to be the "environmental President." Democrats and environmental groups have objected to Mr. Bush's claim, however, saying that in many ways the rules being written to enforce the law have been weakened by the White House.</p>
        <p>Blake Early, an official with the Sierra Club, said that the group objected to one element in the rules issued today, which would allow municipal waste incinerators that generate electricity to qualify for some of the pollution control allowances, most of which are granted to conventional utility generating stations. The Sierra Club argues that this provision encourages garbage incineration.</p>
