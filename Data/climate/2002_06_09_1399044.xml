        <p>IT'S official: Westchester County has terrible air.</p>
        <p>The American Lung Association announced last month that Westchester County failed a nationwide test of air quality, based on measures of ozone levels gathered over three years, from 1998 through 2000. Among the 26 counties tested in New York State, Westchester ranked seventh worst for dangerously high smog levels, behind counties in New York City and Suffolk, Putnam, Chatauqua and Erie Counties, according to the Association's State of the Air 2002 report.</p>

        <p>IT'S official: Westchester County has terrible air.</p>
        <p>The American Lung Association announced last month that Westchester County failed a nationwide test of air quality, based on measures of ozone levels gathered over three years, from 1998 through 2000. Among the 26 counties tested in New York State, Westchester ranked seventh worst for dangerously high smog levels, behind counties in New York City and Suffolk, Putnam, Chatauqua and Erie Counties, according to the Association's State of the Air 2002 report.</p>
        <p>In addition, the most recent ground-level ozone advisory for the New York metropolitan area, where ozone levels were expected to exceed health standards, occurred on April 16, the first ever before May, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>''The regional airshed is so nasty,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental health for the American Lung Association of New York State. He explained that the problem is insidious precisely because it is regional and not local.</p>
        <p>''The majority of pollutants drift eastward,'' Mr. Iwanowicz said. ''Like smoking and nonsmoking sections in restaurants, air pollution knows no bounds.''</p>
        <p>David Martin, executive director of the American Lung Association of Hudson Valley, agreed. ''We're downwind of everything,'' he said, adding that much of the county's ozone pollution originates in the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants as far away as the Midwest and as close as Orange and Rockland Counties. The other major source of the county's pollution comes from car and truck emissions, Mr. Martin said. ''Even though cars pollute less today, we're driving them farther and more often,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Thus, the noxious combination of pollution from smokestacks and tailpipes causes smog, also known as ozone, a kind of toxic soup, Mr. Martin said. (Ground-level ozone is not to be confused with ozone in the upper atmosphere.)</p>
        <p>Smog is formed in the atmosphere from nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds that get cooked in the sun and become ground level ozone, said Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency's regional New York office. ''We have a big pollution problem in the urban Northeast,'' Ms. Mears said, and Westchester County is part of that problem.</p>
        <p>Ozone is a ''respiratory irritant, and in high concentrations it will eat through rubber, so you can only imagine what it does to lungs,'' Mr. Iwanowicz said. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that ozone increases the incidence of asthma among children and worsens breathing among children and adults who suffer from respiratory problems, he said.</p>
        <p>On high ozone days, children with asthma at a camp in near Middletown, Conn., suffered a significantly higher number of asthma attacks, had more respiratory symptoms and a reduced ability to exhale, according to research conducted in the early 1990's by Dr. George Thurston, who studies the health effects of air pollution at the New York University School of Medicine. In an earlier study in 1984, he found that even children without asthma experienced diminished lung function on high pollution days.</p>
        <p>The health situation is worst in high traffic areas of Westchester County.</p>
        <p>''Children in close proximity to major highways have a higher risk of asthma,'' said Dr. Diana Lowenthal, a pediatric pulmonologist at the Westchester Medical Center Children's Hospital. This is true for children who live or go to school within 100 yards or so of Interstate 287, the Sprain Brook Parkway, the Saw Mill Parkway or the Hutchinson River Parkway, she said.</p>
        <p>Because Westchester is part of a large metropolitan area with serious smog problems, and because automobile traffic is increasing sharply, the rate of respiratory ailments among children is on the rise, Dr. Lowenthal said.</p>
        <p>The risks of smog and other kinds of air pollution go far beyond breathing problems, however.</p>
        <p>A graduate of the School of Public Health at Harvard, Dr. Thurston was principal investigator on the air pollution and cancer study that appeared in March in the Journal of the American Medical Association. In the study , Dr. Thurston and his colleagues demonstrated a link between long-term exposure to air pollution and premature death due to heart disease and lung cancer.</p>
        <p>He testified before the United States Senate about setting up a national health registry of chronic diseases, at the invitation of the bill's sponsor, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thurston said that breathing the air in some metropolitan areas, including New York, has the same cumulative effect on the lungs as living with a smoker.</p>
        <p>''Air pollution is relentless, because it's year after year of accumulation over a lifespan, and it can shorten life by one to two years,'' Dr. Thurston said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thurston said he was incensed by the Bush administration's response to pollution problems on the national and local levels.</p>
        <p>''Old power plants supply 50 percent of the power but put out 90 percent of the pollution, because there are no emission controls,'' he explained. They are like ''giant clunkers driving around,'' he said, leaving a potentially lethal trail of pollution wherever they go. Several years ago, the Clinton administration was trying to force older plants that were being renovated to install emission controls, even though the Clean Air Act required such controls for new plants only. The Bush administration, however, stopped trying to close that legal loophole, Dr. Thurston said, so those power plants are still polluting at extremely high levels.</p>
        <p>''If they enforced the provisions of the Clean Air Act on old energy plants, we'd see a significant improvement of air quality in the Northeast, both in ozone and fine particles,'' Dr. Thurston said. ''But the Bush administration hasn't shown a willingness to implement those provisions.''</p>
        <p>Local Democrats are equally disenchanted with Gov. George E. Pataki's approach to air pollution enforcement.</p>
        <p>''The air is getting worse under Governor Pataki,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, state assemblyman for the 86th District. ''The governor does a good job buying open spaces, but when it comes to dealing with corporate polluters, he's nowhere.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky introduced a bill, passed by the Assembly in March, that would limit the amount of mercury, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emitted by power plants statewide. A similar bill, also passed by the Assembly in April, would limit the amount of sulfur in gasoline, diesel fuel and home heating oil, as well as prohibit idling by heavy-duty vehicles for more than three minutes.</p>
        <p>The State Senate has until late June to pass either or both of these bills, but, said Mr. Iwanowicz, ''In all likelihood, if it doesn't happen by June, they won't get enacted.'' So far, he said, there has been ''no public expression of support from Governor Pataki on either bill.''</p>
        <p>On a local level, officials bemoan their lack of influence over the serious pollution problem the county faces.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing that the air in Westchester received such a low mark, but it's almost completely out of our control,'' said Joshua Lipsman, the county health commissioner.</p>
        <p>County Executive Andrew J. Spano said the air pollution problem is ''very serious,'' and that is why ''clean air and clean water is our mantra.'' He recently formed an 18-member Westchester Asthma Council to deal with the immediate effects of poor air quality on residents and their children. The council, which scheduled its first meeting last week, begins the task of identifying children in the county who suffer from asthma, and provide home health visits for the 468 asthmatic children who are enrolled in the HealthSource/Hudson Health Plan. With $20,000 in county financing, the council will try ''to get at the demographics of asthma in the county,'' Mr. Spano said.</p>
        <p>If it's any consolation, Westchester County is not alone in its ozone crisis. The air quality is actually worse in Connecticut, which has ''some of the worst pollution in the Northeast,'' Dr. Thurston said.</p>
