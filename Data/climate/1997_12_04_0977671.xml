        <p>Editorial urges Vice Pres Al Gore to seek workable middle ground at international conference on global warming, Kyoto, Japan; cites need for compromise on targets and timetables and on carbon dioxide emissions limits for developing nations (M)</p>

        <p>It may require a near-miracle for the 150-plus nations now meeting in Kyoto, Japan, to produce, in six days, a comprehensive treaty on global warming. The issue is complex, the disagreements wide. But anyone who has taken the trouble to cut through the diplomatic posturing knows there is room for compromise. At the very least, the negotiators can produce a broad memorandum of understanding that kicks the process forward and provides a firm basis for detailed negotiations.</p>
        <p>Failure to do so would be costly. If the world is shown to be incapable of a collective response to a collective problem, whatever sense of urgency the general public has about climate change could evaporate. Failure would also slow the search for technologies that could reduce the world's dependence on coal and other fossil fuels that contribute to the rise in atmospheric temperatures.</p>

        <p>It may require a near-miracle for the 150-plus nations now meeting in Kyoto, Japan, to produce, in six days, a comprehensive treaty on global warming. The issue is complex, the disagreements wide. But anyone who has taken the trouble to cut through the diplomatic posturing knows there is room for compromise. At the very least, the negotiators can produce a broad memorandum of understanding that kicks the process forward and provides a firm basis for detailed negotiations.</p>
        <p>Failure to do so would be costly. If the world is shown to be incapable of a collective response to a collective problem, whatever sense of urgency the general public has about climate change could evaporate. Failure would also slow the search for technologies that could reduce the world's dependence on coal and other fossil fuels that contribute to the rise in atmospheric temperatures.</p>
        <p>Fear of failure is essentially what drove President Clinton to send Al Gore to Kyoto next week. The Vice President's ostensible mission is to prevent the American position from being shouted down by the Europeans, who think it is too weak. Yet there are some countries, oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and coal-dependent nations like Australia, that want no agreement. Mr. Gore's real mission is to lure both sides to a workable middle ground. That will mean adjustments in everyone's position on two highly contentious issues.</p>
        <p>Targets and Timetables. Mr. Clinton wants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels somewhere between 2008 and 2012, and cut them by unspecified amounts thereafter. The Europeans want to cut emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010, a goal Mr. Clinton regards as incompatible with economic growth. But surely there is room for compromise here, either by picking an arithmetic middle ground, or -- instead of insisting on a one-size-fits-all formula -- by setting different targets for different countries, tailored to their economic and social profiles.</p>
        <p>Developing Countries. The developing countries argue that they need more time to grow and cannot be forced to cut their fossil-fuel emissions. The United States Senate, however, has told Mr. Clinton it will not ratify a treaty that does not include developing countries, and nearly everyone agrees that unless these countries sign on at some point, any agreement will be worthless. The answer here could be to require the developing countries to sign the treaty but allow them to negotiate timetables and targets down the road. Another answer could lie in a novel proposal, offered by the Americans, under which rich countries would subsidize cleaner technologies in poorer countries.</p>
        <p>Kyoto may yet produce a treaty. But even if it does not, it will not have been a failure if it moves everyone to common ground.</p>
