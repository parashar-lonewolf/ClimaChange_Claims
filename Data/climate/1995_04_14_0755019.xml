        <p>It could be said of Dennis Conner that he can see a wind shift with his eyes closed. How else to explain a sailor who has developed an uncanny ability to keep coming back with America's Cup victories when his critics are saying he's over the hill now, or too distracted, or too well off to really care?</p>
        <p>But there he was again today, edging out an opponent on the defenders' race course for the second finals race in a row. In a match that called on skillful tactics to deal with an erratic 5-to-15-knot breeze, a rising sea, and a whale on the race course, Stars &amp; Stripes defeated Mighty Mary by 2 minutes 50 seconds.</p>

        <p>It could be said of Dennis Conner that he can see a wind shift with his eyes closed. How else to explain a sailor who has developed an uncanny ability to keep coming back with America's Cup victories when his critics are saying he's over the hill now, or too distracted, or too well off to really care?</p>
        <p>But there he was again today, edging out an opponent on the defenders' race course for the second finals race in a row. In a match that called on skillful tactics to deal with an erratic 5-to-15-knot breeze, a rising sea, and a whale on the race course, Stars &amp; Stripes defeated Mighty Mary by 2 minutes 50 seconds.</p>
        <p>"We're just pleased to be here, to be afloat, and to be tied," Conner said after the race. "We can hardly believe it ourselves."</p>
        <p>The outcome of today's defense match evened out the scoring for all three American teams. Each is now at 2 points in the Citizen Cup defenders' finals.</p>
        <p>In the Louis Vuitton challengers' finals race, New Zealand's Black Magic 1 beat One Australia by 1:57. It was the second finals defeat for One Australia, which now trails with an 0-2 record in the best-five-of-nine match series.</p>
        <p>The defenders' race added an unexpected twist in a series already tied in knots by a sudden switch in format last week to allow for an unprecedented three-boat finals. The bargain, which was agreed on by all three teams, has given Stars &amp; Stripes a new life. But for Young America, which accepted the sweetened deal to gain 2 seeded points as semifinals leader, the three-way tie now looks like a potential road to nowhere.</p>
        <p>"Any of the three defense boats could win now," said Peter Lester, the tactician for New Zealand's TAG Heuer Challenge, which lost in the semifinals. "Either they're all going quick, or none of them are going quick. We won't know until we see one of them against a challenger."</p>
        <p>The America</p>
        <p>team's boat, Mighty Mary, seemed to be faster than Stars &amp; Stripes during the first part of today's race. The mostly women's team caught a fresh breeze on the right, and sailed higher than Conner's boat. Twenty-five minutes into the race, Mighty Mary crossed clearly ahead.</p>
        <p>But by the first mark, Conner's knack of finding the fresher breeze paid off. The veteran skipper on Stars &amp; Stripes picked up a shift on the left that allowed his yacht to round the mark with a 25-second lead. The dark-blue boat held on to that edge, ahead of Mighty Mary at every mark.</p>
        <p>Once behind, the trouble was just starting for the crew on Mighty Mary. The spinnaker dropped from its halyard shackle twice, finally forcing Merritt Carey to climb the boat's 110-foot mast to try to fix the troublesome fitting. It was a trapeze act made worse by rough seas that rocked the boat like a hobby-horse as it headed upwind.</p>
        <p>"The mood of the camp, every time you lose, is that it's a bit frustrating," Dawn Riley, team captain for Mighty Mary, said this evening. "But as we speak, about 25 people are meeting to continue the tweaking on our boat. It's not over yet."</p>
        <p>Once behind, the trouble was just starting for the Mighty Mary crew. The spinnaker dropped from its halyard schackle in one leg, and then a halyard broke in another. The breakdowns forced Merritt Carey to climb the 110-foot mast to try to repair it. But her job became a trapeze act made worse by rough seas that rocked the boat like a hobby horse as it headed upwind.</p>
        <p>Lisa Charles, another crew member, followed suit, but was unable to untangle the spinnaker halyard, which appeared to be caught near the boat's upper spreader. With no way out, the Mighty Mary team was forced to sail the last leg of the race with the spinnaker attached to the jib halyard.  YACHT RACING</p>
