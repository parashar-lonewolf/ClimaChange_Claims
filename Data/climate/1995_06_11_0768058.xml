        <p>AH, New Jersey, birthplace of Bubble Wrap, Valium and Spaghetti-O's. Not to mention the light bulb, the phonograph and the electron microscope.</p>
        <p>Since the day in 1819 when Seth Boyden of Newark was awarded a patent for a shiny new kind of shoe leather, New Jerseyans have provided an endless stream of ideas and devices to make life more pleasant and productive, from the concrete highway divider to the color television to the artificial larynx. From the motion picture to salt-water taffy, no engineering challenge has proved too great or too small to inspire native inventors.</p>
        <p>The legacy of Edison and Einstein continues today, as can be seen in weekly Official Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. During the weeks of May 16 and May 23, more than four dozen general and mechanical patents were granted to New Jerseyans, many of whom have never seen the inside of a research lab. Here are patent numbers and descriptions for a few. Apparatus Useful in Testing Efficacy of Repellents Anna B. Marin, Leonardo; Craig B. Warren, Rumson; Richard A. Wilson, Westfield; Braja D. Mookherjee, Holmdel and Jerry F. Butler, Gainesville, Fla., for International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. THE PROBLEM -- A need for a better flytrap to make tests of insect repellents more reliable. The more insects that can be attracted to an area where a repellent has been placed, the more data researchers will be able to draw upon.</p>
        <p>THE SOLUTION -- A multi-feature field trap that attracts blood-seeking insects by mimicking characteristics of warmblooded host animals and humans. In one chamber, a piece of dry ice decomposes into carbon dioxide vapor at about the same rate that a cow exhales it. In another, a flashlight gives off infrared light, imitating body heat. The light also attracts mosquitoes by pulsing at the same rate at which they beat their wings, apparently tricking them into believing that other mosquitoes are already there.</p>
        <p>A propeller inside the trap creates an air stream that pulls insects into the trap as soon as they get near it. Researchers set up two traps in the same area, one containing a sample of the repellent being tested and the other a control. Conga Rim Donald M. Kralik, West Milford, and Wayne E. Cohen, Cliffside Park, for Latin Percussion Inc., Garfield. THE PROBLEM -- Players of the conga, a hand drum widely used in Latin, jazz and pop music, often bruise their hands from repeatedly banging the steel rim of the drum, which sits about an inch below the drumhead. THE SOLUTION -- A rim made of gently curved steel, unlike the sharp-cornered standard rim. Clear-Molded Thermoplastic Compact Disk Supporting Tray Michael P. Joyce, Kinnelon, and Peter M. Russoniello, Lodi, for Joyce Development Corp., Rockaway. THE PROBLEM -- Last year, some record companies began ordering trays to fit inside a compact disk box that were made of clear plastic rather than black plastic, so that they could display graphics on the inside of the back of the box. Clear plastic, however, is more brittle than partly rubberized black plastic, and the companies found that when the new boxes were dropped, the plastic petals that hold the disk in the box tended to break off. THE SOLUTION -- The petals broke off easily because they ended just short of the center of the hub and were thus supported only at one end. The new tray links pairs of the petals together in the center in a snowflake pattern that has much more structural strength.</p>
        <p>The tray is now the standard for several major record labels, including Sony and Warner Brothers, and has sold about 50 million units since its introduction last fall. Rope Termination: Constant-Cross-Section Divided-Cavity Potted Socket John F. Flory, Morristown. THE PROBLEM -- A rope, like a chain, is only as strong as its weakest part. With high-performance (million-pound breaking strength) Kevlar fiber ropes used in offshore construction and mooring, the weakest part is often the termination, the mechanism that connects the end of the rope to the object it is securing.</p>
        <p>A standard termination for high-performance ropes is a potted socket. The end of the rope is pushed into a tapered hole in the socket, and the fibers are then untwisted to flare them out. The end of the rope is then treated with quick-setting resin to hold it in the socket.</p>
        <p>With ropes larger than an inch in diameter, the plastic resin holding the rope in place tends to deform under tension. The fibers near the center of the rope move out, increasing the stress on the outer fibers and causing the rope to fail under as little as half its potential breaking tension. THE SOLUTION -- A socket cavity divided into six chambers, effectively creating smaller cavities in which the resin can be effective.  Computerized Lottery Wagering System John B. Scagnelli, Holmdel, and Joseph A. Fiscella, Maywood, for Lottoron Inc., Hackensack. THE PROBLEM -- Many potential lottery customers do not visit stores where lottery tickets are sold because they are homebound or don't have the time. THE SOLUTION -- A system that allows people to buy lottery tickets over the phone. The customer calls an "800" number and is guided through an automated system that asks for amount of the wager, credit card number, and the numbers the customer wants to play. Customers could also buy "subscriber cards" in prepaid amounts, and draw down money from that account to play.</p>
        <p>"It's the last untapped market," Mr. Fiscella said. "We've done the on-line, the scratch-off. It's time to bring in people who don't play the lottery." Horse Mucking Rake Device Anthony N. Russo, Ringoes. THE PROBLEM -- Manure forks tend to scoop up horse bedding along with the manure. If the stall mucker taps the fork against the wall of the stall to sift out the bedding, the manure falls off the fork. THE SOLUTION -- A fork with a basket that starts where the tines end. The stall mucker scoops up a load, taps the basket against the wall and the bedding drops out through the holes. The manure stays in.  NEW JERSEY &amp; CO.</p>
