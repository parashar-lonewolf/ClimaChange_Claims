        <p>An Almost Peaceful Mutiny  No shots were fired and no real threats were made by either side in a mutiny by a band of junior Filipino military officers and troopers that, when it was over, seemed a caricature of the coups and putsches that keep the Philippines on edge.</p>

        <p>Working to Prevent Rioting  The riots in Los Angeles remain a searing memory for many in Inglewood, Calif.
