        <p>Hundreds of millions of tons of cow and pig manure accumulate every year in the United States. If it were piled into trucks, which of course it never would be, the line would stretch bumper to bumper from San Francisco to New York, according to a calculation once made by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The stuff is disgusting. It stinks. The methane gas it emits pollutes the atmosphere. The runoff pollutes the water. And it is ubiquitous. There are dairy or hog farms in almost every state.</p>
        <p>For at least 30 years, the technology has existed to convert this waste into electricity. But the process has not been economical. The initial capital outlay has always been too high, and what utilities would pay for the electricity has been too low. Today, only 31 American farms have such operations, the E.P.A. said.</p>
        <p>Now, with high energy prices and power shortages at the top of the news, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa has weighed in with legislation that would give a tax credit to dairy and hog farmers who produce electricity from their wastes.</p>
        <p>To sweeten the pot, the bill would specify that grants from the government's environmental quality incentive program could be made available to farmers who wanted to invest in the technology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grassley calls his bill  POWER, which stands for Providing Opportunities With Effluent Renew ables. It is another example of legislation that benefits one particular interest or another of an important lawmaker. The measure was introduced just this week, and so far no opposition has developed.</p>
        <p>Thousands of bills are introduced in Congress every year, and most lie untouched in the hopper. But this bill has some chance of enactment this year because of Mr. Grassley's influence. A farmer, he was chairman of the Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over tax legislation, until Republicans lost control of Congress and is now the committee's top-ranking Republican.</p>
        <p>He got the idea for the bill from his predecessor as chairman, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware. Delaware has few cows or pigs but many chickens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, who lost his seat last year, got a law enacted in 1999 that allows a tax credit for electricity made from chicken droppings. No one has claimed the credit, said Bill Satterfield, executive director of Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc., a trade association for chicken producers.</p>
        <p>''Only a big company with millions of dollars of resources can do it,'' Mr. Satterfield said.</p>
        <p>Most of the 31 commercial farms in 16 states where livestock manure is converted into electricity are quite large. Carl Theunis, who owns one of the farms, in Wisconsin, said he had 2,500 dairy cows and had invested more than $2 million in the conversion technology.</p>
        <p>The normal capital outlay is $200,000 to $250,000, said Kurt Roos, director of a federal program that promotes the technology. That is more than twice the government grants that would be allowed to any farmer under the Grassley bill. If a farmer can save 6 cents per kilowatt-hour on the electricity bill, the initial outlay can be paid off in about four years, Mr. Roos said. Under Mr. Grassley's bill, the tax credit would be 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>
        <p>Estimates are that the tax credit could cost the Treasury $300 million over the next 10 years and that 2,000 to 3,000 farmers may benefit.</p>
        <p>Doug Williams, an agricultural engineer at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo who has been working for 25 years with the manure-to-electricity technology, said government subsidies would not be the make-or-break factor in whether the conversion operations became more prevalent.</p>
        <p>More important, he said, is whether the price of electricity remains very high and whether state and local environmental laws become stricter. In fact, the environmental advantages of turning manure into electricity are probably greater than the benefits of energy production.</p>
        <p>The process, called anaerobic digestion, eliminates the odor of manure; controls the release of methane, one of the main greenhouse gases; and makes the pollution from runoff less serious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grassley said he was confident his measure would pass. ''If Senator Roth could get his bill passed for chickens, I can sure get mine passed,'' he said.</p>
