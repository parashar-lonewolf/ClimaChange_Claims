        <p>The Justice Department concluded today that the Clinton administration had acted reasonably in filing lawsuits against power plants under the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Attorney General John Ashcroft said the Bush administration would  continue to prosecute the owners of coal-fueled plants and oil refineries charged with failing to install pollution control devices as they upgraded the facilities.</p>
        <p>''The department takes seriously its obligation to enforce the laws protecting our nation's environment,'' Mr. Ashcroft said. ''Ensuring cleaner air for the health and well-being of all Americans is critically important.''</p>
        <p>The action buttresses lawsuits filed on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency since 1999 against several dozen power plants whose operators are accused of failing to reduce emissions while modifying their plants under a series of requirements known as new source review.</p>
        <p>The ruling today is not the administration's last word on how to carry out the 30-year-old Clean Air Act. As part of its energy plan, the White House has sought a review of pollution rules, and top federal regulators have recommended informally that the administration ease the requirements for new source review.</p>
        <p>A relaxation of the rules is eagerly sought by energy and industry groups, many of which are strong political supporters of President Bush. They contend that the current requirements impose billions in extra costs.</p>
        <p>The operators of the plants, many of which are in the industrial Midwest, assert that many improvements they made were part of routine maintenance and did not constitute significant ''modifications,'' the trigger that compels them under the Clean Air Act to invest in expensive pollution control devices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ashcroft sided with the E.P.A. even as he said the statutory term ''modification'' was ambiguous.</p>
        <p>Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, said Mr. Ashcroft's move placed ''a bipartisan stamp of approval'' on the pollution lawsuits, which Mr. Spitzer helped initiate two years ago.</p>
        <p>''Through this endorsement,'' Mr. Spitzer said, ''the Department of Justice is agreeing with E.P.A. and my office that many coal-fired power plants violated the Clean Air Act when they made major modifications without installing the necessary pollution controls.''</p>
        <p>''We hope that the Northeast will finally see improved air quality with reduced urban smog, acid rain and respiratory disease,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Scott Segal, a lawyer for the power companies, said overzealous enforcement by the government could backfire by inducing power companies to put off repairs that could make them more efficient and safe.</p>
        <p>Operators, Mr. Segal said, ''are faced with a Hobson's choice: withholding routine maintenance or running afoul of E.P.A.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Segal said the current interpretation of the rules for new source review could result in the loss of 6,000 to 12,000 megawatts of generating capacity, the amount used by 12 million households in a year.</p>
        <p>But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a supporter of tough enforcement, said the government's first responsibility was to tens of millions of Americans exposed to ''unfiltered air from power plants that should have been shut down and replaced years ago.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leahy, who plans to hold hearings on the administration's handling of the law, said Mr. Ashcroft's decision indicated ''a reprieve for cleaner air, but it is not yet a victory.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''All of today's Justice Department findings will be meaningless if E.P.A. does not uphold its end and maintain firm and effective rules for big polluters.''</p>
        <p>The White House is awaiting the E.P.A.'s recommendation, officials said. In interagency discussions, Christie Whitman, the agency administrator, who supported the 1999 lawsuits when she was governor of New Jersey, has favored a tougher stance than Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and Vice President Dick Cheney. A tentative list of recommendations recently submitted to the White House would relax the  rules in industry's favor, officials said.</p>
