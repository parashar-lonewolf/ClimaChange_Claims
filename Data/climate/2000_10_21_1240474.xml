        <p>The term ''energy efficient'' sounds jarringly incorrect in describing New York. Big, sprawling, arrogant, corrupt -- those are things people expect. ''Efficient'' seems a little too Jonathan Livingston Seagull and not enough Damon Runyon.</p>
        <p>But New Yorkers are in fact astonishingly stingy in their use of electricity and fossil fuels. According to a recent study, only the residents and businesses in Hawaii used less energy per person, in proportion to the state's population and its economy.</p>
        <p>The study, by a Washington energy research group called the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said that based on federal figures from 1997, New York State's residents and businesses also burned fewer hydrocarbons like gasoline or natural gas in proportion to the gross state product than all other states but Connecticut and the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>And who gets the credit?</p>
        <p>Energy experts say the results are heavily skewed by the huge impact of New York City itself, where mass transit moves millions of people, thus saving uncounted gallons of gasoline that are burned in other metropolitan areas. Dense, high-rise housing is also often far less profligate of energy use for things like heat than the single-family homes that dominate most of the nation. And the housing is often cramped as well, with less room for energy-draining appliances.</p>
        <p>New York's economy also has less dependence on energy-intensive industries like steel making or petroleum refining than the nation as a whole. Driven by the city's numbers, New York State had a lower percentage of households with clothes-washers, or dryers, or dishwashers, or freezers in 1997 than the national average, the efficiency study said.</p>
        <p>In general, the report found that in states with higher energy prices, like Hawaii and California and most of the Northeast, people and businesses tend to use less energy or find ways to make it go further.</p>
        <p>Energy-guzzling states at the bottom of the list, by contrast, tend to have low energy prices and huge empty rural spaces that require lots of driving, like Alaska, in 51st place, and Wyoming, in 49th, or an economic dependence on companies that use lots of energy, like Louisiana, which came in 50th place largely because of its huge petrochemical industry.</p>
        <p>Another surprise -- contrary to all conventional wisdom -- has come from the State University of New York in Albany, where researchers have concluded that the Northeast, particularly a narrow band stretching through the metropolitan area and into southern New Jersey, is a prime potential location for solar energy.</p>
        <p>Richard Perez, a senior research associate at the university's Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, said that his solar insight began with a simple observation: the sunniest, hottest days in New York were also the days when the electricity system was pushing the limit of capacity because of higher air-conditioning use. Mr. Perez realized that solar energy could be the perfect add-on generating mechanism at those exact moments when it was needed most.</p>
        <p>So he analyzed satellite and weather data, correlating sunshine with energy use, and redrew the conventional solar power map. Suddenly, the New York region was almost as attractive as Arizona as a place to use the power of the sun.</p>
        <p>Last year, when 200,000 residents of upper Manhattan lost power for 18 hours on the hottest day in July, the available sunshine level was at 93 percent of maximum, Mr. Perez said. A few thousand small-to-medium-size buildings with rooftop solar panels would have been enough, he said, to have avoided the power loss.</p>
        <p>Technical feasibility alone has not yet carried the day, Mr. Perez conceded. Although he was encouraged by some recent announcements about buildings in New York that had made a commitment to try solar generation, the public's skepticism, both economic and meteorological, runs deep, he said.</p>
