        <p>FROM THAT PLACE AND TIME: A Memoir 1938-1947, by Lucy S. Dawidowicz. (Bantam, $12.95.) In 1939, one week before Germany invaded Poland, the author fled Vilna (now Vilnius, Lithuania), returning after the war to document the destruction of the city's Jewish culture. In 1989 our reviewer, Tomas Venclova, called this memoir "a monument to the community destroyed, not by forces of nature, but by the evil human hand."</p>
        <p>THE COMFORTS OF MADNESS, by Paul Sayer. (Anchor/Doubleday, $8.95.) From the point of view of Peter, a young catatonic in a mental institution, nothing seems to make more sense than the notion of doing nothing at all. "Paul Sayer's powerful and challenging novel is reminiscent of Franz Kafka's story 'The Hunger Artist,' another short work that takes on such endless themes as art, appetite, volition and the death-in-life that is psychosis," Jane Vandenburgh said here in 1989. "Like Kafka's story, 'The Comforts of Madness' is wild, extreme and slightly unbelievable, yet it rings absolutely true." It won England's Whitbread Book of the Year Award for 1988.</p>
        <p>THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS: Shaping the Fate of Our Living Earth, by Jonathan Weiner. (Bantam, $12.95.) A science writer warns that time is running out to avoid global warming and other environmental disasters. Last year our reviewer, Robert Kanigel, said that "some of his metaphors are unforgettable. As a way of showing that the stratosphere, unlike the lower atmosphere, doesn't easily rid itself of pollutants, he writes, 'It is like an eye without tears.' "</p>
        <p>PASSING ON, by Penelope Lively. (Harper Perennial, $8.95.) As if to show that a little thing like death is not going to keep her from meddling in her family's lives, Dorothy Glover bequeaths her house not to Helen and Edward, the daughter and son who live there, but to their teen-age nephew. Last year our reviewer, Richard Bausch, said this novel is written "in a prose that is as precise and unemotional as the date on a calendar. Yet the cumulative effect is powerful indeed."</p>
        <p>EVERY GOOD-BYE AIN'T GONE: Family Portraits and Personal Escapades, by Itabari Njeri. (Vintage Contemporaries, $9.95.) In stories about her family, a black journalist writes about the frustrations of growing up invisible in America. Last year our reviewer, Meg Wolitzer, said, "Ms. Njeri is skillful at rendering her relatives as fully realized characters, whether she's writing about an eccentric aunt who worked as a call girl during the 40's and 50's or a cousin who was a Ricky Nelson look-alike and who was murdered by drug dealers on a rooftop in Harlem."</p>
        <p>VESPERS, by Ed McBain. (Avon, $4.95.) After a priest is murdered in the 87th Precinct, suspicions center on a local cult of Satanists. This is "a shocking new chapter in Ed McBain's continuing morality tale about the forces of good and evil in the big city," Marilyn Stasio said here last year.</p>
        <p>THUNDER AT TWILIGHT: Vienna 1913-1914, by Frederic Morton. (Collier/Macmillan, $9.95.) With residents and transients that included Freud, Stalin, Trotsky and the young Adolf Hitler, Vienna provides an ideal vantage point for a historian to watch the approach of World War I. In 1989 The Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said this book conveys "the sense of an old world breaking up and releasing something new."</p>
        <p>DEATH OF A SALESPERSON: And Other Untimely Exits, by Robert Barnard. (Dell, $3.95.) When these short stories about peculiar means of murder were published in 1990, our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, said, "Viewed as a pack, they seem to take indiscriminate bites out of the collective social hide, nipping at the nobility, the clergy, the avant-garde, the adulterous, the overweight, the geriatric and the young. The innocent get theirs, too."</p>
        <p>DOING JUSTICE: A Trial Judge at Work, by Robert Satter. (American Lawyer/Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $9.95.) A judge on the Connecticut Superior Court says that for all the legal analysis that goes into making a verdict, ultimately the decision comes down to a matter of heart. Last year our reviewer, Carol E. Rinzler, said that though she found the book disturbing "it should be read by every prospective litigant for its vivid portrait of the unfortunate way in which some judges judge."</p>
        <p>UNDER THE BOARDWALK, by Norman Rosten. (University of Arkansas, $12.95.) Growing up in Coney Island in the 1930's, a young Jewish boy comes to realize that, at least for the adults around him, life is a rather depressing, drab, claustrophobic affair. This novel "finds its real ancestry in the stories of Sherwood Anderson, to which it is a gentle, humane, funny and beautifully written successor," Ronald Sukenick said here in 1968.</p>
        <p>THE DARK MATTER: Contemporary Science's Quest for the Mass Hidden in Our Universe, by Wallace Tucker and Karen Tucker. (Quill/Morrow, $8.95.) An astronomer and his wife explain why cosmologists have come to the bizarre conclusion that most of the matter in the universe is invisible. "The scientific reporting is sound, and the ongoing enigma of the dark matter, with its haunting implication that we have scarcely begun to comprehend how the cosmos is put together, comes shining (or darkling) through," Timothy Ferris said here in 1988.</p>
        <p>DEATH ROLL, by Sam Llewellyn. (Pocket, $3.95.) During the Marbella Cup, a world-class sailor fights for his life against a gang involved in a murderous extortion plot. "Sam Llewellyn has been described as the Dick Francis of sailing, and for good reason," Newgate Callendar said here last year. His writing is "clean, flowing, unaffected, sometimes with a touch of poetry."</p>
