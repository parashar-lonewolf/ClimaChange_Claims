        <p>In an overheated room that smells faintly of wet boots, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa is mixing it up with the next generation.</p>
        <p>"I want to challenge this country just as John Kennedy challenged me," he tells the students who have gathered to hear him at the University of New Hampshire. "I want to challenge the American people like Franklin Roosevelt challenged us in 1932."</p>
        <p>"I believe in running a Harry Truman-type campaign," he continues. "A lot of people say you've got to be a little more like a Republican. You've got to walk a little more like a Republican, talk a little more like a Republican. But as Harry Truman said, any time you run a Republican against a Republican, you're going to get a Republican as President."</p>
        <p>Other Democratic candidates may wring their hands over the party's recent agonies; Senator Harkin would rather dwell on happier times. Forget Michael S. Dukakis. Forget Jimmy Carter. And forget, if you will, Lyndon B. Johnson. The Senator's party is the party of grand old Democrats from Roosevelt to Kennedy. Back to the Basics</p>
        <p>"What we Democrats have got to do is go back to our traditional roots and heritage and what the Democratic Party really stands for," he said. "What the Democratic Party basically stands for is economic health and jobs."</p>
        <p>As he shuttles between diners and auditoriums, soliciting support in the New Hampshire primary to be held on Feb. 18, Mr. Harkin offers voters a benevolent vision of goverment, one that is willing to help those who help themselves. He advocates a massive program modeled on the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, which, he says, will put millions of people to work rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. And he calls for a new version of the G.I. Bill of Rights, which put World War II veterans through college; under his version, students would have their tuition paid by the Government in return for a term of service with a conservation corps or a health service corps.</p>
        <p>A combative speaker with an earthy style, the 52-year-old Senator is a self-described populist with just the right sort of resume to suit his politics. His father was a coal miner who died of black lung disease. His mother died when he was 10. The family was too poor to pay for college, so he attended Iowa State University on an R.O.T.C. scholarship and then served five years in the Navy.</p>
        <p>Campaigning against the man he refers to as George Herbert Walker Bush, Mr. Harkin makes frequent use of his impoverished Midwestern background. "Unlike Bush," he said at a recent forum on health care, "I understand what it's like not to be able to afford health care. I don't have to read about it in any books."</p>
        <p>While President Bush seems most comfortable on the golf course or in his mansion at Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Harkin is genuinely at home in a blue-collar world. He has put this skill to use in his campaign with a series of photogenic "work days," one day laying water pipes, another hauling in lobster pots off the coast.</p>
        <p>In his most recent visit to New Hampshire, Mr. Harkin donned a pair of knee-high galoshes to slog around a frozen wetland with members of the local Audobon Society. The wetland was one of thousands in the country that could have been developed under new regulations proposed, and then retracted, by the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>As the Senator emerged from the icy marsh trailing a group of glum reporters with wet feet, he announced buoyantly, "Tommorrow, friends, we're going into a coal mine."</p>
        <p>Mr. Harkin frequently extols the virtues of straight talk, and insists that even if the voters do not agree with him, at least they will know his positions on the issues. "One thing about me," he says, "you won't have to wonder where I stand."</p>
        <p>On many issues the Senator's positions are, in fact, hard to confuse: he is straightforward in support for a national health plan, for example, and he advocates cutting carbon dioxide emissions from all sources in the nation by 20 percent by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>But, when pressed on the mechanics of many of his proposals, Mr. Harkin can be as obfuscatory as any of his rivals. When he is asked, for example, how he plans to finance the public works projects he is proposing, he offers this answer:</p>
        <p>"Implicit in that question is the assumption that we're poor, we're broke. Well, let me disabuse you of that notion. We may be 14th out of the 16 industrialized in what we spend on education. We may be 10th in infant mortality. But guess what? We're the richest country in the world. The money's there, we've just got to start spending it smarter." Some Different Reactions</p>
        <p>What the Senator lacks in the way of detail he often makes up for with sheer optimism. "Don't tell me we can't find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, for AIDS, for cancer," he said recently. "I do not believe these are incurable diseases -- not at all."</p>
        <p>To many Democrats, Mr. Harkin's proposals and his pugnacious style are inspiring after years of party-sanctioned timidity.</p>
        <p>"I like the man's enthusiasm, his can-do attitude," said Preston Mears, an agent for the Department of Agriculture, who heard the Senator speak recently in the basement of the Econo-Lodge in nearby Salem.</p>
        <p>Other Democrats, however, see Mr. Harkin's "big government" plans as a recipe for the party's defeat next November. And still others question whether Truman's "give 'em hell" style is really suited to the complexities of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>"It's like, 'Wake up, this isn't the 50's any more,' " said Michael Rosenthal, a senior at the University of New Hampshire. "He's presenting this Utopian vision of America; I started having visions of parades. That didn't really turn me on."</p>
