        <p>The rivalry between Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Torricelli was so open that the two men refused to talk civilly for nearly a year. But what wasn't so open was the degree to which their feud disrupted the New Jersey congressional delegation's ability to work collectively on local issues.</p>
        <p>The most obvious sign of this was that New Jersey lawmakers had given up any hope of instituting a practice that delegations from other states have used to flex some political muscle here: regular bipartisan strategy sessions.</p>
        <p>As one top legislative aide from New Jersey put it: ''Torricelli and Lautenberg hated each others' guts. You couldn't get them in the same room together.''</p>
        <p>Things are beginning to change. With Mr. Lautenberg retired and his seat now occupied by the more even-tempered Jon Corzine, the delegation meetings have been quietly revived.</p>
        <p>Talk of resurrecting the delegation meetings started in January as the 107th Congress embarked on a session that presented great perils for Northeastern states, among them majorities in both chambers that are dominated by Southern and Midwestern Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Corzine and Representative Marge Roukema, the dean of the New Jersey delegation, sent a letter inviting the other 12 New Jersey legislators to breakfast on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''We hope that this meeting will be the first of what will become an ongoing dialogue,'' the three wrote.</p>
        <p>To hear lawmakers and their aides describe it, the delegation meetings are an opportunity for friendly banter and, more important, plotting strategy. The meetings also give them the chance to brief one another about legislation that is gathering momentum in Congress, as well as other opportunities, like openings on important committees.</p>
        <p>Above all, though, the meetins are  probably one of the best ways for New Jersey lawmakers to discuss what constituents back home are saying and figure out how to get more federal funds for New Jersey, a state that has long sent more money to Washington than it gets back.</p>
        <p>Representative Robert Menendez, a Democrat from Union City, acknowledged that members of the delegation had significant ideological differences, particularly on national issues like tax cuts. ''But,'' he added, ''when it comes to the interests of the state, we all speak with one voice.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey is not the only state to hold delegation meetings. For years, the Georgia delegation met periodically. But the gatherings came to an abrupt halt in 1995, when Newt Gingrich became Speaker of the House and the delegation's Republicans, including Mr. Gingrich, began meeting on their own. Now, with Mr. Gingrich out of office, the delegation is trying to resurrect the practice of getting together on some regular interval.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Roukema publicly called for monthly meetings in 1995 when she became the dean of the delegation. But the proposal died, largely because the feud between Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Lautenberg showed no signs of abating, according to people involved in the matter.</p>
        <p>The first meeting of the new delegation apparently went well, occurring over coffee and bagels. The discussion centered on how to increase federal money for mass transit, housing, hospitals, education, veterans' programs and the Bergen-Hudson Light Rail system.</p>
        <p>The meetings are intended to lend a certain level of cohesiveness to a delegation that is fairly diverse. There are six Republicans and seven Democrats in the House, as well as two Democrats in the Senate. The delegation also has one Hispanic, one black and one woman.</p>
        <p>It is a largely moderate delegation. For example, Mrs. Roukema, a Republican, is at odds with the Republican leaders of the House, and she has been very critical of some of the decisions that President Bush has made, including his decision to back away from a campaign promise to put a limit on industrial emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey delegation is in the process of rebuilding some of the power it lost with the departure of Mr. Lautenberg, who was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee and thus in a position to funnel federal money to New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The delegation holds two seats on the House Appropriations Committee, where the crucial decisions are made about about how federal money will be allocated. In addition, Mr. Torricelli is on the powerful Finance Committee in the Senate.</p>
        <p>But just as important, Mr. Menendez is vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, making him the fifth most powerful Democrat in the House. The delegation also includes another influential lawmaker on Capitol Hill, Representative Frank Pallone, who recently stepped down as vice chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and is a major fundraiser for the party.</p>
