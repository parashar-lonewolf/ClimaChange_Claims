        <p>Now that the water is receding, New Orleans is getting its first clear look at the vastness and complexity of the task ahead. The scattered leaders and residents of the city are just beginning to confront the most difficult questions: how much of the city will be rebuilt, what it will look like, what its character will be.</p>
        <p>But before New Orleans starts its next act, the stage must be built. The water must be drained, the ground cleaned, the infrastructure re-created. And the protections against future floods must be patched and strengthened.</p>
        <p>None of this will be easy, quick or inexpensive, agree experts and officials on the ground who were asked to assess the first phase in rebuilding New Orleans.</p>
        <p>''Any estimates now will be quite preliminary and subject to dramatic change,'' David Passey, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said yesterday when asked about costs of the overall rebuilding effort.</p>
        <p>The agency, which is sending 600 public works laborers to the city, is instead focused on draining the floodwaters, repairing the water system and getting the sewage system operating. Entergy, the utility that serves the region, is trying to restore electricity to the drier areas.</p>
        <p>City leaders are trying to look on the bright side, but the flooding has damaged 80 percent of the city, about 144 square miles.</p>
        <p>''It's devastating, but it's also an opportunity to make New Orleans one of the best cities of the 21st century,'' said Don Hutchinson, the city official in charge of rebuilding.</p>
        <p>First, the water has to go. Now that more and more pumps are back on line, the Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the city will be drained in another month.</p>
        <p>Because residues from the floodwaters are likely to contain the high levels of lead, oil and other toxic substances measured in the water itself, debates will rage about whether this schoolyard or that park is safe, much as they did after dust and debris from the World Trade Center coated Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
        <p>The federal Environmental Protection Agency has promised to convene a task force of experts to study the problems in New Orleans. But it will be weeks, probably months, before many areas are dry enough to assess.</p>
        <p>The agency has already found the pathogen E.coli at levels as much as 20 times what is considered healthy, as well as elevated levels of lead and suspected carcinogens like PCB's, said Eryn Witcher, a spokeswoman for the agency. Ms. Witcher said it was impossible at this preliminary stage to estimate how much a cleanup would cost or how long it would take.</p>
        <p>And the agency's advice for anyone dealing with the water in New Orleans is simple, she said: ''Get out. Stay out.''</p>
        <p>City officials are assuming that thousands of houses will have to be bulldozed. ''You can't save a place that's been soaking for weeks,'' said Robert Kates, an emeritus professor of geography at Brown University and an expert on disaster recovery.</p>
        <p>In facing the mess left by Hurricane Katrina, officials responsible for the environment in New Orleans will contend with a history of unresolved battles over persistent contamination in poor or black neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''The fact is that the whole city is now a potential toxic dump or brownfield,'' said Robert D. Bullard, a sociology professor and director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University in Georgia.</p>
        <p>When property owners start to rebuild, people in the neighborhoods most prone to flooding should consider better defenses, officials say. Houses can be raised according to the level of risk, said James G. Titus, a project manager for sea-level rise for the E.P.A. For new buildings, the cost would be reasonable; older structures can be raised, too. ''We just elevated our house at the New Jersey Shore, as well as our yard,'' Mr. Titus said. ''It costs about $20,000 to elevate a wood house three to five feet.''</p>
        <p>As the cleanup proceeds, basic services will need to be restored, a multifaceted and costly task.</p>
        <p>Electricity is being fitfully restored in some neighborhoods, but the job is only beginning. Entergy says many underground conduits are designed to survive flooding, but some experts are skeptical that the lines will survive weeks under the brackish water.</p>
        <p>Transformers are soaked. Debris will have to be cleaned out of them and electronic parts replaced. Utilities have extensive mutual-aid agreements, but weeks of work remain.</p>
        <p>Once the distribution system is restored, inspectors will have to check the wiring of each home and building. ''It's kind of like a house-to-house battle,'' said Jeffrey Corbett, vice president for distribution of Progress Energy, a utility based in Raleigh, N.C.</p>
        <p>New Orleans will not be habitable by a large population until it has a water supply and a functioning sewer system.</p>
        <p>Sewage treatment tends to be the last thing back on line after a flood, because plants are at the lowest point in the city and thus under the deepest water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Passey, of FEMA, said officials hoped to get the water system running citywide in 90 days.</p>
        <p>One concern was that the toxic water flooding the city may have worked its way into the system.</p>
        <p>''All lines have to be flushed, sanitized, and proven safe enough for people to drink,'' said Kim I. Mastalio, an executive at Black &amp; Veatch, a company based in Overland Park, Kan., that installs and repairs utility systems. ''You've got thousands of miles of pipe. You almost have to go to everybody's sink or house. The process can be overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>Another challenge will be getting in and out of the city. The United States Department of Transportation estimates that Louisiana's highways need $1.3 billion in repairs, but J. Richard Capka, deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, acknowledged that the figure was ''ballparkish,'' adding, ''A lot of what we're looking at is still under water.''</p>
        <p>As for trains, the Sunset Limited, which runs from Los Angeles through New Orleans to Orlando, Fla., has probably made its last run until at least the middle of next year, as have the freight trains that use those tracks. ''There's no railroad left,'' said Cliff Black, an Amtrak spokesman.</p>
        <p>Essential facilities of all kinds, including schools, police stations and hospitals, face huge restoration efforts.</p>
        <p>The health care system, for example, took a devastating blow. The storm destroyed medical offices, shut clinics and forced the evacuation of 11 hospitals. Although a few hospitals remain open, government authorities are working to double the number of available beds. Federal officials are using Kindred Hospital as a kind of command center to evaluate the city's public health needs.</p>
        <p>Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Tenet Healthcare, which closed two hospitals in downtown New Orleans, said that it might take weeks, even months, to assess the damage to them and that the company had not yet decided whether to reopen them.</p>
        <p>Even as it restores basic services, New Orleans must grapple with another fundamental issue: protecting itself. The city remains a shallow bowl lying several feet below sea level.</p>
        <p>Asked if New Orleans is capable of withstanding another storm, Alfred Naomi, a senior manager for Corps of Engineers hurricane-protection projects in the region, replied without hesitation: ''Yeah, sure it is. Even for a Category 5 storm.''</p>
        <p>Breaches in the city's system of levees were catastrophic, but sturdier and higher walls could meet the challenge, Mr. Naomi said.</p>
        <p>Some experts, though, are not so sure.</p>
        <p>Roy K. Dokka, a Louisiana State University geologist who has spent his career measuring elevations around the Gulf Coast, said the problem could be much larger than engineers had estimated, in part because new satellite measurements seemed to show that the city was lower relative to the sea than expected, perhaps two to four feet.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't do you any good to go out and start building anything now,'' Dr. Dokka said, ''because we simply don't know how high to build.''</p>
        <p>Other experts point out that the entire region is sinking as the loose sediment under the Mississippi Delta settles and compacts. The withdrawal of oil and gas from the seabed and coastal areas contributes to this.</p>
        <p>Also, seas are rising as global warming melts glaciers and expands seawater. The combined effect of the sinking land and the rising seas by the end of this century could be the equivalent of lowering levees or sea walls by three feet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Titus, of the E.P.A., said future floods could best be deterred through landscape restoration and engineering.</p>
        <p>If the lowlands between the city and the Gulf of Mexico were returned to nature, mud from the Mississippi River could once again wash over them and accumulate, creating a buffer between raging seas and the city's flood defenses, Mr. Titus said.</p>
        <p>One ambitious coastal restoration plan called Coast 2050 won support from local officials and scientists, but at $14 billion over several decades it has not received federal financing.</p>
        <p>Regardless, though, the levees will still have to be raised, and raised again over time. And raising them will not be easy or cheap.</p>
        <p>To provide the proper support, a levee's base must expand by three feet for every additional foot of height, said Dan Hitchings, the director of regional business for the Mississippi Valley Division of the Army Corps of Engineers. That means encroaching on property close to the levees.</p>
        <p>''It's a larger footprint for the protection,'' Mr. Hitchings said. ''While they might want higher protection, they're not going to be real gung-ho about giving up their property.''</p>
        <p>And the extra weight of higher, broader dikes causes them to sink faster, meaning ever more work, and money, to maintain the protection.</p>
        <p>In the end, it will be Congress who decides, by its financing of the Army Corps, how high a surge New Orleans will be protected against. In the past, one constraint was how high a wall people would tolerate outside their doorsteps, but urban redevelopment could create space for bigger defenses. The necessary improvements would cost perhaps $2.5 billion, Mr. Naomi said, adding that the figure was only an estimate because Congress had not approved a full study.</p>
        <p>Once New Orleans is more or less dry, more or less clean, and more or less with functioning services, it will be ready for the next, even more contentious phase of rebuilding.</p>
        <p>A decision will have to be made on the idea, raised by some scientists, urban planners and commentators, that some neighborhoods carry such a high risk of flooding that they should be given back to the Mississippi and the gulf.</p>
        <p>But Beverly Wright, a lifelong New Orleanian and a sociology professor at Xavier University, harshly criticized that notion. ''I don't hear anyone saying that about the Florida coast, about places that get hit every year and get rebuilt with federal money,'' Dr. Wright said yesterday, while camped at a friend's house in Baton Rouge.</p>
        <p>The profound debates over the shape of the new New Orleans will take months to play out. For now, though, city officials are emphasizing the city they have.</p>
        <p>''The French Quarter, Algiers and the St. Charles Avenue corridor -- all those big houses, all the things the tourists want to see -- they're all still in place,'' Oliver Thomas, president of the City Council, said last week. ''We have a good foundation.''</p>
