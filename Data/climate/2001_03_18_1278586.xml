      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>WAY OUT THERE IN THE BLUE: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War, by Frances FitzGerald. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $17.) This account of Ronald Reagan's hugely expensive Strategic Defense Initiative, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2000, is both a journey into the politics and technology of nuclear diplomacy and a withering inner history of the Reagan administration. The kicker is that the dream of an antimissile defense system still has life today. The author ''clearly, eloquently and engagingly'' describes ''obscure and complicated events,'' Alan Brinkley wrote in these pages.</p>
        <p>LEARNING HUMAN: Selected Poems, by Les Murray. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15.) Australia's unofficial national poet explores the full breadth of his homeland's experience, from its aboriginal past to its colonial legacy and outback bravado. ''With Whitmanesque verve . . . he shows himself to be a necessary poetic intelligence, one that has ventured far on the prow of his continent and made its language his own,'' Albert Mobilio wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>THE PLATO PAPERS: A Prophesy, by Peter Ackroyd. (Anchor, $12.) This novel by one of Britain's foremost novelist-biographers is set in the far future in London, where an honored orator named Plato fills his Socratic meditations with dimly understood references to the ancient past. The result is a ''richly revealing'' tale that ''can be enjoyed as a jeu d'esprit,'' John Sutherland wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>GET HAPPY: The Life of Judy Garland, by Gerald Clarke. (Delta, $14.95.) The luminous but self-destructive entertainer was one of three sisters whose lives were relentlessly stage-managed, especially by their mother, who introduced her daughter to uppers and downers at the age of 10. ''In no other Garland biography do we see as clearly as in this one how the combination of childhood neglect and exploitation led to Garland's later uncontrollable unraveling,'' Elizabeth Kendall said here in 2000.</p>
        <p>BETWEEN FATHER AND SON: Family Letters, by V. S. Naipaul. Edited by Gillon Aitken. (Vintage, $13.) These letters between the young V. S. Naipaul, who was attending Oxford on a scholarship, and his father, Seepersad, reveal the son's vulnerability and intense drive, and mirror themes of the South Asian diaspora. Last year our reviewer, Abraham Verghese, said that for ''Naipaul fans and particularly for future biographers and scholars, the correspondence is a treasure.'' Seepersad was the model for the title character in Naipaul's 1961 novel, A House for Mr. Biswas (Vintage International, $15). It tells of a sensitive but star-crossed newspaper writer who is adrift in Trinidad's Hindu community and unable to shake free of his wife's domineering family. Our reviewer, Morris Gilbert, called this a ''big, ludicrous, fascinatingly detailed novel.''</p>
        <p>HORSE HEAVEN, by Jane Smiley. (Ballantine, $14.95.) This lively novel about big-money thoroughbred racing features a colorful cast of jockeys, grooms, trainers and breeders, but its most memorable characters are the horses, who are given inner lives as distinctive as those of the humans around them. The result is a ''smart, warmhearted, winning book,'' Bill Barich wrote here last year. ''It's deeply satisfying to read a work of fiction so informed about its subject and so alive to every nuance and detail.''</p>
        <p>THE MYSTERIES WITHIN: A Surgeon Explores Myth, Medicine, and the Human Body, by Sherwin B. Nuland. (Touchstone/ Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.) A scholar of medical history focuses on five organs -- stomach, liver, spleen, heart and uterus -- to describe his own clinical encounters and to introduce the pioneers of medicine and anatomy. In 2000 our reviewer, Andrew Miller, called this ''a relaxed, urbane, often witty piece of work.''</p>
        <p>THE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER: People, Weather, and the Science of Climate, by William K. Stevens. (Delta, $13.95.) A former science reporter for The New York Times explores the relationship between humankind and the weather, and the emerging consensus among experts that global warming presents a serious threat. ''Stevens charts the history of our understanding of climate and weather with considerable skill,'' John Durant said here in 2000.</p>
        <p>THEY'RE COWS, WE'RE PIGS, by Carmen Boullosa. (Grove, $12.) The narrator of this Mexican novel is kidnapped in Flanders and sold into indentured servitude on Tortuga, where he learns medicine and hooks up with a band of buccaneers. ''Boullosa's vivid and visceral descriptions provide hallucinatory images of the pirates' raping and pillaging,'' Allen Lincoln wrote here in 1997.</p>
