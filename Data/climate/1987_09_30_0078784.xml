        <p>LEAD: The National Audubon Society, one of the oldest environmental organizations, announced today that it was monitoring acid rain around the country because it was dissatisfied with Government efforts.</p>
        <p>The National Audubon Society, one of the oldest environmental organizations, announced today that it was monitoring acid rain around the country because it was dissatisfied with Government efforts.</p>
        <p>The society's volunteers have been collecting readings at 64 monitoring stations since July, using litmus paper and color-coded charts to measure the acidity of rainfall. The data show high levels of acidity at sites all over the country. But Dr. Jan Beyea, a senior scientist for the society, cautioned that isolated readings of acidity in the early sampling results might reflect only local conditions.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the society plans to have 200 monitoring sites. Sampling results would be verified on a random basis by an independent laboratory. The testing procedure for the program was set up with the assistance of experts at Princeton University, the society said.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency uses 150 monitoring stations, but agency officials contend that their stations provide far more accurate analysis than those of the society. Putting Pressure on Officials</p>
        <p>Peter A.A. Berle, president of the society, said the program was intended to bring timely information about acifidied rain to the public to put pressure on elected officials to take action to deal with the problem.</p>
        <p>''We want those in this Administration who say acid rain is not a problem to hear about this every time they read the local paper,'' Mr. Berle said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the environmental agency, when asked for comment, said: ''We look forward to any information that might shed more light on the causes and effects of acid rain. We hope that their study produces the type of statistically valid data needed to further illuminate our understanding of the subject.''</p>
        <p>The spokesman, David Cohen, added, ''However, it is our understanding that their plan would be accurate only to a 0.5 pH unit, which is not exacting enough for our research effort.''</p>
        <p>Acidity is measured by the pH factor, which describes the concentration of hydrogen ions. The lower the pH, the higher the acidity. Pure water has a pH of 7, while coffee has a pH of 5 and lemon juice 2. Reagan Administration's Report</p>
        <p>Mr. Berle said the monitoring program was planned long before the publication of a report by the Reagan Administration's National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program earlier this month. That report found that only a few scattered areas contained acidified lakes and that there was little if any immediate danger to lakes, forests, crops, building materials and human health from acid rain. That study has been criticized by a number of scientists who said its conclusions did not match data.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is the name given to pollution, largely oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, that are transformed chemically in the atmosphere and fall to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles. Much of the pollution comes from coal-burning power plants, many of them in the Middle West, and Congress is now considering legislation that would impose mandatory controls on emissions from those plants.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration contends that the scientific evidence gathered so far does not justify the high cost of such controls. #166 Lawmakers Urge Action Today 166 members of the House of Representatives signed a letter to the leaders of House environmental panels urging action this year to strengthen the Clean Air Act. Among the provisions would be ''tough standards'' on pollution that causes acid rain.</p>
        <p>The letter, written by Representatives Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, and Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, said the lawmakers ''are deeply concerned over the threats posed to the health and welfare of our country by continuing air pollution.'' On the subject of acid rain, the letter said, ''Evidence mounts of increasingly widespread forest and agricultural damage, sterile lakes and public health problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berle of the Audubon Society said the data on the acidity of rainfall given by the Administration's report were often years out of date and that the data were collected in the fall, when acidity is generally lowest.</p>
        <p>But Susan Roth, a spokeswoman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of private electric utilities, expressed doubt that the information collected by Audubon volunteers ''will be reliable and legitimate enough to base any kind of national policy on.''</p>
