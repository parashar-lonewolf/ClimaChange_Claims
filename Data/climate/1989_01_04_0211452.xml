        <p>LEAD: Americans often fail to recognize how much the health of our high-cost oil producers depends upon the success of OPEC in limiting oil production. Indeed, Americans can get quite dewy-eyed thinking about the beauties of inexorable market forces - until, belatedly, they recognize that the marginal, high-cost producer who should be squeezed out in the quest for efficiency is us.</p>
        <p>Americans often fail to recognize how much the health of our high-cost oil producers depends upon the success of OPEC in limiting oil production. Indeed, Americans can get quite dewy-eyed thinking about the beauties of inexorable market forces - until, belatedly, they recognize that the marginal, high-cost producer who should be squeezed out in the quest for efficiency is us.</p>
        <p>We are witnessing a clash of myth and reality. OPEC cartel members know what they're about - limiting competition, the normal competitive instinct and production. Ironically, the most vocal advocates of a free market among American producers are the very ones that cannot survive without price-enhancing activities, either by OPEC or by our Government.</p>
        <p>Since oil is vested with a national security aspect, another irony is that the United States has left the determination of national security and the domestic oil industry's future to an unacknowledged hope for successful intervention by OPEC. Thus, this Administration rests its hope on an instrumentality it professes to abhor -a market-fixing cartel.</p>
        <p>For the long run, there is scarcely any way for prices to go but up. Indeed, we might have had steadily rising prices in this decade were it not for OPEC's overreaching in the 1970's - overreaching that was greater in its rhetorical aspects than in its pricing aspects.</p>
        <p>The market by itself would have carried prices up because of growing, indeed panicky, demand. Yet, what we saw in 1979-80, in contrast to the original price hikes of 1973-74, was far more than the normal effect of rising prices on demand. Many consumers and most major governments became seriously alarmed that the oil supply truly was uncertain and unstable. The response was predictable -a reaching out for oil substitutes and both self-generated and government-promoted oil conservation.</p>
        <p>But the effects of that response to the overreaching of 1979-80 are beginning to fade, as the vision of plentiful oil spreads more widely. The thrust behind nuclear power has weakened substantially as a result of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and the unwillingness to allow recovery of the costs of new plants. Interest in coal continues to recede because of publicity about the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>In the United States this has meant a turning away from coal and nuclear power and turning back to oil and natural gas. By the middle 1990's, new oil- and gas-fired generating capacity will add substantially to the demand for hydrocarbons. Beyond that, there remains a steady growth in the demand for oil.</p>
        <p>So, despite the widespread belief that we can look forward to more than a decade of moderate oil prices, in a few years time we should anticipate a break-out of oil prices, in which real prices rise persistently. The stage will be set for such a break-out after the reabsorption of the capacities represented by Iran and Iraq, as worldwide demand continues to build at a million barrels a day each year and, perhaps especially, as production declines in the United States.</p>
        <p>According to an estimate by the American Petroleum Institute, with oil at $15 a barrel, American domestic production should decline to 6.2 million barrels a day by 1991. Of course, such estimates cannot be precise, but one should recognize from such a projection, which is roughly accurate, that oil production in the lower 48 states will, by the early 1990's, have declined by more than 50 percent from its peak.</p>
        <p>Moreover, production from Alaska's North Slope will begin to decline, probably next year. This is especially important for perceptions of the oil market. However erroneously, Alaska has been regarded by Americans as an endless source of supply. As the decline, which promises to be quite steep, sets in, the unavoidable result will be a change in perception - which is crucial in establishing the tone of the oil market.</p>
        <p>With falling production and rising demand, American imports should reach nine million barrels a day by 1991 - surpassing their previous peak, reached in the 1970's before the opening up of Alaska. By the middle 1990's, American imports could reach some 12 million or 13 million barrels a day - if that oil should be available. By then, also, we should have a revival of complaints about the American energy squanderer from other importing nations.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that, despite all our rhetoric, we Americans are doing yeoman service to restore the cartel's power. More than anyone else, we are adding to global demand for oil. We are allowing our domestic industry to wither and, as a consequence, rapidly raising the level of our oil imports.</p>
        <p>As we peer into the 1990's, we shall see a revived OPEC, one with fewer members and with power increasingly concentrated among the high-capacity producers - in brief, an inner cartel, wholly dominated by a few Persian Gulf producers. This will be brought on by the unwillingness of the consuming nations (and most notably the United States) to take the steps now that would later protect us against the worst aspects of a revival of cartel power.</p>
        <p>Regrettably, democratic societies rarely respond until a crisis has erupted. The threats of a renewed cartel and a new upswing in oil prices lie too far in the future to spur us to action today.</p>
