        <p>LEAD: The clash between the White House and Congress over broad trade legislation has failed to derail a free-trade agreement with Canada.</p>
        <p>The clash between the White House and Congress over broad trade legislation has failed to derail a free-trade agreement with Canada.</p>
        <p>Although legislators - chiefly from Western states with natural resource industries - have raised a series of complaints about increased competition from Canada, many analysts now think that the pact, on which Congress began work last week, could be approved before the August recess.</p>
        <p>The accord would clear away most trade and investment barriers over 10 years between the two countries, which are already each other's biggest trading partners.</p>
        <p>There had been widespread fears that an expected White House veto of the omnibus trade bill, over the divisive issue of prior notification of plant closings, would destroy the environment for the Canadian agreement, which the White House badly wants.</p>
        <p>But Congressional committee chairmen and the Administration have just worked out a schedule that would enable jointly drafted implementing legislation to be formally submitted to a ''fast-track'' approval process before the end of May.</p>
        <p>''I see no indication whatsoever that Congress intends to hold up the process with respect to Canadian implementing legislation,'' said Alan F. Holmer, the deputy United States trade representative. ''All the discussions to date have been positive and constructive.''</p>
        <p>The House Ways and Means Committee began to ''mark up'' the legislation last week. This week, the Ways and Means panel will continue its work while, in parallel meetings, the Senate Finance Committee will also take up the legislation.</p>
        <p>The closed-door sessions are to write the legislative changes needed to make American laws conform with changes in tariff, regulatory and other practices called for under the agreement, which was signed by President Reagan and Brian Mulroney, the Canadian Prime Minister, in January.</p>
        <p>Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is the Ways and Means chairman, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, the Finance Committee's head, have set the week of May 23 for a conference to complete the legislative tailoring. Under fast-track procedures, Congress then has 90 legislative days to vote either yes or no on the changes as a complete and integrated package without amendments.</p>
        <p>The two Governments are going through a parallel approval process. Canada's implementing legislation will be submitted to Parliament around the end of May. 'Full of Potential Pitfalls'</p>
        <p>John R. W. Fieldhouse, a spokesman at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, said: ''The Congressional hurdle is the major hurdle full of potential pitfalls. We're not counting our chickens just yet, but we do think the merits of the agreement will eventually sell themselves.''</p>
        <p>Once it is clear that the agreement will pass Congress, Prime Minister Mulroney, who heads the Conservative Party, is expected to call elections. Some of the credit for keeping the accord on the tracks goes to the Canadian leader, who recently visited Washington, pressed the flesh with members of Congress and addressed a joint session of Congress on April 27.</p>
        <p>''Mulroney did some pretty impressive lobbying while he was up here,'' said an aide to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, a backer of the agreement.</p>
        <p>Not all of the Canadian's efforts were successful, however. He met with one of the principal opponents of the pact, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, who is worried about its impact on his state's uranium producers. Since there was no meeting of minds on free trade, the two only discussed acid rain, an aide to Senator Simpson said. Different Political Dimensions</p>
        <p>In further explaining why the free-trade agreement has not been held hostage in the trade bill imbroglio, analysts noted that the political dimensions are different. Canada is the United States's closest ally. The two countries share a 4,000-mile frontier. The free-trade agreement, which brings the two allies even closer, is thus seen as too important to sacrifice to the election-year political strife over the trade bill.</p>
        <p>Although the trade agreement cannnot be renegotiated, lawmakers are determined to protect constituent interests - from cattle and wheat to lead and zinc - in the implementing language.</p>
        <p>The agreement generally benefits high-technology, service and manufacturing industries that will gain from reductions in Canada's tariffs, some of the highest in the world for an industrial country. But greater Canadian competition could hurt the American natural resource industries.</p>
        <p>According to a rough rule of thumb on Capitol Hill, winners are everyone east of the Mississippi and Californa; losers are the rest of the country. But other analysts challenge this formulation, calling the pact a winning situation for the country as a whole because of increased general economic activity expected to result, as it did in Europe in the 1950's after formation of the European Community.</p>
        <p>''There is no one out there who thinks he can actually kill this agreement,'' said an aide to Senator Malcolm Wallop, another Wyoming Republican, who also has serious reservations about the pact. ''So the implementing language is the only way to work something out.'' Accommodation Stressed</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they were trying to accommodate the Western interests to the extent possible without undermining either the Canadian pact or other international trade arrangements, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
        <p>''We are sensitive to their concerns,'' a senior Administration official said. One example is the way the lead industry is being treated. A 3 percent tariff on lead would be phased out over 10 years. Should imports surge as tariffs decline, a provision would raise them again for a limited time.</p>
        <p>Last week, in the House Ways and Means drafting sessions, Representative Donald J. Pease, Democrat of Ohio, and Richard T. Schultze, Republican of Pennsylvania, insisted that the implementing language clarify provisions about the steel industry. They want language to say that there is nothing in the free-trade agreement precluding bringing Canada under a program of voluntary steel-export restraints, which the United States already has with about 20 countries and the European Community.</p>
        <p>''We'll try to work out such language,'' an Administration official said, noting that it would not imply that restraints would be imposed on Canada. ''It would just be a statement of fact,'' the official added. Complaints on Subsidies</p>
        <p>Canadian subsidies are a big problem in Congress. Legislators from South Carolina and other textile states have complained about subsidies given to Canada's apparel producers. Farm states worry about subsidized hogs, wheat, potatoes and beef. Maine's legislators point to subsidized fish.</p>
        <p>Because they could not agree on the subsidy question during the negotiations, the two Governments completed other parts of the agreement and said they would take up the subsidy issue again in five years.</p>
        <p>Despite the subsidy problem, most lawmakers back the agreement. Helping to generate that support are manufacturing, service and other industries that stand to benefit, and are lobbying together as the American Commitee for Trade Expansion With Canada.</p>
        <p>The committee is staging rallies and other activities to promote grass-roots interest. ''We're in high gear,'' said Harry L. Freeman, executive vice president of the American Express Company, one of the main backers, ''and we expect to accelerate in May and June.''</p>
