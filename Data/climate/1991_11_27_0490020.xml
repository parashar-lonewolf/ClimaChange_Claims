        <p>Canadian bacon, beer and whisky are staples among Americans with a taste for luxury. But here in western New York, the latest Canadian export has brought mostly grief.</p>
        <p>From across the Canadian border, waste paper, rotten food and the flotsam of countless Ontario businesses are arriving in what amounts to a rolling pipeline of mud-splashed tractor-trailers. In their wake has come anger about the unpublicized change in Federal rules that made it possible, and a growing effort in Congress to impose tariffs on the trash, despite warnings about provoking a trade war.</p>
        <p>Some of the garbage has been dumped here atop a mountain of trash that rises like a tumor from a bed of radioactive waste laid during the Manhattan Project. The landfill is already so high that people living in the shadow of its eastern shoulder say sunset comes 30 minutes earlier than in adjacent areas. The Trash Is Flowing</p>
        <p>Now, haulers acknowledge, the trash has begun flowing to other landfills across the region and to nearby states, including Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Officials say they expect the garbage will soon be trucked to sites in every state within a couple of hundred miles of the Ontario border.</p>
        <p>The fermenting anger over the onslaught of Canadian garbage is the obverse of simmering Canadian wrath over the destruction of the environment by acid rain -- thought to be caused by pollutants from smokestacks in the American Rust Belt that drift over the border, the world's longest undefended frontier.</p>
        <p>Just like the acid rain problem, the garbage situation underscores how even parochial decisions can wreak cross-border havoc. Haulers began trucking mountains of Canadian trash here when Ontario, seeking to finance an ambitious recycling program, raised tipping fees to $150 a metric ton from $18 four years ago. Dumps in the United States generally charge about $35.</p>
        <p>The flood of garbage has opened long-festering wounds in communities across western New York, which is scarred by dumps. After crossing the border, the trucks pass within a stone's throw of Love Canal, Bloody Run Creek, Hyde Park and the so-called Alphabet Sites, to name but a few of the toxic landfills. 'Slap in the Face'</p>
        <p>"It's a slap in the face," Representative Bill Paxon, a Buffalo Republican, said before a recent visit to the landfill here, a couple of miles east of the border and 90 miles south of Toronto. "We are continually being dumped on. Now we're being dumped on by another country. We're better than this. We're worth more."</p>
        <p>United States officials say the barrage of Canadian garbage will aggravate a desperate shortage of space at the declining number of American landfills. That, they predict, will provoke a sharp jump in dumping fees as far away as California and Florida. Ultimately, the price increases will be passed along to consumers across the country.</p>
        <p>Since no agency tracks the trash, there are no firm statistics about how much enters the country. But state and Federal officials estimate that as much as 500,000 tons of garbage has been brought in this year. Hauled in 20-ton loads, that is at least 25,000 truckloads. Lined up end to end, the trucks would stretch about 190 miles.</p>
        <p>State officials fear that what began as a trickle could turn into an uncontrollable flood as soon as current Canadian disposal contracts expire. They note that American landfill operators are already overwhelming Canadian haulers with offers to sell them tipping rights for the 4.3 million tons of garbage produced each year by greater metropolitan Toronto.</p>
        <p>"The floodgates have opened," warns Representative Paxon, the architect of a multipronged legislative campaign to stanch the rising flow of Canadian trash. "This not only exacerbates the existing landfill problem, it brings it to a crisis. It's just a short time till homeowners across the U.S. will feel it in their pocket book." Risk of Disease</p>
        <p>Representative Paxon and other legislators say that the trash onslaught risks spreading agricultural diseases and pests and is an invitation to abuse. Since there is no established routine for inspecting the trucks, officials say it is only a matter of time until companies start bringing in hazardous wastes along with the municipal garbage.</p>
        <p>"At some point, clean garbage is going to become dirty garbage," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican. "Practical experience tells us there are unscrupulous operators out there. It's just a matter of time until some people are going to make big bucks by putting loads in there that are hazardous."</p>
        <p>Until recently the Department of Agriculture prohibited the import of wastes destined for landfills -- although it did allow an estimated 150,000 metric tons of garbage into the country for incineration. But as Ontario increased its tipping fees, the growing price differential drew haulers to American dumps like sea gulls.</p>
        <p>Several companies petitioned the Agriculture Department to reverse a five-year-old policy that required permits to bring in garbage. After a review, the department announced in an unpublicized ruling in July that it had found it did not have the statutory authority to regulate the import of Canadian municipal trash. The decision removed the only Federal restrictions on solid waste imports. The garbage onslaught began almost immediately.</p>
        <p>Ontario officials have mixed feelings about the southward flow. While any increase in the exported tonnage might bankrupt their recycling program, it does relieve pressure on the Ontario's dumps, which are already close to capacity.</p>
        <p>"This is buying extra time for the Province," said Robert G. Ferguson, Toronto's Commissioner of Works, noting that the city has unsuccessfully tried to find a site for a new dump for five years.</p>
        <p>Representative Paxon and Senator D'Amato are pressing legislation that would impose a $150 a ton inspection fee at the border. The two legislators say their colleagues appear eager to co-sponsor the bill. Even though the charge would amount to a tariff, they said it would not violate free-trade agreements between the two countries because it is a service fee.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the proposal has provoked warnings that Canada could strike back by charging even more for hazardous waste that is shipped there.</p>
        <p>"Unilateral action on our part could result in retaliatory actions by Canada," said Representative John J. LaFalce, a Buffalo Democrat who as chairman of the Small Business Committee recently conducted hearings into the issue.</p>
        <p>Officials also fear that making an issue of the problem will open up a Pandora's box of interstate squabbles. In his testimony to the Small Business Committee, Norman H. Nosenchuck, director of the Solid Waste Division of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, noted that New York ships out of state about 13 percent of the three million tons of waste it annually generates. Receiving states, he warned, could use legislation aimed at Canadian waste to prevent interstate shipments.</p>
        <p>"That's a red herring," Representative Paxon said. He added that the entire issue of Canadian retaliation was all but moot because American exports of hazardous waste to Canada last year totaled 75,000 tons, 25 percent less hazardous waste than Canada shipped to the United States in that period.</p>
        <p>"They started this," he said. "We're just trying to deal with it. We can't become the garbage dump for North America."</p>
