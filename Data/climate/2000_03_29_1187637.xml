        <p>Alex Farrell letter comments on March 27 article on shortcomings of Clean Air Act (March 27 article Acid Rain Law Found to Fail in Adirondacks); calls for integrated nitrogen oxide control legislation that accounts for all of pollutant's effects</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Acid Rain Law Found to Fail in Adirondacks'' (front page, March 27): Stringent regulations to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and vehicles are already  on the books, but they are intended to control photochemical smog. Thus those applying to power plants are only in effect in the summer.</p>
        <p>Although Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill would extend some of these controls, it has never generated much support. But all these requirements are under attack from Midwestern states; part of their strategy is to exclude acidification issues entirely.</p>

        <p>Although Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill would extend some of these controls, it has never generated much support. But all these requirements are under attack from Midwestern states; part of their strategy is to exclude acidification issues entirely.</p>
        <p>This points to a problem with the Clean Air Act: it separates acid rain, smog and other effects of nitrogen oxide pollution, making it harder to devise good environmental laws and harder to gain political support for them. We need integrated nitrogen oxide control legislation that accounts for all of the pollutant's effects.</p>
