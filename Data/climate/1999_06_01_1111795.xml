        <p>''Fleas,'' the textbook states, ''are highly specialized parasitic insects belonging to the order Siphonaptera.'' That order name tells it all: Fleas have a siphon, a Draculian mouthpart that sucks the life blood from whatever animal their genes have programmed them to latch onto. Or, failing to find their predestined host, they will dine on any available red-blooded creature.</p>
        <p>Fleas' habits would surely place them among the more repulsive of living things. Upon landing on their victim, they proceed to harass, extract blood, induce allergic reactions, introduce infectious organisms and deposit their eggs on their unwelcoming host. The tiny worm-like larvae emerging from the eggs feed principally on the feces of their parents, who nourish the next generation with partially digested blood.</p>
        <p>Disgusting, possibly, but not to Dr. Jay Georgi, an emeritus professor at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, the operator of one of the nation's few flea farms and the inventor of a most improbable boon to scientific research: the artificial dog.</p>
        <p>When his flea farm was going full-tilt, Dr. Georgi's freeze-dried fleas were more than worth their weight in gold, fetching $40 a gram ($1,200 an ounce), or 10 cents a piece live. Pharmaceutical and pesticide companies bought them to develop flea-control products and allergy shots.</p>
        <p>But the artificial dog -- in effect, a device in which fleas live and reproduce -- has greatly reduced the farm's business. The companies that made the farm one of the largest flea-suppliers in the country bought his artificial dog instead, and bred their own supplies. But Dr. Georgi does not mind. ''Most of the new products on the market for controlling fleas were developed using my artificial dog,'' he is proud to say.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, he keeps a ''small population'' of several hundred thousand fleas alive and breeding for emergencies. ''You never know when we'll get a call for fleas from some company or researcher,'' he remarked. ''We always have to be ready to fill an order.''</p>
        <p>A tinkerer by nature, Dr. Georgi invented the device that revolutionized the flea-breeding business when the grant he had to work on another costly parasite, the schistosome, was not renewed. At the time, fleas for research were bred on live animals, mainly cats and dogs. Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, where Dr. Georgi worked and wrote a classical text on animal parasites, had six cats that served as flea-breeders. And while the cats' flea production was prodigious, the cats were not exactly thrilled and the harvesting was tedious.</p>
        <p>Dr. Georgi thought he could come up with a device that would do better. His artificial dog, modified and patented since his retirement, is a transparent acrylic box, about 16 inches on a side, with an electric heater to warm the fleas and the cow blood they drink. Within the box are 25 cylindrical cages, each of which can feed 300 reproducing fleas. The cages consist of an aluminum cylinder filled with blood and covered with parafilm, an artificial skin through which the insects feed. Their eggs and feces collect at the bottom in plastic dishes filled with sand and ground-up dog food.</p>
        <p>Every other day, the adults are separated out by blowing on the dishes, which sends them hoping about wildly. Then, using another Georgi invention, the adults are  sucked into a collector with a modified vacuum cleaner. Eggs are then transferred to an incubator where they hatch into larvae that dine on the blood-rich feces and dog food. There, they pupate within silken cocoons surrounded by sand grains and metamorphose into adults -- wingless creatures with strong spring-like legs that can propel them up to 7 feet vertically or 13 feet horizontally, the equivalent of a person jumping 250 feet up or 450 feet forward.</p>
        <p>Dr. Georgi figures that one artificial dog can do the work of 104 live ones. If need be, the parasitologist can raise 12,000 fleas in a day with the artificial dog.</p>
        <p>But while he is proud of his invention, the fleas are what really fascinate him. He marvels at their mouthparts, which are horizontal, then are squeezed vertically to make a perfect feeding tube.</p>
        <p>Observing fleas through a microscope, Dr. Georgi produced a home video of the fleas feeding and excreting and then mating, an act entertaining enough to be in a flea circus. The male crawls beneath the female and turns its tail end up to copulate. As with most other species, the males compete for females, and a  male in the mood will try its best to dislodge another male already in a copulatory position.</p>
        <p>''I'm very fond of them,'' Dr. Georgi said. But he admitted: ''No matter how much you love them, you can get bored watching them. They do the same things over and over again.''</p>
        <p>The arrival of warm weather means the height of flea season is fast approaching. The creatures thrive at temperatures of 80 to 85 degrees, and humidity of at least 75 to 85 percent, said Dr. Michael Dryden, a veterinary parasitologist at Kansas State University in Manhattan. As a result, fleas are a year-round problem in the Gulf Coast States, a summertime plague in the Northeast and Midwest and a negligible presence in the Rocky Mountain States.</p>
        <p>Adult fleas are about 1/16-inch- to 1/8-inch-long with dark reddish-brown, wingless, hard-to-crush bodies and three pairs of legs (the hind pair produce those incredible leaps). Their bodies are flattened vertically or horizontally to allow easy movement between the hair, fur or feathers of their hosts.</p>
        <p>Worldwide there are in fact about 1,350 different species of fleas that specialize on various birds and mammals. Pet owners -- and those who bought homes previously occupied by a flea-infested pet -- are most familiar with the cat flea, the flea that is usually found on domestic dogs as well as cats. Adult fleas wisely select feeding sites where their hosts are unable to scratch, typically the base of the tail and between the shoulder blades. Given the opportunity, fleas could easily become ubiquitous pests that inhabit every nook and cranny on earth. Under ideal conditions, in just one month 10 female fleas can generate a quarter of a million fleas in various life stages.</p>
        <p>Pet owners struggling to get rid of fleas are often warned that the parasite spends most of its life off the animal and that treating the animal's environment is as important as treating the animal itself. However, thanks to a discovery in the late 1980's by Dr. Dryden, it is now possible to control fleas without poisoning the environment. Dr. Dryden showed that once they sink into a blood supply, adult fleas hang on to the animal for life. Even though the other stages of a flea's life cycle are spent off the animal, the new flea control products, which include insect growth regulators and skin-penetrating insecticides that are used only on the infested animal, are able to interrupt the flea's life cycle by killing off adult fleas when they seek their blood meal.</p>
        <p>Each fertile female lays about 15 to 20 eggs a day that lie loosely on the animal's coat and drop off almost anywhere, especially where the animal rests, sleeps or nests. Eggs can be found in upholstered furniture, bedding, carpets and in crevices and cracks on the floor. In two days to two weeks, the eggs hatch into blind, light-avoiding larvae, which molt twice within a week to several months before spinning a cocoon. The adults form in the cocoon in about five to 14 days. If conditions are right, they may emerge right away, or they may remain in their silken womb for months until they detect vibrations, pressure, warmth, noise or carbon dioxide that indicate a blood meal is near.</p>
        <p>Adult fleas can live for a year without feeding, but will dig in the moment a likely meal appears. That is why people are often viciously attacked by hordes of blood-thirsty fleas when a family returns home from a long vacation or someone moves into a house that was empty for a long time. Dr. Georgi said that one Cornell professor, upon returning from vacation, would send his dog in first for a few hours to feed the resident fleas before he entered the home. In warm climates, fleas can live outdoors year-round. The so-called sand flea that people encounter on vacation beaches is nothing more than a common flea that is breeding outdoors in the soil.</p>
        <p>Fleas are more than annoyances. About 15 percent of dogs, cats and people who are preyed upon by fleas develop an allergic reaction -- a maddening itch at the site of the tiny red ''bite'' surrounded by a red halo or in some people a generalized allergic dermatitis characterized by intense itching and swelling. A puppy or kitten heavily infested with fleas can actually die of anemia.</p>
        <p>Before the new flea-control products arrived on the market claiming to control flea allergy, the Heska Corporation, a veterinary biotechnology company in Fort Collins, Colo.,  was working on allergy shots for flea-tortured pets. Using an adapted artificial dog, researchers collected spoonfuls of flea saliva from the feeding membranes, identified the protein allergens in the spit, cloned the genes that produce those proteins and were preparing to test the effectiveness of desensitization shots in cats and dogs. Robert Grieve, the company's chief executive, said the project was ''suspended, though not abandoned.''</p>
        <p>Fleas also spread disease, both to pets and people. Most common in domestic animals and an occasional unfortunate human is the tapeworm. Flea larvae, which have chewing mouthparts and nondiscriminating appetites for anything organic, can feed on egg-filled tapeworm segments that escape through the anus of an infested animal. The eggs hatch into larvae in the adult flea. Then, when a dog or cat swallows a flea in the process of grooming, the tapeworm larvae are consumed and invade the animal's digestive tract. Children too may get tapeworms after accidentally consuming parts of tapeworm-carrying fleas.</p>
        <p>More serious ailments transmitted by fleas include bubonic plague, a disease that is endemic in the American Southwest where it is spread primarily by the oriental rat flea from rodent to rodent and from rodent to humans, although 30 other flea species can also transmit the disease. The oriental and northern rat fleas transmit murine typhus fever among rodents and from rodents to people. Fleas are also carriers of tularemia, a disease related to plague that originates in cottontail rabbits in the east and jack rabbits in the west.</p>
        <p>For those interested in assessing the seriousness of an indoor flea infestation, researchers offer this technique: Put on a pair of light-colored trousers and tuck them into white socks. Then enter the area in question for exactly one minute. If five or more fleas have landed on the person's legs, the infestation is severe.</p>
        <p>Flea experts at Colorado State University say that chemical and ultrasonic flea collars are ineffective at controlling fleas. But the newer products, which include insect growth regulators and insecticides that disperse in the animal's skin or get into the blood, work far better than flea powders, shampoos and sprays in keeping pets free of fleas.</p>
