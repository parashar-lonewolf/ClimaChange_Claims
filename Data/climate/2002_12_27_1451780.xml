        <p>Longtime residents of this city of legendary winters woke early this morning and found the world had somehow righted itself after several years of mild winter weather. The streets were blanketed in 21 inches of snow, the cars had turned to smooth hillocks, and the sidewalks were no more than a rumor beneath the thick, white cover.</p>
        <p>''The cars were completely covered, not even the mirrors showing,'' said Walter Nickens, a 51-year-old dishwasher who lives downtown. ''You thought you were in the country somewhere. It was beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nickens started shoveling at 5 a.m. and was just finishing up at 3 p.m., leaning on his shovel and admiring the four cars he had carved out of the snow.</p>
        <p>Across the city and its surrounding counties, people spent the morning digging out and struggling to get to work on roads where, in many places, only one lane was open.</p>
        <p>On Christmas Day and through the night, a wicked northeaster that dropped 5 inches of snow on Manhattan -- and more than twice that in some New York City suburbs -- left a thick covering across much of central New York, the Catskills and the upper Hudson Valley.</p>
        <p>Walton, in Delaware County, received 33 inches, while 31 inches fell in Liberty, in Sullivan County. The largest snowfall was in Cherry Valley, an Otsego County town, where 39 inches fell.</p>
        <p>The people of the state capital took the storm in stride. Crews of teenagers and men gleefully took to the streets with show shovels to dig out cars for a few extra bucks. Children on Christmas vacation hit the hills with toboggans. With sidewalks impassable, people walked down the middle of slush-filled roads to the few stores that managed to open.</p>
        <p>Historians, politicians and other local sages said the storm reminded them of the great winters of the past. There has been a general feeling here in recent years that something had gone wrong with the weather. In the 1990's, several winters brought only sleet, rain and mud, which no one seemed to like.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me like the winters I remember, more like them than in the last three or four years, when I was convinced global warming was on the rise and we would be swimming in December,'' said William Kennedy, the author who has immortalized Albany in his novels.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman John J. McEneny, Albany's representative and a local historian, said he started shoveling at midnight last night in hopes of putting a dent in the mountain of snow so he could free the cars in his driveway in the morning.</p>
        <p>Like many Albany residents, he said he did not mind the weather. His grandmother used to tell him of the great blizzard of March 1888, when 46.7 inches of snow fell on the city and they had to dig tunnels through the snow because it was impossible to move. All storms pale in his imagination to that one, he said.</p>
        <p>''It is beautiful and it does force people to have their lives slow down,'' he said, ''and it's a great reminder that nature is bigger than all of us.''</p>
        <p>No one knows precisely why the winter has started so early and come on so hard this year, but no one doubts this is going to be a hard, cold season. Never has so much snow fallen here in the month of December -- 32.6 inches, according to the National Weather Service. (For the record, Albany's worst winter ever straddled 1971 and 1972, when 112 inches fell.)</p>
        <p>Meteorologists, who do not have a sterling reputation as soothsayers around the capital, say the early winter has something to do with unusually warm air over Greenland, unusually cold air in the upper atmosphere of the North Atlantic, and warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Pacific around the Equator, the El Ni√±o phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist at Penn State University, said the combination of these trends has been causing winter weather in the Northeast for more than a month, but that is no guarantee the heavy snows will continue. ''It can easily swing back the other way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last night's storm forced state officials to take the unusual step of closing more than 140 miles of the Thruway from Syracuse to the Catskills for six hours because plow operators could not see more than a few feet in front of them. It reopened at midnight.</p>
        <p>In Delaware County, the authorities closed the roads from 3:30 p.m. yesterday to 8:30 this morning. Route 17 was also closed, and stranded motorists were forced to lodge overnight at a local school. Officials in Otsego, Herkimer and Schenectady counties took similar precautions late Christmas Day, closing roads to let plows through.</p>
        <p>There were very few reports of serious collisions or injuries in places where heavy snow fell, the state police said. ''If there is such a thing as a good time for a storm this is what happened yesterday, as traffic volume was down because of the holidays,'' said Sgt. Glenn Miner, a spokesman for the state police.</p>
        <p>The morning trip to work was difficult, however, and those who made it often wondered why they had, since so few people were about. John Woodward, the Schenectady County clerk, got up at 3:15 in the morning to dig his car out at his home in Rotterdam, N.Y. It took him two hours, and the trip to work was treacherous. Most of downtown Schenectady was still closed at noon, he said. ''We have had maybe five customers all day long,'' he said. ''Sometimes you feel like why are you here?''</p>
        <p>Some complained of aching backs after hours of trying to free their automobiles from the drifts. Kelly Pagano, a 23-year-old insurance claims processor, gave up and hired a passing crew to dig out his girlfriend's car in central Albany. ''I usually do my share of digging out cars every season,'' he said. ''But they came along and said $20. My back hurts just enough to pay them that kind of money.''</p>
        <p>Most people, however, took the storm with good cheer. For some, it meant employment. Asked if the early winter bothered him, John DeShaw, 30, a highway worker who was digging out cars for $20 apiece, said, ''No way, I want it to go on.''</p>
        <p>Skiers were also happy, as the slopes in the Catskills and Berkshires promised heavenly runs. David Mominee, a 29-year-old computer engineer who was looking for a shovel to find his car with, said the skiing was abysmal last year, but not this time around.</p>
        <p>A Brooklyn native, Mr. Mominee said New York City residents did not understand the winter mindset among residents upstate, where it is embraced. ''Down there you get 6 inches and people go crazy,'' he said. ''Up here, if you aren't going 60 on the Thruway with 2 feet of snow, you are considered a tourist.''</p>
