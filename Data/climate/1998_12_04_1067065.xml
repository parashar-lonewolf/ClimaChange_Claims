        <p>After tornadoes, El Nino rains and an ice storm swept across large swaths of the country, Congress enacted an emergency spending measure in May providing $2.6 billion in natural disaster relief. Deep inside that bill, though, in a last-minute addition, the oil industry won a big concession: relief of $66 million from the amount owed for extracting oil from Federal lands.</p>
        <p>Then in October, with Congress wrangling over a huge spending bill and eager to cut deals and leave town, the oil industry won again as the House leadership reaffirmed that relief. Indeed, in the end, Congress even sweetened the deal a bit, by extending the break a little longer.</p>
        <p>Such is the power of Big Oil in Washington, and two of the biggest players in this monolithic and highly effective industry lobby are the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation. Rich in cash, aggressive in style, with issues ranging from foreign policy to taxes and the environment, they have been effective in pushing their agenda through behind-the-scenes contacts at the highest level of Government and through arm-twisting in Congress.</p>
        <p>''Some companies have a narrow range of interests to lobby on,'' said Jennifer Shecter, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks Washington lobbying. ''But, by its very nature, oil is so pervasive and it is so affected by Government policy that they care about everything.''</p>
        <p>With the oil and gas industry generally marching, and lobbying, in lockstep, it is often hard to separate Exxon and Mobil from their rivals. While somewhat different in their approaches, both companies are big supporters of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade association that spent $3.7 million on lobbying in 1997. They often join industry coalitions created to lobby about a specific topic -- the lifting of sanctions to oil-producing nations like Iraq, for example, or the ability of American oil companies to swap oil with Iran.</p>
        <p>By themselves, Exxon and Mobil have a combined total of 15 full-time lobbyists on their payrolls in Washington, and employ other Washington lawyers and lobbying firms as well. Last year, Mobil spent $5.3 million on Federal lobbying and Exxon spent $5.2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Combined, this would make them the fifth-largest entity in spending on lobbying the Federal Government.</p>
        <p>As multinational corporations with businesses in far-flung spots, Exxon and Mobil's interests in Washington touch on many trade and finance issues. The two companies have won favorable tax rulings before the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department concerning the use of foreign tax credits to reduce their United States tax bill.</p>
        <p>They are sensitive to the State Department's Middle East and Asian policies, especially since oil is often found in pariah nations such as Libya, Myanmar and Iran. They are generally supportive of Arab nations. And new issues, like the proposed Caspian Sea pipeline route -- a region where Mobil has operations -- have engaged them.</p>
        <p>''They are probably most effective behind the scenes,'' said Martin Lobel, a Washington lawyer who represents consumer groups and small oil companies. ''They'll get their economists and lawyers to see the I.R.S. and the companies will stay relatively hidden. You've got maybe two Ph.D economists in the entire I.R.S. and Exxon can hire as many as they want. We were once in a big battle with Exxon on the issue of oil overcharges and there must have been 30 economists on the other side.''</p>
        <p>Edward Rothschild, a senior associate with Podesta Associates, a Washington lobbying firm, said that the two companies' lobbying on complicated tax issues had paid off handsomely.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of esoteric issues, especially in taxes, but which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. ''There were efforts by the Clinton Administration in the last two budget bills to reduce the value of the foreign tax credits. But Exxon and the industry descended and those provisions were quietly eliminated. I don't know who they talked to, but they got the job done.''</p>
        <p>While Exxon and Mobil are usually allied on industry issues, each has a different operating style: Exxon is more aloof and somewhat diffident about how it is perceived; Mobil is quicker to defend its public image and more willing to enter the political fray. Exxon's brashness was evident when the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, one of the worst environmental catastrophes in United States history, became a giant tax break, as the company wrote off all disaster-related expenses -- including legal bills and cleanup costs.</p>
        <p>Mobil makes few campaign contributions, while Exxon is a leading donor to the Republican Party and candidates. In the 1996 Presidential election cycle, Exxon contributed $593,928, donating 95 percent to Republicans; in the last Congressional races, Exxon gave $475,855, 84 percent to Republicans.</p>
        <p>This G.O.P. tilt could help the companies in the next Congress: the three new top House leaders are all Republicans from the Oil Patch: the House Speaker, Bob Livingston of Louisiana; the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, and J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the party's new conference chairman.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, Exxon and Mobil opposed the Clinton Adminstration's efforts to gain Senate approval of the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to curb global warming that had won support by other oil companies like Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum.</p>
        <p>And, in the last Congress, they won significant victories to halt the Interior and Treasury Departments' efforts to get oil companies to pay more in royalties for oil and gas extracted from Federal lands and pay back some $345.5 million in past royalties that the Interior Department says is owed.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has even filed suit to collect these royalties; last August, Mobil spent $56.5 million to settle these claims. Meanwhile, in Congress, Exxon leads an industry effort to pay royalties owed to the Government in oil rather than in cash -- a proposal the Government strongly opposes.</p>
        <p>''The oil companies lobby in a very coordinated way,'' said a staff member for a House energy-related committee, who spoke on the condition that neither he not his committee be identified. ''They rely heavily on the American Petroleum Institute, but they've also got their people. Exxon's lobbyist is very friendly and outgoing and the company is really involved in the royalty issue. On a technical point, Exxon's lobbyist will bring in 11 people to talk to you about it. They are incredibly influential.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Russo, an Exxon spokeswoman, said it was too early to tell how the company's lobbying would be affected by the merger, a view shared by Donald Turk, a spokesman for Mobil. Mobil does plan to continue paying for op-ed newspaper ads and for the ''Masterpiece Theater'' television series through 1999, Mr. Turk said.</p>
        <p>If history is any guide, the companies' lobbying expenses will undoubtedly rise while the merger faces Federal scrutiny: The Bell Atlantic Corporation's lobbying costs shot up to $15.6 million at the time of its merger with Nynex, and the Boeing Company's costs rose to $10 million as it was acquiring McDonnell Douglas.</p>
        <p>Still, the specter of a combined Exxon-Mobil juggernaut on the Potomac scares some. ''They will be so huge and interested in an incredible number of issues,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington nonprofit group. ''They'll come up with new lobbying battlegrounds.''</p>
