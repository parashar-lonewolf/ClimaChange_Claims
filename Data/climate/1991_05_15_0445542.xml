        <p>All over the Northeast, the sugar maples are dying.</p>
        <p>They are dying the same way they grow, slowly, their lifespans measured by decades and centuries rather than months or years. Their distress is discernible: stunted growth, fungus on the bark, leaves that turn orange and drop too early in the fall.</p>

        <p>All over the Northeast, the sugar maples are dying.</p>
        <p>They are dying the same way they grow, slowly, their lifespans measured by decades and centuries rather than months or years. Their distress is discernible: stunted growth, fungus on the bark, leaves that turn orange and drop too early in the fall.</p>
        <p>Among the most affected trees are those in the higher elevations, particularly in the Appalachian range, where they are squarely in the path of the acid rain that has been falling in the region since the 1950's. Also affected are trees growing in soils that are deficient in calcium, an element that helps neutralize the effects of acid rain.</p>
        <p>"We think we are looking at the early stages of an epidemic problem," said Dr. Mel Tyree, director of the University of Vermont's Proctor Maple Research Center, which sits in a maple forest in this town 20 miles east of Burlington. "We project a regionwide decline in the forests within the next 50 to 100 years."  Trees' Wide Range</p>
        <p>Sugar maples, the dominant tree in the hardwood forests of the Northeast, range as far south as Virginia along the highest ridges of the Appalachians and as far west as Minnesota. Although the tree is best known for its sweet sap, which is boiled down into maple syrup, it is also a valued furniture wood.</p>
        <p>Americans spend about $35 million on maple syrup, about half of which comes from Vermont.</p>
        <p>"One strange phenomenon is that a sugar maple under stress will produce more and sweeter sap," said Sumner Williams, assistant director of the research center. He said this was one of several mysteries facing scientists studying the maple.</p>
        <p>Although there is no accurate estimate of the decline for the entire region, researchers studying a population of sugar maples on top of Camels Hump peak in the Green Mountains here have measured a 25 percent decline in the average height, width and general bulk of the trees and a decline of nearly 50 percent in the number of new trees for the last 25 years.</p>
        <p>Some of the sugar maple's enemies are the age-old, naturally occurring kind: drought and rapid temperature fluctuations. Two years ago, the pear thrips,an insect native to Europe, cut a wide swath of destruction through southern Vermont, feasting on young sugar-maple leaves just ready to open.</p>
        <p>But such natural enemies have become all the more deadly because they leave the trees in a weakened condition and thus vulnerable to enemies, particularly pollution, created by man. Trees that would have lived 400 years are dying at 65 or 70.  Measuring the Damage</p>
        <p>A tree grows in concentric circles, with each year's growth wrapping itself around the last. By taking a cross section, scientists can analyze the chemistry of each ring, often as far back as 200 years.</p>
        <p>"In the early 1800's, when some of these trees started, there is almost no trace of chemicals in the wood," said Hubert Vogelmann, a professor of botany at the University of Vermont. "As you start approaching the Industrial Revolution, you start picking up traces of chemicals. But when you hit the 1950's, it really takes off. That's when you can really see the decline begin."</p>
        <p>Exactly what such chemicals do to trees is still somewhat of a mystery to researchers. The lack of better information has made it hard for experts to persuade the Federal Government to intervene.</p>
        <p>What researchers know is that sulfuric and nitrous gases from coal furnaces rise into the air, move east with the prevailing winds and fall to earth as acid rain. The acidic rainfall removes important nutrients from the soil and could also hinder photosynthesis. Sources of Pollution</p>
        <p>By analyzing the chemicals in the air and comparing them with wind currents, researchers at the center here have been able to identify the Ohio River Valley, more than 500 miles to the southwest, as the source of much of the pollution in northern New England. The rest of the pollution apparently travels north from the large urban areas on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>Acid rain has been a continual source of tension between Midwestern states, where the coal is burned, and Northeastern states, where acid rain has damaged lakes and streams. Although the Federal Clean Air Act was amended last year to limit the amount of acidic pollution going into the atmosphere, Mr. Vogelmann pronounced the change "too little, too late."</p>
        <p>Other worrisome chemicals include vanadium, a component of fuel oil, and arsenic, a byproduct of smelting.</p>
        <p>"We think the effect of heavy metals on trees is somewhat like the effect of cholesterol on humans, clogging things up," said Mr. Williams of the research center. "But they may just overbalance the system. We really don't know for certain."</p>
        <p>For the short run, Dr. Tyree said, adding calcium to the forest soils and putting limits on logging would help slow the decline, as would introducing ecologically safe pest controls. But he added, "The ultimate solution is to reduce acid rain."</p>
        <p>The Proctor Maple Research Center, the only center in the world doing this type of research on sugar maples, is facing serious problems of its own. The original building, which dated to 1946, burned down two years ago. The Federal Government agreed to rebuild the center at a cost of $720,000, to be delivered in two grants, if the money was matched by private donations.</p>
        <p>To match the first grant, Mr. Vogelmann went hat in hand to the neighbors, corporate and private donors, and schools, recruiting students to hold bake sales. Donors were encouraged to adopt a maple tree for $100. With the laboratory partly rebuilt, he now faces the daunting task of doing it all over again.</p>
        <p>But he said he would because he believes that carrying on with the 25-year-old sugar-maple study is important, not only because of the commercial value of the syrup that comes from the trees but also because the trees have a place of honor in the American psyche.</p>
        <p>"When we told people a few years ago that red spruce trees were dying, they said, 'Gee, that's too bad,' " he recalled.  "But when I was quoted as saying sugar maples were dying, I got calls from all over the country. A radio announcer from Salt Lake City called me and asked me to comment about it on his radio show. He said sugar maples are like bald eagles and apple pie; they're American."</p>
