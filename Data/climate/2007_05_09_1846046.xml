        <p>For writers of narrative nonfiction, one of the biggest challenges is getting access to sources and events that they might not otherwise see.</p>
        <p>Susan Casey, a former creative director at Outside magazine, has just signed a book deal for about $1 million with Broadway Books to write about the science of giant waves and the surfers who try to ride them. To research the book, she needs help getting to the center of oceans where these waves erupt and where surfers try to catch them -- an undertaking that often requires helicopters, wave runners and exquisite timing. So she is paying Laird Hamilton, the celebrity surfer who will be a central character in her book, to put her at the center of the action.</p>

        <p>For writers of narrative nonfiction, one of the biggest challenges is getting access to sources and events that they might not otherwise see.</p>
        <p>Susan Casey, a former creative director at Outside magazine, has just signed a book deal for about $1 million with Broadway Books to write about the science of giant waves and the surfers who try to ride them. To research the book, she needs help getting to the center of oceans where these waves erupt and where surfers try to catch them -- an undertaking that often requires helicopters, wave runners and exquisite timing. So she is paying Laird Hamilton, the celebrity surfer who will be a central character in her book, to put her at the center of the action.</p>
        <p>''I'm asking him to put me in the middle of his dangerously and logistically complex undertaking,'' said Ms. Casey, whose previous book, ''The Devil's Teeth,'' was about great white sharks. ''It was inevitable that we would have to have some kind of incentive for him to do that.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''He doesn't need the exposure, and he's past the point in his career when he's going to do this out of the goodness of his heart.''</p>
        <p>Although the financial arrangement is not unprecedented, publishing executives said it was more common that an author and subject share proceeds because a ghost writer or joint writer was retained. Sometimes such a relationship can morph, as when Buzz Bissinger was asked to collaborate with Tony La Russa, manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, in writing a more typical ''as told to'' title. During the course of interviews, both Mr. La Russa and Mr. Bissinger decided to let Mr. Bissinger write the book in his own voice, but Mr. La Russa still shared the proceeds of ''3 Nights in August'' and donated his share to the Animal Rescue Foundation, a nonprofit organization he founded with his wife.</p>
        <p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Ron Suskind split the royalties of ''A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey From the Inner City to the Ivy League'' with his subjects, Cedric Jennings and his mother, Barbara, but not until after the book was published. ''I didn't want to tell them until after the process was over because I didn't want them to feel any sort of incentive in terms of cooperating,'' Mr. Suskind said. ''I think it really confuses and affects the writer-subject dynamic.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Casey declined to say how much she would pay Mr. Hamilton, one of the world's most famous big-wave surfers, but she said the split was not 50-50. She said that she retained full editorial control of the book, which will explore how climate change is affecting the frequency and intensity of big waves and will also chart the race by surfers to tackle waves of 100 feet or more. Mr. Hamilton will also participate in promoting it.</p>
        <p>Stephen Rubin, president and publisher of Doubleday Broadway Publishing Group, said he had no problems with Ms. Casey's arrangement with Mr. Hamilton. ''He is giving her access to things that she would never have and taking time,'' he asked. ''Why shouldn't he get paid?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Casey said the book, which was sold on the basis of a 36-page proposal, will probably take her a year to 18 months to research. She said she would be talking to oceanographers and climate specialists and spending time with an eccentric cast of surfers, including Mr. Hamilton.</p>
        <p>Broadway bought the book, currently titled ''100: Stalking the Giants of the Ocean,'' by pre-empting an auction last Monday after Sloan Harris, Ms. Casey's agent, had shown the proposal to 11 publishers.</p>
        <p>Although ''The Devil's Teeth'' sold just 36,000 copies in hardcover, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of book sales, it was a New York Times nonfiction hardcover best seller.</p>
        <p>Stacy Creamer, deputy editorial director of Broadway Books, who will be editing Ms. Casey's book, said she envisioned it as an adventure yarn in the mold of Jon Krakauer's ''Into Thin Air,'' the best-selling account of a deathly climb up Mount Everest ''with a bit from the movie 'Twister' thrown in.''</p>
