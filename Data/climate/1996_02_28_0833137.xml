        <p>You don't hear much these days about Atoms for Peace. Championed by several administrations after World War II, the effort promised a limitless supply of energy for the entire world. Now, scientists involved say, a half century of work that brought that dream to the verge of reality has been stopped flat by Federal budget cutbacks. Theirs is pretty much the point of view of tonight's elegiac edition of "The New Explorers."</p>
        <p>The center of action was the Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, which had the mission of developing safe reactors that would recycle their waste and provide clean, inexpensive and inexhaustible power. Clear explanations and graphics lay out the problems and the attempted solutions. The early efforts were encouraging enough to power a boom in the building of nuclear plants around the country in the 1960's and early 1970's.</p>

        <p>You don't hear much these days about Atoms for Peace. Championed by several administrations after World War II, the effort promised a limitless supply of energy for the entire world. Now, scientists involved say, a half century of work that brought that dream to the verge of reality has been stopped flat by Federal budget cutbacks. Theirs is pretty much the point of view of tonight's elegiac edition of "The New Explorers."</p>
        <p>The center of action was the Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, which had the mission of developing safe reactors that would recycle their waste and provide clean, inexpensive and inexhaustible power. Clear explanations and graphics lay out the problems and the attempted solutions. The early efforts were encouraging enough to power a boom in the building of nuclear plants around the country in the 1960's and early 1970's.</p>
        <p>Yet the images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki never faded, and Bill Kurtis, tonight's guide, leaves the laboratory to remind us of later events that made the hope of a nuclear-powered world seem like an invitation to catastrophe. Most frightening were the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in  1986.</p>
        <p>Opposition, always present, swelled. The scientists' dream became many a citizen's nightmare, bringing safety regulations that raised the costs of the plants. It was cheaper to continue to rely on fossil fuels like coal despite the harm they were doing to air and water and the prospect that they would run out in the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>One legacy of Atoms for Peace remains, along with the reactors that have been shut down: isotopes, some from radioactive waste, are being used to fight cancer. As for the larger dream, of a cheap-energy, clean-energy future, that is on hold in the United States, although other countries, notably Japan, have been carrying forward the work. (Mr. Kurtis fails to note that the Japanese program has been stalled because of an accident at a prototype reactor in December.)</p>
        <p>Viewers are left to muse upon whether an opportunity for a wondrous future has been lost or whether other disasters have been averted.</p>
        <p>'48 Hours' 'Behind Closed Doors' CBS, tomorrow night at 10</p>
        <p>Child-welfare workers usually make the headlines when they are accused of having failed in their jobs. "Behind Closed Doors" offers a glimpse of how difficult those jobs can be.</p>
        <p>Focusing on the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services, the program shows conscientious people grappling with hard decisions: A social worker and a police officer disagree over whether the bruises on two children's  arms are sufficient evidence of intentional abuse to remove the children from their mother's custody. A judge explains that the law compelled him to permit another child to remain in his father's home despite allegations of persistent abuse; the child died. A review board tries to determine whether still another child has been allowed to slip through the system.</p>
        <p>The report, a strong and coherent one by "48 Hours" standards, may slow down  the race to second-guess people who must make tough calls every day about protecting children without breaking up families.</p>
