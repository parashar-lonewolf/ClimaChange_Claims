        <p>Editorial commends China for using regulatory levers and economic incentives to encourage more fuel-efficient cars and trucks; holds that neither Congress nor White House has done much of anything to improve efficiency of American vehicles for past 20 years</p>

        <p>China's relentless economic growth has created severe environmental problems and depleted its natural resources. Its energy demands have contributed to rising oil prices and the gases associated with global warming. So it is heartening when China, the world's most populous nation, takes steps to curb its appetites. We hope other countries (like the United States) may be similarly inspired.</p>
        <p>Last week, Beijing announced plans to raise existing taxes and impose new ones on things like gas-guzzling cars and trucks, and disposable wooden chopsticks. The 5 percent chopsticks tax (a tax that also extends to floor planking) is intended to persuade people to buy reusable and plastic chopsticks in order to slow clear-cutting in Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p>China's relentless economic growth has created severe environmental problems and depleted its natural resources. Its energy demands have contributed to rising oil prices and the gases associated with global warming. So it is heartening when China, the world's most populous nation, takes steps to curb its appetites. We hope other countries (like the United States) may be similarly inspired.</p>
        <p>Last week, Beijing announced plans to raise existing taxes and impose new ones on things like gas-guzzling cars and trucks, and disposable wooden chopsticks. The 5 percent chopsticks tax (a tax that also extends to floor planking) is intended to persuade people to buy reusable and plastic chopsticks in order to slow clear-cutting in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Chinese officials announced a big jump in taxes on vehicles with large engines, while reducing taxes on smaller vehicles. This follows an earlier directive imposing more stringent fuel-economy standards on all vehicles sold after July 1. Taken together, the moves reflect growing official concern about the rapid proliferation of private vehicles in China.</p>
        <p>This is good news for anyone worried about global warming because a big percentage of greenhouse gas emissions come from vehicles. Even with more efficient cars, however, China is expected to be an increasingly heavy producer of those gases because it relies so heavily on coal-fired power plants. The increased gases from these plants are likely to cancel out any savings from automobiles unless some way is found to reduce them.</p>
        <p>Still, China is to be commended for using regulatory levers and economic incentives to encourage more efficient cars and trucks. Neither Congress nor the White House has done much of anything to improve the efficiency of this country's vehicles for the past 20 years.</p>
