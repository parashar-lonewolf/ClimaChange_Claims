        <p>Take a sopping wet underground cavern in a remote corner of Arizona. Add a man-made entrance with heavy steel doors to keep out the hot desert air, a misting system to keep the cavern damp and lights to show off a wonderland of spires, flowstone, soda straws and other phantasmagorical cave formations.</p>
        <p>Then add a human being who, in a one-hour visit, sloughs off some 60,000 skin fragments, 160 million dust particles, 20,000 clothing-lint particles, 25 quarts of carbon dioxide gas and 170 watts of body heat. Multiply this by 183,000 visitors to the cave each year.</p>
        <p>The result is an ad hoc experiment now under way at Kartchner Caverns near this town in southeastern Arizona to learn if it is possible to bring thousands of people into the fragile environment of a pristine cave without destroying the cave in the process. Kartchner is the first major ''show cave'' to open in the United States in several decades.</p>
        <p>The Arizona State Parks system, which owns the land, is trying, with some difficulty, to balance the interests of visitors with those of preservationists. Arizona has spent more than $28 million on monitoring systems and on a visitors center, two man-made entrances, 1,100 feet of concrete tunnels and 1,225 feet of trails that lead visitors to large showrooms inside the cavern. One of these, the Throne Room, is now open. A second, the Big Room, will probably not open for a few years.</p>
        <p>Already, there are signs that the cave is drying out -- compared with years before the cave opened last November, the average temperature is up 1 degree and in some spots humidity dropped by half a percent and evaporation rates quadrupled. And without enough moisture, Kartchner's formations will stop growing and their colors will fade.</p>
        <p>Ken Travous, director of Arizona State Parks, said the changes could be explained by the construction, which is still under way, and the severe drought in the area.</p>
        <p>But a number of leading cave scientists and the two men who discovered the cavern 26 years ago are worried that park officials are not heeding signs that the cavern may be in trouble.</p>
        <p>Ron Kerbo, a leading authority on cave management for the National Park Service, recently visited Kartchner Caverns. Although he praised the commitment of the state park officials, he pointed out problems with lighting, misting, air locks, data collection and a new proposal to sample cave air and moisture with a system of plastic tubing called cave suckers. ''It would be better to install electronic sensors'' to understand changes in cave microclimates, Mr. Kerbo said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Randy Tufts, co-discoverer of the cave who now does lunar and planetary research at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said: ''Our main concern is that they don't seem to be on top of data collection. It's one thing to have a problem and know it and another to have a problem and not know it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tufts and his caving buddy, Gary Tenen, who today owns two Alpha Graphics stores in Tucson, found the cave in 1974 when they crawled into a cavity in the Whetstone Mountains and smelled ''eau de bat guano'' coming from a three-inch hole in a wall of limestone. They widened the hole, crawled in and discovered an untouched, two-and-a-half-mile long, richly decorated ''living'' cave, meaning its formations were still growing.</p>
        <p>Worried that large numbers of amateur cavers would destroy the pristine cavern simply by exploring it,  the two kept its existence a secret. In 1978, they told the Kartchner family, owner of the land, about the cave, and in 1988 the family sold it to the state.</p>
        <p>''Ironically, we realized that the best way to preserve the cavern was to develop it as a commercial show cave so that it would remain under watchful eyes,'' Mr. Tenen said. In unsupervised caves, people cannot seem to stop themselves from breaking off stalactites that took 10,000 years to grow, writing on walls and strewing garbage, he said.</p>
        <p>In opening the nation's newest cave, the developers of Kartchner have been able to employ state-of-the-art principles of cave conservation that are being used to maintain and restore older caves in other parts of the United States and in  Australia, France and Spain.</p>
        <p>Kartchner Caverns is a twisted maze of passageways that open into two main galleries with 100-foot-high ceilings and 26 smaller rooms. Apart from spectacular stalactites, stalagmites and columns, many of the formations sound good enough to eat or put in a living room at home: fried eggs, bacon, popcorn, turnip shields, soda straws, draperies, cave cotton, coral pipes, birdnests and miles of moonmilk, a soft, white claylike substance on cave walls. Some of the formations are blood red. A viscous mud of unknown depth lies in many passages, holding water from past floods.</p>
        <p>From April to September each year, 1,000 to 2,000 myotis bats turn one corner of the cave into a bat maternity ward. That corner will be off limits to visitors then, Mr. Travous said. A variety of microbial life plus 38 invertebrate species munch on bat guano or one another year round.</p>
        <p>Like most limestone caves in the world, Kartchner was formed when rain water combined with carbon dioxide in the air and carbon in the soil to form a weak acid solution similar to soda pop. As this acidic water trickled through limestone, it picked up calcium in the rock. When it reached air in underground passages carved by water running underground, each droplet gave up carbon dioxide gas and left calcium carbonate in tiny rings that grew into the yummy-sounding cave formations.</p>
        <p>The challenge at Kartchner is that this wet underworld lies in a desert where the surface evaporation rate is 800 times greater than inside the cave. If completely opened to surface air, the cave would dry out in a week, Mr. Travous said.</p>
        <p>Before opening it to the public, scientists spent two years taking baseline measurements of air and soil temperatures, relative humidity, evaporation rates, gases and airflow patterns within the cave.</p>
        <p>It is an extremely fragile environment, said Robert Buecher, a civil engineer who led the monitoring study and is an authority on cave climates. The original entrance allowed very little air exchange with the surface, he said. If the humidity were to drop just 0.7 percent from its average before development, to 98.7 percent, he said, the evaporation rate would double and start to dry out the cave.</p>
        <p>Cave climates are tricky and often counterintuitive, Mr. Buecher said. For example, one winter the cave flooded and the relative humidity went down instead of up. This was because the flood water was slightly colder than the cave air and, just as a glass of iced tea in summer collects moisture, the cold water condensed moisture out of the cave air.</p>
        <p>But people are the biggest threat to cave health, Mr. Kerbo said. At Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, people snap off and carry away 2,000 to 3,000 pieces of cave formation each year.</p>
        <p>''Everyone who goes into a cave leaves behind a belly button full of lint, skin cells and dust,'' said Tom Aley, owner and director of the Ozark Underground Laboratory, a cavern dedicated to teaching and research in Protem, Mo.</p>
        <p>People carry enough dust on the surface of their clothing fibers to cover the area of two tennis courts, said Neville Michie, a cave climate expert at Macquarie University in Marsfield, Australia. Walking through a cave, each person drops one microgram of dust per second, Mr. Michie said. The dust travels to the corners of a cavern and dulls the formations. Skin cells and lint, which are heavier than dust, accumulate near trails in nasty-looking grayish black mats or can even hang from the ceiling in ''lintcicles.''</p>
        <p>Flakes of skin are little life rafts for bacteria that float into the cave and compete with native bacteria, often taking over. Moreover, most lint contains phosphates from detergents, and phosphates are essentially fertilizers for algae, which can take root in the cave formations and cause them to disintegrate.</p>
        <p>Finally, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which can change the deposition rate of calcium carbonate, slowing the growth of formations. And, of course, people add heat.</p>
        <p>All of these problems were expected at Kartchner, Mr. Travous said.  The entrances and tunnels were dug at the same level of the natural opening, which prevents air from leaving the cave in a chimney effect. The visitors center, parking lot and other structures were built downhill within a different drainage system. Two huge walk-in freezer doors at each entrance serve as airlocks to the entrance tunnel and prevent surface air from coming into the cave.</p>
        <p>At the end of the tunnel, visitors pass through a smaller third door that leads to trails for viewing cave formations. Misters, like those used on vegetables in a supermarket, are on round the clock, adding two to three gallons of water per hour to the cave.</p>
        <p>The trails have 18-inch-high curbs for catching lint and skin cells, which tend to fall straight to the ground. Trails are hosed down every night.  Lights are turned on only when tours pass through an area.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, Mr. Travous said, only 20 people at a time are allowed on a tour and are watched by two guides.</p>
        <p>As for keeping an eye on the cave's climate, there are 13 monitoring stations for temperature, humidity and evaporation rate along the tour route and in deeper recesses of the cave. The ''cave sucker'' system of tubing is being installed in hope of automating data collection.</p>
        <p>Asked if all these measures were working to protect the cave, Mr. Travous said, ''We sure hope so,'' but added, ''We still don't know what is acceptable change.''</p>
        <p>''The cave is one degree warmer and the humidity is lower in some places,'' Mr. Travous said. ''But if we go back and look at monitoring data from the past, we've seen these higher temperatures before. Plus the cave will flood again.''</p>
        <p>But many scientists familiar with Kartchner Caverns are worried that some of the steps taken to protect the cave may ultimately contribute to its drying out. While the freezer doors keep hot air out of the cave entrance, the tunnels contain so much air that they may significantly alter air flow inside the cave, Mr. Kerbo said.</p>
        <p>The misters might change air flow patterns and temperatures, Mr. Kerbo said. Introduced water could concentrate on mudflats and other surfaces in a way that interferes with natural processes, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buecher said he was worried that data now being collected by hand were not being compared to baseline. ''If they were, someone would have sounded the alarm,'' he said. ''The cave is definitely drying out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Travous said that he planned to hire a cave specialist and a cave scientist to improve monitoring. Scientific advisers will be invited back at some point, and the idea for cave suckers is being re-assessed.</p>
        <p>''We're under pressure from the Legislature to finish construction and be fully open to the public,'' he said. ''But we won't neglect good science in the process.''</p>
