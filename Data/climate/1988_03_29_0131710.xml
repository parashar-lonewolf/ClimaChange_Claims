        <p>LEAD: The Du Pont Company has pledged to phase out all production of CFC's, the chemicals that erode the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere. Du Pont, the world's largest producer of CFC's, with sales of $600 million a year, set no specific timetable. But it said a ''reasonable goal'' would be to cut output by 95 percent by the year 2000 - nearly double the goal set by an international protocol last year.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The Du Pont Company has pledged to phase out all production of CFC's, the chemicals that erode the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere. Du Pont, the world's largest producer of CFC's, with sales of $600 million a year, set no specific timetable. But it said a ''reasonable goal'' would be to cut output by 95 percent by the year 2000 - nearly double the goal set by an international protocol last year.</p>
        <p>The Du Pont Company has pledged to phase out all production of CFC's, the chemicals that erode the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere. Du Pont, the world's largest producer of CFC's, with sales of $600 million a year, set no specific timetable. But it said a ''reasonable goal'' would be to cut output by 95 percent by the year 2000 - nearly double the goal set by an international protocol last year.</p>
        <p>The Du Pont action sets a compelling precedent for countries and companies still skeptical of the urgent need to develop alternatives to CFC's.</p>
        <p>Du Pont has invested heavily in developing substitutes for CFC's. Still, the decision to phase out production must have been hard. The chemicals have many uses, as refrigerants and solvents, in auto air-conditioners and foam packaging, and account for 2 percent of the company's earnings.</p>
        <p>CFC's are largely benign and non-toxic. But their very stability is what makes them a threat. Unlike other chemicals, they resist change as they percolate up through the atmosphere. As they are destroyed by sunlight they release their chlorine atoms, each of which destroys about 100,000 molecules of ozone.</p>
        <p>Ozone fluctuates widely in response to solar activity. But beyond such natural gains and losses, the ozone layer is also being destroyed by chlorine. The reduction attributable to chlorine since 1969 is as much as 3 percent. For every 1 percent thinning in the ozone layer, some 2 to 3 percent more ultraviolet light streams through. That causes biologists deep concern. Damage to plants and animals could quickly affect the environment, food chains and human health.</p>
        <p>Also at risk is the comfortable assumption that the atmosphere is so large and complex it will respond very gradually to man-made changes. The recently discovered ''ozone hole'' over the Antarctic each September is air that has lost 50 percent of its ozone. There was no hole in the 1960's when the chlorine in the high atmosphere amounted to one part per billion. The hole appeared after chlorine levels increased to the present level of just 3 parts per billion. This suggests that the atmosphere is in fact vulnerable to small changes.</p>
        <p>A pending international treaty, the Montreal protocol, calls for a freeze in global CFC production, followed by a cut of only 50 percent. Du Pont's actions signal the need to take even bolder steps to correct an extraordinary imbalance in the earth's protective canopy.</p>
