        <p>TWO HOUSES: Two decades into his career, the unclassifiable novelist and journalist William T. Vollmann -- his new book, ''Poor People,'' is reviewed in this issue -- has published 16 books, one of them a seven-volume, 3,300-page inquiry into the nature of violence and evil. (It's hard now to find a copy of that monster for less than $320.) He's so prolific it takes two and sometimes three publishers to release all his material: at Viking, the publisher Paul Slovak sees Vollmann's fiction into print. At Ecco Press, Daniel Halpern publishes his nonfiction. Vollmann, who is 47 and has written lately of health problems, including a series of small strokes, isn't slowing his output. He's got at least three books on the radar: one he's completed on riding the rails in America; one on the United States-Mexican border and the history of imperialism in America; and one on Japanese Noh theater. Halpern, who also publishes the word machine known as Joyce Carol Oates, had this to say to people who gripe about overproductive writers: ''Would the Yankees complain about their cleanup hitter sending too many balls over the wall in a season? Another save by Mariano Rivera? My good fortune in publishing Joyce Carol Oates and Bill Vollmann -- full-time writers both -- is that there's never an evening when I don't have something new to read by one of our great and original American writers.'' Vollmann, by the way, has yet to have a book appear on the Times list.</p>
        <p>LETHEM'S PLANETS: Jonathan Lethem, whose new book is also reviewed in this issue, has made the Times list -- his novel ''The Fortress of Solitude'' appeared here for one week in 2003. Lethem is a fan of the trippy science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, and he's the editor of a forthcoming Library of America volume of Dick's work; some may recall that early in his career, Lethem was often pegged as a sci-fi writer himself. Two of his first books received brief reviews here, written by the Book Review's former science-fiction columnist Gerald Jonas. Jonas admired Lethem's first novel, ''Gun, With Occasional Music'' (1995), writing that it ''has nothing on its mind but entertainment.'' He was less taken with Lethem's 1998 novel, ''Girl in Landscape,'' but he did like the scene in which a family ''goes to Coney Island for one last terrestrial outing beneath a sun turned deadly by the depletion of Earth's ozone layer.''</p>
        <p>MAN, PLAN: The comic Stephen Wright used to do a bit that went: ''For my birthday, I got a humidifier and a dehumidifier. I put 'em in the same room and let 'em fight it out.'' That's sort of how I feel about two recent books, Eric Abrahamson and David H. Freedman's ''Perfect Mess: The Hidden Benefits of Disorder,'' and its evil twin, Peter Walsh's anti-clutter manifesto ''It's All Too Much: An Easy Plan for Living a Richer Life With Less Stuff,'' which has been hovering on the extended list in recent weeks. One of Walsh's sprightly bits of advice is to undertake a ''book purge'' -- ''for every four or five books you keep, remove one from your library.'' Good plan! I'm thinking I'll start by tossing ''It's All Too Much,'' and then rest for a few years.</p>
