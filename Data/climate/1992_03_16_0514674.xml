        <p>Twenty-two years ago, in a maneuver widely blamed for banking NASA into the downward spiral it has flown ever since, a task group headed by Vice President Spiro Agnew charted a course for America's future in space based on three elements -- the space shuttle, a manned space station and, some time further in the future, a manned mission to Mars.</p>

        <p>Twenty-two years ago, in a maneuver widely blamed for banking NASA into the downward spiral it has flown ever since, a task group headed by Vice President Spiro Agnew charted a course for America's future in space based on three elements -- the space shuttle, a manned space station and, some time further in the future, a manned mission to Mars.</p>
        <p>Now the White House has nominated a new NASA administrator, Daniel Goldin, an aerospace executive at TRW. Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, reportedly pressed for a change in NASA leadership with the goal of setting a bold, fresh course for the nation's space program. And what are the key elements of this new plan? The same Big Three: the space shuttle, a space station and, some time further in the future, a manned mission to Mars.</p>
        <p>If two decades of NASA's staring into the headlights of the same three manned missions doesn't suggest to you that America's space strategists may be a bit lacking in vision, consider that the Big Three wasn't even new when Vice President Agnew stumped for it back in 1969. The rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and a few colleagues had spelled it all out in "Across the Space Frontier," published in 1952.</p>
        <p>Why is the space agency still playing tunes older than "How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?" Because vision's not its business. Baldly politicized ever since the Apollo moon program wound down, NASA has become one more big, fat, arteriosclerotic bureaucracy. Its constituency is the aerospace industry, not the public, and its manned missions are designed to fly not in space but in the halls of Congress.</p>
        <p>What's the solution? Break up NASA and start over.</p>
        <p>On the macromanagement level, we should assign the manned space program to its own agency -- from which it could compete fairly for the big bucks its Buck Rogers missions require -- while a second agency handled unmanned planetary exploration, and a third managed earth sciences and energy. All three could operate under the aegis of a Cabinet-level Secretary of Science and Technology.</p>
        <p>On the micromanagement level, we need to get the space program back into the hands of the kind of lean, mean, goal-oriented teams that drove NASA in its glory days, when men flew into orbit and on to the Moon while instrumented probes ventured to Mercury, Venus, Mars and beyond.</p>
        <p>In those days, it took half the manpower and a fifth of the money (pound-for-pound and in constant dollars) to put a satellite in orbit that it does today. Most of the increase has gone to pay the salaries of the bureaucrats. As Ivy Hooks, a former NASA engineer, told Henry S. F. Cooper of The New Yorker magazine, "The early NASA people were entrepreneurs . . . . In the 25 years after NASA was founded, it became a bureaucracy, and in a bureaucracy quality doesn't rise."</p>
        <p>The key to space agency reform is competition -- more competition among personnel for merit-based promotions, among contractors for performance-based rewards (the key to high-performance spacecraft like Pioneer, which is still functioning 20 years after launch) and fair, open competition between the manned and unmanned wings of the space program.</p>
        <p>For decades now, NASA has been draining money from the unmanned space effort to pay for costly, snail's-pace manned missions like the shuttle. The agency argues that the public won't support space exploration unless human life is at stake.</p>
        <p>My impression is just the opposite: 30 years of following the space effort has convinced me that the booty returned by unmanned probes -- the rugged vistas of Venus recently recorded by the Magellan probe, Voyager's color photographs of Jupiter's ruddy clouds, Saturn's golden rings, green Uranus and ice-blue Neptune -- has done more to fire imaginations than the erstwhile toilings of shuttle astronauts who aptly describe themselves as a "trucking company."</p>
        <p>Maybe I'm wrong. Put the manned and unmanned programs under two separate agencies, let them slug it out for tax dollars and we'll see. If instead we stay on our present course, we're likely to spend another 20 years pouring most of our space dollars into the shuttle, the space station and the manned Mars mission.</p>
        <p>The space shuttle program alone has cost taxpayers more than $100 billion. The recently scaled down space station Freedom is expected to cost another $100 billion; taxpayers have already shelled out $3.9 billion just to draw up the blueprints.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the price tag on a manned Mars mission run to $500 billion. For that much money we could send probes swarming all over the red planet (and transmitting back virtual reality simulations that would enable students around the world to explore Mars for themselves) and orbit additional probes around every other planet in the solar system. And we would have enough left over to reduce the national debt and restore the cuts in the Federal school lunch and food stamp programs that have doomed more than half a million American children to malnutrition-induced brain damage.</p>
        <p>The worst defect of the man-in-space triumvirate is that no one of its components makes sense without the other two. The shuttle has never really had a mission without the space station. Nor has anyone been able to figure out what the space station is for, except to give the shuttle something to do. As far as scientific research is concerned, the nation would get about the same yield in knowledge were we to orbit a flashing neon sign that soared across the night sky spelling out "NASA = Aerospace Jobs = Big $$$."</p>
        <p>And why send men to Mars? In an August 11, 1989, interview on CNN, Vice President Quayle reasoned that humans could live on Mars without much trouble. "Mars is somewhat the same distance from the sun, which is very important," said Mr. Quayle. "We have seen pictures where there are canals, we believe, and water. If there is water, that means there is oxygen. If oxygen, that means we can breathe."</p>
        <p>I'm told that Mr. Quayle has since learned that the canals of Mars actually are an optical illusion last taken seriously in the 1950's and that the Martian atmosphere consists of carbon dioxide gas thinner than the air outside a jetliner window.</p>
        <p>His enthusiasm for sending men to Mars has to do, I suspect, with generating jobs and profits (and thus political support) in the aerospace industry. That's the true rationale behind the Big Three: they're jobs programs. The shuttle and space station projects are entitlements, which means that Congress treats them as open-ended commitments to keep spending indefinitely.</p>
        <p>I'm all for a healthy aerospace industry. But the</p>
        <p>mental</p>
        <p>health of Martin Marietta, Lockheed and the rest depends not just on money but on recruiting skilled, inventive scientists and engineers -- just the sort of people who are repelled by brain-dead jobs programs. A status-quo mindset is literally disastrous in space exploration, which by its very nature demands original thinking.</p>
        <p>To give the Administration and space council their due, the nomination of the budget-minded Mr. Goldin and the announcement last week that agencies other than NASA will play a major role in space planning indicate a desire to see more efficiency. But top-down imperatives are unlikely to budge a NASA dinosaur that responds to innovative ideas by stamping them out.</p>
        <p>If we break up NASA and build a vital, multipartite space agency in its place, won't it, too, succumb to bureaucratic paralysis? Probably. If so, in another 20 years we may have to replace it, too, in the spirit of Thomas Jefferson's dictum that the health of the republic requires periodic ventilation by legal revolution.</p>
        <p>But in the meantime, we could have blazed a path in space worthy of a nation founded on exploration, the first to conquer the skies and put men on the Moon. If we don't, we might as well settle back and watch as Europeans and Asians decipher the secrets of the Earth's climate, map the surface of Saturn's moons and send an efficient manned mission to plant a flag on Mars. The pictures ought to look pretty, seen at home on a Japanese TV.</p>
