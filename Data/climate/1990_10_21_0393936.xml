        <p>LEAD: Brightly colored and maddeningly resistant to breakdown by natural processes, plastic products have become a symbol of the nation's litter and solid waste disposal problems. And, since plastics are almost universally derived from petroleum products, they represent a drain on what could become a scarce and increasingly costly resource.</p>
        <p>Brightly colored and maddeningly resistant to breakdown by natural processes, plastic products have become a symbol of the nation's litter and solid waste disposal problems. And, since plastics are almost universally derived from petroleum products, they represent a drain on what could become a scarce and increasingly costly resource.</p>
        <p>As a result, some chemical companies and research institutes are rushing the development of plastics made from natural sources, such as starch and sugars, rather than oil. Products derived from these materials could ease the pressure on oil supplies if prices soar. And they have the useful property of degrading into benign components quickly and completely after use.</p>
        <p>This is a departure from earlier efforts to make plastics appear more ''environmentally friendly'' by mixing the non-degradable basic polymer with small amounts of materials that react to sunlight or microbes in the soil. All this does, many environmentalists have argued, is produce smaller pieces of persistent plastic.</p>
        <p>The problem is that many of the synthetic molecules that are strung together into polymer chains to make conventional plastics are not found in nature, and thus few organisms have adapted to feed on them. But when plastics are formed from materials found in living plants, they become easily digestible food sources for microorganisms in the soil.</p>
        <p>Not even producers of natural plastics tout them as a complete solution to the solid waste problem. But they say these materials may have important niche applications where biodegradability is needed, such as for the outer wrappers of disposable diapers or as coatings on fast-food containers.</p>
        <p>''We are not the silver bullet, but we are part of the solution,'' said Thomas J. Galvin, biopolymers manager for ICI Americas Inc.</p>
        <p>Natural polymers are not new. Indeed, starch, a natural constituent of many foods, is chemically a polymer of the sugar glucose. Just as the synthetic polymer polyethylene consists of hundreds of ethylene molecules linked together, starch is composed of long trains of glucose units.</p>
        <p>ICI makes a family of biodegradable plastics from sugars and organic acids using bacteria. The procedure is similar to the fermentation process that produces ethyl alcohol, except that the bacteria used, Alcaligenes eutrophus, converts the feed materials into a plastic material known as polyhydroxybutyrate-valerate, or PHBV. The bacteria accumulates the material as a store of energy in the same way humans and animals accumulate fat. When the bacteria have accumulated up to 80 percent of their dry body weight as PHBV, the cells are burst open with steam and the plastic is collected. The exact composition of the polymer can be varied by making changes in the proportions of the feedstock. Thus it is possible to tailor the properties of the plastic while it still in the fermentation tank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galvin said PHBV has properties similar to polypropylene, one of the most common plastics. He said it is stable on the shelf, even in damp environments, but will degrade into carbon dioxide and water in an environment where microbes are present.</p>
        <p>The drawback is cost. The product from a pilot plant in Britain costs $15 a pound, but is expected to fall to between $2.50 and $3.00 a pound when a full-scale plant is built. Even at that, the material would be considerably more expensive than the 30 to 60 cents a pound for common plastics.</p>
        <p>But if events in the Persian Gulf send oil prices higher, the gap could narrow. Polypropylene and polyethylene prices rose as much as 20 percent in recent weeks and could obviously go higher. Moreover, for some, environmental concerns pose a marketing challenge in which cost disadvantages tend to evaporate. One hair care products maker in Germany, for example, is packaging shampoo in PHBV bottles so it can promote their biodegradability.</p>
        <p>Other organizations are working on natural plastics as well. Batelle Memorial Institute's Pacific Northwest laboratory in Richland, Wash., has developed a process that uses bacteria and chemical processes to convert a residue of sugar production known as blackstrap molasses into acrylates, which are used in acrylic paints.</p>
        <p>Battelle officials said the process increases the value of the products that might otherwise have to be disposed of at considerable expense. Blackstrap molasses has a value of about 2 cents a pound, while acrylates command as much as 70 cents a pound.</p>
        <p>The Warner-Lambert Company is building a plant in Rockford, Ill., to produce as much as 100 million pounds a year of what it calls Novon, a plastic material made from starch derived from corn or potatoes.</p>
        <p>The Warner-Lambert process does not involve any bacteria. Instead the starch is melted under high pressure in the presence of water. Previously, it was believed that starch would decompose before it melted.</p>
        <p>The starch-water material is then loaded into injection molding machines where it is melted in a screw conveyor and injected into a mold where it hardens. Company officials said they will supply the raw material in pellet form to producers of plastic products. They expect the first usages will be in products that are only used for a short time and discarded, such as plastic forks and cups.</p>
        <p>The Ferruzzi group of Italy has introduced a material it calls Mater-Bi, which is an alloy that is three-fifths corn starch combined with an unnamed synthetic polymer. The material apparently has better mechanical properties than one composed completely of starch. The company distributed watches and a small camera made of the material to demonstrate its capabilities. Even with the synthetic component, Ferruzzi officials said, it has biodegradation characteristics similar to paper.</p>
        <p>Amilcare Collina, chairman of Novamont, the Ferruzzi subsidiary that makes Mater-Bi, said the material is the result of a deliberate effort to find non-petroleum sources for plastics. ''The idea is to have a bridge between the agricultural culture and the chemical culture,'' he said. ''We want to derive raw materials from agricultural products such as vegetable oils and carbohydrates.''</p>
        <p>He said much of the work on natural polymers done after the oil crisis in the 1970's was dropped when oil prices came back down. Now, he said, environmental concerns and higher oil prices have renewed interest in the technology.</p>
