        <p>The costly federal effort to rebuild New Orleans's flood defenses in time for next year's hurricane season will leave the city no less vulnerable to major storms than it was to Hurricane Katrina, engineers and other experts say.</p>
        <p>And it will take years or decades, these experts say, to provide New Orleans and nearby communities with protection against hurricanes stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which was nowhere near the worst-case storm when it arrived. Its winds over the city and Lake Pontchartrain were apparently far below the Category 3 standard that was chosen in 1965 as the storm to defend against.</p>
        <p>''It took us 30 years to get to a Category 3 standard,'' Brig. Gen. William T. Grisoli, the deputy commander of Task Force Katrina for the Army Corps of Engineers, said of the defenses in an interview. ''You're not going to be at Category 5 by the next hurricane season.''</p>
        <p>Citing the 350 miles of levees in the region, General Grisoli added, ''Put it in perspective: It's not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>The corps is now involved in an arduous process to restore the levees to their previous level of protection, beginning with quick patches and ending, if all goes according to schedule, just before next year's hurricane season with the levees restored to their level of strength before the storms hit.</p>
        <p>Solutions for the longer term are not yet on the drawing boards, but experts have wide-ranging ideas that include strengthening the current levee system, finishing long-planned projects that have limped along because of court fights and tight budgets, and even reshaping the city to recognize that some of its lowest-lying areas might serve as future flood basins in the guise of parks or other undeveloped land.</p>
        <p>For now, the Corps of Engineers acknowledges that with two months left in this year's hurricane season, New Orleans is without any defense against a major storm. Its patched levees can barely withstand a modest storm surge, and flood walls and the taxed drains and pumps can handle only six inches of rain, as last week's renewed flooding in the Lower Ninth Ward showed.</p>
        <p>''We don't have hurricane protection,'' General Grisoli said.</p>
        <p>Senator Mary L. Landrieu, who is co-sponsor of a $225 billion legislative proposal that includes upgraded flood protection and regional rebuilding, said the job ahead ''goes beyond building a higher wall'' against storm waters. ''As this hurricane season tapers off,'' she said, ''we have to be well on our way to drafting a master plan to create the most sophisticated levee system in the world,'' with many elements working together.</p>
        <p>''It's not a local problem -- it's not a regional problem,'' Ms. Landrieu said. Because of the economic importance of the area for energy and commerce, ''It's a national problem, and it's a very expensive problem to fix.''</p>
        <p>In the long run, the challenges will only grow. Sea levels are rising around the world, and the land around New Orleans -- including the levees -- is sinking. The Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico have entered a cycle of intensified hurricane activity that could last a decade or two, and two recent studies have found that global warming might already be causing storms to be stronger than they otherwise would be.</p>
        <p>Craig E. Colten, a professor of geography and anthropology at Louisiana State University, said that what could protect against even a Category 5 storm today ''might not stand up to the worst kind of storm in 50 or 100 years.''</p>
        <p>Many experts agree on basic measures that could be taken to prevent further flooding, if Congress opens the purse strings.</p>
        <p>Alfred Naomi, senior project manager for the New Orleans District of the Corps of Engineers, has studied ways to bring New Orleans up to Category 5 protection and says any defense against such storms would start with barriers in the channels connecting Lake Pontchartrain with the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>The gates, which would be shut during storms, would prevent the surging gulf waters from adding to any surge from the lake.</p>
        <p>This would in turn reduce the amount of water coursing up the drainage canals that carry the pumped runoff out of the city and into the lake. The failure of thin flood walls along those drainage canals caused most of the flooding of central New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Smaller gates at the mouths of those canals could stop residual surges of floodwater from the lake, Mr. Naomi said. The city's pumping system can be modernized and improved, and levees and floodwalls will have to be made higher. But the added weight would cause them to sink even faster, and added width -- three feet for every vertical foot -- would require costly condemnation of nearby real estate. A Louisiana flood control official said that much could be accomplished for the New Orleans area by completing projects currently on the books and rethinking the regional patchwork of programs.</p>
        <p>''Right now we have a piecemeal system,'' said the official, Ed Preau, the assistant secretary for public works with the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development.</p>
        <p>While the current projects offer protection only to the Category 3 level, Mr. Preau said, they could be strengthened. ''The big issue is going to be to get past the environmental concerns,'' he said, adding that wrangling with environmental groups over big projects has slowed the process. Harold Schoeffler, a local official with the Sierra Club and Audubon Society, called the accusation that projects had been significantly slowed by environmental groups ''a bunch of baloney.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups never tried to block projects like a flood gate for Lake Pontchartrain, Mr. Schoeffler said; they have only demanded that the corps address the environmental impact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schoeffler said the Atchafalaya River and its basin, west of the city, could play a much larger role in defense against floods. He noted that the tangled delta of the Atchafalaya naturally protects the region against storm surges, and added that the corps could enhance that protection by dredging deeper channels.</p>
        <p>''The deltas are very beneficial,'' he said, ''but you've still got to get the water out.''</p>
        <p>Professor Colten of Louisiana State, the author of ''Unnatural Metropolis: Wresting New Orleans from Nature,'' said engineering work must be accompanied by efforts to restore nature's own systems for fighting floods. With the delta sinking, he said, ''The most fundamental activity outside of the city would be to restore the wetlands.''</p>
        <p>Like many environmentalists and other experts, he advocates shutting down the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a 40-year-old shipping channel that is lightly used by industry but appears to have served as a superhighway for the Katrina storm surge, contributing to the devastation of levees and flooding in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward.</p>
        <p>Robert Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was important not to rush into an ill-conceived plan.</p>
        <p>''Don't just try to throw $200 billion at it,'' said Dr. Bea, who has worked for the corps and who lost his home when Hurricane Betsy struck New Orleans in 1965. ''We really know how to do it better,'' but ''we do need to slow down and think how to do it.''</p>
        <p>Professor Bea's ideas include eliminating many of the city's open canals entirely and replacing them with powerful underground drainage and pumping systems. He said he would also like to see barrier islands built in front of major inlets to block storm surges.</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Jackson, a longtime resident of New Orleans who is vice president in the local offices of DMJM Harris, a large engineering company, said the federal government needed to rethink the way it protects against hurricanes.</p>
        <p>After the great Mississippi River floods of 1927, Congress gave the Corps of Engineers broad powers and ample financing to do whatever was needed to prevent a similar disaster in New Orleans, including extremely strong riverside levees. By contrast, hurricane protections, which were approved after Hurricane Betsy in 1965, have greater Congressional oversight and control, and projects are subjected to a cost-benefit balancing test.</p>
        <p>''Dams are built based on avoiding the catastrophe that would result if they failed, not on a benefit-cost ratio,'' Mr. Jackson said, adding that the same standard should apply equally to hurricane protection systems for New Orleans.</p>
        <p>William F. Marcuson III, the former director of the Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Miss., and president-elect of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said that even though elected officials have vowed the city would be rebuilt, in the long run it would be foolhardy to redevelop many of the most flood-prone areas.</p>
        <p>Essentially, he said, those areas want to be bays and wetlands. ''Buy the lots back and let insurance pay for the houses,'' he went on. ''Then maybe make it a golf course or bird sanctuary.''</p>
        <p>Recovery after a disaster generally takes far more time than people expect, said Robert W. Kates, emeritus professor of geography at Brown University. Dr. Kates, who has developed a well-regarded four-stage model of disaster recovery, said that the fourth stage -- the one in which greater levels of protection are put in place -- is rarely accomplished because it can take many decades.</p>
        <p>As the rebuilding proceeds to the final stage of reconstruction, he said, the tensions that arise after every disaster are sure to emerge in New Orleans -- especially the very common conflict between those who insist on putting things back in place quickly and those who say, ''Let's do it right. Let's do it better.''</p>
