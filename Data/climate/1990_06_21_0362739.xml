        <p>LEAD: To most people, the fine details of the Federal regulatory process are about as appetizing as a tour of a bologna factory. And those who disregard Bismarck's advice to remain ignorant of the manufacture of sausages and laws often discover that regulators have liberally peppered their products.</p>
        <p>To most people, the fine details of the Federal regulatory process are about as appetizing as a tour of a bologna factory. And those who disregard Bismarck's advice to remain ignorant of the manufacture of sausages and laws often discover that regulators have liberally peppered their products.</p>
        <p>The spice is called cost-benefit analysis, and in the case of the Federal Aviation Administration's consideration of new rules governing airplane safety seats for infants and toddlers, it seems that pediatricians, consumers, flight attendants and even the airlines are finding it unpalatable.</p>
        <p>In several recent air accidents, babies died who might have lived if they had been buckled into safety seats. One example this year was the Avianca Airlines crash on Long Island in January, now the subject of hearings by Federal safety investigators.Another example was the United Airlines crash in Iowa in July 1989. But F.A.A. rule makers argue that it would endanger babies to require that they be buckled into protective seats during flight.</p>
        <p>How come? Because, they say, the costs of requiring safety seats would force families to drive instead of fly, and hence negate any safety benefit from the seats, since cars are statistically more dangerous than airliners.</p>
        <p>Similar analysis comes into play whenever major rules are considered, though the exact costs and benefits can rarely be calculated scientifically. A more rarefied example can be found in the debate over cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and methane into the air, perhaps (or perhaps not) slowing economic growth, to ward off global warming, which may (or may not) exist.</p>
        <p>On infant seats, the analysis begins with the fact that babies under 2 years old are allowed to fly at no charge if they are held on a parent's lap.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. says that if babies were required babies to ride in safety seats, they would need tickets. The extra tickets would cost an estimated $210 million a year. Discounts might be available for babies; that is not clear. But the rule makers believe that a safety seat requirement would cause a 21 percent reduction in airplane trips by families with babies. Every year, they calculate, 700,000 such families would decide not to travel by air.</p>
        <p>Every state requires babies to sit in approved car seats. And nobody considers a lap the safest place for a child to sit in an airplane. The National Transportation Safety Board, an independent agency, recently joined those calling on the F.A.A. to write a rule requiring that babies be fully restrained, even if it means giving up the cherished free rides.</p>
        <p>But the aviation agency continues to balk, recently delaying a final decision on its own proposal to make the safety seats optional for babies - or rather, for their parents, some of whom already choose to buy tickets for their babies and put them in safety seats.</p>
        <p>The agency's pro-choice position is supported by a few analysts who believe that rational examination does not support a mandatory safety seat rule. Take the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonprofit organization that says it promotes ''free-market approaches to regulatory issues.'' It calls a mandatory rule ''a totally unwarranted restriction on consumer choice.'' Like the aviation agency, the institute argues that the mandatory rule would ''cause the deaths of far more people than it might save.''</p>
        <p>There is a logical trap in this reasoning. Nobody knows how the aviation agency decided, many years ago, that 2 years of age was the cutoff point beyond which tickets must be bought and seat belts worn. Suppose the limit were raised to 3 years old: by the agency's logic, more families could then afford to fly instead of drive, carrying their older children on their laps.</p>
        <p>The regulators say they are not considering any such thing. But Sam Kazman, a lawyer with Competitive Enterprise, said he would endorse letting older children ride free on parents' laps. That, he says, is no business of the Government.</p>
        <p>In principle, he said, airlines should be allowed to sell standing-room-only tickets for adults - as long as this decision was approved by their marketing departments. A cost-benefit analysis, he said, would show this to be in the public interest. UALd(United Airlines)</p>
