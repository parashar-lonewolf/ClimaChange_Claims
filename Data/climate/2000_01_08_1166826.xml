        <p>At last, shared interests are producing signs of cooperation between two warring forces in our society, business and environmentalists. On the one hand, bad environmental policies are ultimately disastrous for businesses and their employees. On the other hand, conservationists can't make the environment healthy without the help of businesses.</p>
        <p>As an environmentalist (a director of World Wildlife Fund), I have mostly been in the position of blaming businesses for bad things. However, any habitual blamer also incurs an obligation to give praise where praise is due. Last year, I found that opportunity in an unexpected location, the big Kikori oil field of Papua New Guinea, managed by Chevron.</p>
        <p>Although Chevron had enlisted World Wildlife Fund as partner to advise on environmental issues, I expected to see a mess. Instead, I was astonished as soon as I arrived.  Flying over, I couldn't see oil wells, because almost the whole area retains its original cover of rain forest.</p>
        <p>Forest grows up to the edges of the few roads, camps, wells and drill sites. Next to the camps and wells, I found New Guinea's most endangered bird and mammal species much more abundant than outside the area leased by Chevron. Most drill sites are tiny clearings reached by helicopter, not by roads; all food in camps is imported, not grown in local gardens that would require clearing forest.</p>
        <p>Chevron derives at least three advantages from these tight environmental policies. First, Papua New Guinea is a litigious democracy in which local people still own the leased land and count every tree chopped down in their bill for damages. The less forest cleared, the lower are the damage claims against Chevron.</p>
        <p>Second, big recent industrial disasters give warning that, in the long run, it is far cheaper to spend modest sums each year on a clean operation than to pay later for a catastrophe.  For instance, the Exxon Valdez oil spill cost Exxon billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Finally, Chevron employees themselves tend to be educated and environmentally concerned. They don't like going home and being scorned for being part of a dirty enterprise as soon as they mention their job. The employees feel proud of what they are doing, and they have high morale and low job turnover.</p>
        <p>Essential to the outcome at Kikori is the partnership between a big oil company and a big environmental organization. As a side benefit to Chevron, World Wildlife Fund's independent assessment of Chevron's operation is credible to the public, whereas no one would believe it if Chevron took out ads praising itself.</p>
        <p>This partnership seems to me a model for business policies of the next century. I see it already taking hold in the timber industry, emerging in fisheries, and on the drawing boards in some other industries.</p>
        <p>Behind this trend lies consumers' growing awareness of the risks that environmental problems pose for the health, economies and political stability of their own world and their children's world. Given a choice between buying equally priced products from a clean company or a dirty company, of course they would buy the clean product. But consumers are barraged with manufacturers' claims of environmentally sound practices. How can we distinguish the valid claims from the deceptive ones?</p>
        <p>The solution is termed ''certification.'' As applied to the timber industry, here's how it works. An independent, not-for-profit international entity called the Forest Stewardship Council, established in 1993 with input from environmental organizations as well as from loggers, formed a list of environmentally sound logging practices.</p>
        <p>Those practices include harvesting lumber at a rate sustainable indefinitely, maintaining old-growth forests, maintaining biodiversity, and so on. Timber companies may choose to ask an accredited certifier to study their operations at a particular forest.</p>
        <p>If the operations are found to meet the stewardship council's criteria, that forest is declared certified.  Then, if timber from that forest can be traced to consumer products, those products may carry a label with that information.</p>
        <p>This certification is catching on in a big way. There are already 40 million acres of certified forest in 31 countries, and that area is doubling every year, but consumer demand for the products still exceeds the supply. Certified forests yield timber products costing no more than uncertified products. In Britain, where this process is furthest advanced, sources certified by the Forest Stewardship Council now account for one-quarter of all wood supplies sold nationally.</p>
        <p>Last August, Home Depot, the largest buyer and retailer of forest products in the United States and in the world, announced that it would eliminate sales of wood products from environmentally sensitive areas by the end of 2002, and that it would give preference to certified wood.</p>
        <p>These trends are being driven not only by shifting consumer choice but also by business self-interest and raw necessity. Half of the world's original forests have already been destroyed, and our remaining forests will not last long if they continue to be harvested destructively.</p>
        <p>The same logic is driving a similar trend in fisheries. More than half of the world's commercially important marine fisheries are already either destroyed or endangered, and one-quarter of the catch is currently discarded because of sloppy practices.</p>
        <p>Hence in 1996 Unilever, one of the world's biggest buyers of frozen fish, became concerned for its own long-term survival, and it teamed up with World Wildlife Fund to found a Marine Stewardship Council. By Christmas of next year, I predict that you'll be able to buy environmentally certified seafood at costs no higher than those of corresponding uncertified foods. A race is on between the Alaska salmon fishery, the Australian rock lobster fishery and the Thames herring fishery to be certified first.</p>
        <p>In the next century, this certification will likely spread to the oil, gas and mining industries, and to industries emitting polluting and global warming gases. Make no mistake: this isn't a matter of ecoradical Big Brother ordering businesses and consumers what to do. We shall still need environmental laws, but the essence of independent certification is that it's voluntary at every stage. Labels of certification do nothing more than provide credible information to consumers. If you, as a consumer, don't care about environmental issues, then just continue to buy noncertified products. If you, as a chief executive officer, think that certification won't increase your company's market share, then don't apply to be certified.</p>
        <p>But the logic driving cooperation between environmentalists and businesses seems to me inexorable. Like the rest of us, C.E.O.'s of Fortune 500 companies breathe air, drink water, eat food and have children. Without sound environmental practices, their businesses, health and lives will be threatened. Without their support, environmentalists can't achieve their goals.</p>
