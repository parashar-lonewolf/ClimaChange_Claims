        <p>Ten or 20 years ago, a 60-degree day in January would be something to celebrate. New Yorkers would almost certainly be tearing off their long wool scarves, shedding their heavy coats and streaming into parks, reveling in the strange and wonderful reprieve from ice and freezing winds.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, temperatures soared to a record 64 degrees, weather considered normal for mid-April. But not many New Yorkers walking the streets in T-shirts and light sweaters seemed surprised. When asked whether she missed winter snowstorms, a 7-year-old girl, born in New York but too young to remember the big storm of 1996, said: ''I've never seen one. What is it like?''</p>

        <p>Ten or 20 years ago, a 60-degree day in January would be something to celebrate. New Yorkers would almost certainly be tearing off their long wool scarves, shedding their heavy coats and streaming into parks, reveling in the strange and wonderful reprieve from ice and freezing winds.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, temperatures soared to a record 64 degrees, weather considered normal for mid-April. But not many New Yorkers walking the streets in T-shirts and light sweaters seemed surprised. When asked whether she missed winter snowstorms, a 7-year-old girl, born in New York but too young to remember the big storm of 1996, said: ''I've never seen one. What is it like?''</p>
        <p>Even those who said they hated frigid weather expressed some dismay at what seemed to be the new norm of mild winters, of snowless, iceless Decembers and Januaries.</p>
        <p>''A year or so ago, I loved the warm winters,'' said Anne Garrett, 38, a secretary eating a falafel on a plaza bench outside a Midtown office building yesterday. ''It was great to have spring in January. But now it's getting weird. It's never cold anymore. I worry that something is really wrong, that this global warming is real.''</p>
        <p>According to meteorologists, a vast mass of mild air has been blowing in from the Southwest and is covering the entire mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions, bringing unseasonably warm temperatures that are setting several records. In Connecticut, records were set in Bridgeport -- where the temperature at 2 p.m. reached 60, breaking the high of 53 set in 1960 -- and at Bradley International Airport, in Windsor Locks north of Hartford, where the high of 62 shortly before 1 p.m. broke the 1913 record of 60.</p>
        <p>Records fell in Concord, N.H., yesterday, where it was 61. In Detroit and Grand Rapids, Mich., the temperatures were in the low 50's after reaching records of 57 Sunday.</p>
        <p>Today should be warm, too, with temperatures in the low 60's, said Jeff Warner of the Pennsylvania State University Meteorology Department. But a cold front is expected to move into the Northeast tonight, dropping temperatures to the high 30's or low 40's tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Misha Kizimov, an immigrant from St. Petersburg who walks dogs for a living, said yesterday was perfect. Mr. Kizimov, who spends six hours a day outside with the dogs, said: ''It's Jan. 3 and it's warm instead of cold. The worst day I remember was Dec. 11, 1992, when trees were falling and it was windy with a mix of rain and snow and I was walking the dogs. Today I thank God, it being mild and warm.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the people most disturbed by unseasonable winter warmth are the gardeners, amateur and professional, from volunteers at community gardens to professional horticulturists at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is hanging around,'' said Tom Thies, a board member of the West Side Community Gardens, between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, from 89th to 90th Streets, ''breathlessly waiting to see if buds swell prematurely and the spring bulbs come up prematurely.''</p>
        <p>Kim Tripp, vice president for horticulture at the botanical garden, said she was doing the same thing. ''It sounds funny, but the milder the winter, the more winter damage to the plants,'' she said. ''They don't get their rest, their REM sleep. They're fooled into starting to come out.''</p>
        <p>The worst, she said, is an ''up and down winter,'' with a few cold days, followed by premature warmth. A winter, in other words, such as this one is shaping up to be. Spring bulbs, tricked by the brief cold and the early winter warm days, awaken from their winter hibernation. They bloom too early and can be badly damaged when it turns cold again.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist for the Environmental Defense, which studies global warming, said, ''When you look at the big picture, it's very disturbing.'' The trend toward warmer temperatures year-round could cause serious geographic, meteorological and agricultural problems, he said.</p>
        <p>While the warm spells this winter may not be the result of a buildup of gases from the emissions from factories, cars and so forth, he said, the warm winter is ''a warning that bigger changes are afoot.''</p>
