        <p>Fran Pavley, a soft-spoken, retired schoolteacher who went into California politics, probably never thought she would find herself defending the environmental credentials of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
        <p>But these days, she has been a driving force behind a new battle against global warming. Last month, Ms. Pavley, a Democratic assemblywoman from Agoura Hills, visited Ottawa to seek Canada's help in pressing automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions. There was some skepticism from the press. As one local journalist put it, ''Doesn't your governor drive a Hummer?''</p>
        <p>Yes, Ms. Pavley gamely explained, but she was there with the Schwarzenegger administration's support, and the governor had even recently requested and received a special hydrogen-fueled Hummer built by General Motors. By the end of her visit, two top government ministers said they were poised to adopt their own tough plan.</p>
        <p>It is safe to say Ms. Pavley, who drives a fuel-efficient Toyota Prius, has the auto industry's attention.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, automakers sued to block legislation she sponsored that would require a roughly 30 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks sold in California by the 2016 model year.</p>
        <p>''It's the most challenging regulation that's ever been proposed,'' Thomas C. Austin, a top industry consultant, said in describing its impact on the auto industry. Last month, Robert A. Lutz, General Motors' vice chairman, bemoaned the notion of a single state's trying to regulate global warming, a theory he has doubts about.</p>
        <p>''What are they going to do,'' he said, ''put a bubble over California?''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Pavley, 55, says that California, as one of the world's largest auto markets, has an obligation to lead the way in North America.</p>
        <p>''Almost all nations, with the exception of ours are fully committed to reducing the impact and understand the consequences of not doing so,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After 28 years in education, most recently teaching American history to eighth graders, Ms. Pavley said the linkage of climate change to worsening smog and increased rates of asthma was most troubling to her among a number of potential complications of global warming.</p>
        <p>''It's just critically important to California and the Central Valley and all the kids, with asthma skyrocketing,'' she said, mentioning the San Joaquin Valley, which is the state's prime agricultural region.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists see Ms. Pavley's legislation as the only current hope for curbing automotive greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and by extension, reducing American oil consumption. The Bush administration has declined to join most other industrialized nations in adopting the Kyoto agreement on reducing global warming emissions.</p>
        <p>It is also in the early stages of rewriting fuel economy rules for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in a way that it has acknowledged could actually increase oil consumption and make trucks less efficient. ''We're looking to state and other friendly jurisdictions to move the ball forward,'' said Daniel Becker, the director of the Sierra Club's global warming program in Washington.</p>
        <p>The Pavley plan could put several states on a much different course from Washington. California has the unique authority to set its own air quality standards because they predated the federal Clean Air Act. Other states have discretion to choose California's air rules over those of Washington. As if the industry was not aghast enough at the nation's largest auto market adopting such a regulation, seven Northeastern states are following California and are likely to adopt the Pavley plan. And then there's Canada.</p>
        <p>''The potential market force of Canada combining with California and the seven New England states,'' Ms. Pavley said, ''that would be 30 percent of the automobile market in Canada and the U.S. combined.''</p>
        <p>Pressure from so many regions, she said in an interview shortly before the industry filed suit this week, might ''convince the automobile manufacturers to work with us, to send in their engineers and not their lawyers.''</p>
        <p>For now, it's the lawyers. Greenhouse gas emissions from cars are largely a byproduct of their fuel economy, so regulating emissions like carbon dioxide would indirectly require automakers to improve fuel efficiency significantly. Since the federal government has sole authority to regulate fuel economy, Toyota, G.M. and several other automakers contend in their lawsuit that California is stepping on Washington's turf.</p>
        <p>''It's pre-empted by federal law,'' said Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a lobbying group which filed the suit. ''It's something that needs to be done at the national or international level.''</p>
        <p>California lawmakers say the regulation is focused on harmful emissions and is well within the state's authority.</p>
        <p>''We have the legal ability to do this under the Clean Air Act,'' Ms. Pavley said.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups say the regulation can be met with technology already available and not even as complex as the kinds of hybrid electric vehicles made by Toyota, Honda and Ford.</p>
        <p>Automakers say they will have to stop selling some of their largest sport utility vehicles in the state. Domestic automakers rely on big truck sales and could be particularly vulnerable. Industry experts say the regulation will add about $3,000 to the upfront cost of the average car or truck. State regulators say it will cost far less, about $1,000, and be more than made up for over time by spending less at gas stations.</p>
        <p>Stéphane Dion, the Canadian environmental minister, said soon after his recent meeting with Ms. Pavley that the Big Three automakers, which have a substantial presence in Canada, were not helping themselves by letting Asian competitors lead innovation.</p>
        <p>''The company taking the most market now is Toyota,'' he said, ''so I think it's an indication that it's the first movers who are winning in this world.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pavley's interest in politics blossomed during a 15-year tenure as the part-time mayor of Agoura Hills, a small suburb west of Los Angeles in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains; her assembly district includes well-known Malibu residents like Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks. Three weeks into her first term in 2001, she was approached by a small environmental group, Bluewater Network, which drafted the bill and was shopping for a sponsor.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't get anyone else,'' said Russell Long, the group's executive director. ''I don't think she had any idea of the controversy and the high visibility this bill would engender.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pavley, who has a master's degree in environmental planning, concurs. Auto dealers and lobbying groups campaigned against it and ran print ads and radio spots claiming it would lead to higher gas taxes, lower speed limits and fees on gas guzzlers -- all proposals prohibited in the final language of the legislation. Two Los Angeles disc jockeys even led a caravan of S.U.V. drivers to Sacramento and heckled government officials outside their offices with a megaphone.</p>
        <p>''They would jam phone lines in the offices with all their listeners,'' Ms. Pavley said. ''They could generate a couple hundred phone calls an hour.''</p>
        <p>The legislation, which passed in 2002 and was signed by Mr. Schwarzenegger's Democratic predecessor, Gray Davis, has the backing of the current governor, who has been shoring up his environmental credentials. The final details of the regulation were approved in September by the California Air Resources Board, which is appointed by the governor.</p>
        <p>''He hopes the car companies will see the light,'' said Terry Tamminen, California's cabinet secretary and a top adviser to the governor, in an interview last week. Mr. Tamminen is also a friend of Ms. Pavley's and was a co-host of one of her first political fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>''She has really tried to keep the temperature down, even though automakers and car dealers have been a little hysterical about the potential outcomes,'' he said. ''She tries to be respectful, but like a good schoolteacher, she doesn't hesitate to correct people's misimpressions.''</p>
