        <p>After nearly two weeks of intense and often acrimonious negotiations, 98 countries adopted a treaty today on preserving the world's plant, animal and microbial species. But it was not immediately clear if the United States, Japan and other industrialized countries would sign it.</p>
        <p>The treaty is one of two binding agreements that will be presented for signing at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro next month.</p>
        <p>United States and Japanese representatives here indicated they believed it asked too much of the industrialized countries, which would largely finance the efforts to protect species in the poor countries. They also questioned provisions relating to the commercial exploitation of genetic material in plants or animals found in third world countries. Warning of Mass Extinction</p>
        <p>The possibility that endangered species could provide useful materials for medicine, food or other products is a major impetus in the effort to preserve species.</p>
        <p>Some biologists have warned that immediate steps need to be taken to preserve plant and animal species to avert a mass extinction on an epic scale within a few decades.</p>
        <p>Countries that sign the treaty would commit themselves to develop programs to conserve biological diversity, set up protected areas as far as possible, promote the protection of ecosystems and natural habitats, and rehabilitate degraded ecoystems. The agreement calls for the treaty's signers to meet periodically to review progress, but it does not specify how much money the richer countries would provide to the poorer ones.</p>
        <p>E. U. Curtis Bohlen, the Assistant Secretary of State for the Environment, suggested from Washington that the chief value of the treaty would be to raise the world's consciousness about the need to preserve existing species.</p>
        <p>Based on the draft language he has seen, he said, he cannot recommend that the United States sign the treaty. Mr. Bohlen said high among his concerns were the rights of American companies that were pioneers in developing biotechnology products. Issue of Global Warming</p>
        <p>President Bush will attend the summit in Brazil, where he and the heads of other countries are expected to sign the other binding agreement, a treaty that commits nations to limit emissions of gases that are believed to contribute to global warming. The biodiversity treaty agreed to here today and the climate control treaty are regarded as the most important matters at the environmental summit meeting.</p>
        <p>The intention of the biodiversity treaty is for the developed countries to provide financing and expertise to allow underdeveloped countries conserve their natural resources while using them on a basis that can be sustained over the long term. Most of the world's species are found in the developing world and these species have contributed to medicines and improved foods in the industrial countries.</p>
        <p>A member of the Japanese delegation, Toshiko Shimizu, said that the "concerns of the developed countries were not fully reflected" in the treaty. She said she could not predict whether Japan will sign the treaty in Rio. But a member of another major donor country said he would be stunned if either the United States or Japan signed.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the United States, Japan and Britain said here it appeared that the donor countries would not have enough control over the financial arrangements with the poor countries. "It could give an impression of an open checkbook to the developing countries," said Fiona McConnell, the head of the British delegation.</p>
        <p>Eleanor Savage, the chief delegate of the United States, said that provisions of the treaty were "seriously flawed" and achieved in a "very rushed" process. Mrs. Savage said it seemed clear the final language of the treaty did not give "sufficient protection" to the innovations of the biotechnology industry in the United States. Third World Seeks Access</p>
        <p>Delegates from India and Ethiopia pushed very hard at the meetings here for direct access to technologies developed by corporations using genetic resources found in their countries.</p>
        <p>The treaty says that the "results of research and development" should be shared in a "fair and equitable way" upon "mutually agreed terms" between a company that develops a biotechnological product from the genetic resources in a developing country.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mrs. Savage, Ms. McConnell said she found the possibilities of technological transfer outlined in the treaty to be the "real exciting breakthrough."</p>
        <p>"It means that when developing countries contribute something they will get a share in the benefits," she said.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has consistently said it could not agree on behalf of private companies for the transfer of their technology on a concessionary basis to poor countries whose genetic materials the companies use. India Voices Support</p>
        <p>In contrast to the reservations expressed by the leading donor countries, India, whose delegation had led much of the battle by the developing countries, expressed support for the treaty.</p>
        <p>"It seems to be to our satisfaction," said Avani Vaish, the director of the Indian Environment and Forests Ministry. "The value of our genetic resources will be appreciated. Until now it seemed genetic resources were considered free like water and air."</p>
        <p>Mr. Vaish said that if the financing mechanisms were restructured as called for in the treaty, then developing countries would have more "equitable control" over how the money was spent than under the original proposal, which gave the World Bank a dominant role.</p>
        <p>Largely at the insistence of the developing countries, the intention of creating a global list of plant and animal species, and entire ecosystems, that needed funds for preservation or sustainable utilization was dropped. Most developing countries said they feared such a global list would infringe on their sovereignty.</p>
