        <p>A CONCESSION ON THE ECONOMY -- In his first public remarks since taking office last month, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, said yesterday that he recognized that the economy was not benefiting all Americans. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>JAPANESE AUTOS MAKE GAINS -- Toyota passed Ford in July to rank behind General Motors as the No. 2 selling auto company in the United States, sales figures showed. And in another development that caused automotive eyebrows to rise, Honda outsold the Chrysler group last month for the first time. [C1.]</p>
        <p>G.M.A.C. DEAL COULD BE DELAYED -- General Motors said that its deal to sell a controlling interest in its financing subsidiary could be delayed until next year. It also said it had increased its second-quarter loss by $200 million. [C6.]</p>
        <p>WAL-MART STUMBLES OVERSEAS -- Wal-Mart -- the dominant retail presence in the United States -- has struggled abroad, in places like Germany, South Korea and Japan. The company has discovered that its formula for success -- low prices, zealous inventory control and a large array of merchandise -- did not translate to markets with their own discount chains and shoppers with different habits. [C1.]</p>
        <p>EAGER TO ENTER INDIA -- Clamoring to enter India's red-hot retail sector, the world's largest chains, including Wal-Mart Stores, Carrefour and Tesco, are seeking the best way to enter the country, despite a government ban on direct foreign investment in the market. [C4.]</p>
        <p>LOSS AT ELECTRONIC ARTS -- The video game publisher Electronic Arts reported a quarterly loss with a silver lining, suggesting in a call with investors that the industry's cyclical downturn was showing signs of reversing. [C8.]</p>
        <p>MORE PHONE CUSTOMERS SWITCH -- Verizon and Qwest reported yesterday that the defection of their residential phone customers to cheaper Internet-based services picked up speed in the second quarter. [C3.]</p>
        <p>KODAK REPORTS LOSS -- Eastman Kodak posted a wider second-quarter net loss and cut its full-year revenue forecast, sending its shares down about 14 percent. [C4.]</p>
        <p>INVESTING IN WIND POWER -- Vail Resorts, the big Colorado-based recreation company, said it would make a huge investment in wind power, buying enough credits to offset all the power needed for its resorts, stores and office buildings. [A12.]</p>
        <p>FOCUS ON GREENHOUSE GASES -- The Clinton Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has focused its efforts on combating AIDS, poverty and childhood obesity, will turn its attention to greenhouse gases, former President Clinton said. [A16.]</p>
        <p>STOCKS DECLINE -- The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.74 points, to 1,270.92. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 59.95 points, to 11,125.73. The Nasdaq composite index retreated 29.48 points, to 2,061.99. [C10.]</p>
        <p>RULING IN FORD CASE -- In a split ruling, the Michigan Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision to dismiss a sexual harassment suit against Ford Motor on the grounds that the plaintiff and her lawyers discussed with reporters evidence that the court had deemed inadmissible. [C6.]</p>
        <p>AIR FARES ON THE WEB -- An alternative format for displaying air fares, known as a matrix and used by some low-fare carriers, eliminates scrolling and informs consumers if the cheapest fares are unavailable. [C5.]</p>
        <p>POST OFFICE RESCUER: THE INTERNET -- The Internet is injecting new life -- and a sorely needed source of revenue -- into the Postal Service. And the transformation is happening with packages -- millions of them shipped every day, in a journey that starts with a few mouse clicks and ends a few days later at a customer's door. Postmaster General John E. Potter, above, said eBay shippers alone had accounted for more than $1 billion worth of postage since the Postal Service started working with the company in 2004. [A1.]</p>
        <p>DONATION FOR BUSINESS SCHOOL -- Philip H. Knight, the chairman of Nike, has pledged $105 million to help build a new campus for the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. [C8.]</p>
        <p>YUKOS ORDERED LIQUIDATED -- A panel of judges ordered that the Yukos oil company, once Russia's largest company, be declared bankrupt and its assets liquidated. [C4.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>Business Briefing  Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS said that its second-quarter profit rose fourfold and that contract signings, an indicator of future revenue, doubled. But it issued a third-quarter earnings forecast that was below analysts' expectations and said it would cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs in the second half of the year while hiring more people in India and China. (AP)</p>
        <p>THREE MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS -- the Gannett Company, the McClatchy Company and the Tribune Company -- announced an agreement related to their stakes in their classified help-wanted advertising venture CareerBuilder.com, and two other online businesses, ShopLocal.com and Topix.net. Gannett and Tribune each will increase their ownership in CareerBuilder and ShopLocal.com to 42.5 percent, and in Topix.net to 31.9 percent. (AP)</p>
        <p>BURGER KING HOLDINGS, which went public in May, posted a fourth-quarter loss and reported sales that missed some analysts' estimates, sending its shares down 13 percent, to $13.24. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)</p>
        <p>ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND, the agricultural processor, said its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, spurred in part by a corn-processing profit jump on better ethanol prices. The results easily topped Wall Street's expectations. (AP)</p>
