        <p>In fact, Mr. Rockman is quite serious about all things creepy and crawling. To prepare for a show at Gorney, Braven and Lee (through Nov. 11) of six new paintings which depict his encounter with jungle life, the artist -- who is no nature boy, having grown up in Manhattan -- journeyed to Guyana. With a few friends, he spent several weeks camping in the rain forest, catching and drawing insects. As part of his research, he even consulted a molecular biologist and tropical medicine specialist. Despite his experiences in the tropics, and impressive scientific knowledge, his paintings are anything but naturalistic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rockman's work explores a realm in which gargantuan insects and man-eating plants attack their human prey. In one painting, a self-portrait titled ''Tropical Hazards,'' the robust-looking artist is shown in red swimming trunks, arms outstretched, standing on the hull of a rickety riverboat. Deadly parasites, multiplying in the balmy air and lurking in the tranquil waters, have infected his nerves and organs. With a sense of science-fiction horror, tempered by self-parody and black humor, Mr. Rockman's vision is of nature as a hyper-real, if not freaky, place.</p>
        <p>At 38, Mr. Rockman is part of a generation of painters who share an H. G. Wellsian sensibility that the world of living things, despite its superficial charms, has become a dangerous place. Many of these artists live in urban centers both here and abroad, far removed from the reality of verdure and wildlife. In New York, those working in a similar vein to Mr. Rockman include Frank Moore, who describes ominous rural scenes ravaged by biotechnology; Walton Ford, who depicts a barbaric animal kingdom beneath a veil of dazzling craftsmanship; Thomas Woodruff, who creates allegorical responses to a disease-ridden planet; and L. C. Armstrong, who paints scorched-looking flowerscapes filled with sickly blooms.</p>
        <p>As a result of environmental hazards, animal extinction and genetic engineering, nature is no longer seen as a paradise that forever regenerates itself. The current perception of nature is anti-Arcadian: all that appears to be alluring conceals something appalling.</p>
        <p>''It's like the peaceable kingdom that isn't,'' said Robert Storr, senior curator in the department of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. ''It's a kind of pollution naturalism. You have these eruptions of aberrant nature. It's a return of the Grimm fairy tale approach to life with an emphasis on the grim.''</p>
        <p>Depictions of the dark side of nature have a long tradition in art history. The late Gothic gave birth to the ''Garden of Delights,'' Hieronymous Bosch's interpretation of hell on earth. Nineteenth-century romantic painters like Thomas Cole, Caspar David Friedrich and J. M. W. Turner produced apocalyptic landscapes. Symbolists like James Ensor, Odilon Redon and Max Klinger created the pictorial equivalents of Edgar Allan Poe's macabre tales. After World War I, Surrealists like Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Salvador Dali offered scenes of natural decimation. Today, painters are doing much the same thing. But now it is mainly technology that shapes the contemporary view of nature: at once tormented and twisted -- yet still tantalizing.</p>
        <p>''If you were living in the age of Chernobyl, insecticides, melting ice caps, Agent Orange and Dolly, the cloned sheep, wouldn't you think nature was weird?'' said Robert Rosenblum, a professor of fine arts at New York University. ''In the 19th century, most landscape painting looked divine, where God lives, but by the time you get to the late 20th century, it's where Satan is living. Today, the landscape is sick, like science made it sick.''</p>
        <p>Influenced by movies like ''King Kong,'' in which an oversize gorilla terrorizes civilization, and Woody Allen's ''Sleeper,'' in which people 200 years in the future feast on weird food, Mr. Rockman painted ''The Farm.'' The work, now on view at Exit Art in SoHo in a show called ''Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic Revolution,'' is a wide-angle view of a soybean field with depictions of an ordinary chicken, cow and pig on the left side of the canvas and their mutated descendants after the intervention of biotechnology on the right. The pig, for example, has human organs, and the chicken is featherless with four extra wings. (The painting is the prototype for Mr. Rockman's billboard above a car wash at Lafayette and Houston Streets, sponsored by Creative Time.)</p>
        <p>''This is a cartoon version of farm animals transformed by artificial selection and what the future of American agriculture might look like if the present trajectory and market pressures continue,'' said Mr. Rockman. ''If you're in the buffalo chicken wing industry, then breed extra wings.''</p>
        <p>The Exit Art show, organized by Marvin Heiferman and Carole Kismaric, features 39 artists who address the implications of scientific progress. ''Artists are looking at all this technology with awe, envy and horror,'' said Mr. Heiferman. ''It goes back to Frankenstein or, more recently, the movie 'Gattaca,' '' a 1997 film about genetic engineering. ''It's already in the popular culture,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Painting in a willfully naive, realist style, Mr. Moore, 47, has long addressed the theme of poisoned nature. His work, ''Oz,'' also on view at Exit Art, depicts a panorama of houses, furniture and cars piled topsy-turvy, along with super-size organic elements, like a beanstalk and corn. A DNA strand represents the horizon line and forms an ankh symbol, the ancient Egyptian sign of immortality, signifying the future. ''The picture takes place in Kansas, a corn-growing, wheat growing, agricultural state, but it's agriculture from fairy tales, like 'Jack and the Beanstalk' and 'The Goose That Laid the Golden Egg,' '' he said. ''The foreground is about the material world being in chaos. It's an allegorical depiction of the impact of genetic technology on our lives.''</p>
        <p>Inspired by James Audubon's work, in particular an image of two hawks fighting over a rabbit rendered in all its guts and glory, Mr. Ford, 40, paints allegorical representations of nature's dualities. ''Nila,'' a life-size, 19th-century-style watercolor of a rampaging Indian elephant encircled by a flock of beautiful birds, was exhibited last spring at the Paul Kasmin gallery. The elephant is shown with an enormous erection. ''When a male elephant goes into heat, he gets really sexually charged up and becomes extremely dangerous,'' said Mr. Ford. ''I loved the idea that excess joy could lead to death and violence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford, like many of the artists who envision nature as a place of conflict where beauty and beast meet and compete, grew up in the 60's and 70's when television programs, like Mutual of Omaha's ''Wild Kingdom,'' with Jim Fowler and Marlon Perkins, were popular. As a child in Westchester County, the factual and bloodless scenes he saw on television informed his idea of the wild. ''I think we were the first generation of kids to grow up interested in nature shows,'' he said. ''The work has a lot to do with the kind of TV we watched. It's that arcane or natural history stuff. In a suburban environment, you didn't have real predator-prey relationships around you, so you'd blow them up in your head.''</p>
        <p>The strategy of depicting nature in a hyperrealist style offers artists the opportunity both to disarm with viewer-friendly imagery and to convey disturbing information. ''A lot of people think that if it's figurative, it's conservative, but that's not the case,'' said Mr. Woodruff, 43, who paints ravishing Victorian-style tableaus embellished with sentimental touches like roses, garlands, birds and ribbons. ''We're using a language that people understand to make them think about something they don't want to think about, like strange cancers, genetic mutations, the AIDS epidemic or bodies freaking out. The difference between pretty landscape painting and landscape that involves pathology is that you've been seduced first and then slapped into a place you don't necessarily want to go.''</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Woodruff exhibited a series of paintings, ''All Systems Go,'' at both P.P.O.W and Debs &amp; Co. galleries in Manhattan. The series included large mythological landscapes, in acrylic on canvases shaped like a Gothic arch, teeming with hummingbirds, zebras, goldfish, deer, men in skunk suits, an androgynous figure in a swan headdress and ''slug fairies,'' as the artist calls the fantastic creatures populating the scenes. With images of sci-fi rockets set to launch in the background, the paintings are meant to represent Mr. Woodruff's imagining of a better place than life on earth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Armstrong, 43, also depicts a natural utopia but one that has been tainted. Recalling the exotic, sinuous and erotically charged floral studies of the 19th-century painter Martin J. Heade, she creates a paradise of hothouse flowers in luscious acrylic colors glistening beneath layers of resin. But it is Eden after the fall. The stems of the flowers, dark and hairy looking, have been made with real bomb fuses, which Ms. Armstrong ignites to produce burn marks on the surface of the canvases. The marred plant life suggests a ruined ecosystem, a 21st-century view of a malevolent romantic landscape.</p>
        <p>''The flowers are beautiful, but there's a real creepy part to them,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ''They look like they're surviving something, as if they're benefiting from this global warming. It's not traditional landscape painting. It's an idyllic scene that doesn't have a reference to man or troubles. It's nonlinear. It's beach in winter. You can't tell what time it is. It's out of time and place. It's landscape of the mind.''</p>
        <p>ART/ARCHITECTURE Elizabeth Hayt's most recent article for Arts &amp; Leisure was about the exhibition ''1900: Art at the Crossroads,'' at the Guggenheim Museum.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 29, 2000, Sunday  An article on Oct. 15 about hyperrealistic painting misspelled the name of the gallery that represents the artist Alexis Rockman. It is Gorney, Bravin &amp; Lee, not Braven.</p>
        <p>A picture of a Rockman painting with the article carried an erroneous credit from a publicity agency. (The error also occurred on Sept. 12, when the photograph appeared in Science Times with an article about genetics and art.) The photographer was Oren Slor, and the photograph was provided by Gorney, Bravin &amp; Lee.</p>
