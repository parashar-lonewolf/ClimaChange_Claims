        <p>Eight years after the United States and Russia agreed to cooperate in a permanent human outpost in space, astronauts from both countries arrived at the International Space Station today and began what they hope will be continuous habitation of an expanding research platform 240 miles above Earth.</p>
        <p>A Soyuz spacecraft carrying an American astronaut and two Russians docked at the 80-ton station at 4:21 a.m. Eastern time as the two craft passed over Kazakhstan, site of the crew's launching two days ago.</p>
        <p>After checking the airtight seal between the spacecraft and opening hatches, the Russian astronauts, Lt. Col. Yuri P. Gidzenko and Sergei K. Krikalev, followed by the American mission commander, Capt. William M. Shepherd, entered the station at 5:23 a.m. Their visit is scheduled to last four months.</p>
        <p>There was no live television hookup allowing those on the ground to witness the event, but pictures relayed later showed three smiling men dressed in sleeveless blue jumpsuits and white shirts giving the thumbs-up sign and clasping their hands in a show of unity.</p>
        <p>Daniel S. Goldin, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which is leading the project, congratulated the crew in a telephone call from Russian Mission Control outside Moscow.</p>
        <p>''Let's look upon this as the opening of the international space frontier,'' Mr. Goldin said. Captain Shepherd, a Navy officer on his fourth mission to space, replied, ''We're just starting a long journey.''</p>
        <p>To reach this point, the project had to weather large cost overruns, questions about its scientific value, years of delays by the financially strapped Russian space agency and delicate negotiating among the nations involved.</p>
        <p>Politics, in fact, influenced the plain name of the station. During the call from their temporary home, the crew members asked permission to use the radio call sign Alpha for the station. A surprised Mr. Goldin gave temporary permission to use the name, but it remains to be seen if the name stays.</p>
        <p>The crew said earlier that it liked the name Alpha because it means ''beginning'' and the Greek letter is neutral -- neither English nor Russian. But the 16 nations building the station have been reluctant to name it, fearing disagreement. Mr. Goldin has said in the past that everyone should concentrate on building the $60 billion research outpost and not be distracted by names.</p>
        <p>Some Russians have objected to Alpha because they say it suggests the spacecraft is the first long-term space station, an honor that should go to their Mir, which has been in space for almost 15 years.</p>
        <p>The three men in the station immediately started activating its vital systems.</p>
        <p>The first order of business, before they began a sleep period, was to take care of creature comforts they had been denied for two days aboard the cramped Soyuz: activate a water processor, set up food warmers, check communications links, charge power tools and complete the hookup of the station's special suction toilet.</p>
        <p>Because the crew, dubbed Expedition 1, arrived with only two days of oxygen, the priorities of the next few days involve starting an oxygen generator, activating the carbon dioxide removal system and installing computers and setting up networks to control all the functions of the station.</p>
        <p>The crew spent more time than scheduled setting up its home before starting a sleep period six hours after entering the Zvezda service module, one of three major modules making up the current station.</p>
        <p>''We're all really glad to be here,'' Captain Shepherd said, ''It was a long journey but we've made it.''</p>
        <p>The crew, which trained together for almost five years, was originally to take up residence almost three years ago. But project delays, primarily caused by Russian financial and rocket problems, kept the team grounded until now.</p>
        <p>The station now consists of a 143-foot stack of three pressurized modules and appendages weighing 81 tons. Over the next five years, it is to grow into a 480-ton network of laboratories and other equipment spanning an area larger than a city block with its solar power panels unfurled. The station, scheduled to be completed in 2006, is expected to serve an estimated 45 full-time crews that will work aboard during the next 15 years.</p>
        <p>The structure includes the Russian-made Zarya cargo module, the first section of the space station, launched in November 1998; the American Unity connecting node, attached the following month; the Zvezda control and living module, added last July; and a truss structure, gyroscope assembly and docking port, attached last month by the shuttle Discovery.</p>
        <p>The arrival of the Expedition 1 crew has prompted space station officials to predict that it signals the perpetual presence of humans in space, first in orbit around Earth and later on the Moon and Mars.</p>
        <p>''This is the beginning of what we hope is at least 15 years of continuous human presence in space,'' said Jim Van Laak, a senior NASA station manager at Johnson Space Center in Houston. ''And personally, I hope it's much longer than that.''</p>
        <p>Experts say the new station may remain in use twice as long as planned if well maintained and renovated, but there has been no discussion of a follow-up project to keep people in space longer than that.</p>
        <p>When the Soviet Union launched its Mir space station almost 15 years ago, officials made similar claims that it represented a new era for people staying in space. While Mir was staffed for most of its time in orbit, and remained viable for three times its predicted life, Mir is now aging and empty, and Russian officials say they will bring it down into the Pacific Ocean early next year.</p>
        <p>The main job of Expedition 1 after readying the new station for operation will be to establish a routine of working and living on the outpost that others can follow. The modules are crammed with supplies and equipment delivered by earlier space shuttles and Russian cargo craft. The crew will spend weeks unpacking and stowing the contents of large bags filling the corridors as they get all of the systems running.</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Krikalev is to spend part of his second day on the station examining two of the living module's eight storage batteries, which have malfunctioned and cannot be used to store electricity needed to run the craft when there is no sunlight hitting its solar power cells.</p>
        <p>The crew will have little time to let up because an unmanned Progress cargo craft is due at the station in mid-November with another 1,300 pounds of supplies. The Progress must be emptied, refilled with waste and trash and discarded from the station before the next visiting craft arrives in December.</p>
        <p>On that flight, the shuttle Endeavour will deliver a giant solar power panel that will be deployed atop the station to greatly increase its supply of electricity.</p>
        <p>The Expedition 1 crew is to return to Earth in late February aboard the shuttle Discovery, which will bring three replacement astronauts to continue work on the station for another four months.</p>
