        <p>For Americans, 1492, 1776, 1862, 1945 and 1991 were the five best years of the past five centuries.</p>
        <p>That's making a fairly big claim for this current year, especially when the Gloomy Guses are wailing about hard times, nuclear instability and holes in the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But consider reality, as Mikhail Gorbachev had to do in making a Christmas present to the world of his departure. The yoke of Communism has been lifted from a quarter of a billion people in this year, and the threat of its pernicious reach has been lifted from a third of a billion Europeans.</p>
        <p>And that's not all: the division of an unnatural empire into its national parts has not only reduced the danger of superpower clash, but has engendered a new rationality in the Middle East and South Africa.</p>
        <p>Peace -- real peace -- has broken out; why is nobody celebrating? Democracy has prevailed in its worldwide struggle against tyranny; why are democrats not dancing in the streets?</p>
        <p>One reason for the curious reluctance to embrace the reality of the good news is that it has taken months to unfold; one-day victories are easier to grasp for whooping-up purposes. Another reason is that it seems too good to be true, and we don't want to jinx our incipient no-hitter by talking about it.</p>
        <p>The biggest reason is that we are in the grip of the Melancholia Industry. This high priesthood of deep pessimism has a vested interest in the status quo of unrelieved worry.</p>
        <p>Diplomatic depressives must justify their mistaken past doomsaying about Soviet disunion; political melancholiacs must knock down any outbursts of joy lest incumbents benefit; economic sages feel they must follow the herd of malcontented cows into their double-dipsy-doodle.</p>
        <p>This cacophony of serious wailing is amplified by the megaphone of the media. No conspiracy; only the realization that bad news means good ratings and good news means a vast, happy tuning-out.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the mild recession has touched the coastal media centers as never before. With layoffs hitting home, the viewer and reader would never know that non-frictional unemployment is much lower than in the recession a decade ago, even allowing for slow growth in the labor force.</p>
        <p>As a result, it is unfashionable to be feisty. To be gloomy is to be serious; to be joyful is seen as frivolous or deceptive. That's why leaders are unwilling to appear confident; they fear the appearance of lacking compassion or being out of touch with the upside-down perception of reality.</p>
        <p>That's why we foolishly flip over the coin of peaceful transition in 14 freed republics to examine violence in one; why we ignore the exciting potential for private farm and oil development to deplore the possibility of food riots; why we focus at home on the homeless and crime but overlook the liberating breakthroughs in neuroscience, computer education and genetics. That's why, in the world of the winners, you never hear the word "victory."</p>
        <p>Such stress on stress warps reality. Let us stipulate that small wars and the poor will be with us; that nuclear spread to terrorists will be cause for concerted action; that earthquakes and floods will happen, and the innocent will suffer.</p>
        <p>Now deal with the reality that will change our lives in the run-up to the millennium. Demobilization is real. The troops are coming home all over the world, and all we hear is "Where will they live? Who will give them jobs?" The fact is that tens of millions of able-bodied young people will move out of the inflationary business of war and into the world of productive work.</p>
        <p>Here at home, the next generation will be much better off than ours because it will not have to bear the superpower burden of defense. Free of the cost of protecting Japan and Europe, the U.S. can better compete with them.</p>
        <p>This was also the year that we stopped a near-nuclear dictator before he could take over the world's oil supply and dictate our inflation and interest rates. The lowest interest rates in a generation will sell houses, attract equity investment and propel the economy.</p>
        <p>Freedom shined so brightly in 1991 that too many of us were willing to observe it through a glass darkly. Throw away the filter that obscures reality; this is a glorious moment in history, harbinger of good times to come.</p>
