        <p>A powerful typhoon roared through Japan's main islands on Wednesday, killing at least 30 people and injuring more than 250 in mudslides and flash floods, Kyodo News said. With giant waves destroying breakwaters, 40 more people were missing.</p>
        <p>Pounding Japan just 10 days after the ''strongest typhoon in a decade'' hit Tokyo, this latest tropical storm is the 10th typhoon to strike Japan's main islands this year, breaking a record of six.</p>
        <p>While power failures affected about one million people on Wednesday, many Japanese bunkered down in their homes, watching television reporting of a storm called ''Tokage,'' or ''Lizard'' in Japanese. Television images showed flash floods rising to car windows, powerful winds knocking over trees, and landslides wiping out houses.</p>
        <p>Much of Japan's highly efficient transportation system ground to a halt on Wednesday afternoon as airlines canceled 937 flights, affecting 127,000 passengers, and bullet train service was suspended between Tokyo and Osaka, the busiest line. Powerful waves beached two oceangoing freighters. In Nagoya, high winds and whipping rain forced organizers to cancel all events for the 11th World Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems.</p>
        <p>The Toyota Motor Corporation halted work at 12 auto factories on Wednesday, Kyodo reported.</p>
        <p>Given the pummeling series of storms, Wednesday's deaths had a sad familiarity. A 61-year-old man was blown off his roof while doing repairs. A 68-year-old fisherman was snatched by waves as he was trying to secure his boat. A 31-year-old man drowned when his car was swept into a rain-swollen river. A family of three was killed when waves destroyed its coastal home.</p>
        <p>Japan's first nine typhoons this year killed 102 people, injured 1,991 and left 13 missing, according to Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The storms have caused $4 billion in damages, according to insurance estimates published in Japanese newspapers.</p>
        <p>As the storm started to swirl through Tokyo, Japanese members of the environmental group Greenpeace held an outdoor news conference in front of city's trendy Shibuya train station. Members asked Japan to meet its commitments to reduce emissions of gases blamed for global warming. They also asked that the government look into possible links between this year's bad weather and global climate change.</p>
        <p>The number of typhoons to strike Japan this year is the highest since Japan started keeping records in 1551, Nobutaka Mannoji, director of National Typhoon Center of Japan's Meteorology Agency, said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>''We cannot say anything about whether the unusual activeness of the typhoon phenomenon this year is related to the global warming,'' he said by telephone. ''Higher sea surface temperature is one important element for the birth of typhoon, but there are other elements.''</p>
