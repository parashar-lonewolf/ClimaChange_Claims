      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial notes that in American Southwest, climatologists have found detailed record of weather patterns in tree rings that show that prolonged periods of drought there are normal; holds that findings raise questions about water distribution in vast Colorado River basin, which has experienced staggering population growth; says that nearly every drop of water that flows downstream is already allocated, which means that only new water source for residential and commercial growth is water that has been allocated to agriculture; contends that science is capable of changing its mind as evidence it discovers becomes more precise and more conclusive, but fundamental challenge for us all is to change way we live as well</p>

        <p>It has taken humans awhile to realize that our idea of normal changes as our understanding of history deepens. Climate is a case in point. Over the past couple of decades, climatology has become a deeply historical science. In the American Southwest, climatologists have found a surprisingly detailed record of weather patterns -- especially patterns of moisture -- in tree rings that show that prolonged periods of drought there are normal.</p>
        <p>Those findings immediately raise questions about how water is being used in the Southwest, and particularly about the Colorado River Compact, the 1922 legal agreement that governs water distribution in the vast Colorado River basin. The agreement was based on at most two decades of measuring river flows. But the testimony of tree rings shows that those years were much wetter than the long-term historical average.</p>

        <p>It has taken humans awhile to realize that our idea of normal changes as our understanding of history deepens. Climate is a case in point. Over the past couple of decades, climatology has become a deeply historical science. In the American Southwest, climatologists have found a surprisingly detailed record of weather patterns -- especially patterns of moisture -- in tree rings that show that prolonged periods of drought there are normal.</p>
        <p>Those findings immediately raise questions about how water is being used in the Southwest, and particularly about the Colorado River Compact, the 1922 legal agreement that governs water distribution in the vast Colorado River basin. The agreement was based on at most two decades of measuring river flows. But the testimony of tree rings shows that those years were much wetter than the long-term historical average.</p>
        <p>This evidence -- and its implications -- have been gathered in a report released last month by a committee of the National Research Council. Its conclusions are stark. The Colorado River basin itself -- some 240,000 square miles across the West and Southwest -- has experienced staggering population growth. Precipitation patterns are changing, in part because of global warming, and the spring runoff from snowpack in the mountains takes place earlier than it used to, which means that less water is stored for later in the season. Nearly every drop of water that flows downstream is already allocated, which means that the only new water source for residential and commercial growth is water that has been allocated to agriculture.</p>
        <p>So what is normal? Vast quantities of water devoted to subsidized agriculture? Vast quantities of water devoted to the growth of cities and suburbs that are, in the long historical view, unsustainable?</p>
        <p>The immediate question this report raises is whether the forces that shape development from Wyoming to California will allow themselves to be guided by the scientific evidence and a starkly different vision than the one that was visible in 1922. Science is capable of changing its mind as the evidence it discovers becomes more precise and more conclusive. The fundamental challenge for us all is to change the way we live as well.</p>
