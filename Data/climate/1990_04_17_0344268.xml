        <p>The White House insisted four months ago that a high-profile meeting between Brent Scowcroft and Deng Xiaoping did not violate its ban on ''high-level exchanges.'' The same White House now declares that inviting a Chinese minister to an international conference on air pollution and climate change would violate that same rule.</p>
        <p>The White House admits that China, the world's biggest coal burner and third-biggest carbon dioxide producer, belongs at a conference on the greenhouse effect. And no treaty on global warming would be very useful without China's participation. But officials say that negative reaction to the Scowcroft mission forced the Administration to give its old rule a newly strict interpretation.</p>
        <p>How perverse. What began 10 months ago as a sensibly measured response to the tragedy in Tiananmen Square has been turned into a travesty by its authors. The Administration would do well to return to its original principles.</p>
        <p>Just days after Beijing used tanks and rifles against student democracy demonstrators, Mr. Bush announced the following guidelines for American policy: Because China was home to more than a billion people, Washington would make every effort to keep open essential channels of communication. But because China's top leaders had gravely offended fundamental American values, they would not be honored with prestige visits by high-level Administration officials.</p>
        <p>No good cause would be served if the U.S. ended diplomatic contacts on matters affecting its own national interests. That's why Ambassador James Lilley has remained in Beijing. Secretary of State Baker, and lower-level State Department officials, have continued to talk to the Chinese about Cambodia and arms exports. None of this has caused an outcry among Americans. Nor would many hackles be raised by inviting a Chinese environmental official to the greenhouse conference.</p>
        <p>The sort of thing that truly offends people was Mr. Scowcroft's televised toast to the butchers of Beijing and Mr. Bush's acquiescing in China's demand that he veto a bill extending the U.S. visas of Chinese students. Surely the Administration understands the distinction between public gestures and working diplomacy. Mr. Bush fashioned a principled policy around just this distinction 10 months ago. If he really wishes to heed public opinion, he might begin applying that policy now.</p>
