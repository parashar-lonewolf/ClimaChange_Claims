        <p>LEAD: President Reagan, trying to pave the way for a harmonious meeting next month with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, said today that he would seek $2.5 billion over the next five years for projects to combat acid rain.</p>
        <p>President Reagan, trying to pave the way for a harmonious meeting next month with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, said today that he would seek $2.5 billion over the next five years for projects to combat acid rain.</p>
        <p>The President's proposal would involve a major spending increase.</p>
        <p>White House officials said the new spending was designed to reassure Canadian officials, before the meeting with Mr. Mulroney in Ottawa on April 5-6, that Mr. Reagan was willing to seek acceptable levels of Government action to curb the airborne pollutants.</p>
        <p>The announcement came at a time that Administration and Canadian officials have said progress is being made on a trade agreement to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers, a key irritant between the two nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney said in January that the Administration was not living up to an agreement he reached with Mr. Reagan last year that called for a five-year program costing the United States about $2.5 billion and comparable spending from the private sector to combat acid rain. In the budget he submitted to Congress in January, Mr. Reagan had called for spending $350 million over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan in effect announced today that he would honor the agreement by seeking the full $2.5 billion. That will include $150 million that has already been earmarked in fiscal 1988, plus $300 million in new spending.</p>
        <p>The agreement between the two leaders was aimed at finding ways to control airborne emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides, which are generated mostly by industrial coal-fired furnaces. Such emissions change chemically and return to earth as acidic rain, snow or particles. Some scientists have said they pose a danger to freshwater lakes and streams and may damage plant life and human health. Mulroney Is Pleased</p>
        <p>In Ottawa, Mr. Mulroney, who has been under pressure from environmental groups on the issue, welcomed the Administration's announcement. ''I just want to say that it is a matter of great satisfaction to the Canadian Government,'' he told reporters.</p>
        <p>Canadian experts have estimated that 50 percent of all acid rain emissions in Canada originate in the United States, mainly at coal-burning power plants in the Ohio Valley. They have said failure to limit the emissions could destroy many of the lakes and forests in the central and eastern parts of Canada over the next 30 years.</p>
        <p>In the program announced today, for the 1989 fiscal year the President will seek the $100 million that he has previously indicated he would request, plus $400 million in new funds. For the next three fiscal years, he will seek some $200 million that he has said he would request plus $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>''I will also encourage industry to invest an equal or greater amount over this period and to stimulate development and deployment of innovative technologies for reduction of air pollution emissions,'' Mr. Reagan said.</p>
        <p>A senior White House official said the decision was reached at a meeting Mr. Reagan held last week with his Domestic Policy Council, at which aides identified possibile troublesome areas for the Ottawa meeting. He said Mr. Reagan wanted to do all he could to prevent a fractious meeting.</p>
        <p>In addition, the official said some White House aides had noted that Mr. Mulroney's Conservative Party was trailing badly in public opinion polls.</p>
        <p>Before he met with Mr. Mulroney a year ago, Mr. Reagan argued that more must be learned about the causes and effects of acid rain before an expensive program was undertaken at a time of budget limitations. But more recently he endorsed a report by two special representatives, Drew Lewis of the United States and William Davis of Canada, urging a five-year program to develop cleaner ways of burning coal. The report said acid rain was causing economic, environmental and social damage on both sides of the border.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney indicated impatience with the Administration at a meeting in Ottawa with Vice President Bush in January. Asked if Mr. Reagan's proposed spending was consistent with last year's agreement, Mr. Mulroney said, ''Absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>Reacting to the announcement today, the executive director of the Sierra Club, Michael McCloskey, said that the $2.5 billion would not reduce acid rain and that Mr. Reagan must require major reductions in sulfur emissions. He called the program an attempt ''to create the illusion that this Administration is willing to control acid rain.''</p>
        <p>In Canada, environmental experts said that because the new spending would focus on research in clean coal technology, it would not bring about the immediate reductions in acid rain emissions. ''It won't reduce emissions by a single ounce,'' said Charles Caccia, a Liberal member of Parliament and a former Environment Minister.</p>
