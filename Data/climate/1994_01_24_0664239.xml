        <p>We're havin' a heat wave, a tropical heat wave. The temperature has finally climbed out of the single digits.  The news programs have scrubbed their spots on the return of the Ice Age.</p>
        <p>For this we should heave a warm sigh. Instead, we find ourselves with a head full of Andy Rooneyesque whiny questions. To wit:</p>
        <p>1. How does The Old Farmer's Almanac account for the fact that it predicted a "warmer than normal" January in New York? Software glitch? Is a special prosecutor of fearsome probity -- with subpoena powers -- in order here?</p>
        <p>2. Why do local television reporters insist on delivering live, outdoor reports from Fort Lee, N.J., in subzero temperatures? Do they get paid extra for shivering on-camera?</p>
        <p>3. Just what did happen to global warming? And where is the greenhouse effect when you need it?</p>
        <p>4. Who was the guy with the hockey stick the other night -- when the temperature was exactly zero -- skating on an ice-slicked handball court at 35th Street and Second Avenue, shooting hockey pucks against the backboard?</p>
        <p>5. If he had been alive in New York City last week, could Robert Frost have written: "Some say the world will end in fire/ Some say the world will end in ice"? Who could have voted for fire?</p>
        <p>6. Is it possible that the people who deliver pizza and Chinese food in snow, ice and other aggressive forms of weather could be persuaded to take over the U.S. Postal Service?</p>
        <p>7. From a purely psychological standpoint, does knowing that the wind-chill factor is minus 26, or minus 37, make any difference at all?</p>
