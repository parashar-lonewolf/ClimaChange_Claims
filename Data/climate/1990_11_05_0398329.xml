        <p>A group of scientists considered experts on world climate called Saturday on all nations to take immediate steps to control global warming, regardless of the many questions that still exist about man-made climate change.</p>
        <p>The scientists, at the Second World Climate Conference here, completed their report late Saturday and made it public today. They said in a statement that the technology already exists to make substantial cuts in the emission of harmful gases without jeopardizing economic growth. The cuts and changes they are pressing for are far more drastic than any government is now considering.</p>
        <p>But the unexpectedly strong statement, a consensus reached by more than 700 scientists and environmental specialists, appears to emphasize differences with the Bush Administration, which has problems with the view that governments should lose no time and set immediate targets for cutting back carbon dioxide. The U.S. Position</p>
        <p>The statement is also expected to leave the United States further isolated diplomatically this week when more than 100 environmental ministers will conclude the conference.</p>
        <p>In recent days, most wealthy nations, including the 12 countries of the European Community, have set targets for slowing carbon dioxide coming from cars, homes and factories, and some countries have even pledged to cut back on today's emissions.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration holds that it is still too early to decide how the United States, which is responsible for 24 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, should reduce them, suggesting that to do so risks enormous costs and unduly curtailing its economic growth.</p>
        <p>While the United States is not the only country that feels uneasy about assessing how man is tampering with the enormously complex system that makes up the world climate, it is almost the only industrialized nation that opposes committing itself to cutbacks in the present.</p>
        <p>This week large oil producers, including the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, have rallied to the American side. Experts said these nations believe they will lose if the world suddenly starts burning less oil, the main source of carbon dioxide.  'Between Science and Policy'</p>
        <p>Scientists involved in drafting the strong 13-page conference statement said the document would serve as the framework for future discussions and would be hard for policymakers to ignore. It carries the stamp of the World Meteorological Organization and the world's Oceanographic Commission and a number of United Nations bodies who sponsored the conference. It was unusual because it was the first official call for political action coming from such a large group of climate scientists, among them a number of Americans.</p>
        <p>"We are at an interesting edge between science and policy now," said Maurice la Riviere, a professor of environmental biology and the head of the International Council of Scientific Unions. "We hope governments and policymakers will understand what scientists mean. Where we go from here is up to them, but given what we know, there is absolutely no excuse for governments not to save on energy."</p>
        <p>The digression from science to politics in the six-day technical conference also made some scientists and specialists uneasy.</p>
        <p>"There is a leap here from science to policy that is not comfortable for some people," said Michael Glantz, a social scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Change at an Unseen Pace</p>
        <p>Harmuth Grassl, a German professor of meteorology, said that while "as scientists we are basically here as ruminants, it is very important to get out the main message: That change on earth is now so fast there is no analogy during the last 10,000 years."</p>
        <p>For its scientific substance, the conference statement drew heavily on the report released last May by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is now considered the most important assessment so far of knowledge available on climate change.</p>
        <p>The new report issued here today included these points:</p>
        <p>*Notwithstanding scientific and economic uncertainties, all countries should take immediate steps to reduce greenhouse gases and find more ways to absorb excess gases already in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>*Without such actions, global warming will increase between 2 and 5 degrees centigrade over the next century, a rate of change unprecedented in the last 10,000 years.</p>
        <p>*This warming could lead to a sea level rise between 35 and 65 centimeters in the next century. Although the range is large, it is prudent to take precautions.</p>
        <p>*It is now technically feasible and cost-effective to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in all countries. There are enough opportunities for many industrialized countries to cut carbon dioxide by at least 20 percent by the year 2005 if they use energy more efficiently, employ alternative fuels and plant more forests to absorb carbon.</p>
        <p>Scientists also said to understand climate it was vital to expand global observation systems and above all establish a network to study the world's oceans. Scientists say the workings of the ocean, the main regulator of the world climate, are poorly understood.</p>
