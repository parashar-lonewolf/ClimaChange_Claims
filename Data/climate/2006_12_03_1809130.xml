        <p>For the better part of a century, the smoke spewing from the refineries along the northern end of the New Jersey Turnpike has symbolized the state's attitude toward the environment: throw out the bad stuff and let the winds take it where they will.</p>
        <p>But slowly, new symbols are emerging: a wind farm in Atlantic City; a mandate that the state derive 20 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources, mainly wind and solar, by 2020; and a choice provision that makes New Jersey one of a handful of states in the nation that give utility customers the option of paying a few dollars more to get their energy from clean sources of power.</p>
        <p>A conference at Kean University in Union last month celebrated these changes, while at the same time rallying for more and faster progress by business, consumers and government in making New Jersey a leader in developing and using alternatives to carbon-based energy sources.</p>
        <p>An underlying theme of the conference was that significant numbers of New Jerseyans want to do their part in helping the environment -- and in combating global warming -- and are willing to pay a little more to do it.</p>
        <p>The kickoff speech was given by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the outspoken environmentalist, author, champion of a cleaner Hudson River and son of the former attorney general, who excoriated the Bush administration for its vast rollback of environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>But the emphasis of the conference was on ways to achieve progress. Richard Dovey, president of the Atlantic County Utilities Authority, described how his agency's wastewater treatment plant in Atlantic City gets 62 percent of its power from a wind farm, the state's first, and another 3 percent from 2,700 solar panels. The utility's solid waste plant gets its power from landfill gas, and a combination of soybean and diesel fuels powers its trucks.</p>
        <p>And Jaime Lerner, a United Nations urban planning consultant and former mayor of Curitiba, Brazil, emphasized that environmentally creative programs usually do not take a lot of time or cost huge amounts to put into effect. He recounted how his city of 1.8 million rejected the idea of building a subway system in favor of simply sectioning off the middle of its major avenues for large buslike vehicles that carry up to 300 passengers and run as frequently as every 30 seconds. He said a city could put such a system into effect in two years.</p>
        <p>''If you want creativity, lop off a zero from your budget,'' he said. ''If you want real creativity, lop off two zeroes.''</p>
