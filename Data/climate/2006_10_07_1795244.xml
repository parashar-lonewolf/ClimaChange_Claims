        <p>''SO how did I get here, defending the killing of God's creatures?'' the celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain asks plaintively. The creatures, in this case, are ducks.</p>
        <p>The man he's asking, a fellow celebrity chef, Michael Ruhlman, is sympathetic, but he can't help but throw in a few zingers, as when he asks Mr. Bourdain, ''So, are you just off on another of your bobble-head-doll rants?''</p>
        <p>The conversation, solicited by Salon and conducted via e-mail, centered on how the ''food police'' are making life tough not just for famous chefs, but for the entire food industry (salon.com).</p>
        <p>Michael J. Panter, a New Jersey legislator, has proposed a ban on the forcible feeding of ducks and geese to make foie gras -- which is produced from their fattened livers. Animal-rights activists decry the practice, called gavage. The proposal comes after a similar ban in Chicago and a proposed ban on trans fats in New York City restaurants.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with the proposed New Jersey law, according to Mr. Bourdain, is that the state is home to D'Artagnan, the company that started the fresh foie gras revolution in the United States two decades ago. Mr. Panter's law, according to Salon, could ''effectively cripple the production and consumption of foie gras not only in New York City's great temples of gastronomy, but in restaurants and homes around the country.''</p>
        <p>Ariane Daguin, the founder and owner of D'Artagnan, ''is not just the foie gras lady,'' Mr. Bourdain writes, ''she was a Gertrude Stein to a veritable salon of hotshot New York chefs.''</p>
        <p>D'Artagnan sells much more than just foie gras, offering all kinds of gourmet meats and other products. Ms. Daguin is ''a one-woman supply train for every French chef in New York and consequently any American chef with aspirations to be among the best.''</p>
        <p>Cutting off her foie gras could mean halting that supply train, he laments.</p>
        <p>But what about this gavage business? Isn't it wrong to ram a tube down a duck's throat to pump food into it? Sure, Mr. Bourdain writes. And not only is it bad, but it makes for bad foie gras, but ''that's not what D'Artagnan sells.''</p>
        <p>Although the fowl is fed through a tube, Mr. Bourdain writes that in ''proper foie gras farming, the same feeder tends the duck every day, and more often than not, it's the duck who approaches the feeder.They have room to run around, to live a good, natural life -- even a pampered one -- compared with the horrifying and vastly more widespread practice of raising battery chickens.''</p>
        <p>Battery chickens are raised in a factorylike setting, stuffed into cages, and are induced through artificial lighting to produce as many eggs as they can before they are slaughtered once their egg production levels off -- usually around 18 months. There's no law against that.</p>
        <p>SUSTAINABILE BARGAIN? The threat of global warming could be staved off at the cost of just one year's worth of economic growth over the next four decades, according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers released this week (pwc.com).</p>
        <p>But the consulting firm says its plan would work only if it is put into place immediately.</p>
        <p>The plan itself is nothing really new -- it calls for more energy efficiency, the use of more renewable fuels and emission-reduction technologies.</p>
        <p>''Political will, of course, is the wild card here,'' writes Jeff McIntire-Strasburg who maintains a blog (sustainablog.blogspot.com). He asks his readers if they have ''any ideas on how this might be sold to politicians eager to gain and/or retain an office?'' So far, nobody has responded.</p>
        <p>LETTER IMPERFECT -- On its Web site, Killian &amp; Company Advertising, which specializes in branding, offers portions of some actual cover letters from job candidates (killianadvertising.com). Cover letters are ''where we find the most tortured prose ever set to paper,'' the site says.</p>
        <p>No kidding. Some examples: ''Who's better to spew out incite, than a college senior ... ?''; ''I also want to obtain a deeper understanding of how Advertising firms.''; and ''I also have a degree English which serves me well in editing text for poor grammer or typos.''</p>
