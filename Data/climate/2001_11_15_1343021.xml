        <p>LIKE many filmmakers, Rob Weychert has his ambitions. He used Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' in one film and he makes allusions to ''Brave New World'' in another. He adores the films of Todd Solondz, whom he calls ''the modern master of black comedy.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know anybody else making films now that makes me simultaneously want to vomit and laugh hysterically,'' Mr. Weychert said of Mr. Solondz. ''It would be neat to try with Lego.''</p>
        <p>That's right: Lego. The brightly colored plastic blocks that snap together to create all manner of shapes have inspired a niche world of filmmaking called brick films. Lego directors like Mr. Weychert use the traditional technique of stop-motion animation, shooting the film frame-by-frame and moving the figures between shots to create the illusion of motion. Some of their efforts are viewable online at brickfilms.com and in a special section of ifilm.com.</p>
        <p>Most works are from one to five minutes, enough time to satirize just about anything, and parodies of ''Star Wars'' and ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' are a staple of brick films. But there is a small group of auteurs, like Mr. Weychert, whose film work suggests a movement away from a fascination with novelty toward headier terrain.</p>
        <p>Jason Rowoldt, a computer consultant in Washington and the founder of brickfilms .com, acknowledged that, among the 40 or so filmmakers whose work is online, some do stand out. ''Along with every 10 really juvenile directors,'' he said, ''you get someone who really does a good job and wants to tackle things.''</p>
        <p>Russ Jensen, a 21-year-old art student in central Michigan, addressed racism in his  short ''Black vs. Yellow.'' Two minifigs (Lego-speak for minifigure) declare their mutual unjustified hatred. A third comes along, chops them up in pieces and then reassembles them so that the two figures are now, in the Lego sense, biracial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jensen said he used yellow, rather than white, because of its dominance in the Lego palette. ''The way I portrayed it is kind of silly, but I don't think it's any more or less silly than it is in real life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The films of Mr. Weychert, a graphic designer who lives near Philadelphia, are far less earnest, mixing social commentary with a slacker spirit. In ''Twelve Bucks,'' an unemployed minifig gets a job but fails to realize that the cereal factory where he goes to work is really a missile plant.</p>
        <p>''I knew that I wanted the story to tell itself without the characters necessarily knowing what was really going on,'' Mr. Weychert said. The film, which can be seen at brickfilms.com or at bredstik.com, traveled  briefly around the country as part of an independent film festival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weychert's first film, ''Siege on the Corporate Identity Plant,'' ridiculed corporate culture. ''Heat, Part Two'' (there is no ''Part One'') is a fantasy about accelerated global warming over New Jersey. He has started another project, ''As Good as Soma,'' an anti-consumerist sendup whose title is derived from a reference Huxley makes to a drug in ''Brave New World.''</p>
        <p>''One of the challenges I'm looking forward to overcoming is making something that can actually be moving or gut-wrenching,'' Mr. Weychert said.</p>
        <p>The Lego company is aware of brick films and last year released an elementary filmmaking kit called the Lego &amp; Steven Spielberg MovieMaker Set. But Lego officials may not have foreseen the circumstances their minifigs would find themselves in.</p>
        <p>Q. Allan Brocka, a brick filmmaker based in Los Angeles, made an eight-part, sexually explicit series called ''Rick &amp; Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World.'' It has been screened at many film festivals, including Sundance. ''Girl,'' a short by a filmmaker in Bangor, Maine, whose professional name is Ben B., includes an alarming sequence in which the Lego child's mother snorts a line of cocaine.</p>
        <p>''That's not in line with our brand values and not something intended with our MovieMaker or our products in general,'' said Mike McNally, a Lego spokesman, referring to the cocaine sequence. But he said that Lego had no plans to take any action against brick filmmakers, who generally derive no money from their work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weychert joked: ''It's the big thing right now, you know. Survivor and Lego animation.''</p>
