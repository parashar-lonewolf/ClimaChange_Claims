        <p>Fourteen years ago, the Energy Department and the nation's nuclear utilities struck an agreement for the Federal Government to dispose of high-level radioactive waste from civilian reactors.</p>
        <p>In return for taking one-tenth of a cent on each kilowatt-hour generated by the utilities' reactors, the Government promised to dispose of the waste. It then set out to find a site where it could build a repository. The Energy Department said it would be ready to meet its end of the deal by Jan. 31, 1998, a date that seemed, at the time, comfortably far in the future.</p>
        <p>But after spending some $6 billion -- about half what it has collected so far from the levy -- on evaluating a possible site near Las Vegas, Nev., the department acknowledged today that it would not be able to keep its promise.</p>
        <p>At a hearing before the Senate Energy Committee, Thomas P. Grumbly, the Deputy Energy Secretary, said the site, at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, would not be ready until at least 2010, although it might be able to accept some waste by 2006. Mr. Grumbly also said no temporary site would be ready until 2001.</p>
        <p>As a result, the utilities, running out of storage space of their own, say they are faced with building expensive casks to hold their high-level wastes. They and their regulators are now suing in court and lobbying Congress to hold the Government to the contracts.</p>
        <p>At today's hearing, Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who heads the committee, said, ''It is unsafe to let this dangerous radioactive waste material continue to accumulate at more than 80 sites all across the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murkowski has proposed a bill, similar to one that the Senate passed last year but that was not taken up by the House, to establish an interim storage spot, essentially a fenced-off parking lot for massive storage casks, at the Nevada Test Site, the Government's old nuclear test range, near Yucca Mountain.</p>
        <p>But the Clinton Administration says that spending money on an interim site would drain resources from research at Yucca Mountain and remove all sense of urgency about completing the plans for the permanent site.</p>
        <p>In Nevada, meanwhile, many continue to oppose the plans for the Yucca Mountain site. Testifying at today's hearing, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the 1987 Federal law that pinpointed Yucca Mountain as the site to be studied was unfair to Nevada.</p>
        <p>Senator Larry E. Craig, an Idaho Republican on the committee, replied: ''You can characterize it as you wish, and I don't blame you. It will read well in the Vegas papers in the morning.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murkowski said that if a site in Alaska had been chosen, he would have been on the other side of the table, testifying as Mr. Reid had.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists think long-term storage above ground would be a good way for society to hedge its bets about how to handle materials that will have to be isolated from the environment for thousands of years.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Grumbly of the Energy Department said that establishing an underground ''repository,'' the department's preferred term, would be preferable for civilian wastes and would help isolate military wastes, some of which include material that could be used in weapons.</p>
        <p>The storage problem is quickly becoming acute. The waste was always certain to outlive the reactors, but the lifetime of the reactors is turning out to be decades shorter than expected. Several have now been retired, still storing spent fuel. That requires the owners to maintain equipment and systems that would otherwise have been retired. And the cost for this runs to $10 million a year at some reactors.</p>
        <p>But Michael Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information Resource Service, a coalition of groups that generally favor conservation and renewable energy sources, told the committee today that the situation was not acute.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe it's at the crisis stage,'' Mr. Mariotte said.</p>
