        <p>The first spacecraft to probe Mars ended up shattering ages of myths and delusions. This was no sister planet to Earth lush in lakes, canals and vegetation, as some astronomers had imagined after seeing elusive dark patches and white ice caps that seemed to change with the seasons.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mariner 4, which flew past Mars 35 years ago this month, snapping 22 close-up photographs, revealed a wasteland.</p>
        <p>Scars from cosmic bombardments riddled its surface, implying that Mars had undergone no erosion by air, seas and churning rock over the eons. It had no detectable magnetic field, meaning its core was cooler and less dynamic than Earth's and that its surface was lashed by radiation. And its atmosphere was found to be so thin that any liquid water would quickly vaporize.</p>
        <p>''In jarring contrast with our expectations, we had just discovered a Mars incredibly inhospitable to life,'' recalled Bruce Murray, then a young planetary scientist and later director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which engineered the interplanetary trek.</p>
        <p>Other probes suggested that eons ago Mars was warm and in some places wet. But the planet's white poles today turned out to be mainly dry ice, not water. And slowly, grudgingly, the planet came to be seen as dead geologically and probably devoid of living things.</p>
        <p>Now, rather suddenly, Mars is showing new signs of life. The announcement last month that the orbiting spacecraft known as Mars Global Surveyor had photographed regions said to have been cut in modern times by running water is but one of the surprises emerging from recent detective work.</p>
        <p>Scientists, examining Mars rocks hurled to Earth in upheavals, have found signs that moving water changed the chemical makeup of the surface terrain in recent eras, and they have concluded that the Martian crust harbors up to three times as much water as previously thought.</p>
        <p>Provocatively, experts scrutinizing the close-up photographs of Mars have also discovered hints of modern volcanism and fiery eruptions. That suggests the interior of Mars is warmer than previously thought and may help explain how deep ice can suddenly melt to form surface flows.</p>
        <p>''All this opens up a much more interesting and diverse planet than people expected,'' said Dr. William K. Hartmann, an astronomer at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz. It was his nine-person team that reported evidence of recent volcanism.</p>
        <p>''It's the discovery,'' he added, ''of an active Mars.''</p>
        <p>The implications of the new findings are being debated, and scientists urge caution because the assessments are often tentative. Some doubt flowing water explains the yawning cuts, for instance, and instead suggest other fluids or flows of mud or hot gas.</p>
        <p>But most agree that Mars is showing new signs of heat and vitality, as well as posing a new set of riddles.</p>
        <p>''The evidence now says it's not dead,'' said Dr. Bruce M. Jakosky, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado. ''But we don't comprehend what we're seeing yet, even though we know it's true.''</p>
        <p>Like fuzzy visions of Mars through early telescopes, the hints of flowing water and heat are fueling dreams of the ultimate discovery: aliens, not fossils from some long-departed era, but living ones prospering in secluded habitats, perhaps underground,  tiny and microbe-like.</p>
        <p>''It's not crazy to ask if there's oases where life might still exist'' close to the Martian surface, said Dr. Andrew H. Knoll, a Harvard biologist who studies early life on Earth and its possibility elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But he cautions that hunting for such oases will be difficult because Mars is so far away and the exploratory agenda of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is already so full and slowed by recent setbacks. ''It takes time to do these things,'' Dr. Knoll said. ''It has to be step by step.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kenneth H. Nealson, an astrobiologist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said aliens were rising on the Mars agenda.</p>
        <p>''I had pretty much given up on life near the surface,'' he said. ''I was skeptical about whether in my lifetime we could access any area that would have any possibility of life.''</p>
        <p>The new findings, he said, ''change the game.''</p>
        <p>''Shallow drilling is now something we should look into,'' he added. ''It's a very exciting debate.''</p>
        <p>Mars is the most Earthlike planet in the solar system and a close neighbor, being the next world out. It gets less sunshine than Earth and is relatively cold. Its polar caps and changing seasons, resulting from an axial tilt like that of Earth's, have long made it a world of dreams.</p>
        <p>The astronomer Percival Lowell claimed he had found evidence of artificial canals and intelligent life, even though his telescopes showed Mars as little more than a blurry dot. In 1894, he founded the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Ariz., and for more than a decade charted dark markings he saw as waterways enveloped by dense foliage, somewhat like the Nile.</p>
        <p>In the century since then, Mars probes like Mariner 4 have let scientists make millions of close-up observations and discoveries, including dry river beds hinting at past torrents.</p>
        <p>The $300 million Mars Global Surveyor, built by NASA, has been studying and photographing the remote world for more than two years even as two sister probes last year vanished while approaching the planet.</p>
        <p>The probe has found dust devils, carbon dioxide snow and signs of old magnetic fields suggesting the early core was highly active.</p>
        <p>The findings have tended to come out piecemeal in papers and forums, often with little fanfare, so that even Mars experts are struggling with the tide. ''I can't keep up with it,'' said Dr. Maria T. Zuber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is on a global surveyor science team.</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Hartmann of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson and eight colleagues at Cornell,  the United States Geological Survey and other institutions reported that Mars was apparently alive geologically, based on the freshness of some surfaces.</p>
        <p>The team examined close-up surveyor images of volcanoes and lava flows and found that some had a distinct lack of cratering. All the solar system's planets and moons exhibit impact craters from a steady rain of cosmic debris, with Earth's scars mostly erased by ages of erosion. On any body, the absence of craters implies active resurfacing.</p>
        <p>For Mars, the team focused on the extraordinarily wide mouth of a very young volcano, Arsia Mons. The huge peak, located just south of the Martian equator, is one of the largest known volcanoes, its summit 5.6 miles higher than the surrounding plains and its summit crater, or caldera, 68 miles wide.</p>
        <p>The team found that craters were far rarer in the caldera than on the volcano's outer flanks, suggesting that Mars had been active as recently as 40 million years ago -- a snap in the planet's life of five billion years -- and perhaps even more recently.</p>
        <p>''The crater statistics that we report here suggest that volcanism is continuing on Mars in current geological time,'' the scientists wrote Feb. 18, 1999, in the journal Nature. The team included Dr. Michael H. Carr, one of the world's top Mars experts.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Dr. Hartmann said the finding overturned what had been the conventional view for decades.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of people who thought all the volcanism died out two or three billion years ago,'' he said, adding that molten rock near the surface might explain the evidence of recent water flows.</p>
        <p>At a news conference on June 22 in Washington, NASA made public the signs of flowing water, previewing a paper in the June 30 issue of Science by Dr. Michael C. Malin and Dr. Kenneth S. Edgett of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, which built the surveyor camera.</p>
        <p>Images of 120 gullies, pits and valleys, they said, suggested that flows of water had occurred in recent geologic time, perhaps just hundreds, thousands or millions of years ago, instead of the planet's early days. The springlike seeps and flows, they added, ''could even be contemporary.''</p>
        <p>Close-up images of steep hillsides show gullies and channels ending in fanlike deltas of soil and rocks, suggesting the flows formed the deposits. These features are young, the scientists said, because their surfaces are smooth and light in color, compared with old regions pocked with craters and covered with dark dust.</p>
        <p>The scientists found no link between the sites and known volcanic regions of Mars. Most flows lie in southern latitudes, some not far from the south pole. The provocative sites are seen as having no relationship to warming from sunlight since they often lie in shadows, making them very cold.</p>
        <p>Previously, scientists had estimated that the planet's lingering internal heat might have kept water liquid in rocky strata a mile or more below the dry Martian surface. In contrast, Dr. Malin and Dr. Edgett said the new evidence suggested that liquid water might lie as close as a few hundred feet down.</p>
        <p>Dr. Laurie A. Leshin, a geologist at Arizona State University, recently came to similar conclusions by analyzing a Mars meteorite. She measured the concentration of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, a component of so-called heavy water, in the meteorite and concluded that the Martian crust had two to three times the amount of water previously thought.</p>
        <p>''It's a tiny meteorite with big implications,'' she said in an interview. ''There's every reason to think we could find water in the Martian crust today.''</p>
        <p>In a different Mars meteorite, Dr. Timothy D. Swindle of the University of Arizona and seven colleagues found evidence that water had changed the rock's composition in relatively recent geologic times. ''It's the youngest evidence for water,'' he said, adding that all the emerging signs suggest it now lies close to the surface.</p>
        <p>In theory, the new findings are increasing the possibility that Martians of one sort or another may be clinging to life on the dying planet.</p>
        <p>In the past decade or so, as scientists have discovered a remarkably rich microbial fauna dwelling deep in the Earth's interior, miles down, they have theorized that Mars may be similar. After all, its interior is thought to be wet and warm, potentially a kind of microbe heaven.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas Gold, a distinguished space scientist at Cornell, has proposed that the solar system might harbor as many as 10 alien biospheres hidden in deep rocky strata, with Mars at the top of his list. The problem for human explorers is that such regions are frustratingly out of reach.</p>
        <p>Now, the new evidence of surface water and heat is stirring excitement about the prospect of more accessible habitats and of humans' some day making contact with living Martians.</p>
        <p>''If you can imagine episodes in which water comes to the surface and stays for a while, then you have the possibility that any life would have a chance to grow and express itself,'' said Dr. Nealson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ''To me as a biologist, that's very interesting.''</p>
        <p>Scientists agree that the discovery of even a single extraterrestrial microbe would be a watershed, shedding light on how life began and the odds of its arising elsewhere in the universe.</p>
        <p>''This is exciting,'' Dr. Jakosky of the University of Colorado said of the water evidence and its life implications. ''This is big news.''</p>
