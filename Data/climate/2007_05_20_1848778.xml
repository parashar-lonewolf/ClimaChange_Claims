        <p>MAKING way for the new Yankee Stadium on the sites of Macombs Dam and Mullaly Parks in the South Bronx, 170 mature leafy trees met their fates with chain saws, ropes and log loaders last summer, and an additional 207 are set for their demise.</p>
        <p>To counter the loss, the city's Parks Department has been moving ahead with a five-year program to plant 8,000 new trees along the sidewalks and in parks within two miles of the new stadium. Since last fall, more than 550 young trees representing 33 species have taken root in the area. An additional 250 trees will be put in the ground before the spring window for ideal planting conditions closes in three weeks.</p>
        <p>Although appreciative of the lush greenery, some residents would like to see male trees excluded from the mix because of the pollen that they emit and the medical problems it can cause.</p>
        <p>''Let's not plant something that will actually trigger off these things,'' Robert Garmendiz, chairman of the parks and recreation committee of the local community board, said at a recent committee meeting.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, Mr. Garmendiz requested that the Parks Department refrain from planting male trees, expressing concern that they would worsen allergic reactions and asthma attacks in the South Bronx, where asthma rates are among the highest in the city. ''It only makes sense,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But in the opinion of Fiona Watt, the department's chief of forestry and horticulture, concerns about planting male trees in the Bronx may be largely immaterial, since the city rarely plants male trees.</p>
        <p>In terms of gender, trees are either monoecious, meaning that they have the reproductive structure of both sexes, or dioecious, meaning that they have either the male or female reproductive structure. Only six of the 45 tree species that the city plants on sidewalks are dioecious, Ms. Watt said. Those are the katsura, the Kentucky coffee, the hardy rubber, the ginkgo, the European ash and the green ash trees, few if any of which are being planted in the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>''It's a teeny little drop in the bucket, infinitesimal compared to the number of trees that already exist across the landscape,'' said Ms. Watt, noting that many trees in the city grow wild and were not planted by people. A big pollen-spreading culprit among New York's 5.2 million trees, she said, is probably the ailanthus, among the city's most prevalent species of tree. Seeds it spreads in the wind take root in forests and backyards.</p>
        <p>''When you talk about pollen,'' Ms. Watt said, ''the allergy issue is caused by existing trees.''</p>
        <p>Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner, emphasized that the pollen that trees emit is easily outweighed by their many virtues, like producing carbon dioxide, conducting rainwater and providing animal habitats.</p>
        <p>''You can't have plants without pollen,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''The enormous urban benefits of trees far outweigh the inconvenience of pollen.''</p>
        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH BRONX</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 27, 2007, Sunday  An article last Sunday about the planting of trees near the new Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx paraphrased incorrectly a comment by Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, about the natural benefits of trees. Mr. Benepe said that trees reduce -- not produce -- carbon dioxide in the air by absorbing it. (Trees do emit some carbon dioxide the same way that animals do, but the emission is far outweighed by the absorption that occurs during photosynthesis.)</p>
