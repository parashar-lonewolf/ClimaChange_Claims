        <p>America is back up on wedgies. Remember those triangulated, high-soled shoes of the 40's that incorporated the heel and turned the fashionable woman into an endangered species? They're back -- not merely in the form of platform soles, but planks in political platforms.</p>
        <p>In 1990, as Bush White House aides fought over the degree to which affirmative action guidelines became quotas, the former Carter adviser Stuart E.

        <p>America is back up on wedgies. Remember those triangulated, high-soled shoes of the 40's that incorporated the heel and turned the fashionable woman into an endangered species? They're back -- not merely in the form of platform soles, but planks in political platforms.</p>
        <p>In 1990, as Bush White House aides fought over the degree to which affirmative action guidelines became quotas, the former Carter adviser Stuart E. Eizenstat said with some prescience that the Republicans had "a need to give the Reagan Democrats red meat at a time when the economy is going into the tank, and they see civil rights and quotas as a</p>
        <p>wedge issue</p>
        <p>."</p>
        <p>Recalling this early usage and perhaps coinage, Mr. Eizenstat tells me: "I was looking for a phrase to illustrate the attempt to split the coalition of working-class whites and blacks, the two constituencies Roosevelt unified on economic grounds. The image came to mind of a wedge being driven."</p>
        <p>It filled a political-linguistic need for fresh labels. Another Democrat, the Clinton strategist James Carville, charged two years later that President Bush's advisers, bereft of an agenda, had to "dust off the Republican manual, which is to go to</p>
        <p>wedge issues</p>
        <p>: 'We can't lead the country so maybe we can divide it.' "</p>
        <p>As a phrase,</p>
        <p>wedge issue</p>
        <p>is related to the 80's</p>
        <p>hot-button issue</p>
        <p>, which was an updating of the 70's</p>
        <p>polarization</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>Wedge</p>
        <p>, with earthy Indo-European roots as both verb and noun, strikes me as an improvement over the Latinate</p>
        <p>polarize</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>polarization</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>Wedge issue</p>
        <p>is a political attack locution, usually used by liberals and moderates, aimed at politicians on the right who bring up sensitive cultural and social subjects during political campaigns. The dividing wedge, however, need not be racial: free trade is seen by the right as a wedge issue to use to divide workers and environmentalists on the left.</p>
        <p>Here is a synonymy of the issues issue: a</p>
        <p>switcher issue</p>
        <p>-- like gun control or abortion -- is a single subject that will cause a minority of voters to change their vote regardless of other patterns, urges or habits (resulting in a</p>
        <p>bullet vote</p>
        <p>).</p>
        <p>A</p>
        <p>hot-button issue</p>
        <p>-- like perks for big shots or global warming -- will cause a potential voter to become agitated, but not necessarily to the point of switching allegiance; touching this button causes audiences to roar or hoot, and is synonymous with</p>
        <p>red meat</p>
        <p>, the figure of speech drawn from the excited reaction of carnivorous animals when food is thrown into their cage.</p>
        <p>A</p>
        <p>gut issue</p>
        <p>has a wider visceral appeal: the intestinal matter on this year's agenda is the slow growth of the economy, expressed in the single word "jobs." This</p>
        <p>bread-and-butter issue</p>
        <p>can also be the</p>
        <p>burning issue</p>
        <p>if it is dramatized, but if the opposition fails to ignite it, the subject is better described as the</p>
        <p>paramount issue</p>
        <p>. As an issue fades, it becomes characterized as a</p>
        <p>yawner</p>
        <p>.  PEROTIAN ALERT</p>
        <p>I MISS ROSS PEROT. NOT only did he apply the traffic term</p>
        <p>gridlock</p>
        <p>to divided-party government, but also the jug-eared, thin-skinned executive generated the most derisive sobriquet of the current campaign, as his betrayed supporters called him "the yellow Ross of Texas."</p>
        <p>In Forbes magazine's 75th anniversary issue, Peggy Noonan, the former Reagan-Bush speechwriter who has developed the art of impressionism in political prose, summarized the voters' view of the horseless head man in a poetic trope: "They looked at him and saw a hand grenade with a bad haircut."</p>
        <p>THE WAY THE POLL BOUNCES</p>
        <p>"IT'S PARTLY A</p>
        <p>convention bounce</p>
        <p>," Gov. Bill Clinton said after his poll ratings shot up in July.</p>
        <p>As August ended and the Republicans had convened in Houston, the Bush-Quayle ratings improved somewhat and The Christian Science Monitor wrote, "It represents a routine</p>
        <p>convention bounce</p>
        <p>." Newsweek, in its Conventional Wisdom Watch, asked, "Why does the CW worry about the '</p>
        <p>convention</p>
        <p>bounce</p>
        <p>' if the CW also says the bounce dissipates within two weeks?"</p>
        <p>The much-discussed</p>
        <p>convention bounce</p>
        <p>is a temporary rise in the opinion polls caused by the television exposure and print commentary during a party's national convention. As The Associated Press reported in 1988, "The</p>
        <p>convention bounce</p>
        <p>usually settles down as voters focus on the issues of the race."</p>
        <p>Bounce</p>
        <p>has triumphed over the variant</p>
        <p>bump</p>
        <p>. Who coined the phrase? In 1980, the Carter Presidential spokesman, Jody Powell, used the term to mean a psychological lift: he said that the increase in President Carter's rating was "the post-convention bounce we hoped for." In a dozen years, the</p>
        <p>post-</p>
        <p>prefix has worn off. WORDS OF WISDOM</p>
        <p>PHRASE JUNKIES ARE always on the lookout for political axioms, adages and proverbs.</p>
        <p>Bert Lance's "</p>
        <p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it</p>
        <p>" has become a source of inspiration to anti-activists. Dwight Morrow's "</p>
        <p>Any party which takes credit for the rain must not be surprised if its opponents blame it for the drought</p>
        <p>" is being ruefully repeated by supporters of George Bush. Economists eager to fine-tune the economy turn to the wisdom attributed to the gangster Al Capone: "</p>
        <p>You can get a lot more done with a kind word and a gun, than with a kind word alone</p>
        <p>."</p>
        <p>A subcategory in this field is "forgiveness, political," headed by the quotation attributed to the Kennedy brothers: "</p>
        <p>Forgive but don't forget</p>
        <p>." An addition to this store of sophisticated sagacity has been provided by the newscaster Jim Lehrer, in his new, breezily profound memoir, "A Bus of My Own" (Putnam). He notes in passing that some former associates tried to do him in, and then forgives them, but not completely: "As a prominent Oklahoma politician says a lot," Lehrer writes, " '</p>
        <p>Show me somebody who can't tell his friends from his enemies and I'll show you somebody who's going to end up with no friends</p>
        <p>.' "  ON LANGUAGE</p>
