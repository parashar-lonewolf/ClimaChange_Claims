        <p>LEAD: Laird Cummings did not see the man coming at him through the smoky haze in the dimly lit warehouse here. He did not see the gun pointed at him.

        <p>Laird Cummings did not see the man coming at him through the smoky haze in the dimly lit warehouse here. He did not see the gun pointed at him. But he heard the shot that nailed him squarely in the back. ''I'm hit, I'm hit,'' he shouted. Then lowering his own custom 300-shot ''sniper'' pistol, Mr. Cummings shook his head and wiped a splatter of yellow paint off his black flak jacket. ''I'm getting my tail kicked in there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''In there'' was the Battlezone, a 16,000-square-foot warehouse in this small city north of Berkeley where dozens of people gather four nights a week to shoot paint pellets at each other in the name of fun and recreation. Dressed in camouflage fatigues or black SWAT team jumpsuits, protective helmets and goggles, each player pays $20 to join a paintball team and spend three hours negotiating a maze of matte black walls, trying to capture a key from the other team's station without getting shot with pellets of paint propelled by carbon dioxide cartridges from plastic pistols.</p>
        <p>In the Battlezone, designed and owned by Alexander Jason, a private security consultant, a computer controls the environment, constantly changing the level of the lighting from dim to dark and billowing chemical fog. Tapes of experimental music from the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics at Stanford University alternate with soundtracks from popular movies to create what Mr. Jason calls a ''disorienting'' experience.</p>
        <p>The helmets, goggles and face plates also add to the effect because, encapsulated inside, the player can hear his own breathing becoming increasingly rapid. ''It becomes part of the paranoia,'' Mr. Jason said.</p>
        <p>Jay Friber, a police officer and determined splatmaster, as dedicated paintball players are called, works as Mr. Jason's assistant at the Battlezone and explains safety measures and the finer points of the game to first-time players. What advice does he give novices? ''It's real dumb to look down the barrel of your gun to see if it's loaded,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, paintball, which has more than 15,000 regular players in this state alone, has become so popular that it now has its own national magazine, Action Pursuit. Published in Burbank, it began publishing monthly a year ago and has a circulation of 75,000, nearly all of it through newstand sales, its editor, Russell Maynard, said.</p>
        <p>A former editor of Inside Kung Fu, Mr. Maynard said the sport was growing so fast that there were more than 500 different playing courses set up in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and New Zealand. Experts will play for the North American national championship and a $70,000 purse on Nov. 4 and 5 in Nashville, Tenn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard believes he may have put his finger on one of the reasons for the attraction of the game. ''It's safe,'' he said, ''but there's a perceived danger.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard said the game is ideal for women because quickness and agility are more important than strength, but few play. ''It's not a woman's type of thing,'' Mr. Jason said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cummings, a Navy electrical technician, met his girlfriend when she zapped him in the elbow with a pellet. ''It was love at first shot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maynard thinks the game appeals to men more because, ''every man feels badly if he hasn't been a soldier.''</p>
        <p>Some learn lessons, too. Frederico Pizano, an oil refinery worker who plays here regularly with friends from work, rubbed a cold carbon dioxide cartridge on the bruise that represented his latest wound. ''This shows me,'' he said, ''that if you go to war, you will die.''</p>
        <p>But in keeping with Mr. Maynard's theory, Mr. Jason suggests the game offers an intangible benefit that many men find difficult to achieve in the workaday world outside the Battlezone's doors. He said running through the dark, ready to shoot, adrenalin pumping and the soundtrack from ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' playing, makes ''you feel like some sort of conquering hero.''</p>
