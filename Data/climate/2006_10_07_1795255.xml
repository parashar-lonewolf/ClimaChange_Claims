        <p>Oil executives are usually cautious and secretive. Not Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni of Italy, one of the world's top oil companies, who doesn't mind speaking frankly about his industry's challenges. In a recent stopover in Vienna, between meetings in Moscow and Rome, where he had just announced a wide-ranging deal with Russia's state-owned company Gazprom, Mr. Scaroni answered some questions about the opaque world of oil. Following are excerpts:</p>
        <p>Q: Some people believe high oil prices are here to stay. Do you share that view?</p>
        <p>A: First of all prices are not very high. Sixty dollars a barrel is not very high. If they were high, the American consumer in particular would behave differently. As long as each American consumer burns 26 barrels of oil per year against 12 for Europeans, this means that the prices are not high. High means that people start to say that I can use my energy better. Today, a barrel of oil is worth half a barrel of Coca-Cola. So you should put things into perspective. It has been clear to everybody that the Western world can live with oil above $30, $40, $50, $60, $70 a barrel and economies expand, inflation is low, and consumers continue to drive S.U.V.'s and air-conditioners are so high in American restaurants that you have to put on a coat otherwise you get sick.</p>
        <p>Q. Are you saying the American economy is wasteful in its energy use?</p>
        <p>A: Certainly it doesn't use energy efficiently. Look, if in America cars had the same efficiency as European cars, we would save the total production of Iran. That's four million barrels a day.</p>
        <p>Q. So it's all the fault of Detroit and carmakers?</p>
        <p>A. Even if the United States were independent, hydrocarbons would remain a limited resource. We have a total interest in using that limited resource to increase our efficiency, lengthening the life of the fossil fuels, for environmental reasons. This will more than compensate all the efforts we make in renewable energy. This is not to say we don't have to make renewables but the potential for efficiencies we have is enormous.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you reconcile rising demand and the need for more supplies when governments make access more difficult?</p>
        <p>A. First, I say it's their oil not mine. As a consequence we will have access to their oil as long as we bring something they cannot have by themselves. What do we bring -- technology, project management capability, investment -- something that adds value to them. If we do not add value we are out. Try going into Saudi Arabia and help Aramco to extract the easy oil. They don't need us. First of all they are a good company. Second the oil is easy. Why should they share something they can do by themselves. The second concept that I learned is that when oil prices move from $50 to $60 you cannot expect that this $10 difference falls into your pocket. You'd be happy if half of it went to you. All over the globe, there has been a big push to change the terms of the agreements over the past three years.</p>
        <p>Q. Isn't that a risky admission for an oil executive to be making?</p>
        <p>A. The same thing happens when prices fall. This time we renegotiate. When oil prices went down in the 1990's, we renegotiated. But if renegotiation goes too far, and international oil companies leave, and then production starts to drop. At that point governments understand that the terms and conditions are important and that we have our own interest.</p>
        <p>Q: Are you concerned by the talk of possible economic sanctions being imposed against Iran?</p>
        <p>A. I often say that unfortunately you don't find oil in Switzerland. I cannot choose. Since oil is not in Switzerland but it is in Russia, in Iran, in Kazakhstan, we have to be there. Then we modulate our presence according to terms and conditions. Terms and conditions that change all the time. But if you are not there, you are out.</p>
        <p>Q. Iran is one place that has limited investments by foreign companies. It has also seen its production decline.</p>
        <p>A. The two things go probably together.</p>
        <p>Q. How so?</p>
        <p>A. The fact that there are not many foreign companies probably is the reason production declines. Certainly in the fields we've been in charge of, the results have been spectacular. Beating all more optimistic forecasts.</p>
