        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Start Talking'' (editorial, Aug. 8) rightly questions and criticizes the fact that President Bush refuses to speak with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria about the crisis in Lebanon (and Israel).</p>
        <p>President Bush also indicated, when questioned on Monday by reporters, that he has not spoken directly to Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert of Israel and Fouad Siniora of Lebanon; he prefers to let Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice handle matters.</p>
        <p>As the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel seems to worsen by the hour, one would respectfully yet urgently ask President Bush what he is waiting for.</p>
        <p>Ilene Starger  Brooklyn, Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The reason the Bush administration won't talk to the ''bad guys'' like Iran, Syria and North Korea (editorial, Aug. 8) is that it is dominated by Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and other neocons who cling to the fantasy that the United States can resolve every dispute through military power.</p>
        <p>But in this age of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, no country -- not even the United States -- is powerful enough to impose its will on the rest of the world through force.</p>
        <p>We cannot even do this in a single country like Iraq.</p>
        <p>President Bush's six-shooter is running out of bullets. He has no choice except to talk.</p>
        <p>Roger Algase  New York, Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Aug. 8 editorial recommends that to make any headway in Lebanon, ''Mr. Bush will have to start with a clear signal that what the United States wants is a change in Syria's conduct, not the overthrow of its regime.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this bit of wishful thinking completely ignores the fact that what President Bush and the neoconservatives continue to hold out for, even in the face of their catastrophic failures in Iraq, is precisely that: an overthrow of the Syrian regime.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of Mr. Bush's reaching out to Syria to help end this crisis is about the same as the likelihood that he will start believing in global warming.</p>
        <p>Carl Mezoff  Stamford, Conn., Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I applaud you for asserting the salient point that the process of multilateral negotiations between adversaries is the only path to peace and that the Bush administration should keep its faith in the peace talks despite pitfalls and thorny issues.</p>
        <p>But I disagree with your description of President Bashar al-Assad as ''a bad actor.''</p>
        <p>It seems to me that there is a willingness to deny the reality of the Israeli occupation, to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the most cruel crimes perpetuated against innocent civilians, by placing the blame at President Assad's feet.</p>
        <p>Have we forgotten that the Syrian Golan Heights are still occupied by Israeli forces?</p>
        <p>Hasn't the time come to lay the blame where it truly belongs: Israel's occupation of Arab lands and unwillingness to abide by international norms?</p>
        <p>Munjed Farid Al Qutob  London, Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''After Bomb Kills Loved Ones, Life Turns Ghostly in Lebanon'' (front page, Aug. 8):</p>
        <p>Yes, Ghazi Samra's loss is tragic. We regret all human suffering and are not proud of deaths of non-combatant Lebanese.</p>
        <p>Of what can Hezbollah boast? Defying international borders to kidnap Israeli soldiers? Taking weapons from Iran and Syria to destroy Israel? Stockpiling many thousands of bombs to achieve what? Peace?</p>
        <p>Linda Wolfson-Steinberg  Skokie, Ill., Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>These lines from ''After Bomb Kills Loved Ones, Life Turns Ghostly in Lebanon'' say it all:</p>
        <p>''Around 5:30 p.m., missiles struck the building's foundations and its top floors. Residents now say a Hezbollah official may have been living there.''</p>
        <p>The Israelis have to ask themselves in good conscience whether the mere possibility that a Hezbollah official may have been in the building was worth the lives of the people who ended up perishing in it.</p>
        <p>Mark Cohen  New York, Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Shrugs for the Dead,'' by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Aug. 8):</p>
        <p>The reason we Americans are more sympathetic to Israeli casualties than Lebanese is that the Israelis are direct victims of terrorism bred of pure hatred (no different from the 9/11 attacks).</p>
        <p>The Lebanese are indirect victims of terrorism that is a result of their complicity in allowing the terrorists to operate from their homes and neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>It is their responsibility to prevent attacks on other sovereign nations from within their borders.</p>
        <p>Ron Novick  Orange, Conn., Aug. 8, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Bush's Embrace of Israel Shows Gap With Father'' (front page, Aug. 2):</p>
        <p>George W. Bush is determined not to ''follow in the footsteps of his father,'' who opposed Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian lands. There is, however, another parallel.</p>
        <p>While the father refrained from deposing Saddam Hussein, fearing the chaos that might ensue, the son was implacable about pursuing exactly this course.</p>
        <p>In both cases, subsequent events have amply demonstrated that the father had much sounder judgment in foreign policy than the son.</p>
