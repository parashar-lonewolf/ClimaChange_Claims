        <p>THE latest word on the greenhouse effect, from a National Academy of Sciences panel headed by Daniel Evans, a former Governor of Washington, will surely not be the last. But the panel's report, somnolently titled "Policy Implications of Global Warming," is surely a breakthrough -- the first to bridge the canyon between alarmist science and what-me-worry economics.</p>
        <p>The academy's synthesis can be summed up briefly as concluding that human adaption to warmer weather will likely be relatively painless. Outlined in 113 reader-friendly pages, the argument won't quite convince end-of-nature types to bed down with those looking forward to palm trees in Buffalo. Still, it is a safe bet that the report's approach, which one Bush Administration analyst dubbed a "no regrets" policy, will carry the establishment's imprimatur for some time to come.</p>
        <p>Reduced to its journalistic essence, "no regrets" goes something like this:</p>
        <p>Atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFC refrigeration chemicals) are rising rapidly; projecting current trends, concentrations will be double their pre-industrial level by the year 2050. That virtually guarantees the planet will trap more solar energy and the earth will grow warmer.</p>
        <p>But the plausible range of temperature change is as little as 2 degrees Fahrenheit to as much as 9. And even if the figure could be pinned down, it would not tell us much about the ensuing environmental and economic damage or the difficulty of adaptation. In agriculture, for example, hard-to-predict shifts in rainfall are likely to have far greater consequences than the direct effect of hotter summers.</p>
        <p>Gradual weather change would probably prove only an expensive headache for humans. Tens of millions of Americans, after all, have coped with far more dramatic shifts in their voluntary move to the Sun Belt. But there is some possibility of discontinuous, catastrophic change -- for example, a huge release of methane from the melting Arctic tundra that turned the cornfields of Iowa into a desert in a single generation. And there is little doubt that thousands of marine and plant species would be decimated by even a gradual warming.</p>
        <p>What to do? The panel's "no regrets" strategy starts with emissions-reducing initiatives that would pay for themselves in greater economic efficiency. High on this list is energy conservation for buildings, vehicles and industrial processes.</p>
        <p>But the panel, which included experts ranging from Stephen Schneider, a Government climatologist, to William Nordhaus, a Yale economist, would go further, buying a little insurance against an unexpectedly rainy (or, more likely, a very dry) day. This would surely include spending money to develop greenhouse-benevolent energy technologies that will be on the shelf and relatively affordable if they are needed. And it would probably also include reducing greenhouse emissions where there are only modest net costs. Prime targets: an accelerated phase-out of CFC's, which are damaging the ozone layer as well as warming the planet; a big effort to save tropical rain forests, which support diverse life forms as well as storing carbon.</p>
        <p>"No regrets" looks like good politics as well as good policy. While every politician wants a piece of the righteous turf on this biggest of all environmental causes, few are eager to ask the voters to take the bus to work or shiver in their sweaters until the dangers are much clearer. But the approach may not prove as uncontroversial as it first appears.</p>
        <p>Much of the energy-saving that the panel believes would pay for itself would require a fairly heavy regulatory hand. The report, for example, calls for higher mileage standards for cars -- a move the Bush Administration has already declared to be veto bait. One must wonder, too, how the idea of testing a new generation of nuclear reactors would appeal to Congress.</p>
        <p>But the panel's most problematic recommendations may be those it treats most lightly: the imperative for international cooperation. At very least that translates as aggressive support for population control in the third world. But it could also take money -- lots of money -- to induce poor countries to think greenhouse when they think economic development.</p>
        <p>China, for example, now emits just 7 percent of the greenhouse gas created by human activity. But it emits six times as much the United States per dollar's worth of G.N.P. and a remarkable 18 times as much as Japan. Thus if Chinese living standards ever approach those of the West without radical improvements in energy efficiency and a technological overhaul of agriculture, the greenhouse game will be as good as lost.</p>
