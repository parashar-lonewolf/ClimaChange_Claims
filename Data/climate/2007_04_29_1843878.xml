        <p>Terror Watch List Criticized  Arab-American organizations are demanding Congressional oversight of the terrorist watch list system, citing cases of citizens who have been stopped at the border, fingerprinted, searched and handcuffed time and time again without being given a reason.</p>
        <p>PAGE 25</p>
        <p>A Governor Often Absent  Since taking office last year, Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey has traveled outside the state far more than his recent predecessors -- nearly once in every four days.</p>
        <p>PAGE 29</p>
        <p>Scope of the Steroid Case  After a former Mets employee admitted selling steroids to professional baseball players, documents suggest that the federal investigation is far from over.</p>
        <p>SPORTSSUNDAY</p>
        <p>Bomber Kills 28 in Pakistan  A suicide attacker detonated a bomb as Pakistan's interior minister finished a speech in the country's northwest, killing 28 people. The minister suffered minor wounds.</p>
        <p>PAGE 14</p>
        <p>Sit, Roll Over, Don't Speak!  In dog-crazy New York, renters and buyers are having to pay more to find apartments that will accept their pets, and buildings are demanding better manners.</p>
        <p>REAL ESTATE</p>
        <p>The Carbon Diet  Is the carbon-neutral movement to fight greenhouse gases a gimmick? Some environmentalists say it builds support, while others say it just makes us feel good.</p>
        <p>WEEK IN REVIEW</p>
        <p>Big Day for N.F.L. Draft  As expected, JaMarcus Russell, a quarterback from Louisiana State, was the first overall pick in the N.F.L. draft, going to the Oakland Raiders. Not so expected was the fall of Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn, taken 22nd by the Cleveland Browns.</p>
        <p>SPORTSSUNDAY</p>
        <p>Trip With Nicholas D. Kristof  The Times columnist announces the student and the teacher who have won a contest to accompany him on his travels.</p>
