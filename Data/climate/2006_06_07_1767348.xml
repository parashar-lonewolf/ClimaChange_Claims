        <p>Most people would be surprised to know that shallow water corals encompass only 35 percent of the world's coral species. In fact, most do not need sunlight and exist in both cold and warm regions, including the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Pacific.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Move to Save Coral Reefs'' (editorial, June 5) correctly highlights the need to protect shallow water corals from damage by pollution, fishing boats and global warming.</p>
        <p>Most people would be surprised to know that shallow water corals encompass only 35 percent of the world's coral species. In fact, most do not need sunlight and exist in both cold and warm regions, including the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Pacific.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, they share the predicament of their shallow-water counterparts, and are being destroyed at an alarming rate because of commercial fishing, which trawls and dredges the sea floor in search of fish and shellfish.</p>
        <p>Congress and government agencies must work to protect world-renowned and fragile shallow-water coral reefs in Florida and other popular tropical getaways.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, scientists are calling for laws to protect their lesser known but equally amazing relatives that form deep-sea coral forests off the coast of New York, Massachusetts, Florida and even Alaska.</p>
        <p>Having two coral species on the endangered species list is a wake-up call for all of these fragile ocean animals.</p>
