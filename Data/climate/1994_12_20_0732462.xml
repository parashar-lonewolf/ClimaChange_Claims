        <p>DURING the first two years of its operation, the most accurate system ever devised for measuring changes in global sea level has discerned a steady rise of more than three millimeters, or about one-tenth of an inch, a year. It may not sound like much, but if this trend continues for another few years, scientists say, it will be solid evidence that the earth is undergoing a long-term warming trend, probably related to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Older and less reliable data had strongly suggested that global atmospheric and ocean temperatures were rising, but doubts about the reliability of these measurements had lingered until now; the new satellite measurements enormously improve the precision and reliability of such estimates.</p>
        <p>It is possible, scientists concede, that the present trend might reverse at some point. But if the seas continue to rise from one decade to the next, a time will come when entire countries, Bangladesh and the Netherlands among them, are inundated.</p>
        <p>The satellite sea level data were presented this month at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, at which about 70 papers described results obtained by the Topex/Poseidon satellite, a joint French-American project designed to study ocean circulation patterns. (Topex is an acronym for topographic experiment.) The rate of sea level increase measured by the satellite's radar altimeter, powered by a gigantic array of solar panels, "is in reasonable agreement with tide gauge results," according to Dr. R. Steven Nerem of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
        <p>The traditional method of measuring sea level uses mechanical tide gauges placed in harbors and other coastal sites, from which readings are averaged. But Dr. Lee-lung Fu of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., the project scientist of the Topex/Poseidon project, said that tide gauges are too widely spaced and too few to provide reliable data for the earth's oceans. The satellite, by contrast, makes about 500,000 sea level measurements a day, each of them at a different place and each precise to within two inches. Because the instrument makes so many measurements, local sea level variations caused by wind, tides and other factors are averaged out, he said.</p>
        <p>The satellite covers all oceans lying between 66 degrees north and south latitudes, omitting only the ice-covered polar regions. The satellite returns to the same point along its global-blanketing track every 10 days.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fu and other participants in the project acknowledge that two years of observations cannot prove the existence of long-term climate trends. Nevertheless, these observations corroborate the trend of sea level measurements made over the last century using tide gauges. The mean rate of sea level rise determined by the satellite is roughly what would be expected from global warming, Dr. Nerem said.</p>
        <p>Global warming is thought to cause rising seas for two reasons: the thermal expansion of liquid water and the melting of glaciers and polar ice. Approximate measurements over the decades have shown a strong correlation between estimates of global sea level and global temperature. Although some scientists have challenged such estimates as possibly short-term aberrations rather than long-term trends, evidence has mounted in recent years that a long-term warming trend is in progress.</p>
        <p>Because of a gigantic perturbation of ocean currents in the Southern Hemisphere called El Nino, which occurs about once every four years, the rate of temperature increase (and sea level rise) is periodically reversed, and a graph of rising global temperature looks more like an upward-tilting saw blade than a straight line. "I expect that the Topex/Poseidon satellite will observe a decline in mean sea level next year because of El Nino, and that thereafter, the sea level will rise again," Dr. Nerem said. "When El Nino episodes are included, the mean annual rise in sea level will probably be something like one or two millimeters a year."</p>
        <p>Ocean circulation plays a vital role as the earth's heat engine, Dr. Fu said, serving as a kind of flywheel for storing and dispensing the energy that drives global climate. The instruments aboard the Topex/Poseidon satellite provide a new perspective on the flywheel's operation, he said.</p>
        <p>The Topex/Poseidon satellite was launched on Aug. 10, 1992, by a French Ariane rocket, and it circles the earth at an altitude of 829.7 miles. The United States' financial contribution to the project was $480 million and the French was $220 million. Scientists hope the system will operate for at least six years.</p>
        <p>"We'd love to get data that include two El Nino events to average into our measurements," Dr. Nerem said.</p>
        <p>"But the important thing is that for the first time, climate modelers are getting data that are precise enough to reveal the subtle signatures of global change." he added. "In another few years we'll have a pretty good idea of the true rate of sea level rise, something that interests a lot of people besides scientists."</p>
