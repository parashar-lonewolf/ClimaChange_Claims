Many large industrial countries said they were likely to ratify the agreement, including Japan, Canada, Russia, and Australia, which had hesitated after President Bush rejected the treaty last March.</p>

        <p>Somalia Faces Terror Charges  Somalia's weak government has vowed to root out terrorism and says it takes seriously American allegations that fundamentalists inside Somalia have aided Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.

        <p>Some Animal Rights Groups Are Stepping Up Protests  Many mainstream animal rights organizations have scaled back their activism since Sept. 11, but more radical groups have not. In recent weeks they have firebombed a federal corral for wild horses, raided a mink ranch and set fire to a primate research laboratory.</p>

        <p>Shadow of 70's Crisis Hangs Over City Again  A combination of the slowing economy, the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the impact of the attacks on the World Trade Center has raised the specter of New York City enduring another period of austerity much like that of the 1970's, though comparisons are elusive.</p>

        <p>City Will Drop Charges  Charges against all but one of the firefighters arrested during a raucous demonstration at ground zero on Nov. 2 will be dropped, city officials said, in a gesture to help restore the close relationship forged between police officers and firefighters in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. The move comes in the midst of a continuing struggle between firefighters and the city over how many firefighters should be permitted at the World Trade Center site to help search for the remains of their colleagues, 343 of whom died in the disaster.</p>
