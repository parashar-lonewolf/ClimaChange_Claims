        <p>LEAD: There is a closet in John Illick's house where a wood stove used to be.

        <p>LEAD: There is a closet in John Illick's house where a wood stove used to be. For seven years, he and his wife, Beth, burned wood for primary heat in the long winters here, for economic and esthetic reasons. But the appeal began to wear thin. ''Wood is dirty and it's a lot of work,'' said Mr. Illick, who is a vice president at the Bread Loaf Construction Company.</p>
        <p>There is a closet in John Illick's house where a wood stove used to be. For seven years, he and his wife, Beth, burned wood for primary heat in the long winters here, for economic and esthetic reasons. But the appeal began to wear thin. ''Wood is dirty and it's a lot of work,'' said Mr. Illick, who is a vice president at the Bread Loaf Construction Company. ''I got sick of vacuuming up the dirt and dust and bugs all the time! You end up jamming your fingers in the stove while you're loading it and swearing a lot. My daughter, Adrienne, tripped and burned her face on it.''</p>
        <p>When the Illicks renovated their house two years ago, the stove went.</p>
        <p>There was a time after the Arab oil embargo when wood seemed the answer, when many Vermonters had more time than money, when ''renewable resources'' was the battle cry.</p>
        <p>But that was before doctors warned of the respiratory hazards of wood smoke and states began to regulate wood-stove emissions. It was also a time when oil prices were high.</p>
        <p>''When the price of oil and other fuels started to go back down, wood was no longer a tremendous cost saving,'' said Mr. Illick. ''If the price of oil went back up, would I go back to wood? Well, there's a closet there now, so it's a moot point.''</p>
        <p>The Green Mountain Power Corporation surveyed its customers this year and found that only 16 percent used wood as the primary source of heat, as against 33 percent five years ago.</p>
        <p>Figures compiled by the state's Conservation and Renewable Energy Unit indicate that Vermonters, over all, burned 323,000 cords of wood in the 1987-88 heating season, 36 percent less than the 503,000 cords of the 1981-82 season.</p>
        <p>''While the state is still actively promoting the use of wood, it's true that fewer and fewer people are using it,'' said Stuart Slote, the wood specialist for the state agency.</p>
        <p>Stephen Morris, vice president for sales and marketing of Vermont Castings Inc., a wood-stove manufacturer, has seen many competitors go out of business. He said Vermont Castings has stayed afloat, has in fact grown by expanding its market overseas and emphasizing the smaller, fancier stoves that appeal to owners of second homes. ''The market has moved upscale to enameled, highly efficient models,'' he said. ''A lot of people who used to burn wood for primary heat are becoming recreational wood burners.''</p>
        <p>Roger Mann Jr. has been in the wood business in Waterville for 15 years. As the price of diesel fuel, chain saws and log skidders has gone up, so has his price for a cord of wood - ''$85 in the country and a city fee when I deliver around Burlington.'' He travels as much as 300 miles a day, making three round trips to Burlington.</p>
        <p>''In the early 80's,'' he said, ''I'd take my customers a load of logs, and they'd have a chain saw and a splitter to cut it up. Now they want their wood already split. I see a lot of splitters and chain saws just sitting in the corner. They're expensive pieces of equipment.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, wood still has its fans. Robert Sherman, a lobbyist who lives in Washington, Vt., owns 400 acres and burns about eight cords of wood a year to heat his house. ''I love to cut wood,'' he said. ''It's great exercise. I love being in the woods and cutting it and splitting it - the whole process. I also love the fact that you never have to worry what the thermostat is set at.''</p>
        <p>More typical is Rodney Morris, a teacher. Once, when he wanted heat, he would wad newspapers, pile kindling on top of them and chunks of wood on top of that. Sometimes the wood was dry. More often it wasn't. It would splutter and steam before it caught. He couldn't travel in the winter: his pipes might freeze and burst.</p>
        <p>''I was tired of water all over the floor from the melting ice because I never had my wood under cover,'' he said. ''I was tired of competing with the stove for the available oxygen in the house. The last straw was realizing how many burn holes there were in the linoleum in front of the stove.'' Now he has a propane heater. Just turn the dial.</p>
