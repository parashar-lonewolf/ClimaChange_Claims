        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Information Council on the Environment, financed by the National Coal Association, and Citizens for Sensible Control of Acid Rain, financed by more than a dozen of the country's dirtiest power plants, are misleading the public with their "Wise Use" movement.</p>
        <p>The "Wise Use" movement has grasped onto a concept known as "takings" to stop the progress of pro-environment legislation.</p>
        <p>Anti-environmentalists and big business have expanded the notion of "takings," or just compensation, so that taxpayers would have to pay every time a regulation directly limits the value of property.</p>
        <p>For example, a company dumps toxic waste into a river, violating pollution standards. The Environmental Protection Agency then forces the company to stop dumping. Because the company would have to spend money retooling its plant to reduce toxic emissions, the dollar value for the use of the land decreases.</p>
        <p>Under this definition of "takings," the Government (that is, the taxpayer) must pay the company the money "lost" when the regulations devalued its land, even though the regulation protects the public interest.</p>
        <p>This radical interpretation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees "just compensation" when the Government confiscates private property, is very misleading and should not be adopted. RICHARD SCHUCKMAN  Fair Lawn, N.J., April 15, 1994</p>
