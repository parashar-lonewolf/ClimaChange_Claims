        <p>EVER since Neanderthals were discovered nearly a century and a half ago, they have been seen as something less than fully human. Their bones suggest that they were beetle-browed, squat, thick-boned, heavily muscled and incredibly strong, with short forearms and shinbones, a face pulled so far forward that the chin disappears, a side-to-side gait and a grip that might break a person's fingers.</p>
        <p>But anthropologists now believe that Neanderthals closely approached the earliest modern humans in intellect and level of culture, and in some regions may even have equaled them.</p>
        <p>Were Neanderthals our ancestors or an evolutionary dead end?</p>
        <p>Debate is flaring once more over the relationship between modern humans and Neanderthals in the period between 200,000 and 35,000 years ago, when the Neanderthals lived. One school of thought, led by Dr. Christopher B. Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, holds that Neanderthals were driven to extinction and replaced by modern humans who originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago. Another school, led by Dr. Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan, argues that modern humans evolved from Neanderthals in Europe and from other archaic species of Homo sapiens in other parts of the Old World.</p>
        <p>Everyone agrees that the earliest ancestors of both Neanderthals and modern humans appeared in Africa at least 5 million years ago. Eventually they evolved into a pre-human creature called Homo erectus, which migrated out of Africa into the rest of the Old World. Separate populations of Homo erectus then evolved in different places into the various archaic versions of Homo sapiens, including the Neanderthals of Europe. The argument over Neanderthals' relationship to modern humans is about what happened after that.</p>
        <p>Some of the latest evidence bearing on the debate is to be examined at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago this Saturday.</p>
        <p>In Dr. Stringer's view, anatomically modern humans evolved from an archaic form of Homo sapiens in Africa and then, about 100,000 years ago, swept out of Africa to colonize Europe, Asia and eventually the rest of the world. There was little or no interbreeding between the moderns and archaic forms of Homo sapiens like the Neanderthals, in his view.</p>
        <p>But the takeover by the modern humans was probably not a conquest or genocide. "There was no holocaust," said Dr. Stringer."It would have been an economic competition" for food and other resources, "one in which the Neanderthals gradually lost out." The replacement took thousands of years, he says, because the Neanderthals and moderns were so closely matched intellectually and culturally; otherwise, it would have happened much more rapidly.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wolpoff, on the other hand, says Neanderthals were ancestors of modern Europeans, although the evolving Europeans of that era may have interbred with their counterparts in other regions. Dr. Wolpoff and those who support him cite archeological evidence from central Europe that, they say, shows that the earliest modern humans there had some clearly Neanderthal features.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, says the Wolpoff school, the evolution of modern humans was more complicated than Dr. Stringer would have it, taking different paths and twists in different parts of the Old World. In Israel, they say, where Neanderthals overlapped with early moderns for about 50,000 years, the two populations were intellectual and cultural equals.  "Their behavior was the same," said Dr. Wolpoff. "If you saw this any other time you'd say these were two races in contact" rather than separate species.</p>
        <p>Scientists have been arguing about Neanderthals since the discovery of a partial skull in a cave in the Neander Valley of Germany in 1856. The latest phase of the debate began in the mid-1980's, when genetic analysis suggested that modern humans first appeared in Africa and then spread out from there.</p>
        <p>The genetic findings were based on an analysis of DNA contained in the mitochondria, tiny structures that generate energy for body cells and which are inherited, via the ovum, only through the female line. Using this technique to draw up a family tree of modern human populations, scientists at the University of California at Berkeley calculated that the earliest modern humans emerged from Africa about 200,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stringer and others who believe Neanderthals were an evolutionary dead end say that the modern humans spread from Africa into the Near East, and thence to the rest of the world. The remains of early modern humans found in both Africa and Israel, about 100,000 years old, are "what I consider to be genuine modern humans," Dr. Stringer said. "If you look for modern humans in other parts of the world, there is no evidence until 40,000 years ago or less."</p>
        <p>Last June, French scientists reported that a Neanderthal skeleton discovered near the village of Saint-Cesaire, north of Bordeaux, was about 36,000 years old. Dr. Stringer interprets this to mean that modern humans and Neanderthals must have coexisted in Europe for thousands of years. Contribution Called 'Negligible'</p>
        <p>If there was any interbreeding between moderns and European Neanderthals, he says, it was insignificant. "The Neanderthal contribution to the evolution of modern people is negligible," he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stringer says modern humans did not supplant Neanderthals by conquering or killing them, just that they had an edge in technological or demographic competition, even though the tools found at Saint-Cesaire suggest that later Neanderthals were almost as accomplished as moderns. "I believe the Neanderthals did lose out because they were inferior, but I don't see them as being massively inferior," said Dr. Stringer. "Otherwise, they would have lost out much sooner."</p>
        <p>Ezra Zubrow, an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo, has calculated that a rise of even 2 percent in the mortality rate of Neanderthals, caused by disease, perhaps, or lack of food, could have led to their extinction in only 1,000 years, or 30 generations. The shape of the Neanderthals' upper respiratory tract, which evolved to aid nasal breathing in a cold, dry climate, may have predisposed them to serious respiratory infections, putting them at further disadvantage, says Dr. Jeffrey T. Laitman, an anthropologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. The Neanderthal larynx was higher than that of modern humans, Dr. Laitman believes, limiting the Neanderthals' ability to speak.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stringer has written that Neanderthals were gradually displaced to environments where food supplies were less reliable and "where their dwindling numbers would have suffered greater attrition from the vagaries of fluctuating climates and food supplies, as well as disease," adding, "The Neanderthals probably went out with a whimper, not a bang." Using Fossil Records</p>
        <p>Dr. Wolpoff and his colleagues argue that Dr. Stringer's ideas, however elegant, are contradicted by the fossil record. Abundant evidence from central Europe, they say, establishes that early modern humans still displayed many traits that are clearly Neanderthal in character, and therefore evolved from them. Many early modern skulls, for example, display a tell-tale bone near the place where the mandibular nerve enters the jaw. The bone is a well-established characteristic of Neanderthal skulls, says Dr. David Frayer, a physical anthropologist at the University of Kansas. Another marker seen in both is the space between the third molar and the jaw.</p>
        <p>In addition, says Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern Illinois University, the backs of most Neanderthal skulls look "as if a little bun were stuck there." Skulls of early modern humans found in Czechoslovakia also display this feature. But it is found in neither the Neanderthals nor the early moderns in Israel. "How did the earliest modern humans in Eastern Europe get it unless they got it from Neanderthals?" Dr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>In the past, said Dr. Frayer, scientists have compared Neanderthals with modern skeletons no older than 100 to 300 years, concluding that there was a huge anatomical gap between Neanderthals and all modern humans. "We're going to be showing at the Chicago meeting that the gap isn't that great," he said.</p>
        <p>Neanderthals and early moderns who coexisted in Israel, 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, are said to display an especially striking cultural similarity. "Their archeology is so identical, it's shocking," said Dr. Wolpoff.  They made the same kinds of tools, using the same techniques. They hunted and butchered the same animals in the same way. They buried their dead in the same manner, with the same artifacts.</p>
        <p>As for the European Neanderthals, Dr. Wolpoff suggests that they followed a separate evolutionary course from those of the Near East. They might have differed as, for instance, a modern Swede and a modern Iranian differ. And in fact, their skeletons, while clearly of the Neanderthal type, differ in some details from those of their European counterparts.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wolpoff and his allies question the reliability of the mitochondrial DNA studies that bolster Dr. Stringer's ideas. Some critics say that the DNA analysis assumes that evolution takes place in the minumum number of steps possible, but that there is no reason to believe it actually operates so tidily and efficiently. The exodus of modern humans from Africa may have occurred far earlier, in their view, than the DNA analysis implies.</p>
        <p>A number of anthropologists believe the truth may lie somewhere between the two schools of thought.  Dr. Smith, for one, believes that although modern Europeans evolved in large measure from Neanderthals, other early moderns from elsewhere, including Africa, probably moved into Europe and interbred with the evolving Europeans.</p>
        <p>Why were the Neanderthals in Europe for so long, only to fade out? Dr. Smith proposes what he calls "a possible scenario."</p>
        <p>Neanderthals' physical characteristics, he suggests, enabled them to adapt well to the cold of ice-age Europe. The most recent ice age lasted from about 120,000 to about 18,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began a gradual withdrawal. The Neanderthals had large babies, and size helps babies survive cold better.  From an adaptation standpoint, the other physical characteristics of Neanderthals may have been secondary.</p>
        <p>During a warm interlude in the last Ice Age, Dr. Smith's scenario continues, early modern people from elsewere, lacking the Neanderthals' physical adaptation to cold, drifted into Europe and interbred with its Neanderthal population. The Ice Age reasserted itself for a time, but by then the surviving popluation had developed better clothing, more efficient fires and better houses to withstand the cold.</p>
        <p>A robust body adapted to cold became less important and even a liability because it required more energy. As the generations passed, the human population lost its Neanderthal features under the culling of natural selection.</p>
        <p>But while the Neanderthal physical type disappeared, Dr. Smith says, the breed "did not go extinct in the classical sense." Rather, he said, Neanderthal genes live on today in Europeans and those who, like most Americans, trace their lineage to Europe.</p>
