        <p>STEM-CELL DEBATE DEEPENS -- President Bush's veto of legislation to expand federal funds for embryonic stem-cell research has had the unintended effect of drawing state money into the field and moving the debate into election campaigns across the country. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>STYMIED IN GENEVA -- Talks aimed at reaching a new global trade agreement collapsed, touching off recriminations between the United States and Europe over farm trade barriers and dealing a blow to the Bush administration's international economic agenda. [A1.]</p>
        <p>LARGEST LEVERAGED BUYOUT -- HCA, the for-profit hospital company, agreed to sell itself to three private equity firms and the family of Senator Bill Frist, the company's founders. The deal is the largest leveraged buyout in history, eclipsing the $30.6 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989. The buyout trend is expected to continue. [A1.]</p>
        <p>60 AND OUT -- Nearing the company's mandatory retirement age of 60, BMW's chief, Helmut Panke, introduced his successor, Norbert Reithofer, left, even as he suggested that the retirement age for senior executives had become outdated. But Mr. Panke did not contest the rule. [C3.]</p>
        <p>TAKING THEIR CHANCES -- Gamblers anywhere in the world can use the Internet to place wagers on sporting events and play casino games. Although the recent arrest of the chief executive of BetOnSports made headlines, few experts expect the crackdown to do anything more than dent the industry. [C1.]</p>
        <p>SCANT PAYDAY FOR A HIT -- When a movie takes in $180 million around the world, one would suppose that the people who created the film would become very rich. But with ''Crash,'' the Oscar winner for best picture of 2005 and a sleeper hit at the box office, that has not been the case. [E1.]</p>
        <p>VISTA ON THE HORIZON -- Video-game enthusiasts are likely to welcome the Vista operating system from Microsoft, replacing Windows for PC's. But to judge from a test of an early version, Microsoft still has some critical work to do. [E3.]</p>
        <p>SEARCH FOR THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT -- With more than 80 companies under investigation concerning stock options, it is unclear where the line of criminality will be drawn. The vast majority of cases may wind up being civil matters. [C1.]</p>
        <p>WINNING WHILE LOSING -- Stock options made Gregory L. Reyes, the former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, very rich, and now it is abuse of options that may send him to prison. He and the company are prime examples of how executives can enrich themselves even while many public shareholders -- and the company itself -- lose money. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BIG PHARMA GAINS -- Medicare prescription coverage is fueling profits in the pharmaceutical industry, and the revival continued as Merck and Schering-Plough reported second-quarter profits that were well ahead of analysts' expectations. [C1.]</p>
        <p>DOUBT ON A.M.D. DEAL -- Advanced Micro Devices's $5.4 billion offer for the graphics chip maker ATI Technologies received negative reaction from Wall Street analysts and investors, partly because of the debt financing involved. A.M.D.'s shares fell 4.76 percent, to $17.39, while. ATI's shares closed at $22.44, up 19.6 percent. A.M.D. hopes the merger will propel the company into the consumer products market, where growth is projected to remain strong as PC sales slow. [C3.]</p>
        <p>WILTING IN THE HEAT -- Days of prolonged heat and humidity have driven demand for electricity to record highs in California and other states. Transformers and other equipment shorted out and left tens of thousands of people without power. [A14.]</p>
        <p>DANGER AT THE EDGES -- A group of climate experts contends that the debate over global warming is a distraction from the severity of the hurricane problem facing the United States and its risky coastal developments. [F2.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>ONLINE: DEALBOOK -- A report on mergers and acquisitions, up-to-the-minute news on Wall Street and a look at the behind-the-scenes maneuvering is at nytimes.com/dealbook.</p>
        <p>ANNE FRANK 2006 -- Bloggers in Israel and Lebanon are using the Internet to give the world a first-hand look at the conflict in the Middle East. A report is at nytimes.com/technology.</p>
        <p>A MAN IN A HURRY -- The Times' Micheline Maynard talks about the latest move by Carlos Ghosn, head of Nissan and Renault, on a proposed alliance with G.M., in an audio report at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>THOSE ECLECTIC ELECTRICS -- Over the years some electric cars have managed to break through and captivate more than a few daring consumers. A slide show is at nytimes.com/automobiles.</p>
