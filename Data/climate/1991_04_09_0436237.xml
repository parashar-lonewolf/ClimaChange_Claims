        <p>THE life-protecting ozone shield in the high atmosphere has weakened by up to 5 percent since 1978 under the influence of industrial chemicals. That conclusion, based on direct satellite measurements, was announced last week by the Environmental Protection Agency, along with its calculations that many more Americans are now likely to die of skin cancer because of the higher doses of ultra-violet radiation that the weakened shield will let through.</p>
        <p>How much worse will it get?</p>
        <p>The most important industrial chemicals that chew up the ozone layer are known as chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's. Used ubiquitously as solvents and to transfer heat in air conditioners and refrigerators, the CFC's take years to waft up from ground level to the height of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Although many years of CFC's are thus in the pipeline, the end of the steady increase in destructive chemicals that reach the high atmosphere may be in sight. Concentrations in the atmosphere will continue to grow until the end of the century, reaching a peak 12 to 30 percent above present levels, scientists say, and then start to subside. Once fewer CFC's reach the ozone layer, the shield should start to recover, regaining full strength after a century or so.</p>
        <p>This forecast assumes that the world's industrialized nations will stand behind the pledge they made at a meeting in London last June to halt the production of CFC's and other related chemicals, like halons, methyl chloride and carbon tetrachloride.  Industrialized countries vowed to eliminate production of these chemicals by the end of the century, and developing countries by 2010.</p>
        <p>The pledges were made after less stringent deadlines, adopted in Montreal in 1987, were later found inadequate to meet the threat. Taking It Seriously</p>
        <p>It is uncertain how much more damage to the ozone layer will result before the new controls take effect.  "We really don't know," said Eileen Claussen, an ozone specialist at the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued last week's report. Earlier attempts to forecast ozone depletion, based on mathematical models, were proved so inaccurate by events that "basically, we have thrown out the models," Ms. Claussen said.</p>
        <p>Despite the uncertainty, or perhaps because of it, health authorities are re-emphasizing the need for protection from the sun. "There's no question that the ozone problem is really a problem that's not going to go away," said Dr. Clark Heath, chief epidemiologist for the American Cancer Society. "One should take sun exposure seriously, particularly in the middle of the day."</p>
        <p>Ultraviolet radiation of a particular frequency, called UV-B, causes skin cancer and eye cataracts, and impairs the human immune system as well. Biologists fear that higher fluxes of UV-B would also at some point damage plants, crops and the phytoplankton in the ocean that are the basis of ocean food chains.</p>
        <p>Dr. Heath advised people to avoid the sun in the middle of the day and to wear hats, don a sunscreen lotion and protective clothing such as long sleeves when they are exposed to the sun's rays. He said it was unclear at what point the ozone-depletion issue would become severe enough for the cancer society to develop more detailed suggestions.</p>
        <p>Some pioneering countries have undertaken concerted public campaigns to get people to adopt good sun habits. In New Zealand, where ozone-depleted air from the wintertime ozone "hole" over Antarctica has been detected, the public campaign is aimed at getting people to abandon the ideal of a suntanned body. Children there are encouraged to wear cotton sunhats with protective visors and protective flaps in back. And they are urged, for instance, to sit under a tree when eating lunch in the playground. Television advertisements and posters extol the virtues of covering up. Findings Called Stunning</p>
        <p>Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency reported that in addition to the Antarctic ozone hole, the ozone layer had been depleted in many other parts of the world. At the mid-latitudes where the United States is situated, it reported, the loss over the last decade was twice as great as had been suspected. The agency said the declines, measured in the late fall, winter and early spring, amounted to 4.5 to 5 percent over the decade. William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. adminstrator, called the findings stunning, unexpected and disturbing.</p>
        <p>The same findings applied to the entire Northern Hemisphere temperate zone, with depletions growing more severe the farther one proceeds toward the North Pole. Even larger depletions were found in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>The findings were based on measurements made by special instruments aboard satellites, and scientists say that they were consistent with direct measurements of UV-B increases detected by different instruments at widely scattered ground stations in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>The measurements found no significant ozone depletion in the tropics. But because there is more sunlight in the tropics naturally, UV-B levels remain higher than in the mid-latitudes, even with greater ozone depletion in the mid-latitudes. Likewise, summertime UV-B exposure in the United States remains higher than that in the winter, even though ozone is more depleted in the winter.</p>
        <p>But this is no cause for comfort, scientists say, since people and other organisms in the mid-latitudes are experiencing unaccustomed UV-B levels. "Organisms in the mid-latitudes have not adapted themselves" said Dr. Mark Schoeberl, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which made the satellite measurements. No Split in Washington</p>
        <p>Although scientists are uncertain about the future severity of ozone depletion, they have come to a confident consensus on the essential scientific nature of the threat. Largely because of this consensus, there has been no factional argument within the Bush Administration on either the science of ozone depletion or the need to halt the production of the destructive chemicals. By contrast, the infinitely more complex, uncertain and expensive proposition of dealing with the threat of global warming has caused considerable divisions in Washington.</p>
        <p>Molecules of ozone-destroying chemicals, when released, spend most of their time -- up to 100 years in the case of CFCs -- below the stratosphere, said Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland of the University of California at Irvine who, along with Dr. Mario Molina, first reported that they destroy ozone. When a molecule reaches the stratosphere, he said, "it gets zapped by ultraviolet radiation, and chlorine is released, and that atom eats up 100,000 molecules of ozone." Eventually, it degrades, and that ends the process.</p>
        <p>Ozone is constantly being created naturally, but this natural replenishment is incapable of keeping up with the destruction of ozone by the chlorine. Since ozone also blocks the penetration of UV-B to the earth, the chlorine weakens the shield.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rowland says concentrations of another ozone-destroying chemical, methyl chloride, have remained constant, and it is believed a natural constituent of the atmosphere. Including methyl chloride, he said, atmospheric concentrations of the destructive chemicals have increased to 4 parts per billion in 1991 from .8 part per billion, or just above natural levels, in 1950.</p>
        <p>He forecasts an additional rise of .5 parts per billion by around the turn of the century, followed by a steady decline, if the controls pledged last year in London take effect as planned. That would be an increase of 12.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. forecasts a similar trend, generally speaking.</p>
