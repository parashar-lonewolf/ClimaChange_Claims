      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Dr. Jerri Nielsen went to the South Pole looking for solitude.</p>
        <p>When she first gets off the plane in Antarctica in ''Ice Bound: A Woman's Survival at the South Pole,'' she feels a little dizzy (the altitude), but takes a good look at the expanse of ice and snow and announces: ''Total peace and quiet. That's what I came for.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Nielsen gets just the opposite. Having signed on as the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station's ''winter doctor,'' she quickly learns that the station offers no privacy or luxuries. (She soon becomes accustomed to men urinating in front of her and is resigned to taking only two very short showers a week.) Then, just as she has settled in and made friends, she realizes she has breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Susan Sarandon, who plays Dr. Nielsen, keeps getting better and better. Twelve years after she set the standard for lovable feminist role models in ''Thelma and Louise'' and seven years after her Oscar for best actress for ''Dead Man Walking,'' she shines in good films and lifts unexceptional ones to otherwise impossible heights. ''Ice Bound,'' which has its premiere on CBS on Sunday night, is worthy, sensible drama, but it would be flimsy stuff without her.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nielsen, who did have breast surgery after her return to the United States, recently said she was not happy with the film. In an article in The Globe and Mail in Toronto, she said she would have preferred to have Meryl Streep play her, that Ms. Sarandon's portrayal was too dour. But then, Dr. Nielsen is probably too close to the story to recognize Ms. Sarandon's brilliance, especially in the scene in which she tells her colleagues about the tumor, desperately trying to be lighthearted, and the one in which she endures three attempts to inject the biopsy needle into her breast properly and finally does it herself. Without anesthetic.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nielsen has also said that the point of her story (told in her 2001 book, ''Ice Bound''), which is ''friendship and community are everything,'' doesn't come across in the film. She is completely mistaken on that count.</p>
        <p>If you read the news reports of Dr. Nielsen's experience in 1999 -- accounts of the breast self-examination that led to the diagnosis, the teleconferencing consultations with a doctor in the United States, the chemotherapy and hormonal treatments, the eventual air lift -- it was easy to form a mental image of a woman completely alone in a half-dark room at the end of the world, bravely pushing her way through the panic.</p>
        <p>In CBS's ''Ice Bound,'' the image is of a community of loving, selfless, devoted friends who will do anything they can to help. Dr. Nielsen is portrayed as stubbornly independent at first, but she evolves into a paragon of cooperation and interdependence as the months pass, changed by her polar experience.</p>
        <p>She is probably exploring the spiritual side of life there, too. One patient, who refuses drugs for his migraines, advises her: ''You've got to run toward what scares you, Doc. It's the only reason we're here.'' A recycling expert instructs her to ''Use less than you need and give more than you have.''</p>
        <p>Even the American doctor gets into the mood, reciting a few lines of Veronica A. Shoffstall's poetry: ''And you begin to accept your defeats/with your head up and your eyes ahead/with the grace of a woman, not the grief of a child.'' You can't blame people for feeling inspired in a place that has one sunrise a year and three shades of twilight. (But that doesn't explain the effect on the American doctor, who is in Indiana.)</p>
        <p>Actually, life at the pole looks festive. The film shows people mostly at their nighttime hangout, dancing, drinking, gambling and laughing it up rather than carrying out their studies in astronomy, ecology, climate change, marine biology and the like during the day.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers have shown admirable restraint in not inventing a torrid love affair for Dr. Nielsen, but there is eye contact, not to mention smiling and dancing. The man in question is Big John Penny (Aidan Devine), called Big, with whom the doctor also shares tender feelings and heart-to-heart talks. Sometimes these romantic friendships, like Sally Field and Ron Liebman's in ''Norma Rae,'' are pretty sexy in themselves.</p>
        <p>The film barely refers to Dr. Nielsen's past personal life. Ms. Sarandon's voice-over in the beginning mentions leaving behind ''a family, a career and a world -- all disappointments.'' Some people saw Dr. Nielsen's move to the South Pole, after a divorce and estrangement from her three children, as running away. Some said that wasn't true, that she was just eager for a new adventure. It seems to me that it could have been both.</p>
