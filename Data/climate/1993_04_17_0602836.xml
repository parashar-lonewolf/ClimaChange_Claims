        <p>International 2-5  U.S. REEVALUATING BOSNIA POLICY</p>
        <p>While U.S. officials debated whether to seek air strikes against Serbian forces, President Clinton said the United States and its allies needed to consider actions that "previously have been unacceptable" to stop the Serbian attacks in Bosnia.  1  SERB FORCES ENTER SREBRENICA</p>
        <p>As residents huddled behind bunkers, Serbian nationalist forces moved to within 1,000 yards of the center of the besieged Bosnian Muslim town of Srebrenica, and capture of the city appeared imminent.  1  U.N. DEBATES SAFE-HAVEN PLAN</p>
        <p>The Security Council agreed to make Srebrenica a United Nations-protected haven and to send peacekeeping troops to the embattled town, but with opposition and a fast moving situation, it was unclear whether the move would be an empty gesture.  4  A SETBACK IN HAITI TALKS</p>
        <p>Haiti's military commanders rejected an offer of amnesty by the country's ousted President that was to have been the cornerstone of a diplomatic settlement of the nation's 18-month-old political crisis.  1  A FACEOFF FOR U.S. AND JAPAN</p>
        <p>President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan used their first White House meeting to scold each other about trade, with Mr. Clinton insisting on an approach to resolving disputes that the Prime Minister called unacceptable.  1  RUSSIAN AID A POLITICAL FOOTBALL</p>
        <p>The opposing sides in Moscow's political wars tried to use a $28 billion package of Western aid to their advantage, with supporters saying it was a sign of confidence and opponents saying it would mean further dependence on the West.  5  A SHOW OF MUSCLE IN BRITAIN</p>
        <p>Britain's state-owned railroads and coal mines were shut down by workers demanding safeguards against layoffs. The strike stranded one million passengers and paralyzed Britain's rail system.  3  A car bomb on the West Bank killed two and wounded nine.  3  Italy's leader says his coalition is near collapse.  3  Istanbul Journal: As a city, a glittering, but tragic, magnet.  2  National 6-9  NEIGHBORHOOD'S NEW TERROR</p>
        <p>Random shotgun killings in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Northwest Washington have brought a typically troubled urban neighborhood an unwelcome fame.  1  JURY ACTION IN LOS ANGELES</p>
        <p>A member of the Police Commission said the jury in the trial of four police officers charged in the beating of Rodney King would make an announcement today.  6  MOVEMENT IN PRISON SIEGE</p>
        <p>Inmates in Lucasville, Ohio, were allowed to broadcast their demands on television. In exchange they freed a second of the eight guards whom they took hostage five days ago.  6  CHANGE AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD</p>
        <p>Pamela Maraldo, the new president of Planned Parenthood, is trying to change the organization's emphasis from abortion rights to health care for women.  7  TAILHOOK REPORT DELAYED</p>
        <p>The Pentagon is delaying the release of its report on a Navy sexual-harassment scandal until other events might well diminish its news value, some officials said.  7  PRESIDENT CONCEDES ON JOBS PLAN</p>
        <p>Making a first concession on his plan to stimulate the economy, President Clinton offered to cut $4 billion from the $19.5 billion package. But Republicans said the move was not enough.  8  HILLARY CLINTON RETURNS</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton resumed her campaign to defuse opposition to the proposals her health-care task force is drafting.  8  DALLAS MINISTER ACQUITTED</p>
        <p>Walker Railey, a former pastor who was charged with trying to choke his wife to death in 1987, was acquitted of all charges.  8  PRESIDENT MEETS GAY GROUPS</p>
        <p>Clinton met with leaders of gay and lesbian organizations, the first time that homosexual groups have been welcomed to the White House.  9  CLINTON CAMPAIGN UNDER FIRE</p>
        <p>The Clinton Presidential campaign listed scores of campaign workers as consultants, allowing the campaign to avoid paying Social Security taxes, CBS News reported.  9  Washington Journal: It's cleaning time atop the Capitol.  6  Metro Digest 23  CUOMO SIGNS CASINO PACT</p>
        <p>Gov. Cuomo signed an agreement today allowing the tiny Oneida Indian Nation near Syracuse to open New York State's first high-stakes gambling casino in more than a century.  1  JUDGES' DRUG CASE PROTEST</p>
        <p>Two of New York City's most prominent Federal judges said yesterday that they will no longer preside over drug cases, going public with a protest that calls attention to what dozens of Federal judges are doing quietly across the country. The decisions were made in protest of national drug policies and Federal sentencing guidelines. The judges said the emphasis on arrests and imprisonment, rather than prevention and treatment, had failed, and they are withdrawing from the effort.  1</p>
