        <p>WITH the Long Island Power Authority's settlement of its tax dispute over the Shoreham nuclear power plant, it can now focus on a battle of another kind: convincing the state Public Service Commission that a 22.5-mile power line is needed on the East End by summer to avoid blackouts.</p>
        <p>The proposed underground cable, the first major power line on Long Island in eight years, is urgently needed in light of the unexpected power demands of last summer, according to Michael Lowndes, the utility's chief spokesman. ''If it gets the green light, it will be running by next summer,'' he said. ''We feel confident that the new transmission line, along with conservation methods, will be able to meet the needs of customers.''</p>

        <p>WITH the Long Island Power Authority's settlement of its tax dispute over the Shoreham nuclear power plant, it can now focus on a battle of another kind: convincing the state Public Service Commission that a 22.5-mile power line is needed on the East End by summer to avoid blackouts.</p>
        <p>The proposed underground cable, the first major power line on Long Island in eight years, is urgently needed in light of the unexpected power demands of last summer, according to Michael Lowndes, the utility's chief spokesman. ''If it gets the green light, it will be running by next summer,'' he said. ''We feel confident that the new transmission line, along with conservation methods, will be able to meet the needs of customers.''</p>
        <p>But a coalition that includes the Citizens Advisory Panel, the court-appointed utility watchdog, is challenging the need for the line, which would run south from Riverhead and then east to Southampton. It argues that conservation methods and alternative energy sources could do the job more economically.</p>
        <p>These same groups are also opposing LIPA's plans to build two new gas- and oil-fired power plants on the Island, and the utility's stated need for a 600-megawatt cable under the Sound from New Haven.</p>
        <p>Bert Cunningham, a LIPA spokesman, said that should the utility decide it needed the cross-Sound cable, which is subject to state approval, the winning bidder would lay the cable and then lease it to LIPA.</p>
        <p>But Gordon Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, asks whether that would be cost effective. ''Is it wise to have another company pay for it when LIPA has access to low-cost capital?'' he asked. ''The whole thing is a stupid idea, given the fact we have cleaner and cheaper energy available.''</p>
        <p>The authority is also soliciting bids for the construction of the two 75-megawatt power plants, the first the utility would own. When the Long Island Lighting Company was dissolved in May 1998, LIPA assumed control of its transmission and distribution lines and KeySpan Energy took control of its five power plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raacke said there is nothing to stop the power plants because of their relatively small size. Only plants that are 80 megawatts or more require review by the Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>''The irony is that with Lilco, at least we had the P.S.C. as an independent arbiter,'' he said. ''With LIPA -- with few exceptions, such as siting issues -- its trustees can make decisions without any oversight and not be accountable to Long Islanders because they are not elected.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have called for a comprehensive energy plan since the state took over Lilco. A report in October by the citizens' group and the Pace Law School Energy Project reiterated that need, arguing that alternative energy sources could provide 690 megawatts of electricity, and that 465 megawatts -- 12 percent of estimated future needs -- could be generated in just months.</p>
        <p>''The report concluded that the future electric needs of Long Island can easily be met with energy efficiency and renewable energy technology,'' Mr. Raacke said.</p>
        <p>The report urged an immediate, detailed study of one particular alternative: wind turbines. And it said other energy sources like solar panels and fuel cells should also be considered, along with more energy-efficient lighting, appliances and buildings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowndes said LIPA was already set to test a range of alternatives. For instance, 30 homes are being fitted with solar panels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham said the utility was also working with Babylon and Hempstead on the use of wind energy, seeking large enough areas with sustained winds with a view to installing a wind turbine in each town.  Demonstration projects are on tap for fuel cells, which use natural gas or hydrogen to generate electricity, though these are still expensive.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Cunningham added, ''we have a responsibility to make sure there is adequate electricity on Long Island.''</p>
        <p>Nathanael Greene, an energy policy analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Manhattan, said the utility had two choices: generate more power or help people become more energy efficient.</p>
        <p>''We can help people to use more solar power, we can put in wind turbines, and fuel cells will happen soon,'' he said. ''Those are things at the customer level rather than at the cable level, which is what Lilco traditionally tried to do to solve its problems. They waited until the last minute, then felt as though they had a crisis on their hands and so did crisis management instead of good planning.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Greene applauded the utility for preparing demonstration projects, he questioned the cautious approach to solar energy. The demonstration projects are part of a $160 million, five-year program begun last year that includes a campaign to convince the public to buy more energy-efficient appliances; side-loading washing machines, for example, use 50 percent less energy and one-third less water than top-loading machines.</p>
        <p>''They can save the average household $100 a year,'' Mr. Lowndes said. ''These machines could cost a couple of hundred dollars more, but we are offering from $50 to $150 in rebates.''</p>
        <p>But he added that all these programs will take time, time that LIPA does not have.</p>
        <p>''There has been a tremendous amount of residential and commercial activity in the last five years, particularly east from Route 111 in East Islip,'' he said. ''Add to that a smoking Long Island economy and the fact that Long Islanders have been enjoying a 20 percent electric-rate reduction for the past year and a half. And now, east of Shinnecock Inlet in Southampton, there is a great deal of home building going on -- very large homes. All have central air-conditioning and so they require a great deal of energy to operate. We have to meet those demands.''</p>
        <p>He noted that during a heat wave last July, electricity consumption on the East End jumped 25 percent on July 5, from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>During the heat wave, Mr. Lowndes noted, a record for peak demand was set twice. On July 5, a record of 4,340 megawatts was recorded, and the very next day it was broken when 4,590 megawatts were called for. The system's maximum capacity is 5,100 megawatts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greene said the utility had not yet found the right mix of energy efficiency and energy generation.</p>
        <p>''If LIPA does not find the right balance soon,'' he added, ''its customers will lose on their bills and the environment will also lose.''</p>
