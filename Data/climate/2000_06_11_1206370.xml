        <p>HISTORIC windmills are not an unusual sight on the East End, but three new ones using the latest technology may soon rise on Montauk's ocean bluffs -- and may even power the Montauk Lighthouse.</p>
        <p>The three new towers, wind turbines 80 to 100 feet tall that produce 50 kilowatts an hour, would be the first of their kind on Long Island. They are being proposed by the Long Island Power Authority as an alternative source of energy, a need made more urgent by last summer's power failures on the East End.</p>
        <p>''We have an energy emergency on Long Island because with our growing population, we are running out of electricity,'' said Richard Kessel, the chairman of LIPA. ''I'm worried about the summer because we're anticipating that with a sustained heat wave, we could set a new record of 4,893 megawatts, and our maximum capacity is 5,140 megawatts.''</p>
        <p>As an example of the rising demand, he cited air-conditioning on the Island. ''In 1998 there were 100,000 air-conditioners sold here,'' Mr. Kessel said, ''and last year 478,000 were sold.''</p>
        <p>LIPA has been directed by Gov. George E. Pataki's office to invest $160 million over five years on new technology to promote clean energy and to reduce dependence on oil and natural gas.</p>
        <p>''If we can utilize nature, the fewer nuclear power plants we'll need, and the cleaner the environment on Long Island,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''We hope to see wind and solar power comprising 5 to 10 percent of our energy over the next 10 years.''</p>
        <p>LIPA has been consulting with AWS Scientific Inc., in Albany, a company that has been studying renewable energy for more than 20 years and recently sent scientists and engineers to study the Island's potential.</p>
        <p>Bruce Bailey, the president of AWS, said measurements at Prospect Hill, near Camp Hero, and at Fort Pond Bay in Montauk showed that the area is one of the windiest in the state. Year-round wind speeds in Montauk average 15 to 16 miles an hour, and in winter the average rises to near 20 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey and Mr. Kessel presented these findings last month to the East Hampton Town Board at a special public meeting where Mr. Kessel outlined what would be Long Island's first wind-power project.</p>
        <p>He proposed three wind turbines, each with three-bladed rotors on top of poles or lattice towers, along the bluffs of state-owned land in Camp Hero, about a mile from the lighthouse. He said the three generators would produce a combined 150 kilowatts, enough to power the Montauk Lighthouse and serve the museum there, and provide a surplus that would go into LIPA's grid.</p>
        <p>Several residents of Camp Hero who attended the meeting raised questions about the noise level and the visual appearance of the turbines.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bailey said that from 200 to 500 feet away, the turbines cause a sound measuring only 45 decibels, compared with 55 decibels when the same force wind blows through trees.</p>
        <p>He also said that a more streamlined design for the structures means a less intrusive appearance and prevents birds from nesting in their tops, which was a problem in some towers in California.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey said that Madison, N.Y., has a large wind project under construction and that Searsburg, Vt., has been successfully operating 11 wind turbines for four years, generating 6,000 kilowatts.</p>
        <p>The turbines in Montauk would cost about $500,000 to erect and would connect to LIPA's distribution circuit on Montauk Point. The utility would pay for the project with state financing.</p>
        <p>The power authority also plans to put solar panels on the roof of the concession stand at the Montauk Lighthouse, part of a project that includes testing and evaluating similar panels on the Theodore Roosevelt Environmental Center at Jones Beach and on 31 homes across the island.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to have photovoltaic shingles on 10,000 roofs across Long Island by 2010'' as part of a federal government program, Mr. Kessel said.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, the model Christie Brinkley and her husband, Peter Cook, of Bridgehampton, commended the wind-  and solar-energy programs. ''This is what's right for our kids and our future,'' said Ms. Brinkley, who is a board member of the East Hampton environmental organization Standing for Truth About Radiation.</p>
        <p>Phil Dougherty, of the United States Department of Energy, who also attended the meeting, said: ''We have a legacy of using wind power in this country, from when the Dutch first came over from Amsterdam. The U.S. has invested $1 billion over the last 30 years in wind power, compared with $25 billion to $50 billion over the last 50 years in nuclear power. We are trying to bring down our $4 billion annual federal electric bill.''</p>
        <p>He said the federal government's goal is to produce about 5 percent of the nation's electricity with wind and solar sources by 2020.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel added that he hoped the use of wind and solar energy could also cut Long Island's electricity costs by 5 to 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The Town Supervisor, Jay Schneiderman, said he was excited that East Hampton could be the first town on the Island to try wind turbines. But he added, ''We need to hold another meeting, in Montauk, to get input from the residents there about this project.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said that if East Hampton agreed to go ahead, construction could begin over the summer, and the windmills could be running by January.</p>
        <p>''This won't lower people's electric bills immediately,'' Mr. Kessel said, ''but it's a way to see how wind energy would work, and if it works on the eastern tip of Long Island, it will work anywhere. The Montauk Lighthouse would be a symbol for worldwide attention.''</p>
