        <p>WASHINGTON: NOT SO FAST, LEGISLATURE IS TOLD -- State lawmakers ended their 15-week regular session, but Gov. Gary Locke planned to call them back to a special session this week to deal with many unresolved issues. The Legislature must still address big-ticket budget items like plans to improve schools and alleviate traffic congestion. The House of Representatives did pass a bill allowing Washington residents to leave inheritances to their pets.</p>

        <p>MICHIGAN: STATE SENATOR FACES PEER CENSURE -- A state senator with a history of run-ins with the law could face an unprecedented effort to expel him from office after a meeting with legislative leaders today. The senator, David Jaye, a conservative Republican from the Detroit suburbs, is being urged to resign in the wake of an arrest this month in Florida on a misdemeanor charge of hitting his fianc√©e in the face. He denies striking her. Mr. Jaye has been convicted of drunken driving twice. The Senate majority leader, Dan DeGrow, said he would meet with Mr. Jaye and Republican leaders today to discuss the matter. Several senators have said they would support action to remove Mr. Jaye from the Senate.</p>

        <p>MISSOURI: PARENTS SEE INTERNET TWINS -- The estranged biological parents of twin girls involved in an international Internet adoption dispute saw their daughters on Saturday for the first time since the girls were taken to Wales in December. Separately, each parent spent over an hour with the twins at a counseling center in St. Louis.  The nearly 10-month-old twins were returned to Missouri last week and are in the custody of state social services. The custody case for the twins, who were put up for adoption twice by their parents through an Internet placement service, will be combined with the divorce case of the biological parents, Aaron and Tranda Wecker, and is expected to start this week in St. Louis Family Court.</p>

        <p>ILLINOIS: PUTTING RICHARD PRYOR ON THE MAP -- The Peoria City Council will revisit a proposal this week to name a street after the comedian Richard Pryor, a native who has never been honored in his hometown. Although Mr. Pryor has won Grammy awards and other honors for his work in movies and television, his raw humor and drug use have made many here object to recognizing him publicly. Mr. Pryor, who is 66 and has multiple sclerosis, was born on the city's south side, the son of a prostitute, and he lived above a pool hall and brothel run by his grandparents. A proposal to rename South Sheridan Road after Mr. Pryor was rejected in March, but Councilman Christopher Duncan plans to reintroduce it.</p>

        <p>MISSOURI: SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT RESIGNS -- Wiping tears from his eyes, Benjamin Demps Jr. resigned as superintendent of the Kansas City public schools yesterday, saying the district's only hope was an immediate state takeover. The schools, which have 29,500 students, lost their accreditation on May 1, 2000, after failing to meet any of 11 state educational standards. Mr. Demps, hired in 1999 as the 19th superintendent in 30 years, found himself at odds with the school board over his management style. Last week, the board voted 5 to 4 to fire him, but a federal judge ordered him reinstated. If the schools keep failing, a state takeover could occur in June 2002.</p>

        <p>ARKANSAS: ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TRY FOR SENATE -- Attorney General Mark Pryor announced plans to run for the United States Senate in 2002. Mr. Pryor, the son of former Senator David Pryor, is the first well-known Democrat to enter the race for the seat now held by Tim Hutchinson, a Republican who will also face some opposition in his party primary. Mr. Hutchinson, who had run on a strong family-values platform in the past, is considered vulnerable after divorcing his wife of 29 years in 1999 to marry a former staff member. President Bush is scheduled to speak at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for Mr. Hutchinson in Little Rock on Wednesday night.</p>

        <p>FLORIDA: FIRE CLOSES ROAD TO KEYS -- A 2,000-acre wildfire spread by persistent winds forced the closing of an 18-mile stretch of Route 1, the main artery into the Florida Keys. Traffic on the two-lane highway between Florida City and Key Largo was diverted to another road, which was also temporarily closed by fire, the authorities said. Forestry officials said they believed a campfire started the blaze, which spread quickly through dry grasses. The fire was burning west toward the Everglades and did not threaten any buildings. The highway was expected to be closed until Tuesday. (AP)</p>
        <p>FLORIDA: NEWBORNS ABANDONED, DESPITE LAW: -- At least 11 babies have been abandoned in Florida since July, despite a law that took effect then allowing parents to leave unwanted newborns at hospitals and fire stations with no questions asked, state officials said. In the last month, two babies have been found dead, one in a Key Biscayne trash bin and the other in a canal. Aimee Lee Weiss, 17, who confessed to the second death, said she did not know that parents could leave a newborn at a fire station or hospital. (AP)</p>

        <p>MASSACHUSETTS: SETTING TOUGHEST EMISSIONS RULES -- Gov. Jane M. Swift of Massachusetts announced that the state was adopting the toughest set of emission standards for power plants in the country. As of June, Massachusetts will be the first state to set limits on carbon dioxide emissions, which are believed to hasten global climate change. It will also reduce the allowable levels of emissions that contribute to acid rain and air pollution. The new rules apply to the six oldest and most polluting power plants in the state; the other plants already meet the standards.</p>
