        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he would not support reducing New York City's gasoline tax, declining to follow the lead of federal and state lawmakers who have proposed measures to lower prices at the pump.</p>
        <p>Speaking on his weekly radio program, on WABC-AM, Mr. Bloomberg said the city could ill afford to cut its share of the sales tax on gasoline at a time that its own expenses were increasing to cover the cost of higher prices of gas for city-owned cars and trucks, and of heating oil for city buildings.</p>
        <p>Sales tax of about 8.3 percent is now collected on gasoline bought in New York; 4 percent is levied by the state, 4 percent by the city, and one-third of one percent by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the mayor said.</p>
        <p>State lawmakers agreed this week to effectively cap the state sales tax at 8 cents a gallon, 4 cents less than the tax on gasoline when it sells for $3 a gallon. The proposal, which would also allow localities to cut their portion of the gas tax, has to be approved by Gov. George E. Pataki, who had not yet made a decision.</p>
        <p>Critics have charged that there is no guarantee that the savings would actually reach the public, a concern that Mr. Bloomberg echoed yesterday.</p>
        <p>''A small reduction in the tax is going to hurt this city, and it's probably not going to reduce the pain very much for everybody,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg said similarly capping the city's share of the sales tax would cost about $50 million a year in lost revenue, or, as he put it, enough money to pay the salaries of nearly 1,000 police officers or nearly 1,000 teachers.</p>
        <p>''If we don't have the money, we can't have these things,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Why do we want to do without?''</p>
        <p>Furthermore, from a conservation standpoint, Mr. Bloomberg asserted that cutting gasoline taxes was ''not exactly a terribly smart policy.'' He urged people to end their dependence on foreign oil cartels.</p>
        <p>''The long-term solution in this country, which nobody wants to hear, is to use an awful lot less energy and to get away from fossil fuels,'' he said.</p>
