        <p>David Helvarg (''Fiddling While Antarctica Burns,'' Op-Ed, March 7) is mistaken to assume that environmental conditions in the Antarctic have always been the same and that, were it not for human activity, would remain the same. Why should that be so?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Helvarg (''Fiddling While Antarctica Burns,'' Op-Ed, March 7) is mistaken to assume that environmental conditions in the Antarctic have always been the same and that, were it not for human activity, would remain the same. Why should that be so?</p>
        <p>A look at the geological and ecological history of our planet shows that in the past the earth has been far warmer and far colder than it is today, and entire species of plants and animals have appeared and disappeared -- all without the influence of man.</p>
        <p>The evidence that human activity influences global warming is inconclusive, and Mr. Helvarg's gloomy scenario is ill advised at best.</p>
