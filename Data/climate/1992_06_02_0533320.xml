        <p>International A3-11  JAPAN'S BANKS PULL BACK</p>
        <p>Japan's big commercial banks, after a decade of rapid growth, have stepped on the brakes. Their global expansion has been hobbled by a problem that was considered an affliction of the West: billions of dollars in bad loans.  A1  BUSH OFFERS PLAN FOR FORESTS</p>
        <p>With the Earth Summit opening on Wednesday in Rio de Janeiro, President Bush sought to counter criticism of his environmental record, introducing programs to conserve forests and combat global warming. His action and remarks reflected a continuing Administration struggle over environmental politics.  A1</p>
        <p>E.P.A. chief: "This must be a very hard Administration to read." A11</p>
        <p>Brazilians are casting the U.S. as environmental villain.  A10  THE DEIFICATION OF MAO</p>
        <p>Fifteen years after his death, Mao has scored an achievement more remarkable than his founding and dominance of a Communist China: He has become a god.  A1  BEARING THE BRUNT OF DISCONTENT</p>
        <p>Having survived the winter and the first phase of disruptive economic change, Russia is preparing to undertake a far more ambitious second phase. On the firing line will be Yegor T. Gaidar.  A8  WAR AS AN URBAN NIGHTMARE</p>
        <p>Sarajevo's disaster evokes a frequent comparison -- to Beirut. The depth of misery is astonishing for a conflict that began only in April. A major European city with a population of 560,000 before the fighting has in effect become a jungle.  A3  MILLIONS FOR OFFENSE</p>
        <p>The House Intelligence Committee reportedly approved $40 million in covert aid to help overthrow Saddam Hussein, more than double the current $15 million budget.A3  ARAFAT HAS BLOOD-CLOT SURGERY</p>
        <p>Yasir Arafat, who suffered head injuries in a plane crash in April, underwent surgery in Jordan to remove a blood clot caused by the crash. The P.L.O. leader was said to be in good condition.  A5  WAR ON THE SMUGGLERS, TOO</p>
        <p>Trying to reduce the flow of cocaine through Central America and the Caribbean, the Bush Administration is planning to expand anti-smuggling operations in several countries.  A7  Final arguments began in Israel in the Demjanjuk trial.  A6  National A12-19  A BLOW TO 'STAR WARS'</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's top program analyst says a $35 billion "Star Wars" plan calls for a rushed deployment that threatens expensive and crippling problems. The criticism could jeopardize a Congressional coalition that last year endorsed the building of limited missile defenses.  A1  A HOBBLED CLINTON</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton hoped to sprint to the final steps to the Democratic nomination, but given the situation in California on the eve of its primary, he is likely to have to slog through.  A1  RULING IN EMBRYO DISPUTE</p>
        <p>In a dispute involving the question of when life begins, the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that a man could prevent his ex-wife from having implanted in herself or donating to others embryos that had been fertilized in petri dishes before their divorce and then frozen for later use.  A1  STATES LOSE ON AIRLINE ADS</p>
        <p>States may not regulate airline fare advertising, the Supreme Court ruled. State attorneys general wanted to set guidelines that they said were broader than Federal regulation they regarded as lax.  A1  ACCORD ON WASTE SETTLEMENT</p>
        <p>A Federal judge accepted a plea agreement between the Justice Department and the company that ran the Rocky Flats nuclear plant in which the company, Rockwell International, pleaded guilty to mishandling hazardous wastes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines.  A12  NEW FACES, NEW TENSION</p>
        <p>Record retirements in the House will shake up important committees and, as a result, probably relations between Congress and the White House, assuming President Bush is re-elected.  A12  OWNING THE AMERICAN DREAM</p>
        <p>Most Americans believe that a house with a yard is the best place to live, a survey shows. In addition, they are willing to make large sacrifices to achieve that dream, with blacks more prepared than whites to make such sacrifices.  A12  A STRONG PUSH FOR PHILATELY</p>
        <p>In an effort to balance its budget, the Postal Service is vigorously trying to sell stamps to people who won't put them on letters.  A16  THE SEASON ENDS, GRIMLY</p>
        <p>For Democrats and Republicans and their leading Presidential candidates, the end of the primary season and the advent of their conventions should be a time of joy. This year it clearly is not. Political Week.  A18  VOTE? WHO ME AND WHY?</p>
        <p>Interviews with newly eligible New Jersey voters -- the young and those who have just become citizens -- show that many have an aversion to voting that goes beyond indifference and verges on distaste.  A19  ANOTHER WALLACE CAMPAIGN</p>
        <p>George Wallace Jr. knows his name carries a weight in Alabama matched by none other. But he has tried to carve his own niche in state politics. Now State Treasurer, he is running for a House seat.  A19  Jerry Brown makes it clear he has no plans to just fade away.  A18  Further dispute on Ross Perot's effort to leave the Navy.  A18  Metropolitan Digest, B1 BLEAK YOUTH JOB OUTLOOK</p>
        <p>In the first three months of the year, only slightly more than 1 in 10 New York City teen-agers had a job. The employment market for youths is the worst in memory and the worst among major cities in the nation. Labor experts say the situation shows few signs of improving.
