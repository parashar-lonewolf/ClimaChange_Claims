        <p>LEAD: Changes in the environment brought about by human activity are now occurring globally or over broad regions at a speed that may exceed the ability of people and their institutions to respond, according to and social scientists who attended a meeting last week.</p>
        <p>Changes in the environment brought about by human activity are now occurring globally or over broad regions at a speed that may exceed the ability of people and their institutions to respond, according to and social scientists who attended a meeting last week.</p>
        <p>There was little consensus, however, on what those changes might mean or how they might be softened. Some participants noted that history was filled with examples of humanity pulling back from catastrophe.</p>
        <p>The symposium on ''The Earth As Transformed by Human Action'' was held at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. It brought together scientists and scholars from 18 countries and an even larger number of disciplines to report on how humanity has changed the physical world over the last 300 years. They focused their attention on the depletion of forests, problems of air and water pollution, the creation of deserts through overgrazing and unskilled irrigation practices, and the redistribution of earth's resources over wide areas. Changes Called 'Unprecedented'</p>
        <p>Several of the scholars underscored that those changes were usually slow and localized but they expressed concern about the accelerated pace.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gilbert F. White, of the University of Colorado's Institute of Behavioral Science, said, ''The changes that have taken place in the last 35 to 50 years are unprecedented in nature. And the rate of change is escalating.'' The speed and magnitude of the change raises ''the possibility for a great disaster,'' Dr. White said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Dr. William C. Clark of Harvard University's School of Government, a coordinator of the conference, said that because human beings are now changing not only the surface of the earth but also its ''flows'' of solids, gases and liquids and its fluctuations of climate, ''man is becoming a noticeable goeologic force.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Clark said that central questions before the conference were not only how the environment has changed but how human activities and social organizations have changed in response. '' Division Among Scientists</p>
        <p>Some of the natural scientists here were critical of the social scientists, saying that their analysis did not address the actual environmental problems raised at the conference. C. S. Holling, an ecologist at the University of British Columbia, complained that the social scientists did not provide the ''insights'' he was seeking about such things as how people could organize themselves to respond to the new threats and opportunities presented by a changing environment. Several of the social scientists, in turn, said that the discussions by the natural scientists did not provide the kind of information policy makers require.</p>
        <p>Among the many points scientists made at the conference were these:</p>
        <p>* Because of human activity, largely the combustion of fossil fuels, the amount of carbon stored in the the soil has decreased and the amount in the air and oceans has increased, according to a report by R. A. Houghton of the Woods Hole Research Center and David L. Skole of the University of New Hampshire. Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere is a major contributor to the current ''greenhouse'' warming of the earth's atmosphere by keeping radiation from the sun from escaping back into space. Other basic elements, such as sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus, are also subject to massive redistribution because of human industrial and agricultural activity.</p>
        <p>* While pollution from the burning of fossil fuels and the release of toxic chemicals into the environment has received considerable attention, trace metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, aluminum, arsenic and selenium may be an even more intractable problem, according to a report by Halina Szejnwald Brown, Roger E. Kasperson and Susan Raymond of Clark University. The introduction of these potentially health-threatening metals into the environment has been growing rapidly and, except for lead, there has been little effort to remove them. The result may be a buildup of these metals in the food chain. Dr. Viktor Kovda, a professor at Moscow State University, noted that acid rain acted to release the metals in the soil and thus was compounding the problem.</p>
        <p>* ''Perhaps the most important factor that has altered the face of the earth in many parts of the world is the clearing of forests that once covered large parts of it,'' according to Michael Williams, lecturer in geography at Oxford University. But Dr. Williams cautioned that it was not possible to make a definitive conclusion about just how much of the earth has been deforested. While forests in the tropics are coming down rapidly, forests in the developed world and even China have been making a slow comeback and ''compensated to some degree for the massive deforestation'' in the tropics.</p>
        <p>* There is now a ''new massive wave of habitat degradation and concomitant extinction'' of animal populations associated with rapid increase of human population and economic development, according to Robert L. Peters 2d and Thomas E. Lovejoy of the World Wildlife Fund-U.S. With human pressures accelerating, particularly in the tropics, the loss is likely to reach 20 percent of all species by the year 2,000,the authors said. Dr. Francesco Dicastri, of the National Center for Scientific Research in France, noted that human activity also increased biological diversity in the form of new varieties of domestic plants and animals.</p>
        <p>* Dr. Paul Demeny, a demographer with the Population Council, presented estimates that the current world population of about 5 billion would grow to 8 to 16 billion in the next century and said he believed that the earth could support even the higher level without undue hardship. But William H. McNeill, the historian, called the projections ''very sobering'' and said that the buildup in the number of human beings could lead to some unforeseen catastrophe. For example, he said, such a crowded world would be a ''sitting duck'' for some new, lethal disease.</p>
        <p>This meeting, sponsored by Clark University's Graduate School of Geography, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis and the World Resources Institute, traces its roots to a ''Symposium on Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth'' held in Princeton, N.J. in June, 1955. That conference was one of the first efforts to look at the global environment and had significant influence on ecologists. A Global Strategy Urged</p>
        <p>William L. Thomas, editor of the book produced from that gathering, suggested at this meeting that conditions had changed much from what now seems, he said, to have been a ''simpler'' period. ''The 1955 gathering, he recalled, largely ''celebrated'' human manipulation of the environment and sought to identify problems that might have to be addressed. Now, he said, the need for a global strategy to confront many of the problems was more evident.</p>
        <p>Opinion among the participants seemed divided on whether the global outlook was optimistic or pessimisstic.</p>
        <p>Somewhere in between was Martin Holdgate, science advisor to Britain's Environment Ministry and one of the few policy makers present, who believes that 30 years from now issues such as depletion of the ozone layer and chemical contamination in the environment will look like ''yesterday's problems.'' Where the problems of environmental degradation may not be solved, he warned, is in the developing countries, countries, where poverty forces people to abuse soils and forests and sprawling cities pose serious problems of pollution and health.</p>
