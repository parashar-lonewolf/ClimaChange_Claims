        <p>LEAD:  COLONIAL FURNISHINGS  A look behind the scenes at the Yale University Art Gallery furniture collection is offered to those with reservations for a free lecture and tour at 2 P.M. Tuesday and 1 P.M. Thursday.</p>
        <p>COLONIAL FURNISHINGS  A look behind the scenes at the Yale University Art Gallery furniture collection is offered to those with reservations for a free lecture and tour at 2 P.M. Tuesday and 1 P.M. Thursday.</p>
        <p>Fifteen people will be permitted on each tour, led by Joshua Lane, a graduate student in American decorative arts. Morethan 800 tables, chairs, chests and other pieces are arranged chronologically in long rows in a storage room at 149 York Street, known as the Garvan Furniture Study. ''Objects rotate for special exhibitions in the gallery and at museums around the country, and are available for scholars to come and examine,'' Mr. Lane said.</p>
        <p>The collection, bequeathed to the university in the 1930's by Francis P. Garvan, an alumnus and financier, has been supplemented by gifts and acquisitions, but is limited to American colonial furnishings from the 1670's to the 1840's.</p>
        <p>''The range covers the eastern seaboard, with a concentration on New England,'' said Mr. Lane. ''There are a number of late 17th-century coastal Connecticut oak chests with elaborately carved surfaces, painted chests-on-chests from the late 1700's, and Greek Revival pieces from the mid-1800's.</p>
        <p>A substantial number of 20th-century pieces are stored with the Garvan group and will be seen on the tour, including a sideboard in the Memphis style, using tubular steel and aluminum gridwork, brightly painted.</p>
        <p>The tour group will meet at the Yale Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street. For reservations call 432-0632.  SIERRA CLUB GATHERING</p>
        <p>The greenhouse effect and global warming are the subjects to be covered this week in a slide show and talk by Dr. Sergei Lebedeff, a physicist affiliated with NASA, the Goddard Space Center, and Columbia University. His talk is to be the special feature of an open meeting of the Sierra Club at 7:30 P.M. Wednesday in the East Norwalk Library, 51 Van Zant Street. Admission, parking and refreshments are free.For information call 847-7869.  PAUL WINTER CONCERT</p>
        <p>For its first benefit, the five-year-old New Pond Farm Education Center in West Redding will present a concert in the pasture by the Paul Winter Consort at 3 P.M. Saturday. The center, which focuses on programs related to ecology, farm traditions and Native American cultures, has a kindred spirit in the group, known for incorporating the sounds of nature into its interpretations of jazz, classical, folk, Brazilian and African music.</p>
        <p>The rain date is next Sunday, and if it rains on Sunday the location will be changed to the Joel Barlow High School, Route 58, Black Rock Turnpike, Redding. General admission is $15, children from 6 to 16 will be charged $5. The gates will open for ticket sales at 1:30 P.M. at the center, on the corner of Umpawaug and Marchant Road off Route 53. Reserved seats are $25, and reserved seats plus admission to a post-concert reception range from $50 to $200, partially tax-deductible. Call 938-2117 for tickets or more information.  THE TOBACCO YEARS</p>
        <p>Until the end of August the Connecticut River Museum in Essex will have on exhibition a display of artifacts and photographs documenting the state's once-thriving tobacco industry titled ''Tobacco Valley's Golden Leaf.'' Wagons for harvesting and watering the broadleaf tobacco, mostly used for cigar wrappers, and the white netting that was spread over miles of fields, protecting the crops from sun damage, are among the items.</p>
        <p>In addition, the museum's permanent collection of river memorabilia includes the Bushnell Turtle, a working model of America's first submarine, invented by David Bushnell during the Revolutionary War. Vertical in configuration, it stands 10 feet high and accomodates one person.</p>
        <p>The museum is situated on the riverbank at the foot of Main Street and is open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is $1.50 for adults, $1 for the elderly and 50 cents for children. The phone number for more information is 767-8269.  LONDON SHAKESPEARE</p>
        <p>The Young Shakespeare Company, Ltd., of London, will present ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and ''Macbeth'' beginning Tuesday through Sept. 10 at the University of Bridgeport's Mertens Theater.</p>
        <p>In its one-year history, the troupe of 15 actors, formed at Warwick University where the members were drama students, performed two Shakespearean plays at the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford last summer, and filmed a production for the British Broadcasting Company at Kenilworth Castle in England.</p>
        <p>While ''Macbeth'' is presented in a traditional, medieval setting, ''Much Ado About Nothing'' has been transported to Victorian times in England following the Crimean War. An original musical score was composed for it by Grant Baynham, performed by an ensemble of piano, double bass, oboe and flute, and some of the play's text is sung by the actors as sentimental Victorian ballads.</p>
        <p>''Much Ado'' will be presented at 8 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday and Aug. 23 to 26. Additional performances are scheduled at 2 P.M. Saturday and 5:30 P.M. next Sunday.</p>
        <p>''Macbeth'' will be performed at 8 P.M. Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, and Sept. 6 to 10, with additional performances at 2 P.M. Sept. 3 and 5:30 P.M. Sept. 4. Tickets are $15, $17, and $20. Students and the elderly receive a $2 discount. Those ordering $20 tickets to both plays receive a $3 discount on each ticket. Tickets to an opening night reception and the performance are $35. The box office number is 576-4399, or call Ticketron or Teletron.  INDIAN ANCESTRAL ARTS</p>
        <p>Clan symbols, folk tales, design signatures, and other interpretive decorations were an integral part of American Indian life, applied to clothing, household utensils, and tools. On the most elaborate level, they were embellished with objects that provided sound, particularly for ceremonial dances.</p>
        <p>A number of Native Americans will be at work demonstrating such ancestral arts and crafts in a program called ''Under the Sun Woodland Indian Arts'' at the American Indian Archaeological Institute off Route 199 in Washington. From 10:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. Thursday through Saturday and from noon to 5 P.M. next Sunday visitors may observe the making of Algonkian and Iroquois dresses, Mahican and Paugusset leather and beadwork, Wampanoag, Lakota and Schaghticoke adornments from earrings to mocassins, and Narragansett quillwork and twining.</p>
        <p>Admission is $3 for adults, $2 for children, and includes access to the grounds and all exhibits. For more information call 868-0518.</p>
