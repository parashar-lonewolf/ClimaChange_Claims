        <p>Editorial says Americans remain committed to a their role in the world but want to pursue that role cooperatively with other countries; cites surveys conducted by University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes and Pew Research Center for People and the Press (M)</p>

        <p>The end of the cold war aroused fears among some who conduct foreign policy that Americans would tire of shouldering the world's problems. Superficially, those fears appear well founded. Surveys show that Americans are put off by news of distant conflicts and prefer not to become involved. Look again, however, and a different picture emerges. It turns out that Americans crave engagement in the world's crises, but not in the way they are defined by some leaders in Government, academic institutions and the news media. As a new year dawns, it is worth remembering that citizens want the United States to assert its global leadership, but in a more nuanced and coordinated fashion than in the past.</p>
        <p>These thoughts are prompted by two new surveys showing Americans to be perhaps more concerned and even idealistic about the world's problems than many in Washington. Polls by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found a strong cooperationist streak. For example, the Maryland study found that 74 percent of those surveyed wanted a sharing of power internationally, while only 13 percent wanted the United States to throw its weight around as the sole superpower. In addition, while Congress refuses to approve $1.5 billion in overdue assessments for the United Nations, the Pew survey found that Americans hold the organization in high regard.</p>

        <p>The end of the cold war aroused fears among some who conduct foreign policy that Americans would tire of shouldering the world's problems. Superficially, those fears appear well founded. Surveys show that Americans are put off by news of distant conflicts and prefer not to become involved. Look again, however, and a different picture emerges. It turns out that Americans crave engagement in the world's crises, but not in the way they are defined by some leaders in Government, academic institutions and the news media. As a new year dawns, it is worth remembering that citizens want the United States to assert its global leadership, but in a more nuanced and coordinated fashion than in the past.</p>
        <p>These thoughts are prompted by two new surveys showing Americans to be perhaps more concerned and even idealistic about the world's problems than many in Washington. Polls by the University of Maryland's Program on International Policy Attitudes and the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found a strong cooperationist streak. For example, the Maryland study found that 74 percent of those surveyed wanted a sharing of power internationally, while only 13 percent wanted the United States to throw its weight around as the sole superpower. In addition, while Congress refuses to approve $1.5 billion in overdue assessments for the United Nations, the Pew survey found that Americans hold the organization in high regard.</p>
        <p>These practical attitudes pose an interesting challenge to makers of foreign policy, not to mention the news media that report it. When it comes to American intervention, the key to winning support is to gain cooperation of other countries. As for foreign news generally, other polls show that if it focuses on the rise and fall of regimes and far-off diplomatic and military clashes, Americans no longer anchored in the worldwide contest with Moscow have little patience. But the Pew survey has shown surprising concern about those occurrences abroad that affect Americans' economic well-being, health and safety.</p>
        <p>This might seem like mere selfishness, but the specific examples tell a different story. The Pew survey found broad support for cooperative action to halt global warming, even if it means applying fuel consumption standards that lead to higher gasoline prices in the United States. Pollsters have also found that in the medical sphere, Americans expect a muscular, multilateral response to the spread of disease, whether from the outbreak of mad cow disease in Britain, AIDS in Africa or avian flu in Hong Kong. Americans are also known to be increasingly aware that the collapse of economies in Latin America or the Caribbean can translate into immigration, and that certain economies are dependent on drug exports to the United States. As for the collapse of currencies and financial institutions in Asia, voters will certainly punish any government that ignores the threat they pose to American banks, individual investors and pension funds.</p>
        <p>As President Clinton prepares for the second year of his second term, the foreign policy agenda is surprisingly packed. A newly expanded NATO, and a renewal of American troop involvement in Bosnia, will properly require Congressional approval. Global warming, trade, drugs and disease are at the center of American concerns. The Administration's decision to push for more open trade and to help rescue the economies of Asia will affect the jobs of everyone. The new surveys have thus reinforced an old axiom. Americans care more about the world than they are given credit for. The test of leadership remains to dramatize the connection of the new problems of today to their lives.</p>
