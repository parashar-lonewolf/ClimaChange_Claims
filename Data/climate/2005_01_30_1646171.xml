        <p>A study by the New York Public Interest Research Group has found that the power plants in Northport and Port Jefferson released more air pollution in 2003 than they did in 1995. The study, which compared Environmental Protection Agency statistics, reported large spikes in particulate pollutants like nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide in 2003.</p>

        <p>A study by the New York Public Interest Research Group has found that the power plants in Northport and Port Jefferson released more air pollution in 2003 than they did in 1995. The study, which compared Environmental Protection Agency statistics, reported large spikes in particulate pollutants like nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide in 2003.</p>
        <p>''Sulfur dioxide emissions are up 202 percent in Northport,'' Eric Bruzaitis, the research group's Long Island coordinator, said after the report was released on Wednesday. ''We know it contributes to heart attacks.''</p>
        <p>But officials at the KeySpan Energy Corporation, which owns the two plants, said the pollutants they release were well within all limits. ''We meet the state, federal and individual permit limits by a wide margin,'' said Bob Teetz, the director of environmental engineering and compliance at KeySpan. ''We are from 25 to 50 percent below the allowable limits. We are 75 percent below levels from the mid-1980's.''</p>
        <p>Twelve years ago, the plants were fitted to burn either natural gas or No. 6 fuel oil, and what fuel is used depends on market prices. When gas is used, the plants run cleaner than when oil is burned, Mr. Teetz said.</p>
        <p>He could not immediately say how much of each fuel was used in 1995 and how much in 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruzaitis said the Northport and Port Jefferson plants are old, and even though they went through upgrades 12 years ago, they were still among the dirtiest in the state. ''What's coming out of those stacks contribute to smog and soot, which increase asthma attacks and cause lung and respiratory illnesses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Beth Fiteni, a spokeswoman for an environmental group called Long Island Neighborhood Network, said that even though the levels of pollutants reported were below government limits, that did not make the air quality any better. ''Long Island has a 7 percent asthma rate among children,'' she said. ''That's 2 percent above the national average.''</p>
