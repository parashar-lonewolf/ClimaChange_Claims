        <p>In her hearings for confirmation as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol Browner spoke of the need for a "new era of communication" between environmentalists and business. As one of her first moves, she has a rare opportunity to work to the benefit of the environment and the economy, resolving a dispute with which she is keenly familiar.</p>
        <p>As head of the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, she led the state into an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department aimed at preserving the Everglades, one of the world's great wetlands. The pact between Florida and the Federal Government called for protecting the area by reducing phosphorus runoff from farmland. The phosphorus, thought to harm native plant species, comes from soil, fertilizer, sugar mills, rain and irrigation water.</p>
        <p>Despite a pro-business reputation, the Bush Administration, through the Justice Department, imposed a cleanup on Florida, requiring farmers to insure that their runoff water is cleaner than rain. The $400 million plan envisages building 35,000 acres of experimental filtering marshes which even some government environmental consultants doubt would work as advertised, and handing the bill to farmers. Sugar and vegetable farmers said that the costs would drive out most of the region's agriculture and, by some estimates, put 20,000 people out of work.</p>
        <p>Because of the huge costs associated with the plan, the Everglades issue is far from settled: the so-called solution makes no attempt to balance the economy and environment.</p>
        <p>Here's a way to break the logjam: adopt a system that allows pollution credits to be traded, an arrangement that was successfully built into the 1990 Clean Air Act to curb acid rain. The idea is to have government set targets for phosphorus reduction but give farmers maximum flexibility in achieving them.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department plan made no attempt at a fair distribution of public and private responsibilities for cleaning up the Everglades. Initially, farmers were to pay for everything, no matter how much of the phosphorus problem they actually caused. Then there was talk of an arbitrary deal, dividing costs between agriculture and government.</p>
        <p>While any division of environmental responsibility is arbitrary, people should be asked to pay to clean up only the part of the problem they cause. In the Everglades, farmers should be responsible for making sure that the level of phosphorus in water leaving their land is no greater than the rain and irrigation water that comes on in the first place. If government thinks the water should be cleaner than that, then it has an obligation to pay for the cleanup.</p>
        <p>The key is to allow farmers to decide how best to reduce the phosphorus. Each farm would receive one credit for each pound of phosphorus it may put into public canals. Farmers whose water is easily cleaned up can sell their credits to others. That way, farmers will have a powerful market incentive to invest in new cleanup technology -- a Clinton Administration goal -- and costs will come down for everyone.</p>
        <p>This market is intended to make pollution prevention pay. Farmers may well discover they can remove more phosphorus than they now believe is possible, thereby lowering public cleanup costs too. As the history of technological progress has always shown, where there is an incentive, someone finds a way.</p>
        <p>Government may end up building filter marshes to meet some of its own cleanup responsibilities. Then the question will be which level of government should pay. As E.P.A. Administrator, Ms. Browner can help see to it that the Federal Government faces up to its share of blame for the problems in the Everglades.</p>
        <p>Washington has poured money into a vast canal system near the Everglades that supplies water and controls floods, but it has hurt the environment by rerouting natural waterways and disrupting native life.</p>
        <p>The Everglades, a national treasure, has received short shrift for too long. Ms. Browner can achieve an early victory if she can gain the support of environmentalists and farmers for a pioneer plan that could be the model for environmental policy for decades to come.</p>
