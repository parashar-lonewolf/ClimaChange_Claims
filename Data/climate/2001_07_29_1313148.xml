        <p>Editorial warns that US must not simply walk away from treaties with which Bush administration disagrees, and says more responsible approach is to work with other countries to modify accords</p>

        <p>During the presidential campaign, George W. Bush often said that a country as powerful as the United States should be humble in its relations with other nations. That was good advice, but since taking office Mr. Bush has shown a surprising disdain for the kinds of treaties and international agreements that set the tone for America's engagement with the world and that have figured prominently in Washington's foreign policy for most of the years since World War II. The administration's hostile attitude communicates a sense of arrogance and contempt for international cooperation that ill serves American interests.</p>
        <p>This page favors preservation or adoption of the treaties that the Bush administration opposes. But we recognize that in the case of recently negotiated accords, any new administration has a right to reconsider draft agreements endorsed by its predecessor and to propose revisions more in keeping with its own philosophy. Washington clearly has an obligation to make sure that international agreements do not undermine American security. But unless a treaty is fatally flawed, Washington should not abruptly walk away from the agreement. The more responsible answer is to work with other countries to modify the accord.</p>

        <p>During the presidential campaign, George W. Bush often said that a country as powerful as the United States should be humble in its relations with other nations. That was good advice, but since taking office Mr. Bush has shown a surprising disdain for the kinds of treaties and international agreements that set the tone for America's engagement with the world and that have figured prominently in Washington's foreign policy for most of the years since World War II. The administration's hostile attitude communicates a sense of arrogance and contempt for international cooperation that ill serves American interests.</p>
        <p>This page favors preservation or adoption of the treaties that the Bush administration opposes. But we recognize that in the case of recently negotiated accords, any new administration has a right to reconsider draft agreements endorsed by its predecessor and to propose revisions more in keeping with its own philosophy. Washington clearly has an obligation to make sure that international agreements do not undermine American security. But unless a treaty is fatally flawed, Washington should not abruptly walk away from the agreement. The more responsible answer is to work with other countries to modify the accord.</p>
        <p>As the world's strongest economic and military power, the United States has a compelling interest in helping to expand and shape international law on matters from arms control to the environment to criminal accountability. Mighty as it is, Washington cannot expect to lead the way to a less dangerous, more law-abiding and environmentally sustainable world from the sidelines.</p>
        <p>The administration's record in this regard is dismal. In January, even before Mr. Bush took office, his spokesmen declared that he would not seek Senate ratification of the treaty creating the International Criminal Court. In March, the White House announced that the United States was withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. In May, Mr. Bush made clear he was ready to set aside the constraints of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in order to test and build missile defenses.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, American delegates insisted on diluting a United Nations agreement to reduce illegal trafficking in small arms. Last week, Washington pulled out of long-running efforts to negotiate enforcement provisions for the convention banning biological weapons. Meanwhile, the administration has indefinitely deferred seeking Senate ratification of the 1996 nuclear test ban treaty and the 1993 nuclear weapons reduction treaty with Russia negotiated by Mr. Bush's father.</p>
        <p>The flaws in imperfect treaties can generally be fixed, whether through further negotiations or in the Senate ratification process. Last week, representatives of nearly 180 countries met in Bonn to refine the Kyoto Protocol. Important changes were made that addressed previous American complaints. But instead of engaging in serious negotiations in Bonn, Washington's representative was instructed to stand aside.</p>
        <p>The administration has also so far ignored a useful opportunity to address many of the objections it has raised to the nuclear test ban treaty. Early this year, Gen. John Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, proposed steps that Washington could take on its own to strengthen verification of other countries' compliance with the ban and assure that America's own stockpile of nuclear warheads remained reliable in the absence of testing. Yet the White House has shown no interest in the Shalikashvili recommendations.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's negative approach has all but scuttled efforts to enforce the global biological weapons ban. Unanimous agreement is needed to produce a new draft accord. Other countries are moving ahead with the Kyoto Protocol, but efforts to slow global warming will be badly weakened by the refusal of the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases to participate. The future of the ABM treaty remains in doubt.</p>
        <p>This is not a productive role for the world's leading country and the architect of much of the international law created over the last half-century. Contempt for the concerns of other countries will only erode American influence.</p>
