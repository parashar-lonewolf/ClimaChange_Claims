        <p>LEAD: Fear of attack by 3,100 tons of Long Island garbage brought the Mexican Navy into action on the weekend.

        <p>Fear of attack by 3,100 tons of Long Island garbage brought the Mexican Navy into action on the weekend. Ships, planes and helicopters under orders to keep the garbage out of Mexican waters apparently discouraged the assault, for when last heard from the garbage was meandering around the Gulf of Mexico, and possibly headed for the United States coastline.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile back in Long Island, the story of the garbage's odyssey was posing grave image problems. Frank Jones, Supervisor of Islip, the garbage's birthplace, deplored a situation in which ''Islip's garbage has become the laughingstock of the Eastern Seaboard.''</p>
        <p>Mexico was not laughing, however. One Mexican newspaper objected to Islip's ''turning us into their very own garbage dump.'' The paper discerned and denounced a ''veritable crime against our patrimonial sea.''</p>
        <p>This saga of industrial waste began March 22 when it put to sea aboard a tugboat-drawn barge out of New York bound for points south. Although Islip has a 75-acre landfill for its municipal garbage, the town has forbidden the interment of industrial waste there since last winter, and a private contractor is operating the present tour.</p>
        <p>In the past five weeks the shipment had been denied entry to American territory all the way from North Carolina to Louisiana before heading toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, and wise guys had started calling it ''The Garbage Without a Country.''</p>
        <p>As many people have noted, however, this is not as funny as it sounds. While the United States is churning out astonishing quantities of garbage, people are not as hospitable as they used to be about having it dumped at the beach or on the empty lot next door.</p>
        <p>It is the nature of wealth to create garbage. This truth is enunciated in the ancient saying of the Lancashire philosophers: ''Money's muck.'' An American translation of this might be, ''Filth makes wealth makes filth.''</p>
        <p>The consequences of this principle have been overlooked by our Cassandras. The fantastic wealth of America probably means we are doomed to expire neither of fire, nor of ice, nor even of nuclear folly, but of terminal garbage, and so, not with a bang nor even a whimper, but with a lonely belch from the last citizen buried under discarded plastic containers that housed the nation's final hundred billion fastburgers.</p>
        <p>This may be very reassuring, especially to people who live in dread of nuclear winter, but in the meantime there is the practical problem of how to dispose of 3,100 tons of Islip garbage now at sea. It doesn't seem very difficult to me.</p>
        <p>What, after all, is the American teen-ager for?</p>
        <p>Last Sunday morning, as every Sunday morning, I spent the usual time clearing the lawn and sidewalk of plastic trays, shattered soda-pop bottles, empty beer cans, discarded cigarette packages and all the other familiar scrap generated by American youth's Saturday night orgies. We have all been cleaning it up since 1953, when the onset of affluence razed the awkward age and erected the youth market on its site.</p>
        <p>Kids with money to burn not only generate garbage galore, they are also generous about giving it to strangers. I happen to think they are also very public-spirited and would gladly contribute if asked to help solve Islip's problem.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, I weighed the waste material left on my property and environs Saturday night. It came to slightly less than two pounds. This is hardly a back-breaking weight for a healthy adolescent to throw from a moving car. By enlisting those people who constantly propagandize about American youth's need to exercise more, I believe we can induce as many as 10 million civic-spirited young folks to raise their Saturday night garbage ejections to five pounds per teen-ager.</p>
        <p>Solving the immediate Islip problem, however, would not require all 10 million to pitch in - or, more accurately, perhaps, to pitch out. Consider these figures: Islip garbage at sea: 3,100 tons, or 6.2 million pounds.</p>
        <p>Number of teen-agers required to throw 6.2 million pounds of garbage on strangers' lawns and sidewalks, at the rate of 3 pounds per adolescent: 2,066,667.</p>
        <p>We assume, of course, that each adolescent will throw the usual two pounds of personal garbage in addition to the extra three pounds of Islip's.</p>
        <p>Yes, obviously this will put a burden on people who do the Sunday morning cleanup. A few of them will doubtless whine. There are always malcontents. I urge them to count their blessings and give thanks they are not Canadians being pelted with acid rain.</p>
