        <p>In a small cafe in a town called Nolsoy, on an archipelago in the middle of the North Atlantic, surrounded by barflies and the blue fug of cigarette smoke, I am trying to be unobtrusive. This is not going so well. There are precisely two occupied tables in the establishment, the barflies' and mine. At mine, English is spoken, pallid beer is sipped, and all eye contact is avoided. At theirs, they speak a derivative of Old Norse, drink a rigorous liquor and shoot glances my way, accompanied by throaty chuckles. I, in fact, look not only like an American and a tourist, but also like an idiot, having walked up onto the quayside at Nolsoy, through its most famous landmark -- the bone archway formed by the massive jaws of a sperm whale -- and into its one bar wearing a flotation suit. A giant, puffy, one-piece flotation suit. Ten minutes ago, thudding across freezing harbor waters in a Zodiac, a flotation suit had seemed like a good idea. Now it makes me look like a Power Ranger. The chuckles are starting to crescendo. As I exit the place, from behind me I hear, ''Zay hallo to George Bush.''</p>
        <p>Nolsoy is a higgledy-piggledy little village, and the locals in its one bar are fishermen on extended hiatus. On a Sunday, Nolsoy's few aimless streets are deserted, as is the eerily well-kept football pitch that straddles the waterfront. The men, ominously, have filed out of the bar behind me. But when they approach, they approach tentatively, almost shyly, until one finally speaks. ''You are American, yes?'' ''Yes.'' ''We have something we want to show you.'' I follow them down the slope of the village, toward the harbor, where they lead me to a small, padlocked boat shed. In the middle of the shed sits an exquisitely handcrafted rowboat -- a kind of modern Viking variation on the old New England dory, with a raised prow, a small mast stacked with running lights and the words ''Diana Victoria'' painted along its stern. So this is it, I think. This is Ove Joensen's boat.</p>
        <p>If you are to understand the Faroe Islands, maybe the most curious place left on earth, you would do well to start with Ove Joensen's boat. Joensen was a sailor in Nolsoy who, in his spare time, built the Diana Victoria by hand, and for one purpose only: to row the 900 miles, via the Shetland Islands, all the way to mainland Europe. Joensen wasn't a glory seeker; he wanted to raise money for Nolsoy so that it could afford a new town swimming pool. Nonetheless, in 1986, when he arrived in Copenhagen and leapt out of the Diana Victoria to kiss the statue of the Little Mermaid, he was greeted by a roaring throng -- there are about 10,000 Faroese living in Denmark -- as cameras threw the images back to the Faroes on live TV. Joensen had completed the brutal task in just 41 days.</p>
        <p>The men around the Diana Victoria relay the story carefully, piece by piece, each detail of Ove Joensen's life laid out delicately, like a tiny wreath. They conclude by telling me, mostly in gestures, that after the journey, Joensen's hands never fully unfurled. Three months after his triumph, he slipped on the deck of a boat and slid into the icy waters below. Ove Joensen, whose feat is still celebrated in the Faroes with festivities every August, was dead by a freak accident at the age of 39. In the interior gloom, the men's eyes glint with pride as their hands stroke the flanks of the rowboat. When I note how unusually small the blades of Joensen's oars are, one of the men snorts and says, ''That's your problem. Why are your oars so big?''</p>
        <p>The Faroe Islands are an archipelago of 18 upthrusted hunks of igneous rock in the middle of precisely nowhere, the stretch of North Atlantic halfway between Norway and Iceland. It is oddly temperate, thanks to the currents of the Gulf Stream, and oddly green, thanks in part to the two million pairs of seabirds -- guillemots, fulmars, storm petrels and, of course, the famously cute puffins -- that carpet the islands in guano each breeding season. The Faroes are easily the most moodily beautiful place I have ever been. Each island is a giant slice of elaborately tiered basalt, tilted to one side and covered in green, tussocky felt. Streamer clouds, almost mannered in their perfection, encircle the mountains. Rocky cliffs, topped in arêtes and tarns, plunge into the sea, while up from the water jut massive, looming sea stacks. It rains here a lot, and waterfalls flow pretty much continuously. Driving to my hotel from the airport, the only thing I could make out through the mist was the dull nacre of the rills, dozens of them, snaking their way down the sides of the mountains.</p>
        <p>Vikings settled the islands more than a thousand years ago, and almost 50,000 of their descendants now live here, sharing space with 75,000 more or less freely roaming sheep. Although the Danes took formal possession of the Faroes in 1380 and have never fully relinquished it, ''We are not Danish'' is a common refrain here. (When a country woman said it to me, her eyes flashed hotly before settling back into Scandinavian stolidity.) No, the Faroese are nothing if not Faroese. They speak their own language, recite their own sagas, dance their own raucous chain-formation dance (based on the old French branle simple) and still sing quarter-note, Gregorian-like chants. Their icon remains the turf-roofed house. When the Vikings first arrived, they made rock foundations in the shapes of their boats, turned the boats over on top of the rocks and then, to stabilize and insulate these makeshift houses, put sod on the hulls of the boats. It is not uncommon to come upon a Faroese mowing his roof.</p>
        <p>To this day, when a Faroese man, looking out to the harbor, cries ''Grind,'' every man in town, from the barkeep to the mayor, drops what he is doing, reaches for a metal implement and sprints toward the water. The cry means whales have been spotted, are being herded into the harbor and now need to be slaughtered, in a ritual called a grindadrap. Within minutes, the harbor waters are drenched in red and the corpses of pilot whales lie on the dockside in a row. The precious meat and blubber is distributed, first according to who spotted and who killed, then according to need, with a special emphasis on the elderly, sick and poor.</p>
        <p>Early in my stay I visited with Eydun Dal-Christiansen, an artist and a stonecutter whose torso is so huge I thought he had to be wearing a chest protector beneath his shirt. (He wasn't.) Dal-Christiansen lives on the main island of Streymoy, a short drive outside of Torshavn, at 18,000 inhabitants Europe's smallest capital. Dal-Christiansen builds sinewy lamps out of stones he quarries while hiking alone in the mountains. Sitting in his kitchen, over instant coffee and diced-up candy bars, he told me that he considered his stones to be living things and added slowly, in halting English, ''Here in the Faroes, we live close to nature. Up in the mountains, in the fog, nothing can harm you.'' I had been struggling to understand the Faroes, and then one thing occurred to me: for being so unapologetically sexist, Faroese culture permits an immense and spiritual tenderness on the part of Faroese men. And for being so isolated, the Faroes may be the last place in Europe where you can still succumb to a mystical Yeatsian reverie, and without so much as a hint of kitsch.</p>
        <p>Jah, Jah, come in, come in. In the Faroe Islands, everyone invites you in. The wives serve coffee, then disappear. The men drink coffee and talk. And in recent times, the men talk about oil: ''We have just one leg to stand on. The fish are not enough. If we find oil. . . .'' More than 95 percent of the islands' exports come from fishing, but oil companies are prospecting in Faroe waters. A discovery would allow the Faroese to maintain their comfortable European lifestyle -- thanks in part to a large Danish subsidy -- but more in accord with their self-image, as a fiercely hardscrabble and thoroughly un-Danish people. Over and over again, I was cautiously supplied the latest rumor: ''You know, they had Champagne flown in to the rig last week.''</p>
        <p>The Faroese speak English well -- maybe not as flawlessly as the citizens of mainland Denmark, but they're often fluent or near-fluent. ''Oh, yes, thanks to MTV we learn it early now,'' John Eysturoy, my contact at the modest tourist board, tells me. ''The town council tried to take MTV away in the '90s, but the young people held a protest. So they took away BBC World instead.'' Dal-Christiansen and Eysturoy are old friends, and in the former's kitchen, they alternate between ripping on each other mercilessly and reflecting carefully on the status of the Faroes. Early in the Cold War the United States and NATO deemed the Faroes strategically important, stuck an early warning system on one of its mountaintops and told the Danes, in no uncertain terms, to increase their subsidy to the islands -- to use the teat, in other words, to stave off a growing independence movement. In a generation, with the help of a robust fishing industry, the Faroese went from village poverty to zesty, car-loving, suburban-style affluence.</p>
        <p>And yet the islands have stayed essentially an ancient place. In part, this is a matter of scale. You could fit the entire Faroese population in Rose Bowl -- almost twice over. ''That's the stupid thing about the Faroe Islands,'' Eysturoy says, pointing at Dal-Christiansen. ''One hour after he's done something stupid, I know about it.'' Unlike, say, the Shetlanders to their south, the Faroese have carefully preserved their language. (I was introduced to a snow-haired man in a tweed jacket, a professor known as ''the protector of the Faroese tongue.'' He is tasked with creating new words in Faroese, for things like ''helicopter'' and the ''at'' sign in e-mail.) And compared with the Icelanders to their north, their rituals have yet to be taken over by the trappings of tourist simulacra. ''In Iceland, you can see a Viking town, but it is not real,'' Eysturoy tells me.</p>
        <p>Eysturoy is a soulful hangdog of a 50-something man. He loves the Faroe Islands deeply, but honestly, and applies his favorite epithet -- ''stupid'' -- to them liberally. After about 10 minutes in his acquaintance, I knew I had a friend for life, but I did manage to step out of bounds once. I had lamented having missed, by a scant 10 days, a whale kill, and as we sat drinking at his men's club in Torshavn, trading insults, I asked Eysturoy if he would kindly swim out into the Atlantic and lead a pod of pilot whales in a chain dance. At this he grew silent. There is no funning the grindadrap, a source of both considerable pride and anxiety to a native islander. Greenpeace used to agitate about the kills, in spite of the fact that the pilots are not endangered and that the Faroese use every ounce of every one of the 1,000 whales taken in an average year. ''The kills are very humane,'' Eysturoy said. ''A veterinarian designed the method.'' I tried to make up for my blunder by asking him, ''So, if someone yelled 'Grind' now, you would head to the harbor?'' Without pausing, Eysturoy replied, ''Of course. Or I would not be Faroese.''</p>
        <p>Later, a few miles out of Torshavn in Kirkjubour, the most ancient of ancient places in the Faroes, Eysturoy holds an old whaling knife up to my nose. The smell of blubber on the blade is rich and dank. The knife, like everything in Kirkjubour, is very old. Settled life began here more than a millennium ago. With no trees (hard basalt lies too close to the surface of the soil), all the early houses were built out of driftwood. Kirkjubour's original sod-roof farmhouse, known as the Roykstovan, still stands, and is the oldest inhabited wooden structure in Europe. Here, more than anywhere, one feels the spirit of the Faroe Islands. ''Roykstovan'' means ''smoke room,'' and everything happened in this, the one room where the tribe could afford to make a fire, by burning peat. They slept, ate, combed wool, slaughtered and danced the chain dance for days to keep blood flowing through the bitter cold. It is in this farmhouse, beneath its hulking, fire-singed beams, that Eysturoy encourages me to take in the smell of a grind knife, and says pointedly, ''This is not a place for gold and silver. There is nothing that glitters in this house.''</p>
        <p>As we're preparing to leave, we run into Joannes Patursson, whose family has lived in the house and on its surrounding farmstead through 17 generations. This fact, so astounding to visitors, remains wholly unimpressive to him. ''I don't think of it much,'' he says, leaning on the bumper of his pickup. His young sons run out of the truck and chase each other toward the house. ''Jah, jah, that is Generation 18.'' Will they grow and farm the land, as Joannes has? ''Maybe. They're still boys. You never know.'' How did the land stay intact for so long? And here I learn the most incredible fact about the scarcely credible Faroese: they have retained the custom of primogeniture. Leaseholds are impartible -- that is, if you are the eldest son, you get everything, and if you are a younger son, you get nothing but screwed. ''You can't split it up, or else you destroy it,'' Eysturoy says, gesturing to the farmstead.</p>
        <p>A helicopter from one of the offshore rigs suddenly judders by. ''Maybe in the future we will find a well, get some oil,'' says Patursson, the most deeply phlegmatic man alive, with a shrug. ''The Shetlanders themselves did not benefit from it.'' He looks up to the sky and sniffs. It has done nothing but rain since I arrived, but he says, ''Tomorrow it will be clear.'' A heavy downpour continued through the following morning. And then, just as Patursson said it would, the mist lightened and turned to fleecy strands, backed by merciful patches of blue.</p>
        <p>The coastal village of Tjornuvik is a small cluster of timber houses with a population of about 70. It lies snugly slotted in the hollow of a massive glacial bowl, facing an equally massive ocean channel formed out of an Ice Age fjord. The setting is almost laughably sublime. Hulking mountains shelter the channel, which funnels a roaring surf right up to the village's front edge. In choral reply, waterfalls cascade down from the high escarpment behind the village. Out in the distance loom Risin and Kellingin, the two most iconic sea stacks in the Faroe Islands, known as ''the witch'' and ''the giant.'' (As legend has it, the two ne'er-do-wells were towing the Faroes from Norway to Iceland when the sun came up, and they turned to stone.)</p>
        <p>Once a year, on a Saturday in early fall, well-heeled professionals make the hour's drive from Torshavn to Tjornuvik for the Stakksdagur, the festal day that inaugurates the community's slaughtering season. In spring, a handful of rams are abandoned to the most remote corner of the village commons, to roam wild over the summer. Come autumn, the village men don traditional Faroese caps, sing traditional Faroese hymns and then, carrying seven-foot spiked wooden fence poles, make the punishing mountain hike to fetch the rams. The men build a makeshift pen from the poles, into which they herd the panicked animals, who are hiked back down the mountain and, with much fanfare, into the village. There they are slaughtered and put up for auction.</p>
        <p>The year before my visit had marked a milestone: the first woman was allowed to join the Stakksdagur. This year, I will be its first weak-ankled vegetarian. The leader of our party is a young man named Jogvan, whose family has farmed and shepherded in Tjornuvik for generations. Jogvan is about 30, with jet-black hair and a pair of black swoosh eyebrows set atop a rectangular face. ''You like American football,'' Jogvan says cheerily. ''We, we like collecting sheep.''</p>
        <p>After a round of hymning, a group of about 30 of us ascend to the tottering uppermost heights of a headland, then descend, fully off-trail, into the massive inner rim of a neighboring cirque. The Faroese, it goes without saying, are experienced hikers, as measured by the near total absence, even after hours of precipitous climbing, of dirt anywhere above the sole of their boots. My jeans, meanwhile, are quickly mud-spackled up to the thigh. The hike is exhausting, and I lag badly.</p>
        <p>After crossing a long alpine meadow, we finally arrive at a cliff edge suspended over the sea. Karis, the pioneering suffragette from the previous year, kindly hikes alongside me. ''So where are the rams?'' I ask, and she laughs. Karis, who looks to be in her early 20s and has hennaed hair and blue-saucer eyes, points out to the water. Hundreds of feet offshore, rising hundreds of feet out of the surf, sits a grass-topped sea stack. ''You're joking.'' Karis shakes her head solemnly and laughs again. The sea stack is reachable only by a crude trolley of a welded aluminum chair rigged up with pulleys on a ropeway suspended 400 feet above roiling whitecaps. We will have to tow ourselves across the chasm, two at a time, and make our high-wire return with rams on board. ''We all have to die sometime,'' Karis says, and I understand perfectly. The spirit of Ove Joensen is everywhere in the Faroes.</p>
        <p>Crossing to and from the sea stack goes off without a hitch. The return hike is less difficult, and I fall in with Jonhedin, a native of Tjornuvik who now works as a jack-of-all-trades (a journalist, D.J., teacher and, of course, shepherd) in Torshavn. ''My grandparents would say to me, 'You romanticize village life. We were poor. We owned a quarter of a cow,' '' says Jonhedin, who loves Tjornuvik but refuses to sentimentalize it. ''They were tenant farmers. They lived off of land they didn't own.''</p>
        <p>Later, Jonhedin and I stand together in a makeshift basement slaughterhouse. (Every house in Tjornuvik and most village houses in the Faroes have such an abattoir. ''We live with death, here in the Faroes,'' he says, fully aware of his double entendre.) Here the first ram of the season will be slaughtered. A cartridge gun drives a bolt into the ram's brain, shuddering its body, and then its throat is slit. I've never seen a slaughter, and I watch intently. Blood pours down from the opened throat. The ram kicks and kicks, and death spreads through its body. The blood falls into a bucket, and the bucket is stirred continuously, to prevent clotting, so it can be used later for sausage. ''We use every part of the ram except for the feet and part of the stomach,'' Jonhedin tells me as he holds out the stirrer. The blood clots instantly, and looks like freshly pulped raspberries.</p>
        <p>This ram had grazed in the wild for six months. All the water it consumed came from sea breezes and wet grass, so there's little fat between its dermis and its tissue. To skin the animal without breaking its hide, a very large man in a blue rubber apron and rubber boots, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, repeatedly drives his hand up into the carcass, both with great force and great care. The village elders look on, goading him with clucks. A father holds up his toddler son to afford him a better view. Between strokes, the man plunges his hands into a bucket of cold water and swigs from a schnapps bottle, then sets upon the ram again, his entire body torquing like a Greco-Roman wrestler's. Finally, the hide separates and -- success! -- the carcass is laid on a dressing table, severed hooves in the air, its hypodermis an unbroken white balloon. The chest cavity is opened, the organs carefully removed, the stomach pumped with water and lanced. The waft of cut grass instantly fills the room.</p>
        <p>Over coffee in the kitchen of Jogvan's in-laws, a small group gathers to discuss the day's events. The rams have come in light this year. Jonhedin blames global warming. ''There were fewer sand eels this year,'' he explains. ''The puffins eat fewer sand eels, they fertilize the grass less, the sheep weigh 10 pounds less.'' The conversation drifts away from the Stakksdagur. ''There is a rumor,'' says Jogvan. ''Someone at the airport says the drilling crew ordered a case of Champagne to be choppered out to the rig.'' A round of slow nods. The men of Tjornuvik are convinced that the Faroe Islands, should they discover oil, will do with its riches what Tjornuvik would: create a giant community development fund. Jah, jah, a development fund. More careful nods. Then Jogvan says, ''Of course, I'd like to buy a Humvee, and all that.'' Laughter, as Jonhedin adds, ''A solid-gold Humvee. Now, can you imagine Jogvan driving up the mountain in that?''</p>
        <p>That night I call John Eysturoy to tell him about my remarkable final day in the Faroe Islands. Jah, jah: he had already heard.</p>
        <p>A week later, at home in Brooklyn, idling in front of my computer, I Google ''Faroes,'' ''discovery'' and ''oil.'' The story I click through to reads: ''Drilling by Statoil off the Faroe Islands has been completed. No commercially viable oil or gas volumes were found.''</p>
        <p>ESSENTIALS: FAROE ISLANDS</p>
        <p>GETTING THERE: The easiest way to arrive is through Copenhagen, from which there are several daily flights on Atlantic Airways (www.atlantic.fo). Atlantic also flies from Reykjavik, Iceland; London; and (summer only) Aberdeen, Scotland.</p>
        <p>LAY OF THE LAND: It's easiest to get around the islands by car and ferry. Most visitors base themselves on Streymoy, which is home to the capital city, Torshavn. Of the remaining 17 islands, those most worth visiting are the beautiful Suduroy; Mykines, for bird watching; Eysturoy, for its charming fishing villages; and Koltur, which is inhabited by one couple and has medieval ruins (you can reach it only by an inexpensive Atlantic Airways helicopter flight).</p>
        <p>HOTELS: Hotel Foroyar Pleasant hilltop property, overlooking the harbor and the city, with a good restaurant. Torshavn; 011-298-31-75-00; www.hotelforoyar.com; doubles from $228. Hotel Torshavn Right down by the harbor, and recently refurbished. Torshavn; 011-298-35-00-00; www.hoteltorshavn.fo; doubles from $193.</p>
        <p>RESTAURANTS, CAFES AND BARS: Café Natur Great bar popular with locals, with good bar food and live music. Aarvegur 7; 011-298-31-26-25. Gallari Jinx Café Good coffee and simple snacks. Aarvegur 3; 011-298-31-71-01. Restaurant Gourmet New upscale restaurant with serious culinary aspirations. Gr. Kambans Gota 13; 011-298-32-25-25; entrees $18 to $40.</p>
        <p>SIGHTS AND ACTIVITIES: The best overall resource is the Bradt Travel Guides' Faroe Islands (Globe Pequot, $22); for a list of festivals, hikes and events, go to www.visit-faroeislands.com. In Torshavn, stop by Nordic House (011-298-35-13-51; www.nlh.fo), which offers exhibits, seminars and concerts, and the National Gallery (011-298-31-35-79; www.art.fo). On Streymoy don't miss the beautiful drive to the village of Saksun. The old schooner Nordlysid (www.nordlysid.com) sails around the islands; Captain Birgir Enni will take you to the grottoes and bird cliffs and to Nolsoy, and will also feed you great seafood.</p>
