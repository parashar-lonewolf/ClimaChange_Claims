        <p>With state regulators drafting a bill to begin deregulating New Jersey's power industry in October, a coalition of environmental groups yesterday called for provisions to insure that deregulation would not lead to increased air pollution.</p>
        <p>The coalition, which includes the American Lung Association and New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, urged the State Board of Public Utilities to prohibit out-of-state coal-burning power plants from selling electricity in New Jersey unless they meet strict pollution standards, said John Guinan, a spokesman for the coalition.</p>
        <p>Currently, about one-third of New Jersey's air pollution comes from other states, Mr. Guinan said.</p>
        <p>The coalition also wants to require utilities to charge customers about $2 a month toward research into renewable energy sources and energy efficient products, he said.</p>
        <p>Geraldine Mehu, a spokeswoman for the utilities board, said the bill, which would have to be approved by the State Legislature and signed by the Governor to become law, is in its preliminary stages. She declined to comment on its specific provisions.</p>
