        <p>FOR years, prestigious scientific competitions like the Intel Science Talent Search (more familiar by its former name, the Westinghouse program) were dominated by high school students from such science powerhouses as Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech and some Long Island  schools.</p>
        <p>But in the last few years, Westchester County has had strong showings. With the announcement last week of the 40 Intel Finalists -- including Meredith Arfa, Hayley Barna and Eve Henry, all from Byram Hills High School in Armonk  -- it is clear that something is going on up here.</p>
        <p>What that something is has a lot to do with Dr. Robert Pavlica and his  Authentic Science Research Program. Originally started at Byram Hills High School a decade ago -- where 27 students have since become Intel semifinalists -- the program has been adapted at most of the county's high schools and embraced by the New York State Regents as a three-credit course. It has also been replicated in schools in California, Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey. The program allows high school students, who are enrolled in it for three years, to earn up to 12 college credits for their work.</p>
        <p>Drawing on the methods he had learned as a Ph.D. candidate in biochemistry at St. John's University, Dr. Pavlica developed the basics for the program. Students are expected to develop their own topics, do literature searches, find professional scientists to mentor their work, and make regular presentations about their progress to their peers.</p>
        <p>So what's his secret formula?</p>
        <p>Q. What's the difference between science laboratory courses, which all have a hands-on element, and the Authentic Science Research Program?</p>
        <p>A. The students choose their own research, and choose their own mentors to assist them. They are engaged in real-world problems, on the cutting edge of science, whether it's in psychology, chemistry, biology or physics. Some of our students are working with brain mapping, some doing cutting-edge cancer research. Students realize that there are real-world consequences to what they're doing.</p>
        <p>Q. How important is the Intel competition -- or any other scientific competition?</p>
        <p>A. It depends on who you ask. An educator is truly interested in the process of the student thinking critically, analyzing data, determining what is relevant data from insignificant data. The students are doing and writing cutting-edge research, which would be publishable in peer review journals. That's the reason educators want, or should want, the program. And if you do all that perfectly, then you will do well in the competition.</p>
        <p>But the focus should be on the student being engaged in scientific inquiry. Somewhere in these students' heads is the cure for cancer, the cure for AIDS, the solution to global warming or the solution to problems that haven't even been asked yet. Of course, if they win the Intel, that's wonderful. But if you focus on the Intel, you won't do good research and you won't win an Intel. The focus has to be on the research.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you select students for the program?</p>
        <p>A. There is no screening done in this school; it's all self-screening. It  begins at the end of ninth grade, and once the student gets involved in the  science process, either the student latches on to the scientific process or  decides not to pursue it. The students come in with all their hopes and  dreams, and as they go through the research process, they get a sense of self and realize they love this type of work, or they don't. Nowhere, ever, should a teacher screen a kid. In Byram Hills, we've had three children in special education who've won as Intel semifinalists.</p>
        <p>Q. How does it actually work?</p>
        <p>A. It has to be scheduled as a regular course, not as something that meets before or after school, or squeezed into lunch. Every other day, there is a class for the entire group, where students do oral presentations and learn the essential steps of scientific methods. Then every two weeks, each student here meets with me to discuss what they've done during the past two weeks -- the journal articles they've read, the research they've done, the contacts with the mentor and how they're progressing. If the teacher knows more about the topic than the student does, then the student doesn't know enough. Students should be at an undergraduate understanding of their work.</p>
        <p>Q. The professional scientist who acts as a mentor is a critical ingredient to your program. How do you get mentors?</p>
        <p>A. If you use my method of getting mentors, you have a 90 percent success rate. The student starts with a topic, does research on the Internet,  discusses the articles with me and finds out who the significant players are in the field. Once the student has identified the key researchers, the student writes an e-mail to the scientist or professor, discussing exactly what's been written by the potential mentor on the topic, and asks for help with the student's research. The professor knows that here's a mind that wants to work.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 11, 2001, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about Dr. Robert Pavlica, who started a program that has helped students compete in the Intel Science Talent Search, omitted the name of a finalist from Westchester. He is Vinod Nambudiri of Blind Brook High School.</p>
