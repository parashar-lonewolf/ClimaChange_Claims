        <p>Trust me,I'm ecologically responsible. Like you, I worry about the environment and our gluttonous thirst for fossil fuels. But when the car-rental agent at the Tucson airport asked what kind of vehicle I wanted, I lapsed into an out-of-body reverie through which I heard myself say, ''Well, actually, uh, I'd like the biggest, grossest, most outrageous S.U.V. you've got.''</p>
        <p>I'm sure I would have answered differently had I not lived in Tucson for two years during the early 1980's and had I not remembered that there was absolutely nothing in the world I loved more than riding (with my husband, Howie, who does the driving, a skill I've never entirely mastered) through the desert in a vehicle high enough off the road to provide the most panoramic view of southern Arizona's gorgeous mountains, cactuses and sky. And as soon as we left the airport, it all came streaming back: the feel of the air, like a swath of dusty silk blowing lightly over my face, and the smoky-sweet musk that rises from the desert after a rain or on a blessedly cool night after a hot day.</p>

        <p>Trust me,I'm ecologically responsible. Like you, I worry about the environment and our gluttonous thirst for fossil fuels.

        <p>I'm sure I would have answered differently had I not lived in Tucson for two years during the early 1980's and had I not remembered that there was absolutely nothing in the world I loved more than riding (with my husband, Howie, who does the driving, a skill I've never entirely mastered) through the desert in a vehicle high enough off the road to provide the most panoramic view of southern Arizona's gorgeous mountains, cactuses and sky. And as soon as we left the airport, it all came streaming back: the feel of the air, like a swath of dusty silk blowing lightly over my face, and the smoky-sweet musk that rises from the desert after a rain or on a blessedly cool night after a hot day.</p>
        <p>One pleasure of revisiting cities where you lived while you were young and struggling is that your older, more comfortable self can check into the hotels that you once could only eyeball with envy. The Arizona Inn turned out to be just as luxe and sybaritic as I'd imagined when I'd passed its pink adobe walls 20 years ago. Within those walls is a 1930's Southwestern-style Art Deco compound: 14 acres of lush lawns and flower beds surrounding little salmon-colored cottages. Ours had its own patio with a pair of chaise longues, on one of which I stretched out to call my friends in blizzard-wracked New York for a faux-casual chat about the weather.</p>
        <p>Fewer than 70 miles from the Mexican border at Nogales, Tucson is a little like Miami, in that being there makes you feel as if you've briefly left the United States. Unlike Miami, it's not an easy place to get to -- I could find only one convenient nonstop flight a day from New York. That may be why Tucson has yet to be discovered, at least by Northeasterners, as the charming, authentic, semi-exotic paradise that it is. It's Santa Fe without the cuteness factor, Palm Springs without the lingering ghost of Bob Hope. And it's got a funky, Wild West edginess that I find irresistible, though I realize the sight of grizzled hitchhikers with guns protruding from their pockets may be an acquired taste.</p>
        <p>While much about the city has changed drastically since I lived there -- surging real estate prices have fueled an urban growth spurt, extending the metropolitan area far up to the north -- much has stayed the same or, more surprisingly, improved. These days, it takes a while longer to leave the city and get to the wilderness, but even now a short drive out Speedway Boulevard (once known as America's ugliest street, although most of strip-mall U.S.A. has since caught up) takes you to the western portion of the Saguaro National Park.</p>
        <p>It's best to go in the early morning or at sunset to see its spectacular light and abundant animal life. But at any hour, it's thrilling to round one of the sharp curves that lead to Gates Pass and catch a glimpse of the craggy mountains. They are covered with giant cactuses, some of them as tall as 50 feet, standing with their multiple arms raised like prickly outer-space aliens.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the park has steadily upgraded its facilities, but I'd suggest that the first prize for most improved goes to what is also, in my opinion, the most haunting and beautiful place in the vicinity of Tucson: San Xavier del Bac, the so-called White Dove of the Desert, a Moorish-Byzantine-Mexican-Renaissance church that rises like an iceberg stuck in the sand. The interior decorations -- geometric designs, depictions of angels, saints and Madonnas floating amid trompe l'oeil lintels and drapery -- have been refurbished and restored, and the gilded main altar of the church has been brightened to the point at which the whole interior seems to jump and pulse with color, energy and life.</p>
        <p>But the truth is, I didn't go to Tucson for the architecture.</p>
        <p>Many of my fondest memories of the place, like my fond memories of most places, have to do with food, like the quesadillas that are so light that they appear to levitate off their metal wedding-cake stands at El Torero in south Tucson. Alternately, I might recapture the past in the form of a couple of franks at Pat's Drive-In, a 1950's-style takeout joint (the whole point is to eat in your car) that has been around forever and that serves its specialty with terrifyingly generous sacks of wonderful, skin-on French fries.</p>
        <p>El Torero and Pat's were exactly as I had remembered them, which seemed like positive proof that, no matter what they say, you can go home again. To find the kind of street food that you get in Mexico, we resorted to a time-tested method: we rode around till we saw the cafe with the maximum number of pickup trucks in the parking lot. That's how we found ourselves feasting on thick, magnificently spicy shrimp, tacos and horchata (a cold, slightly chalky almond milk drink) at Pico de Gallo.</p>
        <p>Our lunch took place on the day before we were supposed to leave, so already I was experiencing that preemptive nostalgia that makes you miss a place even while you're still there. And on the actual day of our departure, I found it hard to drag myself away. I kept forgetting things, misplacing things. Was there time for one last swim? And when we finally got into our S.U.V. and headed to the airport in Phoenix, about 120 miles away, I persuaded Howie to take a very wide detour for one last ride through the Saguaro National Park. We stopped and hiked up a trail 10 minutes or so into the mountains.</p>
        <p>The cactuses were backlit by the pale morning sun so that their spines glowed with an incandescent white aura. The air smelled of mesquite, and as we watched, some kind of desert bird -- Was it a grouse? A grackle? -- scurried across our path. I felt a pure bliss that brought me back to the time when I'd lived there, and as I reluctantly trudged back to the big gas guzzler ready to take us one step closer to home, I promised myself not to wait another 20 years before I felt that particular brand of happiness again.</p>
