        <p>THE next time the batteries in your laptop or cell phone conk out at the most inconvenient moment, take heart.</p>
        <p>Scientists are fine-tuning an invention that may eventually replace not only those fallible batteries but even the recharger.</p>
        <p>The invention is the fuel cell, a device that may one day sit neatly inside your mobile phone or laptop. It uses the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity for days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery.</p>
        <p>Fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars, buses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for the subkilowatt world of portable electronics. They may soon come to the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters who are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs, rechargers and spare AA's.</p>
        <p>Some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power source that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery on the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen.</p>
        <p>''Fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy from the hydrogen atom,'' said Christopher Dyer, a senior member of the technical staff at Motorola Labs in Tempe, Ariz., who is the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable electronic devices.</p>
        <p>The principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when hydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced. The energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat.</p>
        <p>The byproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of water vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the fuel cell.</p>
        <p>Give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is provided free in the atmosphere, Dr. Dyer said, and they could power devices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. The hydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided by methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that contains hydrogen, Dr. Dyer said.</p>
        <p>''A liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a laptop for more than a week,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''A lithium ion battery of comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.''</p>
        <p>Lithium ion batteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours of energy.</p>
        <p>Fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output, Dr. Dyer said.  They can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which require a slow recharging.  Dr. Dyer imagines that owners of cell phones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by occasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol.</p>
        <p>''Methanol is inexpensive,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''Ampuls of it could be bought from a supermarket.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent interest in them is. They were demonstrated in the 19th century and deployed more than a century later to provide electric power for NASA's space vehicles. But the internal processing required to produce that continuous stream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for daily applications.</p>
        <p>That is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually lowered costs. At the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington, Va., Robert Nowak, a program manager, said research sponsored by the agency would aid the overladen American soldiers who routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions.</p>
        <p>''Fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider what you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer, radio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel cells his agency has helped to develop. Like many people in the field, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a battery and a small fuel cell. The battery provides peaks of power when needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged.</p>
        <p>''In principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell from time to time,'' Dr. Nowak said. ''The battery will supply any transient power that exceeds a baseline level.''</p>
        <p>While most small fuel cells are more common in research laboratories than in factories, the H Power Corporation in Belleville, N.J., is a commercial producer of subkilowatt fuel cells.</p>
        <p>One type it makes provides backup power for road signs with changing messages like ''Congestion Ahead'' or ''Parking Lot A Is Full.''</p>
        <p>''The fuel cell is the backup for the solar panel,'' said Rene DuBois, director of sales and marketing at H Power.</p>
        <p>Variable road signs with solar panels can go dead when, for instance, snow covers the power source, and a fuel cell can keep the system operating and fully charged.</p>
        <p>Many experts in the field predict that fuel cells will be widely accepted in part because battery development will be unable to keep up with consumers' demand for lightweight electronic products.</p>
        <p>''The small-electronics-equipment market is quietly demanding more and more energy,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''The rate of progress in battery development is probably too slow to meet this demand.''</p>
        <p>The bright screens, souped-up processors and whiz-bang features of the latest laptops, cell phones and other portable devices are insatiable users of batteries. Consumers may not be carrying 20- to 30-pound packs, as the soldiers do, but many of them are routinely hefting 12 to 14 pounds apiece once the weight of the power cord, recharger and spare battery is calculated along with the weight of the laptop.</p>
        <p>But fuel cells are not going to supplant batteries just yet. ''Not a single one is fully functional in a piece of portable equipment,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''It's early days for the fuel cell. I think it will be coming soon, but it isn't quite here yet.''  WHAT'S NEXT</p>
