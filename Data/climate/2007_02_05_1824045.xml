        <p>Senator John Kerry keeps to himself around the Capitol. He is always rushing somewhere, head down, disappearing into elevators. A Senate loner for 22 years, Mr. Kerry seems all the more isolated now as he darts past the media hordes around the next set of presidential seekers, colleagues that include Hillary Rodham Clinton, John McCain and Barack Obama.</p>
        <p>Even in the best of times, Mr. Kerry's face hung droopy and funereal, one of the most weary in American politics. Today, Mr. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who was the exit poll president-elect for a few hours in November 2004, endures the peculiar pariah status that his party reserves for its losing nominees.</p>
        <p>''America does not tolerate losing, even though it's through losing that we learn the most,'' said David Thorne, the twin brother of Mr. Kerry's late first wife, Julia Thorne, and his closest friend. ''People want fresh faces. Or they think they do.''</p>
        <p>As the 2008 campaign begins in earnest, Mr. Kerry has been forced to adapt to something resembling a normal Senate life. This has been no small challenge for a man whose identity has long been steeped in becoming president, or trying to.</p>
        <p>Last week, days after he announced he would not run again, Mr. Kerry said there was no point to dwelling on what might have been. ''You know, that's such a waste of time right now,'' he said in a Capitol hallway interview. ''I came close, but so what? I didn't make it, so move on. Just go forward. There's no sense going backwards.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry ratified his status as Dead Candidate Walking in an emotional speech on the Senate floor two weeks ago. ''We came close, certainly close enough to be tempted to try again,'' Mr. Kerry said, referring to his 2004 campaign.</p>
        <p>Only two colleagues attended his announcement, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a fellow Massachusetts Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada (another, Senator Ken Salazar, Democrat of Colorado, walked in late). ''I have concluded this is not the time for me to mount a presidential campaign.''</p>
        <p>The grave Kerry face was on stark display that day, his voice breaking at times. When it was over, Mr. Reid hugged him and said he loved him, and then Mr. Kerry left the chamber by himself.</p>
        <p>His announcement could have been a dignified valedictory moment. But the enigmatic Mr. Kerry is often misunderstood, and several news reports said he had cried when saying he would not run; in fact, he choked up earlier in his speech when talking about an Army captain he had met in Iraq who had been killed.</p>
        <p>No matter, the photo of Mr. Kerry breaking down ran prominently in the Drudge Report and elsewhere. It buttressed the notion of John Kerry as the forlorn loser who had finally bottomed out. It also served as a grim visual to another round of Kerry abuse, conjuring up the caricature of him as a helmet-haired, flip-flopping elitist.</p>
        <p>''Who will the windsurfing caucus back now?'' a columnist for The Boston Herald wisecracked. A cartoonist for The Times-Picayune of New Orleans mocked Mr. Kerry as saying, ''Actually I was for another White House bid before I was against it.'' A few days earlier in a new book, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, became the latest party bigwig to pan Mr. Kerry's 2004 campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry says he finds it ''freeing'' not to be a presidential candidate. ''Hopefully, the things I say and do will not be taken in the light of a presidential race anymore,'' he said. ''And I think that's positive.''</p>
        <p>He will seek re-election in Massachusetts next year and says he is looking forward to immersing himself in Senate life, particularly on issues related to the Iraq war. Mr. Kerry has sought counsel from Mr. Kennedy, who himself returned to the Senate after a bitter primary defeat and went on to have a storied career as a lawmaker.</p>
        <p>Yet to many eyes, Mr. Kerry will always be trapped in yesterday's news and lingering disappointment. He is a member of the tiny club that knows what it is like to lose an election to George W. Bush -- to blow an election, by some accounts.</p>
        <p>At least Al Gore was allowed to slip away, grow a beard and come back when he was ready. Mr. Kerry had to return to his very public job, hear all about how ''winnable'' his race was, how ''unlikable'' a candidate he was and how ridiculous it would be for him to consider ever trying again. His name elicited instant eye-rolls among many former supporters.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kerry held out hope. Last year, he campaigned for Democrats, wielding an impressive e-mail list, bankroll and political network. He kept his options open. Until, finally, he shed what had been the guiding aspiration of his career seemingly from its outset.</p>
        <p>''Your heart goes out to him,'' Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, said in a brief interview a few days after Mr. Kerry said he was not running. ''It just isn't easy to shift your ambitions away from something that's been his ambition for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Running for president -- or losing -- hardly makes Mr. Kerry unique among senators (scores have run, but no sitting senator has been elected since John F. Kennedy in 1960). But Mr. Kerry stands out for coming so close, and people who know him say it has made it all the harder to give up. ''He is a stubborn, competitive guy, and it must have been very, very hard to get those words out,'' said Jim Jordan, a former Kerry campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Senate colleagues and staff members say Mr. Kerry struggled to reintegrate himself in the Capitol after losing to Mr. Bush. He was never much a creature of the Senate to begin with, an outcast with few close friends there and a reputation for aloofness and occasional grandstanding. His solemn bearing betrayed a certain joylessness in his job. (''John Kerry walks into a bar,'' goes the Washington version of the old joke. ''Bartender says, 'Hey, Senator Kerry, why the long face?' '')</p>
        <p>Shortly after he returned to work, Mr. Reid gave him a stern talking-to and urged him, in so many words, to get off his high horse and rejoin the team, according to a senior Democratic staff member.</p>
        <p>But after laying the groundwork for a return engagement, Mr. Kerry stumbled just before November's midterm elections, when he told what he called a ''botched joke'' that appeared to denigrate the intelligence of American soldiers in Iraq. Democrats distanced themselves from him, Republicans ridiculed him, and Congressional candidates dumped him on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>He was defiant, refusing to apologize at first, offering explanations that he was criticizing Mr. Bush and not the troops. But few people wanted to listen. '' 'Please stop it,'' Don Imus, the radio talk show host and a Kerry friend, urged him on the air. ''Stop talking. Go home.''</p>
        <p>As the 2008 presidential campaign takes shape, friends say it has annoyed Mr. Kerry to keep hearing about how formidable his onetime running mate, John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator, might be.</p>
        <p>Friends say that Mr. Kerry feels betrayed by Mr. Edwards, whom he defeated easily in the 2004 Democratic primaries and faults for being too quick to second-guess their campaign, distance himself from it and embark on his own 2008 effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards was also spared the flagellation that losing Democratic nominees typically endure. Republicans are kinder to their also-rans. Bob Dole lost to Bill Clinton in 1996, but has remained a gray eminence within the party. Barry Goldwater was slaughtered by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 but later became a patron saint of the conservative movement. Richard M. Nixon lost narrowly to John F. Kennedy in 1960 but ran again and won in 1968.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry and his surrogates always emphasize how warmly he is still received whenever he ventures out of Washington. ''John was treated like a rock star in Switzerland,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, who traveled to Davos, Switzerland, with Mr. Kerry and other colleagues last month for the World Economic Forum.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is precisely the kind of compliment that feeds an impression of Mr. Kerry as a high-society jetsetter who is more at home overseas than among everyday Americans. Sure enough, Mr. Kerry was being pilloried anew by Republicans last week for saying in Davos that the United States had become an ''international pariah'' under Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry genuinely seems not to care about such criticism these days. He still wears his burdens plainly, but the burdens could be shifting.</p>
        <p>''You can be more focused when you're not running,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''You can actually get something done on the issues instead of running around as fast as you can.''</p>
        <p>He is still running plenty fast. Mr. Kerry is hard to catch up to, probably by design. He zooms by, gone before you know it. He was seen dashing through a press-crammed Capitol after President Bush's State of the Union address.</p>
        <p>''Can't now; got to go,'' Mr. Kerry said after a news conference about climate change last week. He was off to the Senate for a vote, then exited by another door 20 minutes later.</p>
        <p>''I'm running, I'm running,'' Mr. Kerry told a reporter. He boarded an elevator with fellow senators and fixed his gaze straight ahead.</p>
