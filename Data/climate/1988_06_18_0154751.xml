        <p>LEAD: Weather specialists studying the drought in the Middle West this year have determined why it occurred. But they are wondering whether it is a harbinger of things to come, perhaps evidence of basic changes in climate brought about by the ''greenhouse effect.''</p>
        <p>Weather specialists studying the drought in the Middle West this year have determined why it occurred. But they are wondering whether it is a harbinger of things to come, perhaps evidence of basic changes in climate brought about by the ''greenhouse effect.''</p>
        <p>For months a great wall of high pressure air over the central United States has prevented storms bearing rain and snow from penetrating that region, according to specialists of the National Weather Service. The high pressure was locked in place by a jet stream far north of its normal position.</p>
        <p>As a result, the agency said yesterday, precipitation has been abnormally high in the Northeast and the Northwest even as the Middle West has suffered.</p>
        <p>Concern was expressed yesterday that the resulting drought might offer a glimpse into what Dr. Alan D. Hecht, the director of the National Climate Program Office in Rockville, Md., called ''the greenhouse world'' of the future.</p>
        <p>Is the drought, he asked, ''the kind of thing we will see more of?'' A Change in the Weather?  A number of weather specialists have been searching for signs that world climate is changing as a result of warming caused by carbon dioxide from the burning of fuel. This is the much-discussed greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>With the information now available, Dr. Hecht said, an obvious relationship is still uncertain.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hecht, whose office is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he hoped Dr. Charles W. Stockton at the University of Arizona could determine, from the widths of annual tree rings in much of the West, whether droughts in the last three centuries had been as prolonged and widespread as this one.</p>
        <p>Not since the dust storm period of the 1930's, Dr. Hecht said, has a drought been so extensive. He would like to know how exceptional this one is. Rings and Rainfall</p>
        <p>Annual rings in trees growing in the region over the last 300 years have been analyzed at Dr. Stockton's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Researchers are trying to find out whether occurrences of narrow rings, indicating drought, conform to a 22-year cycle of solar activity. The results have been inconclusive.</p>
        <p>David Miskus of the Analysis and Information branch of the National Weather Service said that from December to February a high pressure region off the West Coast had kept storms away, leading to low precipitation there.</p>
        <p>The high pressure wall then moved east to its present position over the central states.</p>
        <p>In winter and spring, according to Dr. Donald Gilman, long-range forecaster of the Weather Service, the jet stream normally heads east after crossing California, carrying storms over the Middle West.</p>
        <p>This year, however, the jet stream has split, Dr. Gilman said. The main branch has swung north across Oregon. Near Hudson Bay it has curved southeast across New Hampshire and has joined the lesser branch over the Atlantic Ocean after the latter has crossed northern Mexico and Florida.</p>
        <p>The drought now affects most of the Mississippi-Missouri drainage systems, reaching from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers are extremely low. The Tennessee Valley has been short of rain for several years, according to Dr. Gilman, and the shortage has lowered reservoirs enough to threaten power production.</p>
