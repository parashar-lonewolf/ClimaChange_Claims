        <p>LEAD: The disastrous Alaska oil spill, for which corporate apologies and assurances are poor compensation, is scarcely a cloud with a silver lining. It may provide a new impetus for environmental protection and restoration, but the damage done by the Exxon Valdez and its masters will have been done, and much of it will never be undone.</p>
        <p>The disastrous Alaska oil spill, for which corporate apologies and assurances are poor compensation, is scarcely a cloud with a silver lining. It may provide a new impetus for environmental protection and restoration, but the damage done by the Exxon Valdez and its masters will have been done, and much of it will never be undone.</p>
        <p>Even as the cleanup - clearly too little and too late - goes on in Prince William Sound, some economists and environmentalists have told The Times that meeting the ozone standards of the Clean Air Act is proving so difficult and so expensive that it may no longer be worth the effort. Some want to make the standard easier to meet; others want to relax enforcement.</p>
        <p>One reason, they say, is that major sources of ozone, an irritating component of smog, already have been attacked. No major gains, in this view, can be made by further industrial or vehicular controls; so the emphasis now must be on individual actions that would require far-reaching behavior changes by many Americans - for example, reduced or no use of such common items as household cleaning fluids, gasoline-powered lawn mowers, hair sprays, charcoal lighter fluid and a variety of frequently used chemicals.</p>
        <p>Environmental Protection Agency scientists told The Times that to impose effective national restrictions on such emissions - as Southern California officials already propose to do -would cost perhaps $20 billion a year, and require ''controlling legislation.''</p>
        <p>But why should relaxed standards or enforcement be preferable, difficult and costly as meeting the standard may be? The tough requirements of the Clean Air Act may never be fully met in all localities, particularly urban areas, but that's a reason to redouble efforts, not to ease them. And though some scientists may believe that trying to control ozone levels in smog is not worth the cost, that kind of cost-benefit ratio is imprecise and often misleading when it comes to health - particularly the health of children, who are most vulnerable to ozone damage to the lungs.</p>
        <p>Nor is changing people's behavior all that formidable to contemplate. Tobacco smoking, for one good example, has been drastically reduced in this country without anything like ''controlling legislation.'' Consciousness has been raised, at the least, against driving under the influence of alcohol; and any legislation involved was of a kind already on the books in most states and cities, but with stiffened penalties. Aerosols in spray cans have been virtually eliminated, as manufacturers developed new methods.</p>
        <p>Most of the products that might have to be banned or restricted in the fight against smog, in any case, have been in use only in recent decades. They are undeniable conveniences but not exactly necessities of life, such as food, water and air. And the taxing power of the Government could make some of these conveniences too expensive to be any longer desirable.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the lesson of the Alaska oil spill is more, not less protection of the only world we have to live in. At the least, the Exxon Valdez disaster means Congress cannot legitimately open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge - as it has been about to do - to oil explorations. Not only would that have undesirable effect on the refuge itself; it threatens more disasters like the spill in Prince William Sound.</p>
        <p>The oil companies, naturally, will protest that they can prevent such spills in the future, or contain their effects. But that's what they said 15 years ago when a tanker route to the West Coast was chosen over a trans-Canadian pipeline for North Slope oil. If they did know how to avoid or minimize spills, a dubious proposition, they grew complacent over the years, a tendency always to be expected.</p>
        <p>President Bush says oil drilling in the wildlife refuge has to proceed because we need the oil. But we need the refuge, too, and the wildlife - both parts of the great ecological chain that makes the planet habitable and both irreplaceable. Oil that remains in the ground, however, can be replaced if there's the human will to do it - which is what a President needs to encourage at this crucial time in human history.</p>
        <p>The energy that oil would provide - at great cost, not least in further global warming - can be replaced, over time and with effort, by conservation measures that as recently as 10 years ago were pursued by Americans without complaint, and by new steps of greater severity: by a renewed emphasis on solar devices; by a heavy tax on gasoline to force faster development and greater use of less harmful fuels - by a variety of means that mostly require discipline, encouragement, education and the kind of American ingenuity those responsible for the Exxon Valdez seem to have forgotten.</p>
