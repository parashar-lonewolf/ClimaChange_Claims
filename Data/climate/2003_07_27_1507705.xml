        <p>THIS year is turning out to be the year of wildlife disputes for New Jerseyans. Officials recently approved the state's first bear hunt in 33 years after months of complaints about houses and garages being broken into and people and pets being threatened. Deer, as they do every year, have aroused communities statewide by invading gardens and lawns. But the biggest brawl of all is coming to a head this month, in the gassing of the Canada geese.</p>
        <p>In all the disputes, the question seems to be who is overpopulating whom in the nation's most densely populated state. Animal activists say the proliferation of humans has caused the problems. ''This is really human overpopulation,'' said Susan Russell, policy director for the Center for Animal Protection, a newly formed research and advocacy group based in Rumson.</p>
        <p>Others say, however, that the wildlife numbers are getting out of hand.</p>
        <p>The geese, for example.</p>
        <p>''There's no natural predators for Canada geese, and there's no hunting pressure on them,'' said Nicholas Throckmorton, a spokesman for the federal Fish and Wildlife Service. ''So living's good for them, and they've quit migrating.'' But they have not stopped multiplying.</p>
        <p>The big problem is the excrement that the geese leave on lawns, golf courses, parks -- just about everywhere.</p>
        <p>In Mountain Lakes, the goose droppings became so dense that ''people can't walk on their lawns without sliding,'' said Ellen Emr, chairman of the town's environmental commission. Last summer, several beaches in the lake-dotted community had to be closed because of the prodigious droppings.</p>
        <p>When Mountain Lakes killed 99 geese this month, however, not everyone was relieved. Paul Zimmerman, a sportswriter whose house is on the border of this town and neighboring Denville, was outraged. ''I saw the killers,'' he said, referring to the employees of the United States Department of Agriculture, who gassed the geese in a mobile carbon-dioxide unit, as the ''goose Gestapo.''</p>
        <p>Meredith Petrillo, animal control officer for Denville, found out about the goose round-up through Mr. Zimmerman and was also displeased. ''I was not enlightened, nor was my town enlightened before Mr. Zimmerman called,'' she said. She says that using carbon dioxide to kill the geese violates state animal cruelty laws.</p>
        <p>Similar uproars have been playing out as geese have been destroyed in places like Union County; Colts Neck Township in Monmouth County; Hanover Township, Morris County; and even the Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge in Brigantine.</p>
        <p>This is molting season and the geese cannot fly. As a result, this is the best time to carry out killing operations.</p>
        <p>Lethal efforts to dispose of the geese, technically known as ''depredations,'' require a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service. So far this year, it has issued 68 permits to kill more than 14,000 of the estimated 100,000 nonmigratory Canada geese that make New Jersey their home. The federal Department of Agriculture conducted the Mountain Lakes depredation program and two others, said Janet Bucknall, state director of that department's wildlife services program.</p>
        <p>Both federal agencies recommend various methods to chase away the geese, including setting off fireworks or harassing them with dogs, horns and other noise-making devices. Permits to kill geese are issued only after other attempts have failed. And it is the carbon-dioxide gassing that has drawn ire from animal rights activists.</p>
        <p>''It's a lousy way to go,'' said Ms. Russell, who is also a member of the Coalition to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese, made up of groups throughout the New York area. She says the gas method causes ''indescribable panic and terror'' in the birds.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is the dispute more emotional than in Union County, where 705 geese were killed at four parks under a permit that had authorized the gassing of up to 2,700.</p>
        <p>Although the Union County program has ended for the season, animal rights groups say they plan to pursue their lawsuit against the depredations, contending that the use of carbon dioxide violates state law.</p>
        <p>''The suit is anything but moot,'' Ms. Russell said.</p>
        <p>Both sides said they had received a barrage of phone calls and e-mail messages. Ms. Russell said she had logged calls from reporters as far away as Canada and Sweden. John Salerno, a spokesman for Union County, reported international messages from animal activists as well as local messages of support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salerno described himself as a goose lover. But he added: ''It's not a goose question. It's a question of can the environment they're living in sustain them?''</p>
        <p>Last week, the Center for Animal Protection released a poll showing that 70 percent of New Jersey voters and 61 percent of Union County voters think the gassing method of killing Canada geese should be banned. The poll also found that 56 percent of New Jersey voters oppose killing large numbers of Canada geese by any method.</p>
        <p>The telephone poll, based on random samples of 800 registered voters, half of them in Union County, was conducted from July 14 to 16 and was financed by the Center for Animal Protection.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bucknall said that using carbon dioxide chambers to kill the geese had been approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association as an acceptable and humane method. The two other approved methods are by shooting and by cervical dislocation, or breaking a goose's neck. ''That's not something we want to do,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Health officials say that areas with high concentrations of the birds are at risk for ground and water contamination from droppings. High fecal bacteria levels at Wreck Pond near Spring Lake and Sea Girt have led to many ocean swimming bans in recent years, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bucknall said that her department gets about 500 calls a year in New Jersey from people concerned about the geese. Many of them are worried about the possibilities of becoming sick from goose feces. That medical issue is being studied, she said, but is difficult to prove without actually witnessing someone ingesting goose droppings. She added that the large goose populations are also a hazard to airplanes landing and taking off.</p>
        <p>A project is in the works at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, in conjunction with Geese Peace, a group from Falls Church, Va., to show the effectiveness of other methods to control the geese. These would include shaking eggs to kill developing chicks, using border collies to chase geese and replacing manicured lawns around ponds with tall grasses. Jack Keskey, a spokesman, said the department hopes to announce the selection of a municipality for the demonstration project soon.</p>
        <p>In Mountain Lakes, the dispute has pitted homeowner against homeowner.</p>
        <p>''This is a decision that we came to with a heavy heart,'' said Ms. Emr of the environmental commission. ''Everybody had concerns. None of us are on the environmental commission to kill animals. We love animals. It's a data-driven decision. It took us years.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zimmerman, who lives on a small body of water known as Great Bay and likes to watch the waterfowl from his living room window, continues to refer to those who killed the geese as ''executioners.''</p>
        <p>''I think these people are ashamed of what they're doing,'' he said.</p>
