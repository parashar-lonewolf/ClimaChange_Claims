        <p>COULD a small push nudge the relatively benign and stable world climate of the last 10,000 years into abrupt and frequent cycles of warmth and extreme cold? The question is far from academic, some scientists say, given the possibility that heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide could destabilize today's climate system.</p>
        <p>The climate of the last interglacial period, which at least in its early stages was somewhat warmer than the present interglacial period, fluctuated widely in spans of decades or even less, scientists reported 15 months ago on the basis of climatic changes recorded in corings taken from the Greenland ice cap. But six months later, another group of scientists analyzing another Greenland ice sample suggested that the last interglacial period, which began around 130,000 years ago and lasted 10,000 years by most reckonings, appeared stable after all. They said the first ice sample apparently had been distorted when the bottom of the flowing glacier from which it was taken passed over uneven ground.</p>
        <p>Since then, emerging evidence from several sources has seemed to favor first one side of the argument and then the other. The latest piece of evidence, in the current issue of the British journal Nature, comes from a study of layers of pollen laid down on lake bottoms in Germany and France during the last interglacial period, called the Eemian. (The present interglacial period is called the Holocene.)</p>
        <p>By analyzing pollen patterns, European researchers determined the kinds of trees and shrubs that grew at different times. Evergreens like pines, for instance, are more abundant in cold times, while deciduous trees like oaks abound in warm periods. From this record the researchers deduced that the warmest winter temperatures in the first 2,900 years of the Eemian, on average, were about 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they are today. But the rest of the Eemian, they found, descended often into episodes of severe cold.</p>
        <p>In the coldest of these episodes, when winter temperatures were comparable to those at the end of the previous glacial period, the temperature dipped to 50 degrees below zero Fahrenheit at some points, with an average in the coldest month of 4 below.</p>
        <p>The authors of the paper in Nature were two British paleoecologists, Dr. Michael H. Field of the University of Cambridge and Dr. Brian Huntley of the University of Durham, and Dr. Helmut Muller, a paleogeologist at the Federal Center for Sciences and Resources at Hannover, Germany. Dr. Muller assembled the pollen record, and Dr. Field and Dr. Huntley performed the climatic analysis.</p>
        <p>Other recently reported pollen studies in the Massif Central of France, combined with an analysis of the mineral content of lake deposits there, have likewise suggested rapid climatic fluctuations in the Eemian. But recent chemical analyses of ancient climates, as reflected in the kinds of microscopic organisms found in layers of deep-sea sediment from the North Atlantic, suggests a more stable Eemian climate.</p>
        <p>"At this point we don't really know what happened in the Eemian," said Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a paleoclimatologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.</p>
        <p>While the picture is tangled, said Dr. Richard Alley, a paleoclimatologist at Pennsylvania State University, "I do think there is hope of unraveling it." The studies so far contain "elements of the truth," he said, but "it's going to take looking at a few more records in detail" before it will be possible to "pound the table and say, 'This is true.' "</p>
        <p>He and others say the many contradictions in the evidence may stem from the imprecision inherent in imperfect methods of measurement, or from the likelihood that climatic change manifests itself differently in different parts of the world or both.</p>
        <p>Climatic information as revealed by ice corings, for instance, is considered extraordinarily precise in the upper layers of ice that reflect year-to-year variations. But beneath a certain depth, ice layers become too thin for reliable measurement, and the remainder of the climate record must be estimated through computer modeling or by correlating the ice readings with climatic records in ocean sediments. The layers of pollen laid down on lake bottoms, on the other hand, are subject to distortion by disturbances like ancient fires, windstorms, seismic shocks and soil erosion. "One cannot say either of the systems is completely, clearly and solely a climate signal," said Dr. Huntley.</p>
        <p>Even if all the methods delivered precise and true results, said Dr. Alley and Dr. Huntley, the broad climatic changes they document might be manifest at different times and vary in severity and duration from one part of the world to another, given the complexities of the climate system.</p>
        <p>Many long-term climatic changes do appear to be felt worldwide. Dr. Broecker cites, for example, the cold period immediately preceding the Holocene, called the Younger Dryas, whose impact, he says, is now clearly seen to be global. Furthermore, a number of records -- ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland, ocean-sediment corings from around the world and terrestrial corings from North America -- all place the Eemian interglacial period at roughly the same time.</p>
        <p>The Eemian's climatic ups and downs, as well as its duration, vary from one record to another, however. Most records show it lasting about 10,000 years, but some show it lasting twice as long. Some of the discrepancy may stem from how the period is defined. If it is defined as the supplanting of conifers by deciduous trees, as is commonly done, it lasted about 10,000 years -- roughly as long as the present interglacial period has lasted so far.</p>
        <p>The global climate of the Eeemian materialized differently in various regions, said Dr. Huntley. Pollen studies from 10 European sites have now been made, but not all have been published, he said, and they reveal a consistent geographic pattern: the early Eemian warmth followed by fluctuating periods of extreme cold applied to northern and eastern Europe, but the west and south were relatively stable.</p>
        <p>Even the Holocene, while warm and stable compared with the cold, widely fluctuating climates of ice ages, has not been uniform, Dr. Huntley pointed out. In central North America, the maximum warming took place between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago, and the climate has gradually been cooling -- with many peaks and valleys around the long-term trend -- ever since. But while the early Holocene was warm and dry in mid-America, it was cooler and wetter in the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>Huge swings in climate were routine during ice ages, but scientists have believed until now that they disappeared with the periodic disappearances of land ice in Europe and North America, ushering in stable interglacial periods. But "there weren't any big ice sheets in the Eemian," said Dr. Alley. "That's what's worrisome" about the possibility of an unstable Eemian.</p>
        <p>One concern is that if the earlier Eemian was warmer than now and it then became unstable, the Holocene could follow suit. According to this line of thinking, a present-day warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions could ultimately force the climate system to flip to a new, unstable state. For example, melting of polar ice that dumps large amounts of fresh water into the seas could alter or even halt ocean currents that distribute heat around the globe.</p>
        <p>A quadrupling of atmospheric carbon dioxide could stop the main current in its tracks, computer simulations at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University have suggested. Forecasting future concentrations of carbon dioxide is a highly uncertain exercise, but some scientists believe that at present rates of emissions, a doubling of concentrations is assured some time in the next century and that an eventual quadrupling is possible.</p>
        <p>Fears that global warming might touch off a repeat of Eemian instability constitute "the alarmist view," said Dr. Alley. But as long as the possibility of an unstable Eemian is on the table, he said, "we have to consider the possibility that the climate could do something unstable in short order."</p>
