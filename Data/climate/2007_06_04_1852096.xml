        <p>No Excuses  Concessions of a Serial Campaigner  By Robert Shrum  Illustrated. 521 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $28.</p>
        <p>Among the many stirring words written by Robert Shrum are these: ''Since I was very young, I have had a profound reverence for this office I hold. I've been honored that you, the people, have entrusted it to me. I am proud of what we have accomplished together.'' And about wife and daughter, Hillary and Chelsea: ''Their forgiveness and love, expressed so often as we sat alone together this weekend, means far more than I can ever say.''</p>
        <p>In his new book, ''No Excuses,'' Mr. Shrum -- who ought to be making some -- explains how he wrote that speech for Bill Clinton at the height of the Monica Lewinsky mess, knowing full well that the president was in the midst of ''an unhappy vacation'' on Martha's Vineyard with his wife and daughter. As a political operative with more than three decades' experience in the trenches, Mr. Shrum finds nothing peculiar in bending the truth or writing as a ventriloquist. He just regrets that President Clinton shied away from delivering the Shrum version, and that the Clinton legacy was thus diminished by the president's choice to deliver his own defiant lies instead of the more artful lies of a celebrated speechwriter.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the moral limbo of political consulting, as outlined in sometimes routine, sometimes scorching detail in Mr. Shrum's memoir. Although his writing is curiously bereft of his foremost professional skills -- gripping rhetorical structure and a broad vision of the political landscape -- he illuminatingly outlines the calculations that go into campaigning. And if he writes with a prominent sense of his own access, prescience and importance, he also writes with real experience of political image-making. His book is evidence that there is more to the people who dream up slogans like ''the people, not the powerful'' than great raw material for parody.</p>
        <p>''No Excuses'' would be a much-discussed book even without its candid character assessments. But these are the things that leap out first. Mr. Shrum recalls the soreheaded, temperamental Edmund S. Muskie, who once threw a cigarette-dispensing crystal donkey at him; an icy Jimmy Carter (''behind the reflex smile, there was steel -- but more about his ambition than his convictions''); a rudderless and worried John Kerry; and a John Edwards who, despite having bowled over Mr. Shrum with dazzling presidential potential, will wish this book had never seen the light of day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shrum recalls an Al Gore who undertook one of the most important debates of his life wearing hastily applied orange makeup, cranked up on protein energy bars and diet cola. ''It was a recipe for hyperaggression,'' Mr. Shrum writes, recalling one reason things went badly for Mr. Gore that day. He also writes of Mr. Gore's stretching the truth in ill-advised and unnecessary ways, as when he appeared on a Vanity Fair magazine cover touting global warming as ''A Threat Graver Than Terrorism.'' Mr. Shrum's expert role was to realize that calling this ''the 'other' great threat to our future'' would have been a safer, smarter move.</p>
        <p>The consultant's job description, at least as set forth here, entails hoping the candidate is willing to be manipulated. It also means being ready to say anything, however untrue, when the candidate starts improvising. After Mr. Gore began claiming credit for a Shrum-written speech, Mr. Shrum thought he had to choose between making Mr. Gore look like a liar or simply lying himself.</p>
        <p>So he assured a reporter that Mr. Gore was ''literally, truly and unquestionably'' writing his own words. As he now acknowledges, it would have been possible to finesse this situation and still give an honest answer. ''Everything in the speech reflects what he wanted in the speech,'' his colleague Carter Eskew said of Mr. Gore, ''if you know what I mean.''</p>
        <p>With his acute awareness of the importance of reputation, Mr. Shrum of course uses ''No Excuses'' to bolster his own. No, he has never guided any candidate to a presidential victory, unless you count Mr. Gore's 2000 outcome. (He does.) But the book emphasizes, sometimes to the point of tedium, that he fared better with senators, governors and mayors. And he stresses the importance of the ''Shrum Curse'' (the thing that afflicts losing candidates who employ Mr. Shrum) and the ''Shrum Primary'' (in which competing candidates fight for the privilege of having Mr. Shrum's services) for the simple reason that he enjoys the notion of a Shrum Anything. ''No Excuses'' includes many political emergencies in which the equivalent of a 911 call is a Shrum Summons.</p>
        <p>As ''No Excuses'' makes clear Mr. Shrum arrived at this level of power by being smart, collegial and, whenever possible, frank. He didn't do it by being slick, and he hasn't written a slick book. His warts-and-all insights will make ''No Excuses'' catnip for the politically inclined, even if some of it bogs down in minutiae. And he has packed a lifetime's worth of anecdotes in here, some more revealing than others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shrum has clear favorites (most notably Senator Edward M. Kennedy), and goes to great lengths to present them flatteringly. But he is not beyond telling the story of how his team decided that a slender debate lectern would make Senator Kennedy look heavy. So Team Shrum contrived to snitch these props, substitute bigger ones and make sure the originals wouldn't be found.</p>
        <p>For readers who hold any illusions about the political process, ''No Excuses'' cheerfully dispels them. Do you wonder why candidates often repeat themselves to avoid answering difficult questions? Did you imagine that Senator Lloyd Bentsen's slap to Dan Quayle (''Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy'') happened spontaneously? Mr. Shrum discovered, from a column by Maureen Dowd in The New York Times, that Mr. Quayle was making Kennedy allusions. Then he wrote a great retort. Then came the rehearsing: ''The moment was worded, practiced, and polished in the mock debates.'' Then the line was delivered on television. And then the classic Shrum Spin kicked in.</p>
