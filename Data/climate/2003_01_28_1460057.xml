        <p>Lying like a beached whale in the middle of this vast area, a huge slab of ice lies below a three-foot-thick layer of rocks and boulders. Scientists say it is the world's oldest ice, a buried remnant of a monster glacier that passed by 12 million to 15 million years ago.</p>
        <p>The actual age of the ice is a matter of dispute. Dr. David Marchant, a geologist at Boston University, said he believed that it dated from eight million years ago, based on his understanding of the irregular polygons of rock and debris that blanket the glacier.</p>
        <p>Unlike similar polygons that form in warmer Arctic conditions under the force of melting and freezing water, these Antarctic polygons are dry and form in the absence of water, Dr. Marchant said. They are created when temperature changes produce cracks in rocks and dry rubble falls into the cracks, widening them into deep V-shaped wedges.</p>
        <p>He said some polygon wedges here contained undisturbed volcanic ash from eight million years ago. Because the ice beneath the polygons is sealed in place, he said, it is older than the ash.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Ron Sletten, a University of Washington geologist who spent December here studying the polygons, said the underlying ice could not be that old. Yes, polygons are mostly dry and stable, but the wedges are dynamic rather than sealed, Dr. Sletten said. The buried ice is evaporating at the rate of 150 feet a million years, a trend that means that it cannot be more than a million years old.</p>
        <p>Even if only a million years old, the Beacon Valley ice is at least twice as old as the oldest ice-core samples now in existence, taken elsewhere on the continent, from Lake Vostok.</p>
        <p>Both teams are examining gas bubbles in samples of Beacon Valley ice for clues to past climate. The bubbles may tell exactly how much carbon dioxide was in the air millions of years ago and help settle arguments about what the world was like.</p>
