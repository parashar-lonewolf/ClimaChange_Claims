        <p>Edmund G. Brown Jr. campaigns everywhere wearing a red ribbon looped on his lapel as a show of concern for people with AIDS. On Sunday Gov. Bill Clinton answered a question on global warming by urging the creation of an international trust fund to preserve rain forests, in exchange for letting drug companies do research on their rich plant life.</p>
        <p>"Who knows," Mr. Clinton said. "They might even find a cure for AIDS."</p>
        <p>That sums up the way both contenders for the Democratic Presidential nomination have been courting New York's politically adroit gay and lesbian voters: persistently and respectfully, but subtly.</p>
        <p>Both men have expressed broad support for gay rights and lifting the military's ban on homosexuals, advocated greater spending on AIDS and promised to appoint gay people to senior jobs, including an "AIDS czar" to coordinate Government action. Low-Key Response</p>
        <p>But neither the Arkansas Governor nor Mr. Brown, the former Governor of California, has galvanized the kind of excitement generated four years ago by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who held a rally for gay supporters and invariably listed gay people in the public litany of the membership of his Rainbow Coalition. Of all the candidates in this year's race, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts probably raised issues affecting homosexuals most vocally, but he suspended his campaign last month.</p>
        <p>Now, like other voting groups from labor to liberals, many gay New Yorkers are largely divided between the pragmatic view that Mr. Clinton is the most electable Democrat and the belief that Mr. Brown's crusade of outrage is a better way to press the national party on issues of concern to homosexuals. The gay voters' dilemma is only worsened by the continued growth of the AIDS crisis.</p>
        <p>"You know, we have been out in the streets for 12 years, and it's been 12 years of genocide and neglect," said Maer Roshan, co-editor of NYQ, a weekly magazine aimed at gay and lesbian readers that endorsed Mr. Clinton in this week's issue. "Now we want to beat George Bush and we are willing to search for the person who is most capable of doing it," he said. "Clinton isn't perfect. But I think he is acceptable. Acceptable." 'Too Early' for Choice</p>
        <p>Some gay groups supported Michael S. Dukakis over Mr. Jackson in 1988, also with the rationale that Mr. Dukakis was more electable. But Andrew Humm, a member of the city Commission on Human Rights who supports Mr. Brown, said that was the wrong approach. "It's too early for that kind of practicality," he said.</p>
        <p>"We can be practical in the fall," Mr. Humm said, "and obviously we'll support the Democrat. In the meantime, let's go to the convention and get the platform pushed to be as progressive as possible. I think a Brown Presidency would be a lot of fun."</p>
        <p>Like any group, gay voters are not monolithic, and estimating their political influence is especially difficult because they are largely self-identified. But concern over AIDS, Mr. Jackson's Presidential campaign, the election of Mayor David N. Dinkins with broad gay support and the election of the first two openly gay City Council members last year have all combined to foster political activism.</p>
        <p>Asked recently if he would make a particular push for gay voters, Mr. Brown held a thumb and forefinger together, to explain that they were a small segment of the electorate. But, he added, "My record's very good" on issues of concern to gay people.</p>
        <p>Yesterday at Borough Hall in Brooklyn, Mr. Brown supported a plan by Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, to fight the AIDS epidemic on the national level.</p>
        <p>Both Presidential candidates have taken some pains to highlight their support for gay rights without alienating other voters. Both oppose the idea of a Federal law legalizing marriages between people of the same sex, preferring to leave that up to the states.</p>
        <p>Late Saturday, after newspaper and television news deadlines had passed, the candidates held low-key meetings with separate groups, Mr. Brown with Mr. Humm and about a dozen gay-rights advocates in Greenwich Village, and Mr. Clinton with a coalition of two-dozen not-for-profit AIDS advocacy and service groups in his midtown hotel.</p>
        <p>The Clinton meeting came nine days after the candidate had a rude encounter with the intensity of feeling over AIDS when he was heckled by a member of Act Up, who accused him of dying of ambition while others were dying of AIDS.</p>
        <p>After the Saturday meeting, leaders of groups from the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Act Up and the Latino Commission on AIDS said they were especially pleased with Mr. Clinton's pledge to make a major AIDS policy speech soon -- to a general audience -- and to have a person with AIDS speak at the Democratic National Convention in Madison Square Garden in July.</p>
        <p>On some issues, participants said, Mr. Clinton hedged, saying he could not pledge expanding Medicaid benefits to cover all people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, who meet income eligibility standards without knowing more about the effect it would have on state budgets.</p>
