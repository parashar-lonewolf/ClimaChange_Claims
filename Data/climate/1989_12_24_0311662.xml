        <p>LEAD: For the third year in a row, mountain resorts in Europe's Alps are expecting a brown Christmas instead of a white one.</p>

        <p>LEAD: For the third year in a row, mountain resorts in Europe's Alps are expecting a brown Christmas instead of a white one.</p>
        <p>For the third year in a row, mountain resorts in Europe's Alps are expecting a brown Christmas instead of a white one.</p>
        <p>In Switzerland, virtually the only skiing is at resorts with ski runs on glaciers, which are open the whole year anyway, and those with snow-making machines.</p>
        <p>Yet for the time being, hotels are filled, and no one seems particularly worried. ''Generally, even in the lower-altitude resorts, the booking situation is astonishingly good,'' said Hans Keller of the Swiss tourist office.</p>
        <p>Resort officials and hotel owners say vacationers reserve their accommodations for between Christmas and New Year's well in advance. They say there have been very few cancellations.</p>
        <p>Even if skiing is limited, some vacationers are happy just to sit in the sun at outdoor cafes. Most Alpine resorts offer an array of alternative activities, ranging from guided nature excursions to fondue evenings to hang-gliding lessons. And many local tourist boards have halved ticket prices for ski lifts and mountain railroads, to allow visitors to hike or sightsee.</p>
        <p>''People won't spend their money on ski lifts, but they'll still spend it on hotels, tea rooms, cinema,'' said Daniel Max, president of an association of innkeepers, ski-lift operators and sporting-goods merchants in Chamonix, France.</p>
        <p>The only ones who are suffering, he said, are the lift operators and sporting goods stores. ''If there's no snow, people don't buy new equipment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Three consecutive years of late snow are not that unusual. ''You hear people blaming all sorts of things, like the global warming trend or the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl,'' said Jean Brissaud, director of Chamonix's tourist board. ''But the meterologists tell us it is not at all exceptional.''</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is the popular expectation of deep snow by Christmas. But the idea of white Christmases ''is a bit of a fiction'' in the Alps, said Cyril Aubert, a climatologist with the Swiss National Institute of Meteorology.</p>
        <p>''The snow will arrive sooner or later,'' Mr. Aubert said. But no forecasters are prepared to predict about how this winter will turn out.</p>
        <p>Last winter it began to snow heavily only in mid-January, and the possibility of a repetition worries innkeepers. After the traditional family vacation week ends on Jan. 1, people go to ski resorts only to ski.</p>
        <p>''If we have no snow by the beginning of January, that's when we'll start having problems,'' Mr. Brissaud said.</p>
        <p>With billions of dollars invested in ski lifts, hotels and urban amenities, resorts throughout the Alps have become more vulnerable to the caprices of nature. ''In former times, people didn't react like nowadays, when there's such a lot of business involved,'' said Joe Luggen, director of the tourist office in Grindelwald, Switzerland. Many Alternatives Offered</p>
        <p>Like many of the large resorts, Grindelwald has gone to great lengths to come up with alternative activities, like children's games and films in the afternoons, torchlight walks in the evening and cultural activities of all kinds. It keeps fitness clubs open until late at night, and it opens summer hiking trails.</p>
        <p>For determined skiers, it is promoting helicopter skiing, off-slope skiing, and ski-touring - each with licensed guides - on the higher, snow-covered elevations above the ski lifts.</p>
        <p>Some feel it would be better if people tried more to adapt themselves to the natural environment of the Alps, rather than adapting the Alps to the ski industry.</p>
        <p>A small but growing Alpine ecology movement is highly critical of the concrete vacation villages that have been built, especially in the French Alps, and of the defacing of mountain slopes by bulldozers to enlarge ski runs.</p>
        <p>There is also criticism of the growing use of snow cannons at ski resorts. Environmentalists say that the cannons waste energy and water and that vegetation is affected by the unnaturally deep snow cover.</p>
        <p>''There is enough air and water pollution,'' said Hans Weiss, director of the Swiss Foundation for Landscape Protection and Management. ''We shouldn't increase the stress on the Alpine environment for such dubious purposes.''</p>
