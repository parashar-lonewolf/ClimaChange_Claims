        <p>Almost no one foresaw the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979 and the price collapse of 1986. Engineers in the 1950's were stunned by the idea that nuclear power meant cheap, limitless energy and stunned again in the 70's that it did not. New inventions, regulations and political developments rush onward, sometimes offering vast changes, but often doing no more than offering.</p>
        <p>What is next on the horizon?</p>
        <p>Here are three glimpses of the future, each of which might prove a turning point -- or a mirage. They are the large-scale direct production of electricity from sunlight, the establishment of workable agreements that would foster the use of renewable energy sources and the peaceful use of surplus plutonium from nuclear bombs. Photovoltaic Cells</p>
        <p>Photovoltaic cells, which make electricity directly from sunlight without emissions, are waiting in the wings. While they are far too costly today to compete with conventionally made power, they are useful in devices that would be expensive to wire to the power grid, like irrigation pumps, roadside signs and emergency call boxes. And with breakthroughs in the laboratory and factory, the price of the cells is rapidly falling.</p>
        <p>When and where will they reach the magic price level and begin to displace power from coal, oil and natural gas? With a little extra help in the form of research money, maybe next year, in White Pine, Colo. Advocates of "renewable" energy say a cluster of 33 houses high in the Rockies could become the Kitty Hawk of solar power.</p>
        <p>White Pine, which is 110 miles southwest of Denver and 7 miles up a dirt road, is tied to the Public Service Company of Colorado's electric system by a line that crawls five miles over an 11,300-foot mountain pass. The 70-year-old line is still functional but perilously close to the tops of the winter snow drifts, and the utility fears that the wire will be a hazard to skiers. The utility wants something done by the end of the summer of 1993; replacing the line would cost $130,000.</p>
        <p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a Government research institution near Denver, and Public Service drew up an alternative: a 35-kilowatt solar cell array, coupled with batteries that would store the energy if it was not needed when the sun shone. The cells would provide two-thirds of White Pine's electric needs; the rest would come from a generator running on propane.</p>
        <p>The cells and the generator are off-the-shelf parts. But the utility would have to develop a control system to keep track of how much electricity the cells produced, how much was in the batteries and how much was being consumed. The system would run the propane generator when needed.</p>
        <p>"There is nothing quite like this in America, where a complete community in America would be serviced like this," said John Thornton, a photovoltaic expert at the Energy Department who works at the renewable energy laboratory.</p>
        <p>According to Chuck Rhodes, senior planning engineer at Public Service of Colorado, the alternative system would cost $500,000. Photovoltaic cells are now most commonly found on pocket calculators, but White Pine, said Mr. Rhodes, would teach energy engineers more about utility-scale applications. The cells that would be used in the White Pine project would produce energy at a cost more than triple that of electricity from old-fashioned coal-fired plant.</p>
        <p>The company does not think its other electricity customers should pay for the White Pine experiment and is looking for financing from the energy laboratory and others to make up the difference.</p>
        <p>If the solar project is built, said Mr. Thornton, "it will give confidence to other utilities, so other people say, 'Yeah, that's possible.' " If the price of solar cells falls by half again -- as it has done several times -- it would be economical in some locations, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhodes agreed. "It's inevitable that the price will come down," he said. "It's a question of how long, 5years or 20 years."  Renewable Energy</p>
        <p>Regulators have debated for years how to set prices for electricity in a way that gives appropriate advantage to power from renewable energy, like wind, sun or trees, which do not pollute or deplete natural resources. Now, the Bonneville Power Administration, which serves the Pacific Northwest, has taken a concrete step in that direction.</p>
        <p>The administration, a Federal agency, announced in December that it wanted to sign purchase contracts with independent electricity producers, a common way for utilities to get new power supplies. But Bonneville said its contracts would specify that if over the agreements' 20-year lives Congress imposes a tax on pollutants, including one on carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause global warming, the tax would be paid by the electricity seller, and not by Bonneville. The possibility of such a tax might discourage a builder of conventional generators.</p>
        <p>According to Gary L. Fuqua, deputy assistant administrator of Bonneville, if the generator bears the risk, "renewables" have an advantage in the bidding, because they do not emit carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Energy experts say that most existing contracts are silent on the question of new taxes, and this clause represents a new direction, though Bonneville is not certain whether it will affect the bids it will receive.</p>
        <p>But an independent producer who planned to use a conventional source like natural gas might go to Lloyd's of London for a policy guarding against a pollution tax, Mr. Fuqua said, and the price of that policy could give the edge to another technology. Or, as a precaution, a company that planned to use fossil fuels might add a few tenths of a cent to its price, giving an advantage to renewables. Or a company that specializes in plants that run on fossil fuels might decide not to bid, leaving the field open for renewables. Surplus Plutonium</p>
        <p>A political shift, the end of the cold war, has produced a problem and an opportunity in nuclear power. The United States and the Soviet Union are disassembling thousands of nuclear weapons with tons of plutonium, which can power reactors as well as bombs.</p>
        <p>Disassembly is a very small step because the bulk of the work involved in making nuclear weapons is in preparing the plutonium. In this case, the plowshare can be quickly converted back into a sword.</p>
        <p>But the plutonium can be safely disposed of in a nuclear reactor. And while the precise amounts involved are classified information, it is clear that only civilian power reactors can do the job.</p>
        <p>"We should do it damn fast," said Ersel A. Evans, a consultant and former vice president of the Westinghouse Hanford Company, which for years ran a big weapons installation for the Government. "There are hundreds of tons of plutonium out there," he said, raising the possibility that the owners could rebuild bombs, or some could be diverted by a third party. "If we're horrified by it, why don't we do something?"</p>
        <p>On its face, this would also seem to be an opportunity, since making uranium fuel for utility reactors requires extensive, painstaking preparation.  Like surplus k-rations, the bomb plutonium would seem to be available for peacetime use.</p>
        <p>But no one is jumping.</p>
        <p>"I don't think the utilities would be wanting to volunteer for that sort of thing," said John J. Taylor, vice president for nuclear power at the Electric Power Research Institute, a not-for-profit consortium in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>Loading plutonium fuel would require a license amendment, and that requires public hearings, something no utility relishes. And, experts say, many utilities are loath to make any connection between their plants and nuclear weapons. Several experts with long Government experience in plutonium-fueled reactors who now work in the civilian sector refused to be quoted on the subject.</p>
        <p>And plutonium, unlike uranium, is highly toxic, so it must be converted into fuel rods in highly controlled circumstances. Fuel manufacturers would have to convert the plutonium from its current metal form to the ceramic form used in reactors, but plants to do this do not exist in the United States. If built, the plants and fuel would have to be guarded against anyone shopping for bomb fuel.</p>
        <p>But no significant technical breakthroughs are needed. In fact, all American power reactors already run partly on plutonium. They convert uranium into plutonium every moment they run; plutonium is formed when a neutron freed by splitting a uranium atom crashes into another uranium atom and is absorbed by it, transforming it into a new element. When the new plutonium atom is hit again by a neutron, it splits and gives off energy.</p>
        <p>With all the complications, Dr. Taylor said, "I wouldn't want to state that there's some economic advantage there." But if the Government put it forward as an important national problem that only the utilities could solve, he said, "I'm sure people would cooperate."</p>
