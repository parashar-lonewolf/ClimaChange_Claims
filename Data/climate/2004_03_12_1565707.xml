        <p>The environment minister of Canada said yesterday that his country would emulate California's new law aimed at curbing automotive global warming emissions if carmakers did not agree to make significant reductions.</p>
        <p>''Unless we get a voluntary agreement, our intention is to make use of the California model,'' David Anderson, Canada's environmental minister, said in an interview shortly before a speech about global warming at the University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>The notion of Canada following in California's footsteps will not appeal to automakers, who have said they will sue to keep the state's global warming law from taking effect. But Mr. Anderson said the Canadian government had not yet given up on reaching a voluntary agreement.</p>
        <p>Canada has been negotiating with automakers and representatives of other industries since December 2002, when it signed on to the Kyoto Protocol, a global accord on limiting emissions of gases linked to climate change that has been rejected by the Bush administration and Russia.</p>
        <p>As part of the Canadian government's effort to meet the Kyoto targets, it has asked automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of Canadian vehicles by 25 percent by 2010. Mr. Anderson said that so far, the industry had balked at such a notion.</p>
        <p>''They say it's impractical,'' he said. ''They say it's out of sync with the United States so it would affect the common market with the U.S. and Canada, so that's why it would be important for us to find state partners.''</p>
        <p>Mark Nantais of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association, a lobbying group, said his group was talking with the government. ''We're basically discussing the progress we've made to date and the progress we will be making with the introduction of new technologies.''</p>
        <p>He said he had not seen Mr. Anderson's speech, which was made late yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The auto industry voluntarily follows United States fuel economy regulations in Canada as well. But Mr. Anderson, a member of the ruling Liberal Party, said in the interview that he had been frustrated that the growth of sport utility vehicles had stalled fuel efficiency gains in both countries.</p>
        <p>''Our difficulty now is that the U.S. federal government is not seeing eye to eye with us on the importance of reductions from the automobile sector,'' he said. He added that Canada's government could carry out a law passed by Parliament in 1982 that would give the country its own fuel economy standards.</p>
        <p>Or Canada might look to pattern regulations after California, the one state allowed to write its own air quality standards because of its history of smog. Other states can choose California's rules instead of the federal government's, and many in the Northeast have done so.</p>
        <p>''We can together create a critical mass in the integrated North American market,'' Mr. Anderson said in his speech, according to a transcript. ''This is particularly crucial for climate-friendly vehicles.''</p>
