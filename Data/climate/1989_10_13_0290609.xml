        <p>LEAD: The ozone in the stratosphere over the South Pole has equalled the lowest level that scientists have measured, space agency scientists reported today.</p>
        <p>The ozone in the stratosphere over the South Pole has equalled the lowest level that scientists have measured, space agency scientists reported today.</p>
        <p>Measurements by a satellite showed that the ozone density over Antarctica declined by about 45 percent from early August to Oct. 5, said scientists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
        <p>Arlin Krueger, Richard Stolarski and Mark Schoeberl, the scientists monitoring the ozone levels, said the last reading on Oct. 5 matched the lowest measured, which came in 1987.</p>
        <p>The depletion occurs in an area formed by clouds, extreme cold and certain wind patterns at high altitudes over the South Pole. Such a hole can remain undisturbed for months during the cold part of the year, but the ozone depletion appears to correct itself in the polar summer. Depletion Varies Year to Year</p>
        <p>Last year, ozone concentrations over Antarctica dropped by about 15 percent in September, or about a third of the depletion this year.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming clear that the ozone hole is not going away in the near future, although the depth will vary from year to year,'' Mr. Krueger said in a statement from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Space agency scientists have been monitoring ozone levels over the Antarctic for more than 10 years using an instrument aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite.</p>
        <p>Other studies have found some seasonal thinning of the ozone layer above the North Polar region.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the stratosphere can block much of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun and prevent damaging levels of ultraviolet radiation from reaching Earth. Excess exposure to such radiation is thought to be a major cause of skin cancer, and some studies have shown that an increase in the radiation can also harm plants and the immune system of humans.</p>
