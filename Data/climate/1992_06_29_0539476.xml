        <p>Late this afternoon the ocean barge Spring Brook will slip quietly into the East River and head to sea, carrying for the last time one of America's least loved cargoes: 400 tons of New York City's processed sewage.</p>
        <p>It has been four years since Congress voted to ban the common practice of using the ocean as a municipal chamber pot, and with the Federal deadline set for tomorrow, New York is the only city that still does it. For environmentalists and many politicians, the final barge journey will be a moment of triumph, one they say will make the planet a cleaner, healthier place.</p>
        <p>But behind the public celebrations lie a host of anxieties. For New York, the end of ocean dumping means the beginning of a new and troubling era: a city that is already struggling to recycle, burn, export, sell and bury nearly 30,000 tons of garbage every day will have to find ways to handle some more. And despite plans, promises and years of negotiations, it won't be easy or cheap. 'We Rushed Into This'</p>
        <p>"This ban has been portrayed as an accomplishment that has no flaws," said Representative Thomas J. Manton of Queens, whose district will be among those that will be forced to process the city's treated sewage, called sludge. "But I worry whether this makes sense economically or environmentally. We rushed into this for political reasons and now we will have to deal with some harsh truths."</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most painful of those truths is that while it will be nearly impossible to export, bury or burn most of the city's sludge, it is even harder to find a New Yorker eager to live near a plant designed to process it, either by turning that waste into useful compost or by baking it into fertilizer pellets at tremendous heat.</p>
        <p>Over the next decade the city, which has one composting plant on Wards Island, plans to build at least three composting plants, in Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn, and one in the Bronx that will make fertilizer pellets. There are also plans for at least one chemical plant on Wards Island that would turn sludge into cover for landfills. Needed but Unwanted</p>
        <p>Later, city environmental officials say, New York may need more sludge plants; plans for them, however, have proven as popular in city neighborhoods as incinerators, garbage transfer stations and recycling centers. Everybody may need them but nobody wants them. So besides battling for a new incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the city faces the prospect of placing as many as 10 plants over the next 15 years to bake and compost its sludge.</p>
        <p>And it will have to do it at great cost to the residents of New York City. In the fiscal year that starts on Wednesday, the city will pay more than $250 million to dispose of its sludge on land. Last year it cost less than $20 million to ferry it 106 miles to the Deepwater Municipal Sludge Site on the edge of the Continental Shelf, where at least 40 million tons of waste have been deposited since 1986.</p>
        <p>City water and sewer rates rose nearly 20 percent in 1991, mostly to accommodate the anticipated increased costs of sludge processing. And the City Department of Environmental Protection expects the increases to continue.</p>
        <p>"It's not really a water bill any more," said the department's Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton, about the combined sewer and water bills that city residents pay. "It's a sludge bill." Priorities Are Doubted</p>
        <p>Mr. Appleton says he feels strongly that ocean dumping is wrong and he is pleased to see it end. But he also says: "I just don't know if this is how I'd choose to spend my next $250 million. On the list of pressing environmental problems faced by this city and this country, I really wonder if ocean dumping is that high."</p>
        <p>Nearly every working day for most of this century -- here and in hundreds of coastal communities from Los Angeles to Miami -- barges made similar journeys, laden with millions of tons of sludge they dumped into the ocean.</p>
        <p>Congress banned the practice in 1988, after a summer in which tons of medical waste washed up on beaches and thousands of dolphins died mysteriously along the Atlantic Coast. Although government officials insisted there was no connection between the medical debris and ocean dumping much farther out to sea, environmentalists had a strong election-year issue and few politicians were eager to oppose a ban.</p>
        <p>Sewage sludge had been dumped 12 miles out in New York Harbor since 1924. Citing evidence that enormous expanses of the inner coast had been degraded by the practice, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1984 designated a new site, 106 miles off the coast of Atlantic City, that was assumed to be much safer.  Pollutants at Deep Levels</p>
        <p>"The evidence is harder to gather at that depth," said J. Frederick Grassle, director of the Institute of Marine and Coastal Studies at Rutgers University. "The effects of ocean dumping that far out are not severe. But there are effects, and clearly pollutants are penetrating into the deepest layers of the sea."</p>
        <p>For most smaller cities the shift to 106 miles made the cost and trouble of dumping too high. But some, including many communities in New Jersey and in Westchester and Nassau Counties, continued until last year. New York, by far the nation's biggest ocean dumper, took a little longer to stop.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists who campaigned hard for an end to dumping -- in part by likening the assault on the oceans to the greenhouse effect gases are feared to have on the earth's atmosphere -- say that using the ocean as a dump site is never an acceptable alternative to finding safe ways to dispose of waste on land. Many scientists also worried about the long-term effects of dumping waste beyond the edge of the continent, where the ocean floor drops to a depth of more than 6,000 feet from 600 feet.</p>
        <p>Opponents of dumping say that sophisticated new technology allows sludge to be treated so that it can be used in many beneficial ways. Among the recent innovations are giant centrifuges used in New York, which, like washing machines, rely on a spin cycle to reduce sewage to concentrated form. 'Sludge Has a Bad Name'</p>
        <p>"Just dumping this stuff in the ocean and pretending to forget about it is not an answer to any problem," said Nina Sankovitch, a senior project lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Sewage contains nutrients that harm the ocean but that when properly treated can be beneficial to soil. Sludge has a bad name but it doesn't need to."</p>
        <p>Good sludge, filled with nitrogen and phosphorus, is essential for plant growth, and when metals and other poisons are eliminated it can be better than most manure. The shrubs and grasses of the newly renovated Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan were planted on a bed of genuine New York City sludge and the flowers and lawns of Gracie Mansion have prospered with its use.</p>
        <p>Under the administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the city bitterly fought the Federal ban on ocean dumping and delayed its enforcement for years. But in the long run, the delays may have cost the city money because it was unable to establish joint sludge plants with neighbors like Westchester and New Jersey that also recently stopped dumping.</p>
        <p>"We could have saved a lot of money and done the right thing here," said Sarah L. Clark, a scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "But at least, after years, we are finally getting out."  Few Like Landfills Either</p>
        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins, who supported the ban on ocean dumping, will join environmentalists and William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, at a celebration in New York on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Some of the city's sludge is now taken to southern Virginia and buried in a landfill, an alternative that few scientists consider any better than dumping at sea. And New York has contracted with several private companies to process its sludge and dispose of it. But by the end of the decade it plans to set up its own processing plants.</p>
        <p>Where they will go remains a thorny issue. A Citizens Advisory Committee has been meeting regularly with the city environmental department for three years. Mr. Appleton has discussed with residents throughout the city the need for such plans, and most agree that they are essential. But neighborhood leaders often wonder why it is essential to put them where they live.</p>
        <p>"This is going to be a real problem for the city," said City Councilman Stanley E. Michels of Manhattan. "We have to put the things somewhere. It's half of what our lives are consumed by. Where should we put this? Where should we put that? And the ban will put enormous pressure on the city. But we are doing the right thing and we will rise above the partisan problems. It'll just take time."</p>
