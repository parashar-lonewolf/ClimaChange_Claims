        <p>IT has taken more than 15 years of campaigning, but those who have been urging government agencies to buy environmentally friendly products say they see much progress. The Bush administration may resist the Kyoto treaty on climate change and Congress may debate environmental regulations, but when it comes to shopping, people in government are looking for alternatives that are healthy for the planet.</p>
        <p>Buoyed by grass-roots support and an executive order, purchasing agents for federal and state governments could become models of a maturing environmental movement.</p>
        <p>''Green purchasing may not be the silver bullet, but it is part of an overall set of activities that will help,'' said Marcus Peacock, deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>In King County, Wash., which encompasses Seattle, government agencies have lists of products to consider when buying everything from road repair material to police cars. The county's Environmental Purchasing Program is required to review and recommend ''environmentally preferable'' materials ''whenever practicable.''</p>
        <p>Most states have rules promoting green purchases. In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki issued orders last year for all public schools to use environmentally friendly solvents. Massachusetts, which spent $145 million on environmentally preferred products in 2004, decided that year to become ''the first state to include substantial human health and environmental considerations into a computer purchase,'' Government Procurement magazine reported.</p>
        <p>Scot Case, a consultant to government agencies and businesses on environmental policy, said that green-oriented buying has been increasing steadily. As awareness spreads and the number of products grows, he said, spending has been expanding by 12 to 14 percent a year.</p>
        <p>''In this part of the country, everyone is concerned about the environment,'' said Eric Nelson, manager of the Environmental Purchasing Program in King County. ''Still, it has been very slow to persuade all of our agencies to find alternatives that work, are at the right price and that are the least harmful.''</p>
        <p>Windell Mitchell, the director of King County fleet administration, said he met resistance when he first raised the idea of alternative-fueled police cars. So he brought in professional drivers who, using test cars, convinced police supervisors that cars fueled with compressed natural gas would serve their needs.</p>
        <p>The King County government, which has 19,000 employees, spent almost $18 million last year on green products, including cleaning items, biodegradable hydraulic fluids, asphalt with low emissions of noxious gases, plastic siding for trucks, alternative-fuel buses and hybrid cars. But that figure probably represented under 10 percent of total purchases.</p>
        <p>''Our single biggest issue is, What do we mean by being green?'' Mr. Nelson said. ''There are not enough standards among enough products.''</p>
        <p>As part of a wider campaign, Mr. Nelson has joined with associations of government procurement agents, the E.P.A. and industry groups to bring manufacturers, scientists and testing organizations together.</p>
        <p>''The idea is that government agencies are buying these products in any circumstances, and over time our job has been to make procurement agents and politicians aware that they could be doing good at the same time,'' Mr. Case, the consultant, said.</p>
        <p>''We call it responsible purchasing,'' he added. ''This began with the notion that it was a tree-hugging idea that was kind of absurd. Now we have begun to recognize that there is a balance in finding better products that also protect human health and the environment.''</p>
        <p>Green spending at the state and local levels pales compared with the federal government's. Executive orders from George H. W. Bush's presidency have called for more spending on recycled goods and on products deemed safe to nature.</p>
        <p>Executive orders now require that preference be given to recycled or green products across most federal departments, from Energy to Defense. The E.P.A. is asking the rest of the government to accept its purchasing standards, which require that green alternatives be considered.</p>
        <p>The Army, for example, spends $100 million a year on paper, so purchasing agents have found recycled paper or paper made with fewer harmful chemicals while also requiring less energy to produce.</p>
        <p>Although there is no directive to produce, say, an environmentally sensitive cruise missile, compliance extends to weaponry. One project that won a federal environmental award was a nuclear submarine that used propellants, paints and cleaning fluids endorsed by industry and government standard setters and that would do less harm to the environment when decommissioned.</p>
        <p>There are also government recommendations that propellants, chemical-resistant paints and fire-suppression systems for tanks meet environmental standards. According to Mr. Case, manufacturers have been encouraged to produce lead-free bullets, now common on firing ranges, to minimize ground pollution.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A., whose own facilities are powered by alternative energy, has developed standards for more than 60 products. Mr. Peacock said that when the agency started 35 years ago, many sources of pollution were visible. Over time, smokestacks have been disappearing, but environmental solutions are ever more complicated.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s influence has extended to the consumer market. Appliances now routinely carry Energy Star compliance, and cleaning products may have Green Seal approval stickers, representing joint testing and certification between industry and the government, agency officials say. Likewise, computer makers have joined refrigerator manufacturers in promoting efficiencies in electricity use.</p>
        <p>Coordinating whether the federal government complies with its own rules is the Office of the Environmental Executive, which operates out of the White House and is part of the Council on Environmental Quality. Dana Arnold, the chief of staff, acknowledges that green buying is still in its early stages. It is impossible to measure progress accurately, she said, because purchases are not recorded as green.</p>
        <p>''Some agencies are aggressive, some less so; this cannot be seen as a boutique thing to do,'' Ms. Arnold said.</p>
