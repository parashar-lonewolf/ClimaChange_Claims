        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Several recent articles described efforts to assess the economic costs of coping with the predicted greenhouse effect (Business Day, Nov. 14; front page, Nov. 19). I find it disturbing that the projections are based on questionable assumptions about energy consumption and its concomitant carbon dioxide production. In developing data for carbon control technology, economists simply extrapolate current energy use patterns into the future. The idea that our need for electrical energy will continue to increase at the same rate as it has in the past remains unchallenged.</p>
        <p>This scenario overlooks two important points: First, it misses the stupendous passive savings that could be realized from changes in residential and commercial architecture. Since energy-efficient landscaping can reduce residential heating demand in northern and temperate zone homes by 30 percent, this decrease in fossil fuel use would proportionally reduce carbon dioxide release.</p>
        <p>Imagine what savings in commercial construction could result from replacing the glass curtain of contemporary skyscrapers with energy-conscious designs: buildings with rounded corners and roofs like igloos; buildings whose solid perimeter walls surround temperate atriums; buildings that achieve internal temperature control from an exterior skin planted to tundra species like reindeer moss; even buried buildings surrounded by easily heated 50-degree earth are all design options that could cut carbon production from fossil fuels without requiring gas capture and reduction devices.</p>
        <p>The second fallacy of many cost projections of carbon dioxide control is the assumption that our current energy behavior will remain unchanged. Is it really a law of nature that every American over the age of 15 will own a car? Or that an addiction to commuting, multiple electrical appliances and throwaway products is incurable? The microeconomics of car ownership dictate that at some point carbon dioxide control technology will make a vehicle too expensive to own and operate for many consumers. And since one of the macroeconomic effects of the rising oceans predicted during the coming greenhouse years must be the submersion of most of the world's coastal metropolises, the car-as-product becomes obsolete once there is no longer a place to commute to.</p>
        <p>If the greenhouse effect becomes a reality, energy use and carbon release patterns will change in ways undreamed of by economists whose cost projections focus on technological fixes to badly designed and badly used products and processes. Coping with life in the greenhouse will require original insights into how, where and why we live, not just simple tinkering.  KAREN JESCAVAGE-BERNARD  Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Nov. 20, 1989</p>
