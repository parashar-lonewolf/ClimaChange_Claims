        <p>Re ''Protecting the Earth'' (editorial, Aug. 28): At the center of any global warming debate is the issue of developing a national energy strategy. Such a strategy would include establishing controls on fossil fuel emissions while developing alternative-energy technologies that will wean us off fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>The agency charged by law with the responsibilities for these issues is the Department of Energy. Although the evisceration of the department began under the Reagan administration, the lack of leadership in energy policy has continued through every administration since, including President Clinton's.</p>
