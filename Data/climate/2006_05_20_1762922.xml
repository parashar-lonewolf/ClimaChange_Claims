        <p>The auto industry has dropped a lawsuit against New York State over strict new regulations governing global warming emissions, but will still continue to fight the rules. The suit, which was filed last year, was dropped on Tuesday, according to court documents.</p>
        <p>The move represents a tactical shift for the automobile industry in a broad legal fight against California and states like New York that seek to mimic its global warming regulation requiring automakers to improve the fuel economy of their cars.</p>
        <p>''This illustrates that the car companies' legal assault on New York's rules that will reduce global warming emissions from cars is meritless,'' said Yueh-Ru Chu, an assistant attorney general of New York State. ''We welcome their withdrawal of their lawsuit and look forward to the day when these critical regulations will be fully implemented.''</p>
        <p>Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry trade group leading the suit, said, ''we reviewed our strategy and decided that this particular action doesn't fit in with the approach we're pursuing.''</p>
        <p>When, and if, New York's regulation actually takes effect remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>In 2004, California adopted the nation's first regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, a move that sent shudders through automakers from Detroit to Tokyo. Unlike smog-forming pollutants, carbon dioxide and other global warming emissions from vehicle tailpipes cannot be filtered. That means that cutting such emissions depends largely on making cars and trucks much more fuel efficient.</p>
        <p>Several states in the Northeast have moved to adopt California's regulation, due to go into effect on 2009 models. The auto industry's legal fight is likely to stall those regulations. The industry is suing California in federal court to block the regulation, and also suing in federal court in other states as well, though not in New York.</p>
        <p>The industry's chief argument is that the states' move to regulate global warming emissions from cars treads on the federal government's sole authority to regulate fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups, and attorneys general from California to New York, have argued that they have the authority to regulate harmful emissions regardless of the effect on fuel economy. California also still needs to obtain a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out the rules, a step that many view as unlikely given the Bush administration's opposition to greenhouse gas regulation. That could lead to another court fight.</p>
        <p>The industry had sued New York in state court on the ground that the state did not review the new regulation as thoroughly as the state's laws require. Asked if the industry would now move to sue New York in federal court, Ms. Bergquist said, ''we haven't made any decisions.''</p>
