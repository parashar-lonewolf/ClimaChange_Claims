        <p>LEAD:  CABARET STARS  Julie Wilson, singer and actress, and Marilyn Michaels, comedian, will present an evening of music and comedy Saturday at Raritan Valley Community College in North Branch.</p>
        <p>CABARET STARS  Julie Wilson, singer and actress, and Marilyn Michaels, comedian, will present an evening of music and comedy Saturday at Raritan Valley Community College in North Branch.</p>
        <p>Miss Wilson and Miss Michaels, two of New York's top cabaret performers, replace Barbara Cook, who was scheduled but canceled because she was cast in a Broadway role, according to the college.</p>
        <p>The performance begins at 8 P.M. Tickets are $12.50 and $15.  Information: (201) 725-3420.  NEW PLAY IN PRINCETON</p>
        <p>''Three Ways Home,'' a new play by Casey Kurtti that is trying to find its way to a home on stage in New York, will have its premiere at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton.</p>
        <p>Such odysseys are not unknown to the McCarter, where, for example, Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' had its premiere in 1938.</p>
        <p>Miss Kurtti's play involves a child-welfare volunteer assigned to befriend a street-wise welfare mother whose teen-age son escapes reality in the fantasy world of comics.</p>
        <p>McCarter's Stage Two production represents the continuing refinement of the play.</p>
        <p>Performances run through next Sunday. Tickets are $7.50.</p>
        <p>Information: (609) 683-8000.  NATALIE COLE IN NEWARK</p>
        <p>Natalie Cole, the pop singer and daughter of Nat (King) Cole, will appear Friday night at Newark's Symphony Hall as the first presentation in the Gala Marquee Season featuring not only pop music, but also contemporary jazz and jazz fusion, as well as rhythm and blues.</p>
        <p>The series is named for a giant curbside marquee to be built at the site, 1020 Broad Street.</p>
        <p>Friday's concert, which begins at 8 o'clock, also marks the end of the first phase of renovations for the Concert Hall and Terrace Ballroom.</p>
        <p>Information: (201) 643-8009.  MUSEUM OPEN HOUSE</p>
        <p>The archaeopteryx, the first bird, is the subject of much scientific speculation, and Saturday it will be discussed at the Rutgers University Geology Museum's museum's 20th annual open house in New Brunswick.</p>
        <p>The event, from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., will feature four lectures with slide presentations, a mineral sale, films and the museum's many artifacts, including an Egyptian mummy from 320 B.C. and the skeleton of a mastodon dug up in Salem County in 1876.</p>
        <p>John Ostrom, a paleontologist, professor of geology and curator of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, who has published his study of six known specimens of archaeopteryx, will speak at 3 P.M. in Room 123 of Scott Hall.</p>
        <p>Other lectures will be on gem lore and history at 9:45 A.M., on asbestos in the environment at 11 A.M. and on the rising sea level's impact on coastal development at 1:45 P.M.</p>
        <p>Information: (201) 932-7084.  SKI-A-THON BENEFIT</p>
        <p>Next Sunday is the preregistration deadline for getting all the benefits of participating in the annual Vernon Valley Ski-A-Thon, which benefits the Sussex County unit of the American Cancer Society. The skiing begins at 9 A.M. on Feb. 5, and continues to 10 P.M. on Feb. 6.</p>
        <p>Participants obtain fixed donations from supporters or collect pledges based on the number of runs skied.</p>
        <p>Preregistration by mail is $35 and includes a Ski-A-Thon T-shirt, pins and other bonus items, as well as the privilege of deducting the fee from donations raised. Registration in person is $45 and provides no bonuses.</p>
        <p>The event raised $1,200 from 56 skiers when it began in 1985, and by last year had gone to $18,000 from 321 skiers. This year's goal is $30,000 and 400 skiers.</p>
        <p>The skier raising the most money will win one week's free lodging with three days' lift tickets for two at Steamboat Springs, Colo. There are several other ski-oriented top prizes.</p>
        <p>Vernon Valley-Great Gorge Ski Resort in Vernon has donated ski time and facilities for the event.</p>
        <p>Information: (201) 383-1334.  BENEFIT FOR HOMELESS</p>

        <p>Mr. Chapin, a brother and frequent music partner of Harry Chapin, the folk-rock composer and performer who died in 1981, is widely known as a champion of humanitarian causes.</p>
        <p>He was the host of ''Make a Wish,'' which was on television from 1971-76, has performed in ''Cotton Patch Gospel,'' a cracker-barrel retelling of the New Testament composed by his brother, and has recorded several albums (one of them, ''In the City of Mercy,'' included his brother's song ''All My Life's a Circle'').</p>
