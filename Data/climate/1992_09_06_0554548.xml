        <p>Favors Federal legislation providing benefits to domestic partners regardless of sexual orientation. Favors a Federal law prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals.

Views needle exchange as "least desirable" option, but supports as part of larger drug education program. MILITARY</p>

Would end production of B-2 bomber, reduce "Star Wars" research and delay its deployment beyond 1996. Favors new Government agency to shift research and development to civilian technologies, and retool defense laboratories.  ENVIRONMENT</p>
