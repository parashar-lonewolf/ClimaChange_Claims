        <p>This winter a 50-foot-wide strip of Roger Middleditch's sugar-beet field fell into the North Sea, his rich East Anglian lands reduced by a large fraction of their acreage. The adjacent potato field, once 23 acres, is now less than 3 -- too small to plant at all, he said.</p>
        <p>Each spring Mr. Middleditch, a tenant farmer on the vast Benacre Estate here, meets with its managers to recalculate his rent, depending on how much land has been eaten up by encroaching water. As he stood in a muddy field by the roaring sea recently, he tried to estimate how close he dared to plant this season.</p>
        <p>''We've lost so much these last few years,'' he said. ''You plant, and by harvest it's fallen into the water.''</p>
        <p>Coastal erosion has been a fact of life here for a century, because the land under East Anglia is slowly sinking. But the erosion has never been as quick and cataclysmic as it has been in recent years, an effect of climate change and global warming, many scientists say. To make matters worse for coastal farmers, the government has stopped maintaining large parts of the network of seawalls that once protected the area.</p>
        <p>Under a new policy that scientists have labeled ''managed retreat,'' governments around the globe are concluding that it is not worth taxpayer money to fight every inevitable effect of climate change.</p>
        <p>Land loss at Benacre ''has accelerated dramatically,'' said Mark Venmore-Roland, the estate's manager. ''At first it was like a chap losing his hair -- bit by bit, so you'd get used to it.'' But in the past few years, he said, ''it's been really frightening.''</p>
        <p>A report this year from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that rising seas will force 60 million people away from their coastal homes and jobs by the year 2080.</p>
        <p>Another study, the Stern Report, released last December by the British government, projected hundreds of millions of ''environmental refugees'' by 2050. That category includes people whose land is ruined by floods and those whose pastures are parched by drought.</p>
        <p>Most are expected to be poor people in developing countries, like fishermen in Asia or shepherds in Africa. Mr. Middleditch, a grizzled, balding man in Wellington boots, and Mr. Venmore-Roland, with his upper-class accent, plush yellow corduroy trousers and walking stick, are certainly not typical of this group. But their plight shows that even here in Europe, livelihoods are being affected, particularly in rural areas.</p>
        <p>Walkers and birders who frequent these famous Broads, or salt marshes, will find that the hiking path through Benacre that once gently declined from a low grassy plateau toward the beach, now ends in a precipitous drop of 16 feet to the water; the rest fell into the sea in February.</p>
        <p>The 6,000-acre Benacre Estate is losing swaths of land 30 feet wide along its entire two miles of coastline each year. Inland trees that were once sold for timber are dying or no longer commercially valuable, because the proximity to the salty sea air has left them stunted.</p>
        <p>Farmers like Mr. Middleditch are losing fields and trying to adjust crops to an unpredictable climate. Mr. Middleditch is now planting hemp. In Cornwall, in southwestern England, warmer and wetter weather has led farmers to experiment with growing jalapeño peppers.</p>
        <p>As climate change has accelerated erosion on the east coast of Britain, many scientists and politicians have decided that it no longer makes sense to defend the land.</p>
        <p>Under the policy of managed retreat, farms, nature preserves and villages are surrendered to the sea.</p>
        <p>''This land is very sensitive to climate change because it is very low-lying and doesn't tolerate high temperatures like we've had the last few summers,'' said David Viner, a climate expert at the University of East Anglia. ''The government will only protect land it thinks of as economically important, and on an economic level you can say that makes sense, but of course that's not the whole picture.''</p>
        <p>A landmark scientific report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released in February, predicted that warming caused by human activities could produce rises in sea level of 7 to 23 inches, accompanied by much stormier weather, by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>In Indonesia, the environment minister predicted that 2,000 of the country's islands could be swallowed by the seas in 30 years and said that little can be done to defend them.</p>
        <p>In wealthier regions, vast engineering projects can often prevent the sea's encroachment, Mr. Viner said, but the cost is often so high that it becomes politically unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Here in the Broads, there are conflicts about who deserves to be spared the effects of climate change, and what should be sacrificed to the advancing water.</p>
        <p>Local council meetings have pitted conservation groups against farmers; landowners against environmentalists; national politicians against villagers. Then there is the question of who, if anyone, should compensate people for the land and income lost.</p>
        <p>Farmers and landowner groups are calling for government payments and for a voice in deciding what must be saved. They would also like permission to build their own private sea defenses.</p>
        <p>Last year, Peter Boggis, a farmer whose land abuts Benacre, paid a contractor to add dirt to the bottom of the sea cliff that abuts his land. He was ordered to stop, after conservation groups said he was tampering with a site of scientific interest.</p>
        <p>Farther up the coast, four or five homes from the village of Happisburgh fall into the sea each year, as the cliff beneath them crumbles.</p>
        <p>While they appeal for help, the North Norfolk District Council and Coastal Concern Action Limited have started to shore up Happisburgh's cliff with rocks, financed in part by an Internet campaign, ''Buy a Rock for Happisburgh.''</p>
        <p>''The U.K. won't let London flood,'' Mr. Viner said, ''but the national government's not going to worry about an odd village or farm.''</p>
