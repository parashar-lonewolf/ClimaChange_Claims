        <p>What was supposed to have been summer's last hurrah instead became another quest for any available stretch of sand and surf. Many Suffolk County residents found themselves warned off their neighborhood beaches over the Labor Day weekend, just as Long Islanders had been periodically throughout the rainy summer.</p>
        <p>Downpours and the elevated bacterial levels in the water that resulted led Suffolk and Nassau County health officials to close or issue warnings against swimming at a patchwork of beaches and parks for days at a stretch in June, July and August.</p>
        <p>Most recently in Nassau, 23 beaches were shut down on Aug. 25. They reopened six days later. Suffolk authorities issued an advisory covering 62 beaches on Aug. 28. Two days later, two beaches were closed but the advisory was lifted for 57 beaches and their waters again cleared for swimming.</p>
        <p>The fun was short-lived. On Sept. 1, the Friday of the long holiday weekend, the remnants of Hurricane Ernesto struck. The arrival of Ernesto, which had been downgraded to a tropical storm before it hit Long Island, prompted Suffolk to issue a new advisory that covered 52 beaches. According to Suffolk's beach hot line, that advisory was lifted Monday at 24 beaches but remained in effect at 28 -- in Centerport, Cold Spring Harbor, the Great South Bay, Huntington, Long Island Sound and Northport -- for an additional 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Although Nassau shut down beaches on its North and South Shores four times over the summer, Ernesto dropped too little rain there to raise bacteria counts beyond acceptable levels, said Cynthia Brown, a Nassau health department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>That, however, does not mean Nassau residents can make up for lost time by spending this weekend or next at a county beach. ''The beaches are now officially closed until next year,'' said Ms. Brown, noting that residents' user permits expired on Tuesday, the day after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>First Plant to Turn Grease Into Fuel Opens</p>
        <p>The Northeast's first plant to convert restaurant grease into biofuel has officially opened. The pilot plant, which is in Bohemia, is expected at first to produce up to 1,000 gallons a day of biofuel that could be used in diesel-powered cars and trucks, as well as home-heating systems. North American Biofuels, founded last year by C. David Butler II and Alan Ellenbogen, opened the plant on Aug. 29. By December, its output should reach about 4,000 gallons a day, the company said.</p>
        <p>Suffolk County's sewage-treatment plant stopped accepting restaurant grease in 2002 after its system clogged up, and Nassau's plant accepts grease only from restaurants inside the county. For the past four years, Suffolk restaurant owners have had to pay to ship their grease to New Jersey, where plants have developed their own problems, or dump it illegally down the drain.</p>
        <p>''This facility takes a costly problem -- the disposal of waste grease -- and turns it into an energy solution by producing a clean, renewal energy product, which will reduce harmful emissions into the atmosphere,'' Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler, an engineer, developed the processing system and its computerized operating technology. Russell Reid, a New Jersey-based waste management firm, will transport the used grease to the plant. Island Biofuel, based in Center Moriches, will be the major distributor of the end product, Mr. Ellenbogen said.</p>
        <p>Producers of biodiesel and other forms of renewable energy can be eligible for federal, state and local tax incentives. But North American Biofuels was not because it relies on a technology that is cheaper to build than plants that process ''virgin'' sources, like soy oil -- about $7 million compared with $20 million to $30 million.</p>
        <p>But the company will pass along a 50-cent-a-gallon federal subsidy to its customers, Mr. Ellenbogen said. That would lower the wholesale price per gallon to less than $1.90, compared with about $2.25 for home-heating fuel and about $3.10 for biodiesel made from soy, he said.</p>
        <p>Bill to Penalize Inmates For Spitting at Guards</p>
        <p>Under a year-old state law, a jail inmate who throws blood, semen, urine or feces at a corrections officer can be charged with a felony. Now a bill, sponsored in the State Assembly by Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat from Great Neck, would add saliva and phlegm to that list.</p>
        <p>Corrections officials in Nassau and Suffolk said inmates know that the law established tougher penalties for throwing certain bodily fluids at guards but also know that it did not include saliva, so they have spit at guards more.</p>
        <p>The bill, which passed the Senate in June, would make that a Class E felony punishable by one and a third to four years in state prison, not in a county jail. The sister bill in the Assembly, sponsored by Mr. DiNapoli, is in committee. The unions representing corrections officers in Nassau and Suffolk support its passage. ''One hundred percent,'' said Vito Dagnello, the president of the Suffolk County Correction Officers Association. ''It's become part of the job that you go home at night not knowing what you've contracted.''</p>
        <p>Saliva or phlegm, particularly if it contains blood, can carry infectious pathogens, including those that cause hepatitis, tuberculosis or H.I.V., the unions said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dagnello said it was difficult to get worker's compensation or disability payments for illnesses that guards believe were contracted from inmates, ''because the government's position is that you could have contracted it somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>John Duer, the president of the Nassau County Sheriff Officers Association, said the same compensation battle exists for corrections officers statewide. He said that one of his members was recently spit at by an inmate whose saliva landed in the officer's mouth. ''Now he's being tested for a whole list of contagions,'' Mr. Duer said of the officer.</p>
