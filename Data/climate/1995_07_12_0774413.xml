        <p>With his red plastic bucket, some putty-like material and a spatula, Jan Branda is an expert on outdoor chins, noses, fingers and feet.</p>
        <p>Lovingly, he restores glowing expressions to pockmarked cherubs, rubs down delicate hands encrusted with layers of grime and glues back feet splintered by severe weather.</p>
        <p>Mr. Branda, a stonemason and sculptor, is one of the anonymous men who tend to Prague's glorious collection of medieval, Baroque and Renaissance statues, monuments and buildings.</p>
        <p>The other morning he was perched above the St. Matthias Gate at the Prague Castle, hidden by blue net and rusty scaffolding, touching up the mane of a royal lion and replacing an angel's chin.</p>
        <p>"Rain collects on the chin and it falls off," Mr. Branda, in blue coveralls and black beret, said as he peered at the curve of a dented chin through his glasses.</p>
        <p>All over Prague, it is a race against time to shore up the splendors of the city before the vulnerable sandstone statues crumble under the weight of pollution, the rumbling of streetcars and, most recently, vandalism by tourists who think a piece of Prague stone is a nice memento.</p>
        <p>Unlike some European cities of architectural majesty, Prague emerged intact after World War II. Its curling medieval passageways and cobbled courtyards, its Gothic towers and vaults, its froth of Baroque churches and Art Nouveau mansions were unscathed by bombs.</p>
        <p>But peace was not so gentle. Soot from coal-burning stoves and chemicals from industrial plants poured down on centuries of cultural heritage. And while the guardians of Paris and Vienna were constantly retouching their beauty, the Communist would-be builders of a new worker state had less use for the heritage of a repudiated past.</p>
        <p>In those years, men like Mr. Branda worked more often on projects intended for the greater glory of the state: the fixing up of statues and squares for party anniversaries and military parades.</p>
        <p>"At least 80 percent of our statues and sculptures are in bad shape from assaults ranging from acid rain to mechanical damage," said Vratislav Nejedly, the director of conservation at the Culture Ministry. "We have missing fingers, hands. Our roads were planned for horse carriages and now we have cars backing into statues."</p>
        <p>Now, the Culture Ministry has increased the money for restoration, partly in the belief that better-kept statues will reap an economic return from the tourists who sweep into the Czech Republic at a greater rate than they do France.</p>
        <p>Cupolas, fronts of churches and sides of buildings are swathed in protective netting as the ministry's 84 restorers, sometimes garbed in white coats like lab scientists, tackle the city's long inventory of damaged goods.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Branda, who is 52, and his fellow restorers, the work is less cosmetics for tourists than a passion to preserve the soul of the city. Sometimes they have to go to extraordinary lengths.</p>
        <p>Many nights past midnight Mr. Branda and his colleague, Jiri Novotny, clambered onto the windswept roof of St. Salvator Church in the Clementinum at the foot of Charles Bridge to wrap and tie up seven 17th-century stone statues of the disciples. In the dark, a crane then plucked the statues for safekeeping and repair in a workshop.</p>
        <p>"The streetcars had rattled them so much the statues were about to fall down on the people below," Mr. Branda said.</p>
        <p>There were similar problems with the dagger-wielding stone giants at the St. Matthias Gate. "They are replicas from 1902 of the 18th-century sculptor Frantisek Platzer," Mr. Branda said as if talking of an old friend.</p>
        <p>"It's unusual to work on replicas, but these are in a prominent place so it's important to restore them." Especially, he said, since one of the outstretched arms was about to drop off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Branda studied at the Academy of Art for six years and considers himself an artist, but he tries not to leave his own imprint on the works of some of Central Europe's finest Baroque sculptors like Matyas Braun and Ferdinand Brokof. "I want to be the most anonymous man, to get as close as possible to the creator's work."</p>
        <p>The statues are cleaned with a mixture of ammonia to allow the stone to breathe. They are never stripped or painted. "The new guys paint them to look like new," Mr. Branda said with disdain. The restorers fret that as private buyers refurbish houses and palaces they add bright synthetic paint that suggests Disneyland elbowing its way into the old world.</p>
        <p>One of the most scarred parts of Prague, Charles Bridge, is one of the biggest tourist attractions. Shoulder-to-shoulder throngs brush by 34 sandstone figures that line the parapets.</p>
        <p>"Charles Bridge used to be like walking through a beautiful gallery," Mr. Branda said. "Now it's a marketplace and a dangerous place filled with gangsters. The tourists come at night and steal a halo of stars because they think it is gold. Or whole hands and fingers disappear. One of our sculptors always has several fingers ready to glue back on."</p>
        <p>Last month the bridge's most fabled Baroque statue, St. Lutgard, a Flemish nun grasping the knees of Christ long hailed by critics for its sensual passion, was wrapped in scaffolding one last time in preparation for its removal.</p>
        <p>On and off, Mr. Branda has worked at preserving St. Lutgard for decades -- he watched his daughter march to the 1989 anti-Communist protests from within the cocoon of the statue's scaffolding -- but the corrosion has gone too far. The stature has a gaping crack down its back and is to be replaced this fall by a reproduction.</p>
