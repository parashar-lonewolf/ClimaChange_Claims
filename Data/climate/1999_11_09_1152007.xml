        <p>Last summer, as environmentalists called for air pollution controls on New York's oldest power plants, Gov. George E. Pataki showed no interest, declining to include them in a related bill. Then, his administration briefly backed away from its demand that plants in other states cut their emissions, before reversing itself under intense criticism.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, who praise some aspects of the governor's record, seized on those events to assail him on air quality. What a difference a few weeks make. With recent moves to impose strict emission limits on old power plants and new cars, Mr. Pataki has suddenly jumped to the head of the line among the nation's governors in fighting air pollution, winning a chorus of accolades from environmental groups.</p>
        <p>The governor and his aides insist that his actions should be taken at face value and that their timing was coincidental. But Democrats, environmentalists and not a few of the governor's fellow Republicans say they cannot help but see links to the heat he took last summer, to his budding rivalry with the state's new, Democratic attorney general, or even to his hopes of being tapped as his party's vice-presidential nominee next year.</p>
        <p>And for some who have closely followed these events, there is a nagging suspicion that questions about Mr. Pataki's motives stem, in part, from the reluctance of environmentalists -- not to mention some reporters and voters -- to give a Republican the benefit of the doubt on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>''I think that might be true for a lot of environmental organizations, but I really don't think it's true for us,'' said Larry Shapiro, an environmental lawyer at the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''Look, I believe the governor has always truly cared about environmental concerns. But that doesn't mean that politics don't enter into it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, in an interview today, said: ''It's just amazing to me that something that I've been deeply involved in since I was a little kid, people can question my motives. I think it reflects more of the mind-set of the liberal press and their bias.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the truth of his motives, the constant assessment of them has been fed by the apparent meandering of the governor's policies.</p>
        <p>''There were a number of things,'' said Val Washington, director of Environmental Advocates, a coalition of groups, ''that had called into question the governor's leadership on the environment, and I think it's clear he has set out to reassert himself because he sees this as his territory and he wants to protect it.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and some legislators have long wanted the state to limit pollution from old power plants that were exempt from stringent state and federal controls, but Mr. Pataki would not embrace the idea. He ignored calls to include it earlier this year in a bill on granting environmental permits to new plants.</p>
        <p>For years, New York and neighboring states have called on the federal government to crack down on power plant emissions from the Midwest and the South, which blow into the Northeast and contribute to smog and acid rain. This summer, the Pataki administration floated a proposed compromise with the other regions, only to withdraw it under fire from other Northeastern states and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>State lawmakers and environmentalists were quick to note that if he pressed his case against out-of-state plants, Mr. Pataki would not endear himself to powerful Republicans, and a lot of voters, in other parts of the country as he tried to raise his standing in the national Republican Party. ''In New York, this stuff makes you very popular,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''But there are states where you can run against environmental protection and win.''</p>
        <p>In September, the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, said he would sue 17 out-of-state power plants under the Federal Clean Air Act. A few weeks later, he put eight New York plants on notice that they, too, might be in violation of the act and could face legal action.</p>
        <p>Not only had the governor suffered a spate of bad publicity on air quality issues but also after years of being the state's most prominent conservationist, he suddenly took a back seat to Mr. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, he was feeling the heat,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee. ''He felt pressured by Spitzer's moves and the pressure we have been applying for five years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki took back the spotlight last month -- and stunned many environmental groups -- when he announced that he would order sharp cuts in emissions by older plants in New York, doing administratively what a few months earlier, he had refused to do legislatively.</p>
        <p>Then, when the Clinton administration said it would take enforcement action against power plants in the Midwest and the South, the governor repeatedly claimed credit for pressuring the federal government into it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki announced this week that New York would impose tough new emission standards on vehicles, starting in 2004, a step that, unlike his move against power plants, was not a surprise. The timing made New York the first state to join California, which created the standards, barely beating Massachusetts, which is expected to adopt them soon, and allowing the governor, once again, to claim national leadership.</p>
        <p>The latest round of events has spawned a new set of theories. One has it that Mr. Pataki has largely abandoned his hopes of getting on the national ticket, and is securing his status in New York. But another holds that since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, may be vulnerable on his environmental record, the party would do well to choose a vice-presidential nominee who has a stronger environmental record.</p>
        <p>''I think making a big splash with this stuff might actually help Pataki's chances, and I'm sure that's occurred to him, too,'' said a prominent Republican political consultant, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Hank Morris, a Democratic consultant, said, in a reference to Mr. Bush, ''Maybe Pataki read that Houston has the most polluted air in the country.''</p>
