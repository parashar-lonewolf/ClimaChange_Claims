        <p>Bloomberg administration is airing idea of incinerating New York City's garbage because once-abundant alternatives are becoming harder to come by; some environmentalists will fight incineration, saying that while incinerators may well be cleaner now than they were a decade ago, more is known about danger of pollutants they do produce; other environmentalists say they could agree to put incineration back on table but only if city makes major new commitment to reducing its waste through expanded composting and recycling and institutes ambitious program of monitoring air emissions and ash; photo; graph (M)</p>

        <p>In recent years, the idea of using incineration to dispose of some or all of New York City's daily tide of garbage seemed about as dead as Marley's ghost.</p>
        <p>A plan in the mid-1980's to burn about half of the total in an archipelago of incinerators across the five boroughs was downsized, then killed. The last municipal incinerator closed in the early 1990's. Environmental objections, neighborhood politics, and perhaps most important, a bounty of other options, especially adequate and affordable landfill space to bury the trash, made incineration look like a footnote.</p>
        <p>But now the idea of trash-into-ash is back, and part of the reason, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city officials seemed to be warning New Yorkers this week, is that the once-abundant alternatives are becoming harder to come by, and to pay for. ''We're going to have to take a look at all different possibilities,'' Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday on his weekly radio show when asked about the current state of incineration technology. ''No matter what you hear about people yelling and screaming, an awful lot of this technology has gotten very much better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg's sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, twice brought up the issue of incineration, without ever being asked about it, in testifying earlier this week before the City Council. ''I don't know what the thoughts of the city are, what people's feelings are on it are, I don't know if things have changed,'' Mr. Doherty later told reporters. ''But we have to think about it, we have to look at it again.''</p>
        <p>Questions of cost are driving that search. Between 1998 and 2000, the cost of exporting the city's trash beyond its borders more than tripled, and is projected to more than double from that amount by 2004 to $238 million a year, according to the city's Independent Budget Office.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists, waste industry experts and government regulators say that many things have changed since New York last considered incineration as a serious option in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Like Rip Van Winkle, who emerged from a nap to find the world transformed, a new debate about incineration would take place on an altered terrain. And few doubt that the issue would be any less hard-fought. But from the rules of environmental regulation to the tactics of community opposition, and from the tarnished dreams of recycling to the concerns about the city's ability to be self-sufficient in uncertain times, just about everything else can be divided into columns of then -- a decade ago -- and now.</p>
        <p>Back then, emissions from trash-burning plants, especially things like dioxins and mercury, prompted the most objections. Now, since new tighter federal regulations were imposed in the 1990's, the plants are far cleaner, state and federal regulators say. But the additional pollution-control technology is expensive, and many plants across the country have closed. The number of incinerators fell to 97 as of last year from a high of 150 in 1993, according to Governmental Advisory Associates, a research and consulting firm in Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Back then, city sanitation officials hoped that recycling would become a pillar of long-term disposal plans, making New York less dependent on things like landfills or incinerators. In 1992, for example, the City Council projected that recycling would divert 42 percent of the city's trash by the turn of the century. Now, with New York struggling to reach even a 20 percent diversion rate, Mr. Bloomberg has proposed cutting the program nearly in half to save money. Less recycling means more garbage that must be buried or burned.</p>
        <p>Back then, New York's energy market was a regulated monopoly and there was little concern about long-term electricity supply. Now, with uncertain deregulated energy markets, some experts say that generating megawatts from trash could find new appeal.</p>
        <p>Back then, the overarching environmental issue of garbage in New York was the festering landfill at Fresh Kills in Staten Island, which was closed last year. Now the questions are more diffuse and so are the environmental tradeoffs. Some environmentalists say that the vast fleets of diesel trucks that rumble every day across New Jersey, taking the bulk of the city's trash to landfills in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- and burning an estimated 10 million gallons of fuel a year in the process, according to a recent report from Columbia University -- are perhaps as big an environmental insult as anything at Fresh Kills, but far harder to measure.</p>
        <p>Back then, the politics of trash centered on the question of the betrayal of Staten Island in the 1940's, when a supposedly temporary local dump became the city's only dump. Now, issues of economic vulnerability are behind the search for new solutions -- a note that could find particular resonance in a city still recovering from the impact of terrorism and a recession.</p>
        <p>Exporting the city's garbage to mostly out-of-state landfills, Mr. Doherty told a City Council committee this week, makes the city dependent and defenseless, especially if Congress passes legislation allowing states to regulate garbage exports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg added his voice to that message yesterday.</p>
        <p>''There are two states, Virginia and Pennsylvania, that are willing to take it,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, referring to the city's trash. ''But they charge a lot of money.'' He said he agreed with Mr. Doherty, and that down the line, those states would undoubtedly raise their prices.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists say that a new battle over incineration would be as hard fought as anything in the past, and that while plants may well be cleaner now, more is known about the dangers of the pollutants they do produce. Other environmentalists say they could agree to put incineration back on the table, but that the price of their support would be high.</p>
        <p>''Could we have that discussion? The answer is yes,'' said James T. B. Tripp, the general counsel at Environmental Defense, a national conservation group based in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tripp said that any serious proposal to bring back incineration would have to be directly linked to a major new commitment by the city to reducing its waste through expanded composting and recycling. Government monitoring and testing of air emissions and ash, he said, would also have to be far more ambitious than anything contemplated in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>''If we're going to think about it, we've got to be prepared to think about everything,'' Mr. Tripp said.</p>
        <p>Other environmentalists say that advocates of incineration underestimate the costs, both financial and environmental, of trash-burning technologies. New tactics of community opposition have also been sharpened since the early 1990's, especially the link between environmental protest, civil rights and racial politics, generally lumped together under the heading of environmental justice.</p>
        <p>David Higby, the solid waste project director at Environmental Advocates, a conservation and lobbying group in Albany, said that mercury emissions, in particular, were still a problem from trash combustion, and that the trend among many municipalities was toward a zero-emissions standard for mercury, which could make finding a place for new plants almost impossible.</p>
        <p>''They were marginal then,'' Mr. Higby said, referring to the trash plants of the early 1990's. ''I think we're coming to the point where they're not practical any more at all.''</p>
        <p>A study released recently by Columbia University, on the other hand, paints an opposite picture -- that the current technology for converting waste to energy, as an environmental solution, is vastly preferable to landfills. The report, by an interdepartmental group of engineers, scientists, public policy experts and others, called ''Life After Fresh Kills,'' says that landfills almost invariably leak pollutants over time and can also produce methane, a so-called greenhouse gas that has been linked to global climate change.</p>
        <p>Burning trash, the report says, could also reduce the state's dependence on coal for generating electricity, which would reduce pollution because trash-burning regulations are so strict. The authors of the study also offered up some political advice: don't force a plant on any community in the city or the region, but open up a system of bidding so that a community, reachable ideally by barge so that trucks would not be needed, could negotiate a package of energy rebates, tax dividends or other incentives.</p>
        <p>The price of those incentives might be high, but they also might be, in the age of litigation and community organization, the only means of success, the report said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg said on his radio show yesterday that he thought part of the problem was how a debate over incineration would be framed and reported. In representing both sides of a controversy, scientific expertise can come off sounding like just one more opinion, he said. ''The trouble is, it's one person's word against another,'' he said, ''and all of the experts that really know what they're doing may say it's clean and one guy who knows nothing stands up because they want to grandstand.''</p>
