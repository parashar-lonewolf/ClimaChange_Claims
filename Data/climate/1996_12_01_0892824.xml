        <p>DO you have a sore throat, runny nose or watery, itchy eyes? Are you sneezing, coughing or wheezing? Does your head ache? Feeling tired and irritable? You may have picked up a bug from a friend, family member or co-worker. Or you may have gotten sick from your house.</p>
        <p>''People usually attribute these symptoms to a cold or a flu,'' said Andrew Port, director of indoor air quality for Environmental Waste Management Associates, a consulting company in Parsippany, N.J.  ''But in a significant number of cases, these symptoms are indicative of either a problem with their heating, ventilation or air-conditioning system, or the presence of elevated concentrations of indoor air pollutants.''</p>

        <p>DO you have a sore throat, runny nose or watery, itchy eyes? Are you sneezing, coughing or wheezing? Does your head ache? Feeling tired and irritable? You may have picked up a bug from a friend, family member or co-worker. Or you may have gotten sick from your house.</p>
        <p>''People usually attribute these symptoms to a cold or a flu,'' said Andrew Port, director of indoor air quality for Environmental Waste Management Associates, a consulting company in Parsippany, N.J.  ''But in a significant number of cases, these symptoms are indicative of either a problem with their heating, ventilation or air-conditioning system, or the presence of elevated concentrations of indoor air pollutants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Port, a certified industrial hygienist, said that since the energy crisis in the early 1970's, increasing numbers of people have been complaining about illnesses that appear to be the result of increasing levels of indoor air pollution.</p>
        <p>''We try to use as little fuel as possible,'' Mr. Port said. ''So in the wintertime we seal up our homes as tightly as we can.'' In fact, he said, increased roof and wall insulation, shrink-wrapped windows, caulked door frames and even insulated electrical outlets have essentially made us prisoners of our own exhalations. ''It's like walking into a big plastic bag,'' Mr. Port said. ''You just keep breathing the same air over and over.''</p>
        <p>While inhaling someone else's carbon dioxide may seem bad enough, used breath is only part of the problem. ''Every chemical you use in the house emits vapors,'' Mr. Port said. ''And if you're exposed to a low dose of an allergen over a prolonged period of time you become increasingly sensitized to it.''</p>
        <p>Alex Wilson, publisher of Environmental Building News, a professional journal published in Brattleboro, Vt., said that while most homeowners are aware of the dangers posed by lead, asbestos and radon, fewer are aware that serious problems can be created by heating systems that are not properly maintained, by moisture that turns seemingly harmless household dust into breeding grounds for harmful molds, and even by carpeting and the glue that holds it down.</p>
        <p>''In fact, carpeting is probably the single biggest source of indoor air quality problems,'' Mr. Wilson said, explaining that carpeting and carpet adhesive contain harmful chemicals like formaldehyde that slowly evaporate into the air. That can be dangerous, he said, when people in a house breathe the same contaminated air over and over.</p>
        <p>''I would recommend buying carpet that meets the standards for low emissions set by the Carpet and Rug Institute,'' Mr. Wilson said, explaining that the institute has established a set of maximum acceptable levels of volatile organic compounds -- potentially dangerous substances -- in carpeting. Products that meet the criteria, he said, will carry the institute's seal and the phrase, ''Meets low VOC emission criteria.'' The institute, in Dalton, Ga., can be reached at (706) 278-3176.</p>
        <p>Another common source of indoor pollution is improperly maintained or improperly used heating units. Mr. Port of Environmental Waste Management Associates explained that heating devices that rely on combustion can pose potential problems. Under optimal conditions, he said, oil-  and gas-fired furnaces should be vented well enough to keep dangerous gases from filling a house.</p>
        <p>But if a squirrel seeking warm lodgings unexpectedly takes up residence in a chimney, dangerous carbon monoxide can seep back into the house.</p>
        <p>''Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that will put you to sleep and eventually kill you,'' Mr. Port said, adding that the only way to know if carbon monoxide is building up in the house is to install a carbon monoxide monitor. The situation gets even worse, Mr. Port said, when the heat source is unvented.</p>
        <p>''Kerosene heaters are the nightmare of fire departments and health professionals,'' Mr. Port said. ''There's no exhaust system hooked up to them at all. If they're working correctly, it's not much of a problem. But how do you know if they're working correctly?''</p>
        <p>Bill Kerbel, a certified industrial hygienist for Atlantic Environmental, an environmental consulting firm in Dover, N.J., said that even clean-burning natural gas can cause problems.</p>
        <p>Gas stoves and ovens, he said, generate nitrogen dioxide, a gas that can cause asthma in young children. And while normal use of a gas stove for cooking is safe, he said, nitrogen dioxide levels can rise significantly when a gas oven is used for heat in an unventilated house or apartment.  Even highly efficient gas appliances  -- like ventless fireplaces and heaters -- can create high levels of humidity in a house.</p>
        <p>In fact, humidity -- too high or too low -- can be a problem for many homeowners. Low humidity, for example, can result in drying of the skin, nasal passages and throat. Attempts to cure the problem by running humidifiers, however, can create even more problems than they solve.</p>
        <p>Dr. Philip Morey, a microbiologist with Air Quality Sciences in Marietta, Ga., explained that high levels of humidity -- which can result from too much cooking, too much showering and even too many people breathing in a confined, unvented home -- can cause condensation inside the walls and under the roof. And that, he said, can result in quietly thriving growths of mold.</p>
        <p>''Nearly every surface on the planet has some mold spores on it,'' Dr. Morey said. ''All they need is a damp environment to start growing.''</p>
        <p>And while mold may appear to be harmless, Dr. Morey said, it can be problematic when inhaled. ''We're not just talking about irritation and a headache,'' Dr. Morey said. ''The literature is very clear that there is a clear correlation between dampness, mold growth and chest disease.''</p>
        <p>When mold is present, inhaling the spores is actually quite easy -- spores are designed to float around quite nicely. It is even easier, however, when they are growing on the inside of dust-lined ductwork that has become damp as the result of a leak or water seepage.</p>
        <p>''We usually get called in when the kids are sick and the doctor asks the parents, 'When was the last time you had your ducts cleaned?' '' said Steven Frank, president of Guardian Power Cleaning, a duct cleaning contractor in Freehold, N.J.</p>
        <p>Ventilation ducts, Mr. Frank said, provide a highly efficient method for distributing air throughout the house. Mold spores, it seems, are happy to hitch a ride. And in many cases, Mr. Frank said, the inexpensive filters installed by homeowners hardly slow down a speeding spore.</p>
        <p>''The best filter is the electrostatic air filter,'' Mr. Frank said. ''It costs more money and requires more maintenance, but it does a much better job.''</p>
        <p>An even better solution, however, is to remove any potential breeding ground for mold or bacteria. ''Total source removal is the best method,'' Mr. Frank said, explaining that with such a cleaning -- which costs about $300 for an average three-bedroom house -- the contractor cuts access holes at various points in the system through which brushes can be inserted to scrape the interior surface before vacuuming the ducts clean.</p>
        <p>Finally, experts say, it pays to keep some fresh air coming into the house from somewhere -- even if it costs a few dollars more for heating fuel. ''A well-ventilated basement is the answer to a lot of indoor air quality problems,'' said Mr. Port, the industrial hygienist. ''Remember, you may not even know you've got a problem until it's too late.''</p>
