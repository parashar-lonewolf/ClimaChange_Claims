        <p>SUNSHINE apparently isn't something you miss, even when it's gone.</p>
        <p>Over the last half century, less and less sunlight has reached the earth's surface -- as much as 10 percent less in the early 1990's than in the late 1950's by some estimates. But this ''global dimming'' occurred so slowly that even scientists examining the data didn't believe it for years.</p>
        <p>''Some still don't believe it,'' said Dr. Atsumu Ohmura of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, who first noticed the effect in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>The culprit appears to be air pollution. Light bounces off particles in the air. The particles also cause more water droplets to condense, forming thicker clouds. That pollution darkens skies is not news -- 19th-century, coal-burning London famously suffered ''pea soup'' fogs that lasted for days. But the sun has dimmed everywhere, not just over cities.</p>
        <p>Air travel may have exacerbated this effect. For example, when commercial air traffic was grounded for a couple days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, meteorologists observed that temperature swings, from day to night, widened several degrees. The reason, they said, was that jet contrails normally blocked sunlight during the day and acted like a blanket at night, trapping warmth.</p>
        <p>The effects of reduced sunlight are uncertain. It might mean slower growing crops -- and less food -- particularly in heavily populated and polluted places like China and India. On the other hand, global dimming benefits arid areas like the Middle East by slowing evaporation of precious water.</p>
