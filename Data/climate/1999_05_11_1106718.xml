        <p>During a forest fire, most insects and animals flee in all directions, flying, running, crawling and using every possible means to avoid the deadly flames. But there are exceptions, like some  jewel beetles.</p>
        <p>These insects are fire seekers. Fire in the woods, particularly if certain tree species are burning, draws them from miles away. So intense is their interest that firefighters are sometimes hampered by swarms of the flying beetles, which swirl around in a distracting mass or latch onto the humans with their powerful mandibles.</p>
        <p>The seemingly strange conduct of these fire beetles, as they are sometimes called, is not an exercise in self-destruction but an example of evolutionary behavior aimed at perpetuating their species, scientists say. And some scientists believe people can capitalize on their behavior and the body parts they use to detect fire or sense chemicals in the environment.</p>
        <p>In their fire-seeking frenzy, flying into flames or crawling along still-smoldering trees, the beetles may be trying to beat competitors to weakened or dying trees so that they are the first to plant their eggs into them, researchers believe. To do that, though, the beetles must be able to find burning trees and get to them quickly. While it has been known for decades that these insects have infrared detectors that allow them to sense the heat of fires, new research by German scientists indicates they also possess highly sensitive detectors in their antennas that allow them to sense minute amounts of volatile substances in smoke from burning wood.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stefan Schutz of the Justus Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, and colleagues say this highly sensitive smoke detection, coupled with their heat sensors, appears to be part of a system that allows the beetles to sense fires and home in on them from distances of more than 30 miles away.</p>
        <p>''There is a complex interplay with the infrared system that we do not fully understand,'' Dr. Schutz said, ''but we think detecting the smoke may be an early indication to the beetle that there is a fire in the area.'' The beetles are often found in hilly places where there may not be the clear line of sight to a fire that is needed by their heat detectors, he said.</p>
        <p>''It could be that if they detect the odor of a fire they fly up and look around,'' Dr. Schutz said. The insects may also follow a wispy trail of smoke until their infrared detectors locate the blaze and guide them to it, he added.</p>
        <p>E. Richard Hoebeke, a beetle expert in the entomology department at Cornell University said the German work was ''new and exciting'' but also showed how much people had to learn about insects.</p>
        <p>''How did these beetles develop their ability to lay eggs this way?'' Mr. Hoebeke asked. ''Think about how little we know of insects with incredibly sensitive and complex sensory mechanisms.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Daniel Young, director of the insect research collection at the University of Wisconsin's entomology department, said many beetle species found in the United States and Canada exhibited fire-seeking behavior, looking for stressed or dying trees in which to plant their eggs, so their larvae could develop in or under the bark.</p>
        <p>''Trees that are healthy have chemicals, such as pitch, to attack a parasite and the strength to resist invasion,'' Dr. Young said. ''Those that are weakened, dying or dead are more acceptable hosts for insect pests.''</p>
        <p>Many of these invading insects prefer certain trees for food or egg-laying, experts said, and attack only that species or closely related species.</p>
        <p>Jewel beetles belong to a family of insects called Buprestidae, hard-shelled creatures named for their shiny, metallic-looking shells, often dabbed with bright colors or spots. The fire beetle studied by the German researchers, a species called Melanophila acuminata that has a less dazzling charcoal color, is common in temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, including large areas of Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>Dr. William G. Evans, an entomologist who studied the insects 30 years ago as a professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said he was gratified that scientists were continuing to study the beetles, but not too surprised by their findings. ''All insects have olfactory organs in their antennas,'' he said, ''and you would almost expect the beetles to detect smoke.''</p>
        <p>In earlier research, Dr. Evans discovered that Melanophila acuminata had a pair of thoracic pit organs that were sensitive infrared receptors, guiding the insect to fires.</p>
        <p>Members of the German team involved in the antenna work, Helmut Schmitz and Horst Bleckmann of Friedrich Wilhelm Rhineland University in Bonn, have continued work on the heat receptors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Evans said the theory that smoke activated the beetles' hunt for a fire was plausible, but that locating burning trees was primarily the function of the infrared detectors.</p>
        <p>In a report published in March in the British journal Nature, Dr. Schutz and his colleagues said they removed antennas from the beetles, dipped them in an electricity-conducting liquid that contained nutrients and connected them to instruments that measured electrical changes in the fluid. The antennas were exposed to volatile chemicals from smoldering pieces of wood and the reactions generated by thousands of sensory hairs on the antennas were measured by electrical changes.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that the antennas were particularly sensitive to phenolic compounds found in wood smoke, and that the reaction was pronounced for a species of pine tree, Pinus sylvestris, it particularly favored. The antennas detected combustion derivatives in concentrations as low as a few parts per billion, the researchers reported. They estimated that this sensitivity would allow a beetle to detect the smoldering bark of a single pine tree in light wind from a distance of more than half a mile.</p>
        <p>Similar tests on the antennas of three other beetles, including two that attack weakened trees, showed much lower sensitivity to combustion compounds, the report noted.</p>
        <p>Most forest fires occur in the autumn, Dr. Schutz said, and this is when the beetles lay most of their eggs. The eggs require a cooling period to hatch, which they do after the winter frost, and the larvae develop in the spring. Another curiosity about the beetle's reproductive cycle is that only 65 percent of the eggs hatch, he said, and the other third lie dormant for a year. Of these remaining eggs, two-thirds hatch the following year and the rest stay inactive for yet another year.</p>
        <p>''The beetles need forest fires to propagate and this appears to be a protective mechanism to keep the species going through years when there are no fires,'' Dr. Schutz said.</p>
        <p>The researchers said that understanding how the beetles detected fires could have practical applications, particularly in developing new types of fire alarms and early warning detectors for forest fires. Dr. Schutz said his group was working with his university's physics institute on a bio-sensor for fire warnings.</p>
        <p>Current fire alarms that look at carbon dioxide levels or combustion volatiles can be fooled by automobile fumes and other gases, he said, and the group is trying to develop a hybrid system using electronics and biological sensors to detect specific by-products of smoldering fires. They are testing a prototype bio-sensor that uses transistorized components and actual beetle antennas, he said, and are trying to isolate and identify the proteins in the insect antennas that react to smoke so that they can be used in more advanced devices.</p>
