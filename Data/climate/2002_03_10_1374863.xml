        <p>Mike Sterling, an accountant from Staten Island, very much enjoyed his lunchtime stroll through Midtown Manhattan on a late winter's day last week when the temperature was drifting languidly past 60 degrees. Lovely, he said. Beautiful.</p>
        <p>''But I'm sure we'll have to pay for it somewhere down the line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sterling's sentiment captures some of civilization's -- not to mention the accounting trade's -- oldest and biggest discontents: there is no free lunch; anything that feels good will have its comeuppance; beware of easy credit.</p>
        <p>Winter never really came to New York this year. So was that good, or bad? The lack of rain and snow made the living easy, but it delivered the region onto the threshold of a severe drought. Climate scientists say that the cumulative strangeness of the season -- the warmest and second-driest winter ever recorded in New York City through March 1 -- advanced their case that climate change, caused by the buildup of industrial-era gases in the atmosphere, is real and is happening now. But they fret that people might in fact grow to like the idea of climate change, having breezed through a winter like this one.</p>
        <p>Even some people who have dedicated their professional lives to the reduction of these so-called greenhouse gases quietly admit that they enjoyed the winter.</p>
        <p>''It's very seductive,'' said Dr. Eric Chivian, a psychiatrist and director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. ''I feel it in myself, especially as I get older. I love a balmy early-spring day in February.''</p>
        <p>For most of human history, it didn't much matter what people felt about the weather -- they simply had to deal with what it brought them. But now it does matter, scientists say. How people relate to climatic events and unusual seasons has become part of the global dynamic of environmentalism, because perception and feeling can translate into politics. And by those lights, much of the Eastern United States has become a giant psychology experiment. For people like Dr. Chivian, enjoying the winter became almost a guilty pleasure. For many others, it was a complicated one.</p>
        <p>Psychiatrists say, for example, that the number of cases of wintertime depression -- known as seasonal affective disorder -- caused by light deprivation from short, gloomy days spent indoors -- was down sharply this year because of the abundance of sun and fine weather in which to enjoy it. But in the aftermath of September's terrorist attack, they say, new depression cases more than made up the difference.</p>
        <p>Climate researchers like Dr. Chivian say that the unusual weather and drought gave them added credibility. Politicians and business leaders returned their phone calls. But the cost of that was the feeling, to their immense dread, that they'd actually been proven right.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute and co-leader of a multiyear study into the effects of climate change on the New York City region, stepped out into the yard of her home in Tarrytown, N.Y., last month, for example, and found that her quince tree had blossomed two months early.</p>
        <p>She loves her quince tree and its dark-pink blossoms. But the time was wrong. The quince tree was out of sync.</p>
        <p>''We didn't really want this to be coming true,'' she said.</p>
        <p>What complicates the winter-that-never-was, making it more than simply nice or not, is that it was both a startling weather event in its own right and a cause of future disruption at the same time. The very hot summer of 1999, by contrast, also broke weather records, but it was, in a way, self-contained in that it did not leave lasting imprints on the seasons that followed. This winter was not like that. By its very dry balmy beauty it altered the future by not adequately filling the reservoirs that supply the region's water. It forced people, or at least politicians, to think beyond the immediate season.</p>
        <p>And that, in turn, scientists say, is what starts to connect the dots between day-to-day weather and the broader question of climate, and then beyond that to things like changing habitats and endangered species.</p>
        <p>A recent report by Dr. Rosenzweig's group at Columbia said, for example, that New York's climate in the middle of the 21st century might be drier, with more frequent droughts, or that it might be wetter, with more rainfall, but that in any case traditional seasonal cues and rhythms would likely be the first casualty.</p>
        <p>William Solecki, a professor of geography at Montclair State University in New Jersey and co-leader of the regional climate-assessment project with Dr. Rosenzweig, said that an absence of winter heightened for him the strangeness of life after the terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>''Sept. 11, if you remember, was a crystal-clear-blue, dry day, and now the whole season has been like that over and over again. It's like being stuck in a time warp -- time isn't moving forward the way it normally does.''</p>
        <p>For other people, it's that very sense of altered time since the attacks that made a beautiful winter even more precious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sterling, the accountant who works in Midtown, said the heightened sense of uncertainty about life and the future made it imperative to him to seize each day as it comes.</p>
        <p>''You have to enjoy life wherever you can,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Climate scientists see a dark cloud behind that kind of reaction to the weather, too.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chivian at Harvard said that on one level, he thinks the reassessments that people like Mr. Sterling have made about priorities and values are generally positive. But in thinking about human responsibility for future generations and ecosystems, the spirit of living for today can lead to a sense of acceptance and passivity, Dr. Chivian said, and that could have disastrous consequences.</p>
        <p>''It illustrates a kind of helplessness, that there's nothing we can do about this, the best we can do is count our blessings and enjoy life as it comes,'' he said. ''Yes, it's nice to enjoy every day, but these are things we can control, and that we've got to control, or people coming after us will say we squandered an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Other researchers say that the ethos of American life, hammered into people's heads by credit card companies, carmakers and fast-food sellers, is to buy now, consume now, live now, and whatever you do don't put off the gratification. Asking people to think beyond the current season, indeed to generations beyond the current season, runs counter to those very powerful forces.</p>
        <p>Even asking people whether a pleasant winter alters their thinking about climate makes some scientists uncomfortable. A changed climate will in fact have winners and losers, those scientists say, and New York, in some ways, might well benefit. But to think only of the parochial consequences is exactly the sort of self-centered short-term thinking, they say, that created the problem, especially from the burning of fossil fuels in cars and electric power generators.</p>
        <p>''As we're enjoying consumer society, most of us don't think about the negative consequences of having too much enjoyment in life,'' said Dr. Dan A. Oren, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. ''I suspect that the average citizen, including you and me most of the time,'' he said, does not feel ''the guilt that ought to be there.''</p>
        <p>Somewhere in the middle of all that, real life went on in New York this winter, and people like Cynthia Ruiz were able to hold two very conflicting ideas in their heads.</p>
        <p>''It's beautiful. It's scary,'' said Ms. Ruiz, a member-services representative for a labor union, who was taking her lunch hour in Bryant Park on Thursday, when the temperature reached 65. ''I worry about the global warming thing. The drought, yeah, too. Other than that, it's great.''</p>
