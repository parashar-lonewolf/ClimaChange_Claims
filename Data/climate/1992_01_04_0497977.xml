        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Forget Dr. No" (editorial, Dec. 22) correctly calls attention to the major problem of the future of the scientists of the former Soviet Union. But to suggest that Western governments and foundations support scientific work inside the former Soviet Union is dead wrong!</p>
        <p>First of all, it will not work. "A Soviet (Russian) Academy Is Adrift" (news article, Dec. 14) cited the extensive emigration of hundreds of the best scientists. Giving funds to the laboratories of the defunct Soviet Academy of Sciences may well result in support of mediocre or politically favored work. To assure proper use of Western funds, an army of Western scientists would be needed. Talented scientists in Eastern Europe, India, China, Pakistan (to name a few regions) are also underemployed and are potential candidates to be attracted to "rogue" projects in bandit nations like Iraq.</p>
        <p>The United States would do far better to reverse the downslide of support for employment of trained scientists in this country: (1) by a major increase of funding for basic and applied research in American universities; (2) by increasing the opportunities for permanent and visiting positions in major national laboratories such as Brookhaven, Argonne, Los Alamos; (3) by giving governmental tax write-offs for private industrial research laboratories.</p>
        <p>All these mechanisms were used after World War II with great success, resulting in uncountable patents, in creation of new industries such as electronics, and in other major achievements.</p>
        <p>Yes, save Soviet scientists! Have them come here and join American scientists to solve the nation's and the world's pressing technical problems -- such as the need for renewable energy sources, for the immunization and cure of AIDS, for weather prediction, for preservation of the global environment. But don't throw good money into a decaying and chaotic bureaucracy that has outlived its usefulness!  JOSEPH L. BIRMAN Distinguished Professor of Physics, City College, CUNY New York, Dec. 22, 1991</p>
