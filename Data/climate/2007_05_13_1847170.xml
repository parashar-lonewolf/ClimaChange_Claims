        <p>Re ''A Split Emerges as Conservatives Discuss Darwin'' (front page, May 5):</p>
        <p>Evolution is the study of how species change, how new species originate and how living species adjust to environmental change -- knowledge essential to the survival of present and future generations as they cope with climate change.</p>
        <p>The Republican presidential candidates should have been asked if they objected to evolution being taught in secondary schools and, if not, whether they, like President Bush, would mix religion (intelligent design) with science.</p>
        <p>As to how conservative ideologies struggle to adapt to Darwinian theory, the real question should be: Should the religious right continue its efforts to deprive millions of American students of the knowledge of how species change?</p>
        <p>James V. Bradley  Libertyville, Ill., May 5, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a retired biology teacher and the author of ''How Species Change.''</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Conservatives who believe a Darwinian view of human nature supports their policies are being very selective. True, our competitiveness and acquisitiveness make capitalism good for productivity, but we still have to rein in corporate greed, pollution, gun violence, militarism and other excesses.</p>
        <p>Darwin's brilliant theory of evolution by natural selection explains that we became what we are because, in the ancestral environment, traits that promoted survival and reproduction were passed on. Somehow, our brains grew big enough to give us our adaptability, inventiveness and morality.</p>
        <p>Ever since, our cultures and technology have evolved much faster than our biology.</p>
        <p>Our evolutionary past doesn't tell us what choices we should make today; old strategies don't always work in a new environment. Darwin himself had a strong moral sense and clearly saw that we had to transcend our animal natures to build a better world. Let's hope our brains are big enough.</p>
        <p>Gerald W. Neuberg, M.D.  Irvington, N.Y., May 7, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Some conservative intellectuals, you report, now argue in favor of Darwin's theory of natural selection, convinced that it ''can provide support for many bedrock conservative ideas, like traditional social roles for men and women, free-market capitalism and governmental checks and balances.''</p>
        <p>But aren't they committing the same blunder that supporters of ''intelligent design'' or ''creationism'' make? Aren't they evaluating Darwin's theory solely on the basis of its utility to a particular belief system and not in terms of the hard evidence of empirical science?</p>
        <p>(Rev.) Nils Blatz  Mattituck, N.Y. , May 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It amazes me how much it can upset people of religion when science is proposed as an explanation for what they take on faith. After all, God created science, too.</p>
        <p>Randall Davis  Chicago, May 5, 2007</p>
