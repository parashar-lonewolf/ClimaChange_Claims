        <p>Actress Sues Over 'Movin' Out'</p>
        <p>A dancer and actress who says she was harassed for having large breasts and a serious toe injury while performing in the touring version of the Tony Award-winning musical ''Movin' Out'' has filed a second lawsuit seeking more than $100 million, The Associated Press reported. Alice Alyse, 29, left, filed suit for more than $100 million against the owners and managers of the touring production in March. Now she is suing the Actors' Equity Association for an additional $100 million. In the new suit, filed this week, Ms. Alyse, whose mother is Nicaraguan, contends that the union failed to address her complaints of sexual harassment and sexual and ethnic discrimination, violated union grievance procedures and conspired with the show's owners and managers to damage her financially, emotionally and physically. Franklin Moss, outside counsel for the Actors' Equity Association, said the union had not been served with any papers.</p>
        <p>Public Knowledge: Kevin Kline in 'Lear'</p>
        <p>Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public, revealed at a fund-raising gala on Wednesday night that the mysterious Shakespeare play this fall to star Kevin Kline, below, with James Lapine directing, would be ''King Lear.'' The announcement was hardly a surprise; Mr. Lapine and Mr. Kline had held a widely reported ''secret'' workshop of ''Lear,'' and apparently it took. In other Public news Christopher Walken will show up in the second Shakespeare in the Park play this summer, Bertolt Brecht's ''Mother Courage and Her Children.'' Mr. Walken, who will play the Cook, joins an already name-heavy production: George C. Wolfe is directing, Tony Kushner has written a new translation, Jeanine Tesori has written original music and Meryl Streep plays the title role. ''Mother Courage'' begins previews on Aug. 8, and opens on Aug. 21.</p>
        <p>'Encores!' to Salute Revues</p>
        <p>Honoring the 100th anniversary of the first ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' the 2007 season of ''Encores!'' at City Center will pay tribute to the Broadway revue with three shows, including its first original production. The season begins Feb. 8 to Feb. 11 with what is billed as the first full-scale New York presentation of Stephen Sondheim's score for ''Follies'' in more than two decades. From March 29 to April 1, ''Encores!'' will present a full-scale restoration of the 1932 Irving Berlin and Moss Hart musical, ''Face the Music,'' about a desperate New York producer trying to raise money for his latest revue. The season will end with ''Stairway to Paradise,'' May 10 to May 14, a specially created production that is to celebrate a half-century of Broadway revues with numbers and sketches from Ziegfeld shows, as well as from ''The Garrick Gaieties,'' ''The Band Wagon,'' ''As Thousands Cheer,'' ''This Is the Army,'' ''Call Me Mister,'' ''Pins and Needles'' and more.</p>
        <p>NBC Expands Investigative Unit</p>
        <p>NBC News has announced an increase in the number of news division producers working in its investigative reporting unit, Reuters reported. In the initial expansion, the number working with Lisa Myers, left, the senior investigative correspondent, will increase to 10 from 4. The unit contributes to ''NBC Nightly News,'' ''Dateline NBC'' and MSNBC and CNBC. ''It's a big commitment,'' said Steve Capus, the president of the news division. ''It's a commitment to the kind of news that I would like to see the news division doing.''  With the first reading of scripts for the final eight episodes of HBO's ''Sopranos'' scheduled for Thursday, four more cast members have signed new contracts or are close to signing, Reuters reported. They are Lorraine Bracco, who plays Tony Soprano's psychiatrist, Jennifer Melfi; Aida Turturro, who plays his sister Janice; and Robert Iler and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, who play his children. Still unsigned are Tony Sirico, Steven Van Zandt and Steven Schirripa.</p>
        <p>Dave Matthews Band Aids Environment</p>
        <p>The Dave Matthews Band (below, Mr. Matthews) is lining up on the side of the environment. The band paid $200,000 last year to settle a charge that one of its bus drivers had dumped human waste off a bridge over the Chicago River, is trying to ease global warming by taking part in a program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other pollution, Reuters reported. According to the energy company NativeEnergy, the band is buying so-called offsetting credits to eliminate pollution equivalent to 36 million average car miles, roughly what the band and its fans have produced in the last 15 years. NativeEnergy did not say how much the band would pay, but its online calculator put the figure at $216,000.  Hootie and the Blowfish will do their part for education when they begin their 10-city Homegrown Concert tour in Nashville on Monday, The Associated Press reported. The band will be collecting school supplies. Ticketholders are encouraged to bring supplies to be donated to the school system in each community, and in each city a business or organization will make a donation to the schools.  XM Satellite Radio announced that Willie Nelson would join its lineup to provide creative direction for its traditional music channel, ''Willie's Place,'' formerly known as ''Hank's Place.'' He will also contribute exclusive programming to it and other XM music channels.</p>
