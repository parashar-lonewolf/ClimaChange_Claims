        <p>LEAD: With the permission of Queen Elizabeth II, the repository of the Queen's English has been modernized and internationalized with words and phrases that would have puzzled Queen Victoria and startled polite society in the Victorian Age.</p>
        <p>With the permission of Queen Elizabeth II, the repository of the Queen's English has been modernized and internationalized with words and phrases that would have puzzled Queen Victoria and startled polite society in the Victorian Age.</p>
        <p>When the newly revised, 20-volume second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is officially published in London next Wednesday by the Oxford University Press, it will be the first comprehensive edition since the original 12 volumes appeared in 1928 and immediately became the last word on words. The dictionary, known as the O.E.D., will make its debut with ruffles and flourishes at Claridge's, the Mayfair caravansary, at a party to be attended by royalty, commoners and hundreds of lexicographers. The capacious, expensive ($2,500) dictionary, like the first edition, will be the arbiter of the English language as it is read and spoken all over the world - including the former 13 Colonies.</p>
        <p>The dictionary's publishers say America is the largest market for the O.E.D. 2, as well as the source of many of the new entries. From Clones to Crack</p>
        <p>The O.E.D. 2 includes some impudent and technical language, signifying the greater acceptability of street argot, the vast changes in life styles and the revolutionary developments in the sciences since the time when the sun never set on the Empire.</p>
        <p>Among the new words and phrases found in O.E.D. 2 are: yuppification, clone, breakdancing, nuclear winter, blow (as in depart), basket case, brain dead, badmouth, acid freak, right-to-die, drunk tank, foxy (as in sexy or sultry), AIDS-related, passive smoking, cheapo, ghetto blaster, desktop publishing, Filofax, bottom line, Eurobond, crack, buyout (leveraged, management), drag queen, palimony and the pits.</p>
        <p>Following a nearly century-old tradition, O.E.D. 2 is dedicated ''by gracious permission'' to the reigning monarch. Under the editorship of Dr. James A. H. Murray, a former schoolmaster, the first O.E.D. was begun in 1884 and dutifully dedicated by the University of Oxford to Queen Victoria in 1897. It was released one volume at a time; not until 1928 was the entire 12-volume set completed and dedicated to King George V. A supplement was deemed necessary only five years later. Between 1972 and 1986, four more volumes were added to the 13-volume 1933 edition. #60 Million Words The O.E.D. 2, some seven years in the making, incorporates the original entries plus the supplements - and then some. The 1928 O.E.D. has 44 million words; the O.E.D. 2 has nearly 60 million words.</p>
        <p>''We've added 5,000 new words, or new senses of existing words, to cover current language,'' said John A. Simpson, the co-editor of the new edition, with Edmund S. C. Weiner. Mr. Simpson was in Washington recently to sign up American researchers to work on future editions.</p>
        <p>Most of the dictionary's researchers are in England; several are in New York, Washington and Boston because of their proximity to major libraries. ''We - and the new words - never stop,'' said Mr. Simpson. New Roots for Old Words</p>
        <p>Both the co-editors, who are British, began working for Oxford University Press shortly after graduating from their universities. Mr. Simpson, who is 35 years old, studied at York; Mr. Weiner, who is 38, was at Oxford. They consider lexicography their profession. Both said that discovering a new historical root for an old or modern word is an exhilarating adventure.</p>
        <p>''We have a permanent staff of about 20 people and some 300 to 400 contributors, always searching for new words,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''American fiction, Australian and South African journals, hobby magazines, even private correspondence -they're all part of our quarry.''</p>
        <p>The statistics for the new dictionary are mind-boggling. There are 22,000 pages. More than 500,000 words are defined and illustrated with nearly 2 1/2 million quotations (Shakespeare is cited 33,150 times). There are 577,000 cross-references, 249,000 etymologies, and 137,000 pronunciations. There are 290,000 main entries, or about 38,000 more than in the first edition. The longest entry in O.E.D. 2 is for the verb ''set,'' which has 154 main senses, and alone includes 60,000 words and 362,000 characters. It is little wonder that the new dictionary occupies nearly four feet of shelf space. #10,000 Sets to Be Available Although handwritten in the research stage, the revised edition was computerized; it serves as an electronic data base that will enable future changes to be made quickly.</p>
        <p>Oxford University Press, which edited the dictionary at its home base in England and printed it in Taunton, Mass., has produced 10,000 sets.</p>
        <p>The original 1928 O.E.D. is still available on a single CD-ROM disk (the letters stand for compact disk, read-only memory) for about $860. Oxford University Press is looking into the possibility of fitting O.E.D. 2 on a disk. In the early 1990's, the complete O.E.D. 2 is to come out in two or three volumes, requiring a magnifying glass to read; the first O.E.D. has such an edition in two volumes. An abridged Shorter O.E.D. 2, in two or three volumes, is also in preparation for the 1990's. The Language of Science . . .  Mr. Simpson pointed out that the English language is now the language of record in the fields of science and technology; more than 20 percent of the new entries are from these vocabularies. Among the new science entries are acid rain, bar-coding, big crunch, cursor, daisy wheel, download and laptop.</p>
        <p>Commerce also has made contributions: agribusiness, bagman, bed and breakfast, cash flow, credit union, deregulate, duty-free, fast track, Fortune 500, Great Leap Forward, greenmail, petro-currency and plastic money.</p>
        <p>Medical terms that didn't exist in the earlier edition include acupressure, biofeedback, CAT, amniocentesis, est, detox and nose job (a colloquial Americanism for ''an operation involving rhinoplasty or cosmetic surgery on a person's nose''). . . . Of Cultures . . .</p>
        <p>''We don't seek out the most trendy words,'' Mr. Simpson said, ''but instead wait till the words are in widespread use. The new words aren't intended to represent simply the emergent vocabulary of the last few years.</p>
        <p>''We have quite a few Yiddish words and expressions that have become Americanized,'' he said, ''such as schlepping and schlemozzle. Actually, they're mock-Yiddish.''</p>
        <p>According to the O.E.D. 2, schlemozzle is ''a muddle or complication, a quarrel, rumpus or melee,'' with the additional explanation that it is ''perhaps an adaptation of the Yiddish for an unlucky person.'' . . . And of Diplomacy The Russian word glasnost requires 53 lines. The historical small type in the definition says that ''the Russian word is recorded in dictionaries from the 18th century, but in a more general sense of publicity.'' Usages by Lenin, Solzhenitsyn and Gorbachev are cited.</p>
        <p>A reader can find the phrase ''Big Apple'' in a section on combinations of the word big. Big Apple has these definitions: ''(a) a ballroom dance for a group of people, popular in the 1930's; (b) slang, the city of New York; big band, a large band of musicians playing jazz, dance-music or the like (as distinct from a small group or 'combo').''</p>
        <p>Stuart Flexner, the editor in chief of the Random House reference division, which produced its second edition of the Random House Dictionary of the English Language in one volume in 1987, said: ''The O.E.D. is based on historical principles. Over the years, it has added more American words and we've added more British words - like braces for suspenders, lift for elevator and roundabout for a traffic circle.''</p>
        <p>Before returning home to Oxford, Mr. Simpson said the language in the O.E.D. ''is not just the so-called King's, or Queen's English, but the people's English.</p>
        <p>''I like to think O.E.D. 2 is the dictionary of record of every aspect of human emotions.''</p>
