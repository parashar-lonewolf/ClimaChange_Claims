        <p>Gov.

        <p>Gov. Eliot Spitzer has now added his voice to the chorus of New York lawmakers imploring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct a thorough, independent safety inspection at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan -- not the routine maintenance and oversight that the commission insists is all that's needed, but a special, meticulous, top-to-bottom review that includes experts from outside the region and input from the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer is right to do so. The plant is aging and seemingly snake-bit, wrapped in a perennial fog of missteps and glitches and public-relations embarrassments.</p>
        <p>It leaks tritium and strontium.</p>
        <p>Its sirens continually fail.</p>
        <p>And its unplanned shutdowns are so frequent they seem to follow a schedule.</p>
        <p>That's oxymoronic, but that's Indian Point for you. Now that Entergy Nuclear Northeast has officially submitted its application for 20-year extensions of Indian Point's two reactor licenses, concerns about ineptitude and decrepitude are more relevant than ever.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer is walking a potentially delicate line. Though conservation and efficiency can do much to reduce demand, New York State will need to increase supply, while striving to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels as well as its greenhouse gas emissions. It is hard to imagine achieving either objective without including some nuclear power in the energy mix. As badly as people may want to pull the plug on Indian Point -- particularly those living in its shadow in New York City and the Hudson Valley -- it's still too early to do so. Mr. Spitzer's responsible call for tougher inspections should not be construed as a campaign to blow a hole in the state's power grid.</p>
        <p>There is, however, no contradiction in recognizing the need for clean-burning nuclear plants and the critical importance of making them impeccably safe and secure.</p>
        <p>Not everyone seems to get that. Mr. Spitzer's original budget sought to charge New York's nuclear plants $13 million to help pay the state for using National Guard for security; that proposal was killed in the Legislature, to the delight of the energy companies, which had argued that it was only fair that they be allowed to shuck off that expense.</p>
        <p>And on one basic point -- reliable warning sirens -- Entergy seems bafflingly incompetent and lackadaisical, having missed repeated deadlines to install a functioning system. It was recently fined $130,000 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for blowing its April deadline; the company now promises to have a plan in place by the time the next deadline rolls around.</p>
        <p>Plans are one thing. Working sirens are another. Indian Point's chronic missteps have badly strained public confidence, something that its owners and federal regulators should make it a priority to restore. They should start, at the very least, with an independent safety assessment.</p>
