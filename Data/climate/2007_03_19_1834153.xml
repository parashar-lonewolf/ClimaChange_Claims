        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I didn't think that the Bush administration was capable of appalling me any more than it already has, but ''Whose Oil Is It, Anyway?,'' by Antonia Juhasz (Op-Ed, March 13), proved me wrong.</p>
        <p>So one of our vital ''benchmarks'' for Iraqi progress, a measure by which we determine when to bring home our brave service members, is to allow multinational oil companies to take control of Iraqi oil, thus increasing their already burgeoning profits while reducing the amount of oil revenues available for Iraqi national reinvestment?</p>
        <p>Remember those antiwar protesters and their signs that read ''No Blood for Oil''? Remember how they were derided as anti-American and antimilitary? It appears that those protesters spoke the truth.</p>
        <p>This is just another example of Big Oil's dominance of American foreign and domestic policy, right alongside the administration's refusal to take meaningful action to combat global climate change.</p>
        <p>Dan Browning  Decatur, Ga., March 13, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was mortified to read Antonia Juhasz's Op-Ed article about the proposed Iraqi oil law and to realize that the world's suspicions about oil being the primary agenda of the Iraq invasion were correct.</p>
        <p>Now that we have devastated Iraq and killed untold numbers of its citizens, the United States intends to magnify the impact of its malevolent presence by depriving the Iraqi people of the means to rebuild their shattered nation.</p>
        <p>The oil law set to go before the Iraqi Parliament is radical, and the model has been rejected by other oil-producing nations of the Middle East precisely because of the unfair advantage it offers to multinational corporations.</p>
        <p>President Bush has suggested that ''they hate us'' because we ''value freedom.'' I might suggest that perhaps they hate us for robbing them blind.</p>
