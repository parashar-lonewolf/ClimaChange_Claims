        <p>CHAMONIX, France - First came the town, then the tunnel.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>First came the town, then the tunnel.</p>
        <p>The town is an Alpine resort of 10,000 nestled under the sugar white slopes of Mont Blanc. The tunnel cuts a seven-mile long passage through the mountain.</p>
        <p>These days their relations are taut. For many townspeople here, the tunnel has become an ogre, spewing pollution on Alpine landscapes and tarnishing the beauty that lies at the heart of the tourism industry that nurtures the town.</p>
        <p>The reason for the disenchantment is simple: The Alps, of which Mont Blanc is the highest peak, have the effrontery to stand between several of Europe's most dynamic industrial regions in southern France and northern Italy. So every day about 4,000 tractor-trailers, roughly half the total truck traffic crossing the Alps, rumble through the tunnel and clog feeder roads in the Alpine valleys.</p>
        <p>Opposition to the tunnel galvanized six years ago, when a passing refrigerator truck burst into flames, leaving 39 dead. The tunnel, a favorite of tourists driving the Alpine routes from France and Switzerland to northern Italy, was ultimately reopened and the trial of those believed responsible is still pending.</p>
        <p>Passions flared again in June when a truck burst into flames in the Fréjus tunnel, which pierces the Alps south of here. Since then, roughly half its daily truck traffic has been diverted to Mont Blanc. Fréjus is expected to reopen by the end of August.</p>
        <p>Jean-Pierre Comeliau, 57, a building contractor who leads a local environmental group, says that besides creating noise and vibrations, the trucks spew diesel fumes and fine particles that accumulate in the steep Alpine valley and contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>And the Fréjus explosion was a vivid reminder that safety concerns have yet to be fully addressed.</p>
        <p>''Six years after the accident, nothing has changed,'' Comeliau said. ''They're just managing a continuous crisis.''</p>
        <p>The man who has to manage the situation is Pierre-Francois Linares, a 50-year old former naval officer who is one of the tunnel's three directors. Despite accidents, the volume of truck freight through the Alps has soared, he said. With the opening of formerly communist eastern Europe, the volume of traffic from those countries has tripled, he said while gazing out of his office at the tunnel's mouth toward trucks from Poland and Lithuania.</p>
        <p>To regulate the flow through Mont Blanc, Mr. Linares said, trucks are made to wait on approach roads, which can accommodate as many as 500 of them, before they are sent through in convoys. ''The reverse side of the coin,'' he said, gesturing down into the valley, ''is that by accommodating them, we're polluting down there.''</p>
        <p>While recognizing the scale of the environmental challenge, some local people shy away from blaming the trucks for it. Laurent Collignon, 42, one of 200 mountain guides who lead tourists in the Alps, points to the immense Bossons glacier that edges imperceptibly down the slopes of Mont Blanc. The glacier is shrinking, and its color, except in winter, is a dirty brown.</p>
        <p>''We have a problem: The ice is receding,'' Mr. Collignon said. ''It may not be the tunnel, but it's global warming.'' The brown color, he said, comes from dirt and stones the glacier plows up as it recedes.</p>
        <p>Michel Charlet, Chamonix's mayor since 1983, says the town is trying to tame its many sources of pollution. ''Large installations are now heated by gas, and we are introducing buses and shuttles, some free of charge,'' he said. As for the trucks: ''We're trying to diminish their number.''</p>
        <p>That number is not academic. Most travel in and out of Chamonix is by road, much of it through the tunnel. The risk of fire is always present, despite new safety features since the Mont Blanc tunnel fire. Moreover, trucks can sideswipe each other since the tunnel was originally deigned for narrower passenger cars and buses, not wide vehicles. ''The risk of accidents is always there, and the more vehicles, the more risk,'' Mr. Charlet said, adding that ''It's never an exact science.''</p>
        <p>''I'm worried,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a country little inclined to embrace American solutions, Mr. Charlet favors what he calls the American method: loading containers, or entire trucks, onto rail cars for long distance shipment. But the environmentalists say that the Paris government, by keeping diesel fuel cheap and taxes on trucks low, has favored road over rail for freight, with sometimes paradoxical results.</p>
        <p>Dutch potatoes are trucked to Spain to be cleaned and peeled, Mr. Comeliau said, then trucked back to Holland for sale there. Similarly, shrimp are trucked and shipped from Denmark to Morocco, via Spain, to be cleaned, then hauled back to Denmark.</p>
        <p>Both the mayor and the environmentalists agree that, for the moment, no affordable alternative exists, since France has spent profusely to build high speed passenger trains, but relatively little for freight.</p>
        <p>''Today we're at an impasse,'' said Mr. Comeliau.</p>
