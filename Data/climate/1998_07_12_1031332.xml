      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Since sweeping into Washington in 1995, the Contract-With-America Republicans have tried every legislative trick in the book to undermine the nation's environmental laws. Heroic efforts by moderate House Republicans and timely Presidential vetoes have held them off. But the G.O.P. contractors are a patient bunch, and after lying around in the weeds for a while, they have now loaded up two big appropriation bills with nearly 20 anti-environmental riders. None of these riders challenge any basic law, but collectively they threaten the nation's struggle to clean its air and water, restore important fisheries and protect its public lands. The moderates must try to sanitize these bills. If that fails, Mr. Clinton should veto them if they reach his desk in anything like their present form.</p>
        <p>The rider that most offends the White House was attached by the House Appropriations Committee to a bill providing funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. It would bar the agency from spending any money to carry out the global warming agreement negotiated in Japan last year until the Senate approves the treaty. Read literally, this provision could prevent the Administration from encouraging industry to take purely voluntary steps to reduce carbon dioxide before the treaty becomes binding. This is truly retrograde thinking, not least because it would discourage energy-saving measures that would make sense even if global warming did not exist.</p>

        <p>Since sweeping into Washington in 1995, the Contract-With-America Republicans have tried every legislative trick in the book to undermine the nation's environmental laws. Heroic efforts by moderate House Republicans and timely Presidential vetoes have held them off. But the G.O.P. contractors are a patient bunch, and after lying around in the weeds for a while, they have now loaded up two big appropriation bills with nearly 20 anti-environmental riders. None of these riders challenge any basic law, but collectively they threaten the nation's struggle to clean its air and water, restore important fisheries and protect its public lands. The moderates must try to sanitize these bills. If that fails, Mr. Clinton should veto them if they reach his desk in anything like their present form.</p>
        <p>The rider that most offends the White House was attached by the House Appropriations Committee to a bill providing funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. It would bar the agency from spending any money to carry out the global warming agreement negotiated in Japan last year until the Senate approves the treaty. Read literally, this provision could prevent the Administration from encouraging industry to take purely voluntary steps to reduce carbon dioxide before the treaty becomes binding. This is truly retrograde thinking, not least because it would discourage energy-saving measures that would make sense even if global warming did not exist.</p>
        <p>Most of the other riders fall into the category of regional mischief-making, an area in which Alaska's Congressional delegation is the undisputed champion. Senators Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski and Representative Don Young have burdened the Interior Department spending bill with provisions that would increase logging in the Tongass National Forest, prevent the National Park Service from phasing out commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park and authorize new road construction through the Chugach National Forest and the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>The Izembek road has assumed talismanic significance to both sides. Environmentalists say it would be the first road built through a designated wilderness area in 34 years, and thus a terrible precedent. The Alaska delegation says the road is needed to transport isolated villagers to modern hospitals. There may be room for argument here, but Mr. Stevens, the feared chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, seemed in no mood for deliberation when he warned his colleagues that he would not easily forget a vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>Other Westerners have inserted provisions that would delay modest but useful efforts to improve the health of the national forests and minimize harmful grazing and mining practices on Federal lands. But the worst rider of all comes from Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican who always seems to be in the vicinity of bad ideas. It would require specific Congressional approval for any changes in the operation of any dam, public or private, in the Columbia River watershed -- effectively overriding all other environmental protections and dealing a huge blow to efforts to restore salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorton's audacity would never survive a separate vote, so he hopes to sneak it through as part of a larger spending bill. If Mr. Gorton succeeds, President Clinton must intervene. The Gorton rider alone is worth a veto.</p>
