        <p>Q: As the popular governor of New Mexico but one of the less-popular candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president, did you enter the race to actually win or merely to angle for another position at the national level? I want to be president. If I don't win the presidency, I am not interested in the vice presidency or in being secretary of state.</p>

        <p>Q: As the popular governor of New Mexico but one of the less-popular candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president, did you enter the race to actually win or merely to angle for another position at the national level? I want to be president. If I don't win the presidency, I am not interested in the vice presidency or in being secretary of state.</p>
        <p>Why not? As a former ambassador to the U.N. under President Clinton, as well as a self-appointed global trouble-shooter, you seem like a natural for secretary of state. I can be a governor who practices foreign policy, as I do.</p>
        <p>Right, just last month you toured a refugee camp in Darfur and went on to Khartoum, where you were able to arrange a 60-day cease-fire between rebel groups and the Sudanese dictator, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. What is he like? I met with him twice on that trip. He is very pragmatic and also very isolated. I got an American journalist out late last year, and as the American ambassador said, he likes me, Bashir. So I used that. That was the reason the Save Darfur Coalition asked me to go to try to get him to do a cease-fire.</p>
        <p>How do you think Condoleezza Rice and the rest of the State Department view your interventions into foreign affairs? I am sure she would prefer that I not be involved, that her own diplomats take care of things.</p>
        <p>So you think she considers you annoying? I would think so.</p>
        <p>Do you hold her responsible for the unilateral thrust of this administration's policies? No, I believe it is President Bush, who is saying, ''I don't talk to countries that exhibit bad behavior.'' And pretty soon, with that standard, we're only going to be talking to the Vatican.</p>
        <p>In recognition of your diplomatic efforts in various countries including North Korea, you've been nominated four times for the Nobel Peace Prize. Have you lobbied for it? No, you're told that is the worst thing to do. Don't lobby, don't make public statements.</p>
        <p>I once read somewhere that people who are obsessed with making peace between warring camps tend to have grown up in homes where there was a lot of arguing between the parents. Was that true in your case? In my case, my parents sent me away at a very early age. So I don't know if they fought. I was 12, and I was gone. I think I have tried to be a negotiator because of my bicultural background.</p>
        <p>Your father was an American banker, and your mother was from Mexico, where you spent most of your boyhood. As the first Hispanic major-party candidate to seek the presidency, do you think this country should officially be bilingual? No.</p>
        <p>Many people in New Mexico say they knew you were running for president a few months ago, when you suddenly began to shed pounds, which you seem to do every time you're seeking office. I think the American people want their leaders to be and look healthy. I've lost about 30 pounds in five months. I need to come down another 10 pounds.</p>
        <p>Why do I keep hearing about you and speeding tickets? We never did get a ticket, but I was speeding. I'm impatient. I try to get too many things done. But it happened twice, and then it became part of the lore.</p>
        <p>Well, at least you drive your own car, instead of being chauffeured around town. No, I wasn't driving. The state police drive me. But it was my fault.</p>
        <p>On what basis, other than your record-breaking speed, do you think you can win the presidency? A lot of other candidates can give speeches about renewable energy and Iraq and creating jobs. I've got the experience. I've got the background. I've got the training. I believe as a negotiator I can bring people and the country together.</p>
        <p>Doesn't Hillary Clinton, for instance, also have experience? I don't want to get into that. I'm going to be positive in this campaign.</p>
