        <p>LEAD: Our frozen-apple-pie contest has been a disappointment. Hoping to discover a new cliche for the outmoded expression ''as American as apple pie,'' we offered a frozen apple pie as a prize for the best entry and sat back waiting to be deluged with fresh, pungent and colorful phrases.</p>
        <p>Our frozen-apple-pie contest has been a disappointment. Hoping to discover a new cliche for the outmoded expression ''as American as apple pie,'' we offered a frozen apple pie as a prize for the best entry and sat back waiting to be deluged with fresh, pungent and colorful phrases.</p>
        <p>That was six weeks ago. This was our first experience at running a contest, and had we known at the outset what we know now, we would not have got into it.</p>
        <p>For example, any number of careless readers submitted entries based on the mistaken belief that they were supposed to come up with a new cliche for ''as American as mom's apple pie.''</p>
        <p>This produced bales of cliches incorporating the word ''mom's.'' We got ''as American as mom's pizza pie,'' ''as American as mom's product tampering,'' ''as American as mom's smoking gun,'' ''as American as mom's acid stomach,'' ''as American as mom's mugging,'' ''as American as mom's electric chair,'' and more.</p>
        <p>Many contestants were so confused on this point that they believed the prize for best entry was a frozen mom. A Mr. Vanocur wrote that he considered it vulgar to give away a frozen mom in a contest and asked what the country was coming to.</p>
        <p>This, incidentally, seems to be an extremely American question to ask, for several dozen contestants proposed ''as American as asking what the country's coming to.''</p>
        <p>We also had trouble with the prize frozen pie, which of course we bought minutes after announcing the contest lest we run afoul of the Government.</p>
        <p>What Government laws may require of persons running a contest we did not know, but there was bound to be a Federal Contest Agency. Doubtless it employed prosecutors just itching to send people like us to Leavenworth if caught without the prize on hand whenever Federal prize inspectors drop in without warning.</p>
        <p>Its inspectors would surely demand a urine sample taken at the time the prize was bought. Would anybody nowadays risk accepting a prize pie purchased by a person under the influence of alcohol or illicit abusable substances?</p>
        <p>So into the freezer in a sealed jar went this favorite Government evidence, as well as a frozen apple pie purchased minutes earlier.</p>
        <p>By now it was obvious we could be flirting with years in the courtroom unless we got a license, or perhaps a writ, or an ex post facto law, or a bill of attainder. To find out, we needed a lawyer, and we found one by mingling in a cocktail party in a suburb so out of the mainstream that people, not to mention lawyers, still called for bourbon instead of seltzer with a slice of celery.</p>
        <p>Our lawyer was not too far gone, however, to realize that we were trying to pump him for some free counsel. In short, we were brushed aside like a mere unincorporated institution without sufficient assets to support a three-year court case, which we were.</p>
        <p>''Contest law? You can't afford it,'' he told us. ''It is a fen so impenetrable that cynics say it was written only to assure employment for the next generation's glut of law-school graduates, who would otherwise be doomed to the dole.''</p>
        <p>This made us wish we had never started the contest. For another thing, the entries pouring in were overwhelmingly flabby. Not a single one with wit, lilt, pungency. Not an ear-grabber in the lot.</p>
        <p>''As American as lite beer,'' was typical. ''As American as peanut butter and jelly.'' ''As American as acid rain.'' ''As American as diet soda.'' ''As a Toyota,'' ''as a budget deficit.'' And these were the good ones, the leading contenders for the frozen apple pie. What a pickle! Giving the prize to ''as American as lite beer'' would obviously enrage hundreds who had come up with the just as good ''as American as peanut butter and jelly,'' or ''as diet soda,'' or ''as a budget deficit.''</p>
        <p>Sorehead losers would probably squawk to the Government, the Government would issue injunctions, writs of mandamus, certiorari, duces tecum, habeas contestus. The American curse - a life sentence to deposing - seemed all too possible.</p>
        <p>At this pass, luckily, a solid unchallengeable winner appeared. He was the chief author of this column. ''I have a much better 'as American as' than any of our contestants,'' he said, and wrote it out for us.</p>
        <p>It was magnificent. He insists, however, that it not be made public lest plagiarists steal the fruit of his genius before he can copyright it. We can reveal only that it is an excellent ''as American as.''</p>
        <p>Upon receiving his frozen pie, he shared it with the rest of us. No more submissions, please. The contest is closed.</p>
