        <p>TO GET a sense of where President Clinton ended up after a year-long White House struggle to shape his global warming plan, consider who quit after it was announced.</p>
        <p>It was Timothy E. Wirth, the Undersecretary of State for global environmental affairs, one of the greenest of the President's advisers and nominally the top official directly in charge of negotiations toward a new climate treaty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth advocated an aggressive plan for significant cutbacks in the nation's emissions of greenhouse gases -- one that could have had significant costs for the economy. Bit by bit, that plan was scaled back as Mr. Clinton listened, and listened again, to the warnings of senior economic advisers like Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers and the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Janet L. Yellen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth's decision -- to leave his post after the Kyoto talks to head a foundation created by the billionaire Ted Turner to support the United Nations -- followed a long, meandering and occasionally intense debate inside the White House that reflected many of the conflicts that bedevil climate change policy.</p>
        <p>The conflicts went beyond the traditional clash of green eyeshades and green armbands, to encompass opposing views on technology's potential and on ways of making predictions about unpredictable systems. The debate also pitted the old Bill Clinton, whose instinct would have been to side with Mr. Wirth's call for sweeping government action, against a new Bill Clinton, chastened by his health-care failure and acutely aware of the domestic impact of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>And it was shadowed by two futures: for Mr. Clinton, by a desire to shape his legacy, and for Vice President Al Gore, by the need to balance his strong environmental views against the coalition-building that leads up to a presidential run.</p>
        <p>FIVE years ago, President George Bush joined other leaders of developed nations in pledging at the Rio environmental summit to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Two years ago, when it was already clear that the U.S. and some other countries would miss that voluntary target, Mr. Clinton agreed to join an effort to come up with a binding treaty for reductions at Kyoto.</p>
        <p>In the struggle that followed, President Clinton's economic advisers stopped him from promising deep, quick cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases, but they argue that they did not win this debate; they say they merely acted as a counterweight to Mr. Wirth, Katie McGinty, the White House environmental adviser, and environmental groups. The President, his economic team notes, did not agree to delay cutbacks in emissions for as long as the economists had initially suggested.</p>
        <p>''The spin is that we won,'' one senior economic adviser to Mr. Clinton said recently. ''The reality was a little more muddled.  We agreed there needed to be goals, even aggressive goals. But there also needed to be escape hatches, in case the economic effects turned out to be a lot more damaging than we thought.''</p>
        <p>MR. CLINTON pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. The turnabout in emissions will be encouraged at first with tax incentives and research subsidies for conservation and clean energy production.</p>
        <p>In later years, a cap will be placed on greenhouse emissions, coupled with a system to give credits for emissions reductions that companies can save and sell. It is a system in which the Government will set a mandatory goal but leave the mechanism to the market instead of turning to a Government fiat.</p>
        <p>If the Administration's approach delivers the promised reductions, emissions between 2008 and 2012 will be about a third lower than current trends would predict.</p>
        <p>But nobody knows how much that will cost. ''There is no credible, widely accepted economic analysis that currently exists in the United States, or in most other countries, that can answer very basic cost and benefit questions,'' said Eileen B. Claussen, a former senior aide to Mr. Wirth who had played an instrumental role in the talks but left the Administration a few months ago.</p>
        <p>It wasn't for lack of trying. The Administration struggled for two years to come up with a credible analysis of the economic effects of moving away from fossil fuels, but the uncertainties -- over things like what the United States economy will look like a decade from now, what technological advances in emissions controls will be made and how willing consumers and manufacturers will be to respond to economic incentives -- proved overwhelming. Ms. Yellen essentially declared the effort to come up with reliable numbers a failure last summer.</p>
        <p>That opened the door to something of a policy-making free-for-all that lasted well into the fall and has left many members of Congress wary, Ms. Claussen said.</p>
        <p>There was never any serious debate inside the Administration about the science of the issue; the White House has decided that the climate problem is real and serious. After all, the leading environmentalist of them all is Mr. Gore, and he long ago won over President Clinton on the need to do something about the threat of climate change.</p>
        <p>But as one of Mr. Clinton's top aides noted during the debate: ''Al has discovered it's a lot easier to write a book about the subject than to grapple with the economic costs. But he's getting the hang of it.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Gore was highly receptive to the economic arguments, especially when the chorus of warnings included American business groups, whose support he will need when running for President.</p>
        <p>The real debate within the Administration pitted the pure economists against the technologists, the people who deal with the gross domestic product against those who specialize in British thermal units.</p>
        <p>The economists were deeply worried that any policy intended to drive down the use of fossil fuels -- especially a policy like the one the Administration favors, to put a cap on emissions of carbon dioxide and to let a market in emission permits dictate the price of fossil fuels -- would, in effect, amount to a system of energy rationing and energy taxes. In their rear-view mirrors, these advisers saw the economic disruptions of the oil shocks of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>But the technologists argued that the new policy would stimulate the appearance and rapid adoption of exciting new technologies that would make it possible to conserve energy and to produce more of it without fossil fuels. In their rear-view mirrors, they saw the efficiency gains and higher productivity that resulted from putting the nation on an energy diet in the 1970's and the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Both groups have economic models that prove their arguments. But no model is particularly well suited to predict what will happen to energy prices under the Clinton Administration's plan. That is because the plan calls for using inherently unpredictable free markets, rather than rigid regulations, to control emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The Administration wants to put a fixed overall cap on the total emissions of greenhouse gases by industries. Then it would issue individual companies permits that would allow them to release a certain amount of the gases. Limiting the supply of something increasingly in demand generally has the effect of driving up its price. But the Administration hopes that the permits, which would be traded on a free market, will limit the price pressures on energy and encourage innovation instead.</p>
        <p>For instance, a company that found a cheap way to control carbon dioxide emissions could sell its extra permits to a company with high control costs. Both companies would benefit economically from the transaction, and the market in permits would stimulate the invention and adoption of the cheapest possible control technologies.</p>
        <p>The Administration hopes to extend the permit system worldwide, allowing poorer countries with low emissions to raise money by selling part of their right to emit greenhouse gases to developed countries that have plenty of cash but have bumped into their pollution limits.</p>
        <p>Selling this at Kyoto, where developing nations are demanding deeper, faster cuts, is shaping up as a daunting task. But Mr. Clinton has tried to build his second term on proposals to marry government goals and market mechanisms, and has always prided himself on his deal-making abilities.</p>
        <p>This time, it may be the deal of the next century.</p>
