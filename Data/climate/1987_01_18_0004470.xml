        <p>LEAD: ON May 16, Dr. Carolyn Falk will place a top over the billiard table in her basement recreation room in Middlebury, converting it into an appropriate setting for the annual meeting of the Falk Foundation of Excellence. The foundation, which Dr. Falk started ''to encourage dreamers,'' she said, has given monetary awards to artists, schoolchildren and even a skier, and this year's applicants promise to be no less exciting, she said.</p>
        <p>ON May 16, Dr. Carolyn Falk will place a top over the billiard table in her basement recreation room in Middlebury, converting it into an appropriate setting for the annual meeting of the Falk Foundation of Excellence. The foundation, which Dr. Falk started ''to encourage dreamers,'' she said, has given monetary awards to artists, schoolchildren and even a skier, and this year's applicants promise to be no less exciting, she said.</p>
        <p>''I think people are beginning to understand what this is all about, and we are attracting people who are creative - the people who pass a garbage dump and say, 'There must be a better use for this stuff,' and think about it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Falk, a 49-year-old educational consultant, admits to being a bit of a dreamer herself. She had wanted to encourage creative people to pursue original ideas, and the result was the foundation, which is headquarted on the second floor of her home.</p>
        <p>Throughout the year, applications arrive there from state residents hopeful of gaining an award of up to $1,000 for an original idea they wish to pursue. She gets about 60 applications a year, and has granted up to four awards in one year.</p>
        <p>Thus far, $3,000 has been awarded, with four winners sharing $1,000 the first year, one winner receiving the full $1,000 the next year and two winners receiving $500 each last year. This year, the foundation plans to award a total of $2,000, to be evenly divided between winners in the two age categories: people between the ages of 12 and 19, and over the age of 50.</p>
        <p>Dr. Falk will not talk about the applications she has received so far this year, except to say that ''the ideas are wonderful and creative and even bizarre. Things I never would have thought of myself.''</p>
        <p>She created the private, nonprofit foundation in 1982, following the death of her mother, Elizabeth Rubin Myerson, ''a very dynamic and attractive gal who was a woman ahead of her time,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''My mother always had ideas and was always encouraging people, so, when she died and I inherited some money from her, I thought providing encouragement to others would be the best thing to do with it,'' Dr. Falk said. ''After all, my husband makes a nice living, I work, so I wanted to do something more than just buy some new clothes.'' Her husband, Maurice, is a pediatrician.</p>
        <p>But administering the foundation herself would be too time-consuming, Dr. Falk decided. Also, she said, ''I wanted to create a think tank.'' So she formed a board of eight trustees, people from various walks of life who volunteer to review applications and select the winners.</p>
        <p>A main feature of the awards is that they are available only to people between the ages of 12 and 19, and those over 50.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to give money to people who don't usually get it,'' Dr. Falk said. ''I chose young people because kids don't usually have a way of getting an income. And I chose older people because, when you're over 50, people assume you are completely satisfied with your lot in life and soon you will be going into a retirement home.''</p>
        <p>''These people are our greatest resources,'' she said. ''At 50, you've paid your dues, and you're able to synthesize what you've learned. If an old man wants to go on an archeological dig, I say, 'terrific.' ''</p>
        <p>Foundation guidelines say the judges look for ''seriousness of purpose, evidence of planning, evaluation methods and creativity. Under the last category, the proposal's ''impact on society'' is considered.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Falk's definition of this last factor is a bit different than the one generally accepted.</p>
        <p>''We put a great burden on our gifted people,'' she said. ''When we fund gifted programs, we say that these people may someday find a cure for cancer. That's very exploitive. Everyone is gifted in one way or another. My philosophy is that if you become the best 'you' you can be, then we're all going to benefit.''</p>
        <p>While Dr. Falk is an advocate of education, no awards are given for tuition. It is ''the passion for living, learning and sharing'' that she wishes to promote.</p>
        <p>Such passion is exemplified in Dr. Falk's own life. An energetic woman and fast talker, she recently received a doctorate in special education from the University of Connecticut. She teaches gifted students at the Talcott Mountain Science Center in Avon, and her home is filled with her handmade pottery and puppets. She began ice-skating as an adult, and now teaches the sport. Her husband is a successful example of her theory of encouragement; once a nonskater, he now also teaches skating.</p>
        <p>Before launching the foundation, however, Dr. Falk called her son, Steven, a bio-medical engineer in Maryland who also composes music, and her daughter, Jodi, a dancer who lives in New York, to explain ''that they'd never see a penny of Grandma's money,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''My son said, 'I would like to produce another album and buy a new car, but I wish someone would have been around with a program like this when I was younger,' and my daughter said, 'I'd really like some money to go dance in France, but O.K.,' '' Dr. Falk recalled.</p>
        <p>A winner in each of the two categories can receive up to $1,000, but she does not like to focus on the money. She believes she is offering something even more valuable - ''information and encouragement.''</p>
        <p>Applicants do not have to have an idea worthy of a monetary award to be considered worthy of help, according to foundation rules. Finalists do not receive money but are introduced to foundation members eager to pass along information that may be of use. A committee also keeps track of winners, to offer help along the way.</p>
        <p>Dr. Falk takes no part in the selection of the winners; the choice is left to the trustees.</p>
        <p>''I wanted the trustees to be independent,'' she said. ''I don't need a rubber stamp.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Andrew R. Heminway of Middlebury successfully convinced his fellow trustees to give an award to Steve Desovich, then 19, who wanted to use the money to promote the sport of mogul skiing. He was the first and only person so far to win the entire $1,000.</p>
        <p>''He filled out the requirements better than anyone I've ever seen,'' said Mr. Heminway, who added that the trustees were impressed by Mr. Desovich's commitment to skiing, his passion for the sport and his goal to make mogul skiing a part of the Olympics Games.</p>
        <p>Margot Moser of Woodbury said she is looking forward to her first year as a trustee. Ms. Moser, an actress who teaches singing in New York is particularly excited about the opportunity to award grants to people in the over 50 age bracket.</p>
        <p>''Often, people over the age of, say, 35, are shut off from grants,'' she said. ''In the theater, I run into it all the time. I think encouraging two such diverse age groups is a marvelous idea.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Falk appears delighted with all the choices her trustees have made thus far. Judith Plummer of Woodbury, a retired schoolteacher won $100 in 1983 to create a group in which genealologists could meet. In 1983 Virginia Zellner, who teachers gifted children at the Sherman School in that town, won $300 on behalf of her students to create an activity book about the Statue of Liberty. The book took three years to complete, but arrived last spring.</p>
        <p>In New London, Janet Shafner, an art teacher, won a $500 award for the members of her advanced art class; she used the money to rent space for exhibiting their works and hiring artists to critique their work.</p>
        <p>Some winners discover that their projects do not go smoothly. Last year Thomas Brown, an 18-year-old from Bethlehem, won $500, which he used to purchase equipment to measure the effects of acid rain on the Chesapeake Bay. He traveled there last summer and quickly encountered an unexpected problem: lack of rain. He then shifted the scope of his project to include the effect of drought on the bay, he said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes projects become too mired in problems to get off the ground at all. Thomas McAuliffe won $500 in 1983 to establish an exchange between his Spanish-language students at Joel Barlow High School in Redding and youngsters living in a Hispanic section of the Bronx. The project never materialized because Mr. McAuliffe was unable to find an effective contact in New York, but he has not given up, and is contemplating a similar program with Bridgeport students instead, he said.</p>
        <p>Was Mr. McAuliffe's project a failure?</p>
        <p>''No! No! No!,'' said Dr. Falk. ''Thomas is just regrouping. Do you know how many wonderful ideas grow out of failure? Why, Fleming should have thrown out his petri dish. It was contaminated. But look what resulted,'' she said, referring to Sir Alexander Fleming and the accidental discovery of penicillin.</p>
        <p>As for any advice to this year's applicants, sorry, Dr. Falk said she has none. ''If I could tell you in advance what we want, it wouldn't be creative,'' she said. ''I really want it to be open-ended. If you have a passion, polish it, refine it, make it explainable, and I'm with you.''</p>
        <p>For more information, write to the Falk Foundation for Excellence, 121 Tyler Crossing, Middlebury, Conn. 06762. The deadline for completed applications is April 30.</p>
