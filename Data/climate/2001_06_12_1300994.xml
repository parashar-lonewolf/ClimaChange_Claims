        <p>Explaining the Bush administration's enthusiasm for nuclear power plants, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently said: ''If you set aside Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the safety record of nuclear is really very good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill has an ear for the Bushian dialectic, having recently spent a great deal of time beating the drum for the tax-cut package, which was a great idea if you set aside the fact that it wouldn't stimulate the economy and we couldn't afford it.</p>

        <p>Explaining the Bush administration's enthusiasm for nuclear power plants, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill recently said: ''If you set aside Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the safety record of nuclear is really very good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill has an ear for the Bushian dialectic, having recently spent a great deal of time beating the drum for the tax-cut package, which was a great idea if you set aside the fact that it wouldn't stimulate the economy and we couldn't afford it.</p>
        <p>His boss is off on his first trip to Europe, where this administration is very popular, if you forget about questions of defense, foreign policy, capital punishment and the environment. The president is going to have to sell our allies on his plan for a missile shield, which is an exciting new vision for arms control except for the fact that we don't know how to build it.</p>
        <p>We are hoping that Europe works out well for Mr. Bush even though he is said to be planning to use the same diplomatic strategy there that he employed in California, possibly the least successful good-will trip since Dad dined in Japan. The president left Washington on a conciliatory note, acknowledging that the greenhouse effect is not a figment of deranged environmentalists' imagination and promising more money for research. The administration must have given up hope of finding a scientific panel that felt global warming was no big deal if you set aside the fact that the planet is getting hotter. Still, who knows what might turn up? Extensive, painstaking studies should always precede action, missile shields of course excepted.</p>
        <p>At home, the Senate will be operating under its new Democratic leadership. To everyone's relief, Senator Strom Thurmond, the 98-year-old senior Republican, is no longer president pro tem and thus third in the line of succession to the presidency. The new president pro tem is Robert Byrd of West Virginia. This is a great improvement if you skip over the fact that Mr. Byrd is an 83-year-old former Ku Klux Klan member who recently used the n-word repeatedly during a bizarre television interview in which he claimed to be demonstrating how much progress the country has made in race relations.</p>
        <p>Congress, meanwhile, is turning its attention to the patients' bill of rights, which is to health care reform what a gnat is to aviation. The president and Congress are very close on this issue, except that Mr. Bush is threatening to veto it. Still, the president has to do what he thinks best. He's the guy with the mandate, if you set aside the irregularities in Florida and the fact that he lost the popular vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neill is onto something. This is a linguistic construct for our time:</p>
        <p>* If you set aside the divorce, the ''Love Nest'' headlines, the cancer and the term limits, New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani is in clover.</p>
        <p>* If you set aside April and May, Jenna's been having a great freshman year.</p>
        <p>* Maxwell Taylor Kennedy, a son of Robert Kennedy, dropped out of the Congressional race in Massachusetts yesterday. He had enormous political potential if you set aside an inability to read a prepared script, a tendency to giggle at inappropriate moments and an arrest record for an assault committed in the company of his cousin Michael Skakel, the current murder defendant.</p>
        <p>* Aside from the script and the actors, ''Pearl Harbor'' was one heck of a movie.</p>
        <p>* A friend who had been watching the all-execution-all-the-time coverage on cable TV yesterday reported that someone had put in a good word for Timothy McVeigh by saying it was sad that a person's entire life would be judged by the worst thing he did. If you set aside . . .</p>
        <p>Last month I wrote a column about Acting Gov. Jane Swift of Massachusetts, who was preparing to deliver twins and had to commute from the other side of the state because Massachusetts is the only state that does not provide its governor with subsidized housing. This was entirely accurate, except for the fact that  Rhode Island, Arizona and Vermont don't either.</p>
        <p>Personally, I can see Rhode Island's point, but everybody else should think this through again. Really, you could just rent them a condo.</p>
