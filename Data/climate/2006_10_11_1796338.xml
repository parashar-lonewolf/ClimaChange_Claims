        <p>A few years ago the Rev. Tri Robinson did an odd thing. Mr. Robinson, a politically conservative Idaho rancher and pastor of the Vineyard Boise Church, took his place at the pulpit, opened his mouth and told his evangelical Christian congregation that it was time to do something about the environment.</p>
        <p>''Our truth is that God created the world,'' Mr. Robinson tells Bill Moyers on ''Is God Green?'' ''He commissioned us to take care of it. And that's that.''</p>
        <p>This intriguing one-hour documentary, the second of three in this month's ''Moyers on America'' series, will be shown on most PBS stations tonight. And it will not make evangelical celebrities like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell happy. (Toward the end of the hour, Mr. Robertson is seen telling his audience that ''some of the evangelicals are being used by the radical left to further their agenda.'')</p>
        <p>Actually, Richard Cizik, a vice president of the National Association of Evangelists, saw the light (so to speak) at a 2002 conference of scientists and religious leaders in Oxford, England. Mr. Cizik (pronounced SIGH-zik), who lives in Virginia, was impressed by Sir John Houghton, a British scientist and fellow evangelical. He told Mr. Moyers that the laws of science ''are God's laws, because they're the way he runs the universe.''</p>
        <p>A lot of American evangelical Christians agree wholeheartedly and are making special efforts to become involved in environmental causes. They call what they're doing ''creation care.''</p>
        <p>When ''Is God Green?'' turns to West Virginia, the story becomes more familiar. Carmelita and Ernie Brown, who live downhill from a mountaintop coal mine, demonstrate the sad state of their drinking water. Neighbors talk about health problems that appear to be connected with dangerous chemicals in the water.</p>
        <p>The new element is that when Judy Bonds, a 10th-generation Appalachian resident, participates in protests against the coal industry, she shouts, ''The earth is God's body!''</p>
        <p>And organizations like Christians for the Mountains exist.</p>
        <p>Allen Johnson, a co-founder, says it's extremely simple from a religious point of view: harming the earth is a sin. What he and his organization want to do, he says, is invite churches ''to explore this as a theological and biblical issue.''</p>
        <p>''Is God Green?'' traces the growth of evangelical Christianity's political power, beginning with a 1980 speech by Ronald Reagan in which he referred to the Bible as the answer to all the world's problems. Then the documentary gives the antigreen side equal or near-equal time.</p>
        <p>Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, is seen at a podium, asking rhetorically, ''Could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people?'' He answers himself: ''I believe it is.''</p>
        <p>Calvin Beisner, of Knox Theological Seminary in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., puts forth a couple of curious ideas. One is that while environmental devastation does exist, it comes from God as punishment for humanity's evils. Just like Hurricane Katrina, he says. When Mr. Moyers suggests a moral obligation to take care of the planet, Mr. Beisner, who teaches historical theology and social ethics, replies, ''We also have a moral obligation to do rational cost-benefit analysis.''</p>
        <p>But his may no longer be the majority opinion among his fellow religious believers. Mr. Cizik points out past cases of political judgments clashing with biblical values, back to the battle over the abolition of slavery in the United States.</p>
        <p>''It happened in the civil rights movements of the 1960's, in which evangelical Christians sat on their hands,'' he says, adding that he has had to apologize for them. ''And today, Mr. Moyers, I am not willing to make that same mistake.''</p>
