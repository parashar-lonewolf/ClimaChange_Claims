        <p>LEAD: When Congress suspects that an Administration has ignored or covered up a problem, it dispatches a collection of faceless auditors to investigate. Typically, the General Accounting Office finds the problem worse than anyone suspected.</p>
        <p>When Congress suspects that an Administration has ignored or covered up a problem, it dispatches a collection of faceless auditors to investigate. Typically, the General Accounting Office finds the problem worse than anyone suspected.</p>
        <p>Whether the issue is the savings and loan debacle, the cost of cleaning up radioactive waste or the cause of an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, White House officials often concede the validity of G.A.O. findings.</p>
        <p>If Congress seems to have the upper hand in a political tug-of-war with the President, that is partly because it can call upon the accounting agency, a cadre of professional experts who, for the better part of the agency's 69-year existence, have consistently turned out top-quality research.</p>
        <p>As head of the General Accounting Office, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher makes authoritative pronouncements on a mind-boggling array of volatile questions. With Mr. Bowsher entering the 10th year of his 15-year term, the G.A.O. is at the zenith of its power, as demonstrated by recent events.</p>
        <p>Getting Their Attention</p>
        <p>Concern in Congress and the Bush Administration over the savings and loan bailout jumped noticeably in April when Mr. Bowsher said the cost, including interest, could total $500 billion over 30 years. The figure was roughly twice as much as previous official estimates.</p>
        <p>Tests performed for the G.A.O. forced the Navy to reconsider its conclusion that the explosion aboard the Iowa last year resulted from a suicidal act of sabotage by a desperate young sailor. The accounting agency said it was more likely that gunpowder bags, rammed into the breech of a gun at high speed, had ignited accidentally.</p>
        <p>And the G.A.O. was the first Government agency to sound an alarm over safety and environmental hazards at the nation's nuclear weapons plants, years before Congress or the Energy Department focused on the problem.</p>
        <p>With 5,100 employees and a current annual budget of $364 million, the agency is busier than ever. It issued 880 reports and 3,800 legal rulings last year, and in the last 12 months it began 1,500 audits and investigations at the request of Congress.</p>
        <p>Can Act on Its Own</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. can initiate studies on its own, but a steadily increasing proportion of its work, now 82 percent, is produced in response to Congressional requests. The agency often negotiates with lawmakers to insure that Congressional assignments mesh with its work plan, focusing on what the agency calls ''issues of national significance.''</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. is required to perform work requested by the heads of Congressional committees and, as a matter of policy, its guidelines say, ''We assign equal status to requests from ranking minority members.'' It also responds to many requests from junior members of Congress as resources permit.</p>
        <p>By most accounts, the agency, often described as an investigative arm of Congress, deserves its reputation for incorruptibility and intellectual honesty. Accounting and financial management have long been its strong suit. By its own estimate, the G.A.O. saved $79 billion for the Government over the last five years.</p>
        <p>But it is not just a financial auditor. Most of its work is program evaluation. Nearly every important piece of legislation passed by Congress directs the G.A.O. to study its effects. Three-fourths of the agency's recommendations are adopted. Biased Toward Congress?  If the accounting agency has one institutional weakness, its critics say, it is a subtle, pervasive bias in favor of Congress: a predisposition to favor Congressional action as the solution to problems.</p>
        <p>The agency rarely investigates Congress, even though many people say there is at least as much mismanagement and misconduct on Capitol Hill as in any Federal agency. Asked if he ever considered doing a comprehensive audit of Congress, Mr. Bowsher said, ''I'd love to do it, but in my 15th year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowsher, a former partner at Arthur Andersen &amp; Company who once served as Comptroller of the Navy, is paid $96,600 a year and can be removed only for neglect of duty, malfeasance or misconduct. Mr. Bowsher, 59 years old, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan from a list of eight candidates recommended by Congress.</p>
        <p>Harry S. Havens, one of 11 assistant comptrollers general, acknowledged that close ties between the G.A.O. and Congressional committees, which often use the agency's research for partisan political ends, ''could pose significant risks to credibility'' for the watchdog agency. Republicans in the Reagan and Bush Administrations complain that the G.A.O. is used by senior Democrats in Congress to ''micromanage'' the executive branch.</p>
        <p>A Critic Speaks Out</p>
        <p>Former officials in the executive branch give the G.A.O. high marks, with a few exceptions, like James C. Miller 3d, Mr. Reagan's second budget director, who said: ''The work is spotty, uneven. All too frequently, G.A.O. has been politicized by members of Congress to do a hit job.''</p>
        <p>John S. Herrington, who was Energy Secretary in the Reagan Administration, complains that the accounting office has become ''a kingdom, a law unto itself.'' At the same time, he said, ''I give G.A.O. high marks for its work on nuclear waste and weapons production.''</p>
        <p>The secret of G.A.O.'s success is its institutional culture, its methodological rigor and technical expertise. Dozens of engineers, economists, social scientists, psychologists, biochemists, geologists, actuaries, statisticians and computer scientists have joined the accountants and lawyers who form the backbone of its staff. Such expertise enables the G.A.O. to answer tough questions about chemical weapons, spacecraft computers, pesticide residues, global warming, cancer drugs and controlling infection in military hospitals.</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. also puts extraordinary emphasis on recruiting and training and has established special links with 60 college campuses, using senior agency officials as recruiters. It had 7,000 applications for 200 professional jobs this year. Young auditors who join the G.A.O. seem to believe deeply that government can and should work. Many have worked at consulting firms for higher salaries, but prefer the G.A.O. because, they say, its standards are higher and they do not have to chase after business.</p>
        <p>Access to Much Data</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. works under the discipline imposed by knowing that nearly all its work will become public. It benefits from having access to Federal tax returns and classified government documents. But it may not declassify documents, and it can use tax returns only for the purpose of auditing the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>''We have a legal right to virtually any information where the Federal dollar is involved,'' said Ira Goldstein, assistant comptroller general for operations.</p>
        <p>As a condition of receiving Federal grants and certain contracts, private companies, universities and state and local governments must let the G.A.O. audit their books for any misuse of Federal money. The Central Intelligence Agency is the only Federal agency not subject to review by the G.A.O.</p>
        <p>Clashes With Pentagon</p>
        <p>The accounting agency is meticulous. In an annotated copy of each report, auditors list the source of every factual statement. A G.A.O. employee verifies each reference, and the draft report is reviewed by G.A.O. officials.</p>
        <p>Despite such safeguards, G.A.O. reports often anger policy makers, and none more than at the Pentagon. About 25 percent of the agency's work focuses on the Defense Department.</p>
        <p>Eight years of work by the accounting office documenting technical flaws in the Bigeye chemical bomb recently forced the Defense Department to cancel its production. ''Testing of the weapon was really inadequate,'' said Eleanor Chelimsky, an assistant comptroller general.</p>
        <p>John E. Krings, director of weapons testing and evaluation at the Pentagon from 1985 to 1989, complained recently that some G.A.O. investigators had ''low levels of engineering competence and minimal knowledge'' of the military purpose for which weapons were designed. But Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, praised the G.A.O. for ''carefully and objectively evaluating'' poison-gas munitions.</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. was created in 1921, but it traces its roots to 1789, when Congress established a Comptroller in the Treasury Department to ''examine all accounts'' of the Federal Government. The Comptroller General has a mix of duties, some esoteric, some anachronistic. They include prescribing accounting standards for Federal agencies, settling financial claims by and against the Government and issuing authoritative opinions on the legality of Federal spending.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein, the assistant comptroller general, said, ''The duties are all tied together in a latticework that reinforces the stature of G.A.O., its image as a powerful organization.''</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. brings the same methodical rigor to its own business as to investigations of other agencies. In 1986, when AIDS was stirring panic and prejudice, Mr. Bowsher appointed a panel of 11 G.A.O. officials to devise a policy for the agency. Their report said that G.A.O. employees with the disease should be treated humanely and should not be dismissed or subjected to discrimination.</p>
