        <p>''U.S. Is Losing Its Dominance in the Sciences'' (front page, May 3) did not mention one looming exodus that may further cripple scientific endeavor in the United States: the loss of American-born, American-trained scientists to other countries.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''U.S. Is Losing Its Dominance in the Sciences'' (front page, May 3) did not mention one looming exodus that may further cripple scientific endeavor in the United States: the loss of American-born, American-trained scientists to other countries. Whereas those who desired a research career had at one time been compelled to remain here, now the options available are much broader as Europe and Asia surpass the United States in scientific productivity.</p>
        <p>In my experience, the Union of Concerned Scientists represented the feelings of a wide swath of American scientists when it accused the Bush administration of favoring a conservative political agenda over good science. Whether the issue is stem cell research, global warming or missile defense technologies, the administration has favored rhetoric over reality. More disturbingly, its rhetoric and acts reveal that the United States places little value in intellectual achievement.</p>
