        <p>On June 12, President Bush won applause from environmentalists when he pledged to rid the nation of dirty air by overhauling the Clean Air Act of 1970. Now Mr. Bush has unveiled the fine print. The applause has turned to skepticism, even anger. During six weeks of bureaucratic infighting, Mr. Bush has made compromises; the bargain he seems to have struck with the automobile industry is especially disappointing.</p>
        <p>Even so, his proposals represent an important departure from years of White House indifference. They will force industry to think creatively about new technologies. And they challenge Congress to end years of stalemate.</p>
        <p>The bill offers two dramatic improvements over existing law. The first would require utilities to cut in half their current discharges of sulfur dioxide, the chief cause of acid rain, by the year 2000. The acid rain provision is not without flaws, but it's still stronger than anything yet introduced in Congress. For eight years, the Reagan Administration engaged in endless studies and took no action -even as acid rain poisoned lakes and forests.</p>
        <p>The second departure would require the gradual phasing in of cars powered by ''clean fuels,'' like ethanol and natural gas. One million would be sold in each of the model years from 1997 to 2004. Some clean fuels may pose new environmental hazards, and they are not now economically competitive with gasoline. Yet little will be lost by forcing industry to develop new technologies.</p>
        <p>The bill's biggest weakness, environmentalists argue, lies in provisions aimed at attacking urban pollution caused when hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxides react with sunlight to produce ozone. Since the automobile is a major source of these gases, Mr. Bush asks Congress to tighten tailpipe standards by 40 percent on hydrocarbons and 30 percent on nitrogen dioxides.</p>
        <p>That's just what he promised in June. But critics say he has sabotaged that promise by allowing auto makers to meet the standards by averaging the pollution of all cars rather than having each individual car remain below the maximum level. The average pollution from today's new cars is already well below the present maximum and slightly below even Mr. Bush's new target. Thus the new target would be meaningless and perhaps even harmful.</p>
        <p>Congress will now be exposed to the same pressures Mr. Bush was; cleaning the nation's air will be an expensive, contentious business. But as poll after poll shows, Americans are prepared to pay for cleaner air. Mr. Bush is sailing slowly, but at least the wind is up.</p>
