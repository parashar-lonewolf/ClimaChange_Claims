        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>QUEENS: FIRE INJURES WOMAN -- A Queens woman was critically injured when a fire tore through her Brookville home yesterday afternoon, officials said. The authorities said the woman, Estelle Knox, 67, was being treated at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx. The fire was apparently caused by careless smoking, the police said. It broke out at 1:30 p.m. on the first floor of the woman's two-story wood-frame house on 145th Avenue, said Firefighter Daniel Lynch, a Fire Department spokesman. The fire was under control by 2:03 p.m., and no other injuries were reported, officials said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GENERIC DRUG SAVINGS -- New York City and Long Island residents could save an estimated $2.6 billion over the next decade, according to Senator Charles E. Schumer, if generic drugs could be sold as soon as patents on brand-name drugs expire. Mr. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, and Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, have written a bill that would remove some regulatory and market hurdles, including payments by brand-name drug makers to keep generic drugs off the market.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: 3 HURT IN FIRE -- Three residents of an Upper East Side apartment building were hospitalized for smoke inhalation after a fire yesterday, a Fire Department spokesman said. The fire began at 10:40 a.m. in a second-floor apartment in the brick building at 508 East 79th Street near York Avenue, and was under control by 11:08, Firefighter Dan Lynch said. The cause was under investigation. A spokeswoman for New York Presbyterian Hospital said she could provide no information on the condition of the three injured.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: ENERGY-EFFICIENCY FEE -- New York businesses and environmental groups are disagreeing over extending the state's fee on electricity bills to pay for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. Eighteen environmental and consumer groups are urging the state's Public Service Commission to approve the collection of $200 million a year through the fee, known as the system benefit charge. That is $62 million more than the $138 million that the commission's staff recommended be raised through an increased charge over the next five years. But the state Business Council is urging that the charge be reduced and then extended for only two years.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: WASTE HAULERS SETTLE -- Three waste haulers will repay $90,000 to customers who paid for recycling services only to have recyclable items dumped in with the rest of their trash. A fourth trash company will have to pay $10,000 to three town waste collection and education efforts. The state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, began an investigation after an article in The Times Union of Albany in June 1999 showed that recyclable items were ending up in landfills. The haulers are Casella Waste Systems of Rutland, Vt.; Vets Disposal of Oneonta; and Waste Stream of Ithaca. The fourth, County Waste and Recycling of Clifton Park, will have to pay its settlement to three towns in Saratoga County.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>WATERBURY: BONDS DOWNGRADED -- A Wall Street bond house has downgraded the city's bond rating again, potentially jeopardizing its efforts to borrow money to pay employees. The bond house, Fitch ICBA, downgraded the city's bond rating on Friday to what is commonly known as ''junk'' status, although that term was not used. It was the second time in two weeks that Fitch downgraded the city's bond rating. The city, facing deficits for last year and this year, has run out of cash to meet its December payroll.</p>

        <p>SOUTH WINDSOR: UNION ACCEPTS CONTRACT -- Members of the machinists' union who work at United Technologies International's fuel cells division voted yesterday to accept a new three-year contract. The 240 workers covered by the agreement will receive wage increases totaling 9 percent over the next three years, the union reported. The average wage at the fuel cells division had been $19.90 per hour.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>ELIZABETH: JAIL PLAN SHELVED -- Citing a decrease in the number of young detainees, Union County officials have scrapped plans to build a juvenile jail here. The county will sell the land intended for the jail, which would have cost $20 million, according to Daniel Sullivan, chairman of the Board of Freeholders. From 1996 through the end of July 2000, the number of juveniles held in Union County decreased 12.2 percent, according to Sharon Lauchaire, a spokeswoman for the state's Juvenile Justice Commission.</p>

        <p>EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP: DEER SEASON BEGINS -- New Jersey's main deer-hunting season opens today, with a record kill expected but no guarantee that it will alleviate deer-related problems that plague many communities. While the state offers more than 100 days a year for hunting deer, including bow, shotgun and muzzle-loading rifle seasons, the six-day firearm  season that runs until Saturday is the most popular. Last year, 75,398 deer were killed.</p>

        <p>ARMY CAPTAIN MURDER HEARING -- A pretrial hearing in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn is scheduled for John Lau, a United States Army captain charged with murdering a Brooklyn couple.</p>
        <p>GREENHOUSE GAS HEARING -- The City Council has scheduled an oversight hearing on a bill to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent over five years from city-owned power plants. Council Chambers, City Hall, Manhattan, 1 p.m. Information: (212) 788-0260.</p>
