        <p>Separate studies using different methods in the last three years have found that as the earth's atmosphere warms, spring warmth is arriving earlier and autumn coolness is coming later in the Northern Hemisphere. But much of the evidence has been indirect, and now a direct examination of the actual behavior of plants across Europe appears to confirm the earlier findings.</p>
        <p>The new evidence comes from a network of 77 research sites called the International Phenological Gardens. Spread across Europe from northern Scandinavia to Greece and from Spain and Ireland to Poland and Bulgaria, the gardens contain genetically identical clones of various species of trees and shrubs.</p>
        <p>Each spring from 1959 to 1993, observers at the sites recorded the dates when buds first appeared, leaves unfolded and plants flowered. Likewise, the observers noted the dates when leaves turned color and fell from trees. Analyzing the resulting mass of data, two researchers at the University of Munich in Germany have found that over the three decades, the advent of botanical spring advanced an average of six days, while autumn was delayed an average of about five days.</p>
        <p>This 11-day lengthening of the growing season was caused by warmer temperatures, concluded the researchers, Dr. Annette Menzel, a specialist in the study of forests, and Dr. Peter Fabian, who specializes in climate, meteorology and forests. Their report appears in the current issue of Nature.</p>
        <p>Since the late 19th century, the average surface temperature of the earth has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more, with northern latitudes warming more than the global average. The dominant view among experts is that emissions of heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide, a product of the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil, are responsible for at least some of this warming.</p>
        <p>The dominant view also holds that if emissions of the heat-trapping gases continue at the present rate, the average global temperature will rise by another 2 to 6 degrees, with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees, over the next century. This compares with a warming of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The predicted warming, the experts say, would disrupt the earth's climate, make both droughts and floods worse, cause the oceans to rise and push temperate-zone climatic zones farther north. It would also be expected to have some positive effects, not least the lengthening of growing seasons in northern latitudes.</p>
        <p>According to the Menzel-Fabian study, the longer growing seasons have already arrived. The area of the study spanned almost the entire width of the northern temperate zone, from the sub-Arctic to the Mediterranean region. The two scientists' analysis of the plants' spring awakening and autumn decline found that in some research stations, in the Balkans, spring was coming later. They attributed this to regional patterns of climate change that were exceptions to the larger European pattern.</p>
        <p>That pattern, they found, was clear: Over the last three decades, the onset of spring gradually moved earlier in the year, while the advent of autumn became later and later.  Further, they discovered, this pattern matched what would be expected to happen on the basis of computer models of the effect of rising temperatures on plant behavior in spring and fall.</p>
        <p>Plants' response to seasonal change is driven mainly by changes in the average daily temperature, said Dr. Menzel, and Europe's temperature has been rising over the last three decades. Modeling studies, she said, indicate that 70 percent of the lengthened growing season can be explained by rises in daily temperature. Changes in light, soil conditions and water supply also influence the awakening and dormancy of deciduous plants.</p>
        <p>The researchers attributed the rise in daily temperatures to a general warming of the climate rather than any locally induced warming produced by what is called the urban heat-island effect. Cities are warmer than the surrounding countryside, but only a few of the research sites in the International Phenological Gardens are in urban areas.</p>
        <p>Other recent studies have shown that buds are bursting open earlier in the spring in Canada, and studies in Britain have found that birds are laying their eggs earlier in the year.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Dr. Charles D. Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego reported that an earlier spring in the Northern Hemisphere was reflected in the seasonal rise and fall of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Plants ''breathe'' carbon dioxide. When they drop their leaves in the fall and go dormant, atmospheric levels of the gas increase. When they regain the leaves in the spring, levels drop.</p>
        <p>Analysis of these fluctuations revealed that spring was arriving across the hemisphere about a week earlier in the 1990's than in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>In 1997, this finding was bolstered by a study by Dr. Ranga B. Myneni of Boston University and four other researchers, including Dr. Keeling. Using a different method, they found that spring was arriving about a week earlier in the early 1990's than in the early 1980's. This study was confined to regions north of the 45th parallel, which runs through or near Yellowstone National Park, Minneapolis, Ottawa, Boston, Bordeaux, Belgrade and Vladivostok. North of that line, warming in recent decades has been substantially greater than the global average.</p>
        <p>The Myneni study also found that fall was arriving later, with the result that the growing season in the northern climes had increased by 12 days, give or take 4 days. The researchers reached this conclusion by analyzing changes in solar radiation absorbed by plants as they performed photosynthesis. From this, the scientists were able to infer the arrival of the seasons.</p>
        <p>Taken together, Dr. Myneni said, all the recent studies indicate that a warming and greening of the planet is indeed under way, and that the growing season should lengthen further if temperatures continue to rise.</p>
        <p>One result, a number of scientists say, is an increase in vegetation.. Dr. Menzel and Dr. Fabian, writing in Nature, said the lengthened growing season they found was ''likely to contribute to increased biomass formation.'' Biomass is the dry weight of living things, in this case plants.</p>
        <p>Studies in Europe and Asia have indicated that forests have indeed increased in biomass. And Dr. Myneni and his colleagues were able to determine that because of more vigorous plant growth associated both with warmer temperatures and higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the amount of vegetation in the northern regions had increased by 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Quite apart from the effect of warming, carbon dioxide spurs plant growth. What this carbon dioxide effect might mean for agriculture and forestry is not entirely clear. Some experts say that while more carbon dioxide makes plants bigger, it does so by reducing the relative amount of nutrients in a plant. This makes it less nutritious as food -- a person or animal would have to eat more to get the same benefit.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a greener north could increase agricultural and timber production and expand the Northern Hemisphere's wheat-growing regions.</p>
