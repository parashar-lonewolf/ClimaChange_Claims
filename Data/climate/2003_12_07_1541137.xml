        <p>Editorial reports that Bush White House still appears to be calling shots at EPA under Michael Leavitt, whose first action was to rescind Clinton-era proposal to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants; sees long-promised payoff to Pres Bush's big contributors in utility industry; notes that on happier note, Leavitt proposes major cuts in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides</p>

        <p>The White House called the shots when Christie Whitman was running the Environmental Protection Agency, and from the looks of things, the White House is still calling the shots. Michael Leavitt's first major action as E.P.A. administrator last week was to rescind a Clinton-era proposal to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The reversal came right out of the Karl Rove playbook, a long-promised payoff to President Bush's big contributors in the utility industry. Nobody blamed Mr. Leavitt personally.

        <p>The White House called the shots when Christie Whitman was running the Environmental Protection Agency, and from the looks of things, the White House is still calling the shots. Michael Leavitt's first major action as E.P.A. administrator last week was to rescind a Clinton-era proposal to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The reversal came right out of the Karl Rove playbook, a long-promised payoff to President Bush's big contributors in the utility industry. Nobody blamed Mr. Leavitt personally. Still, the ruckus surrounding the announcement got his tenure off to a wobbly start, while overshadowing two positive initiatives on smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>The country's coal-fired power plants are the biggest source of airborne mercury, a toxic pollutant that threatens human health after it enters the food chain, usually through fish. In December 2000, after meetings with stakeholders, Bill Clinton's E.P.A. announced that it would require companies to install state-of-the-art pollution controls and committed the agency to producing a detailed proposal by this month. The general expectation was that the controls would be in place by late 2007, reducing mercury emissions by as much as 90 percent.</p>
        <p>Then George Bush came to office and expectations changed. The coal-burning utilities went to work on the White House, the White House went to work on the E.P.A., and on Thursday came the result -- a far weaker plan that seeks a meager 30 percent reduction in mercury emissions in the near term and only a 70 percent reduction by 2018. The net effect is that an estimated 300 tons of mercury that would have been captured by the Clinton strategy will now be allowed to poison the air.</p>
        <p>The administration advances many arguments for its move -- that the necessary technology will not be widely available by 2007, for example; that industry will not be able to afford it even if it is. Since independent studies suggest otherwise on both counts, one is left to conclude that the only argument that really mattered was that this plan would be a lot easier on the utilities.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on a happier note, Mr. Leavitt has announced proposals for major reductions in sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to both smog and acid rain. New controls on these pollutants have been in the making since 1997, when the Clinton administration settled on strict new health-based air quality standards for smog and soot.</p>
        <p>The proposals could use further tightening. They are welcome nonetheless, especially in the eastern half of the country, which suffers from windblown pollution from other regions. The Adirondack Council, for one, believes that the new reductions will eliminate the acid rain that for years has been devastating lakes and forests throughout the Northeastern United States. The air should also be cleaner and more breathable in Eastern cities. The pity is that the public had to absorb so much bad news with the good.</p>
