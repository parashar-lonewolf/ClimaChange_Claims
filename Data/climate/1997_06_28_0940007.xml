        <p>A week after government leaders from around the world trooped in by the dozens to assess the global environment five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the international conference they addressed ground to a quiet close today in an atmosphere tinged with gloom.</p>
        <p>While nonstop speeches went on in the hall of the General Assembly, committees of nations bickered for days but were unable to agree on concrete proposals in three critical areas: cutting emissions to head off global warming, protecting forests and increasing aid to poor nations who are ruining their environments through uncontrolled development.</p>
        <p>In all of these areas, many nations had been looking to the United States for leadership, another demonstration of the enormous power Washington has in the United Nations, even though Washington has been the target of criticism for failing to pay its dues.</p>
        <p>When President Clinton, in his speech on Thursday, backed away from setting numerical targets for American emissions reductions as Europeans had asked, the initial response was critical, since diplomats realized that there would probably be no decision from Washington until very close to a conference in Koyto, Japan, in December, the deadline for an international agreement.</p>
        <p>This will give little time to negotiate acceptable levels of emissions reductions with developing countries, some of which are already reluctant to agree to any controls if someone else does not pay for the cost of environmental improvements. In coming decades, large developing countries like India and China will be major emitters of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane.</p>
        <p>''With less than six months to go to Kyoto, we still haven't heard any near-term specifics from the Clinton Administration,'' Howard Ris, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said after Mr. Clinton's speech. ''We need to tackle global warming now, not tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>But today, diplomats and a number of environmental groups found silver linings in the President's speech, welcoming his statements that recognized the danger of global warming and the role that human activity -- most of all in the United States -- plays in creating and worsening the problem.</p>
        <p>Many also welcomed the President's pledge to inform the American people why the issue of greenhouse gases was important. American public opinion played a significant part in building up the international awareness of environmental issues a decade ago, and partly drove the momentum that made the Earth Summit in Rio a success in 1992.</p>
        <p>It became apparent today that it was not only the United States and other industrial nations that stalled agreements on major issues. At a news conference marking the end of the meeting the United Nations calls ''Earth Summit + 5,'' Razali Ismail, president of the General Assembly and Malaysia's United Nations representative, said that both rich and poor nations had shown a lack of political will to force more than convoluted compromises.</p>
        <p>The conference produced a closing document that took small steps in areas of freshwater conservation, forest use and the financing of environmentally sustainable development, including the need to look at harmful government subsidies. But a separate statement of commitment to action on the environment was scrapped because countries could not agree on the wording.</p>
        <p>Mr. Razali, who was a major player in the Rio conference in 1992, said that not only were indicators of environmental destruction worse this year, but also the spirit of Rio was gone.</p>
        <p>''We reached the zenith of our enthusiasm and commitment for sustainable development and the environment in 1992,'' he said. ''Since then many other things have come our way which have distracted our attention from that. Since then a sense of parochialism has spread over much of the developed world, a parochialism that affected the willingness of those countries to make available funds or resources, all kinds of things, technology transfer.''</p>
        <p>''This special session should go down as a very honest attempt to try to make an appraisal of the results, and of how far we have gone from Rio,'' he said. ''There was very little attempt to try to sweep things under the carpet or put a gloss over something that's not there.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at a separate news conference today, Barbara J. Bramble, director of the international office of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington, said that this had been a week of ''standstill'' in areas environmental groups had expected action.</p>
        <p>''All is not lost,'' she said. ''There's an awful lot of language that shows slow bits of progress. But that is a total disconnect in time scale between what is being done and what is really needed.''</p>
