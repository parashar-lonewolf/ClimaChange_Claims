        <p>Those who look for political import in prom-queen movies may be interested to note that Buffy (Kristy Swanson), the cheerleading, bubble-headed heroine of the blithe teen-age comedy "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," kicks and backflips her way to martial-arts mastery before the story is over. As for other things worth noticing, you may be too old to appreciate one of this film's main selling points if you're distracted by its efforts to enhance Luke Perry's hair.</p>
        <p>Luckily, there are better reasons for watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," a slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected. Ms. Swanson's funny, deadpan delivery holds the story together reasonably well, as does the state-of-the-art Val-speak that constitutes most of Buffy's dialogue. (The screenplay, uneven but bright, is by Joss Whedon.) "Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador -- like I'm ever going to Spain</p>
        <p>anyway</p>
        <p>," sniffs Buffy at the mall. "I can't believe I'm in a graveyard hunting for vampires with a strange man," she whines later,</p>
        <p>"on a school night."</p>

        <p>Luckily, there are better reasons for watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," a slight, good-humored film that's a lot more painless than might have been expected. Ms. Swanson's funny, deadpan delivery holds the story together reasonably well, as does the state-of-the-art Val-speak that constitutes most of Buffy's dialogue. (The screenplay, uneven but bright, is by Joss Whedon.) "Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador -- like I'm ever going to Spain</p>
        <p>anyway</p>
        <p>," sniffs Buffy at the mall. "I can't believe I'm in a graveyard hunting for vampires with a strange man," she whines later,</p>
        <p>"on a school night."</p>
        <p>Buffy, we learn, had a special gift for killing vampires when she lived an earlier life in Europe, during the Dark Ages. (A title gives the film's main setting as "Southern California: the Lite Ages.") Nowadays, her ambitions are more modest. "All I want to do is graduate high school, go to Europe, marry Christian Slater and die," she says at one point. About career goals, she says: "I'm going to be a buyer. . . . I don't know, it's just a job I heard of, sounded pretty cool."</p>
        <p>The very thin plot describes what happens after Donald Sutherland, as a kind of cosmic coach, makes Buffy understand her mission and trains her to do battle with a latter-day vampire squad. These spooks are led by Rutger Hauer, who indeed looks ghoulish, and Paul (Pee-wee Herman) Reubens, who seems to be greatly enjoying the malevolent possibilities of his role. "Kill him a lot," he hisses, about a potential victim. "I'm fine," says Buffy, after he greets her nastily, "but you're obviously having a bad hair day."</p>
        <p>The film, directed breezily by Fran Rubel Kuzui, slows down to make room for some mugging from Mr. Perry, who plays potential vampire bait and is better at being studiously cute than really acting. It also loses speed during Buffy's transformation into a pompon-waving woman warrior. Her conversion may be commendable, but it's a shame to see her drop the princessy mannerisms that make her early scenes so amusing, especially as they are seconded by a giddy Greek chorus of Valley Girlfriends (Michele Abrams, Hilary Swank and the funny, voluptuous Paris Vaughan). "The earth's in terrible shape, we could all die!" one of them wails when discussing whether an ecological theme might be right for the senior dance. "Besides, Sting's doing it." When Buffy chimes in about the ozone layer during this discussion, it is only to announce "Yeah, we've got to get rid of that."</p>
        <p>Just as the higher-energy "Wayne's World" did, "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" aims for a teen-age audience but occasionally offers a broad wink at what it sees. This film also includes a few minor characters worth mentioning, like the psychobabbling coach (Mark DeCarlo) who tells his basketball players to think: "I</p>
        <p>am</p>
        <p>a person. I have a right to the ball." Candy Clark appears too briefly as the jewelry-jangling mother who cries out "Kiss noise!" as she bids Buffy goodbye.</p>
        <p>"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes very mild violence and profanity.
