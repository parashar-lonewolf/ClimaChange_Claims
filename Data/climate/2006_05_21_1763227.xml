        <p>Paramount Classics is pulling out the political stops to pump its documentary about global warming, ''AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH,'' which arrives just at the moment when the broader culture seems ready to pay attention. The film had its premiere at Sundance but, oddly, did not make a big splash there. It features former Vice President AL GORE as he travels from place to place ringing alarm bells (which is not the same as being alarmist) about global warming; it also intersperses science with Mr. Gore's personal journey into activism. The studio has tapped into political grass-roots groups to promote the film, but you needn't be an activist to find this either interesting or relevant. Opens Wednesday at Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, (212) 330-8182, and AMC Loews Lincoln Square, 1998 Broadway, (212) 505-6397; and at the Arclight Hollywood in Los Angeles, (323) 464-4226, and the Monica in Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741.</p>
        <p>If you're into dark Gothic tales with more than a hint of forbidden sex, see ''THE KING,'' which opened on Friday in Manhattan and expands to five more cities on June 9. The gifted GAEL GARCÍA BERNAL plays a young dreamer just out of the Navy who travels to Corpus Christi, Tex., to find his father, played by WILLIAM HURT. But the father, now a pastor, would rather forget this reminder of a sinning past. As the young man continues to insinuate himself into the family's life, and that of his half-sister, the stage is set for violence and, ultimately, tragedy. MILO ADDICA, whose credits include ''Monster's Ball'' and ''Birth,'' wrote the screenplay with JAMES MARSH, who directed. Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, (212) 330-8182.</p>
