      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges Supreme Court's new conservative majority to show that it is truly conservative by observing precedent rather than following personal ideology; urges court to strike down federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortion, to uphold race-conscious admissions policies at K-12 public schools in Seattle and Louisville, Ky, and to side with states suing federal government for failing to regulate new cars' emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants</p>

        <p>The Roberts court officially began last year, but the term that starts this week should give the first clear picture of what kind of court it will be. The docket includes major cases involving abortion, affirmative action and the environment.</p>
        <p>The justices in the Supreme Court's now solidly conservative majority will be given a chance to prove what sort of conservatives they intend to be: those who issue rulings to match their personal ideology, or those who want to keep the court on a steady path by respecting precedent.</p>

        <p>The Roberts court officially began last year, but the term that starts this week should give the first clear picture of what kind of court it will be. The docket includes major cases involving abortion, affirmative action and the environment.</p>
        <p>The justices in the Supreme Court's now solidly conservative majority will be given a chance to prove what sort of conservatives they intend to be: those who issue rulings to match their personal ideology, or those who want to keep the court on a steady path by respecting precedent.</p>
        <p>The cases that have so far attracted the most attention are a pair of challenges to a federal law that criminalizes so-called partial birth abortions. The law, passed by Congress in 2003, does not have an exception for procedures necessary to protect the health of a pregnant woman. The court struck down a nearly identical ban in 2000 by the State of Nebraska. That ruling was 5 to 4, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- the court's perennial swing vote before she retired -- sided with the majority.</p>
        <p>The ''partial birth'' cases should reveal a lot about the views of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. If they are as hostile to abortion rights as many court watchers believe, there may now be five votes in favor of the ban, which could outlaw many second-trimester abortions and endanger the lives of women.</p>
        <p>But if they are true to the statements they made at their confirmation hearings about respecting precedent, they should not want to reverse a decision the court made on this subject as recently as 2000.</p>
        <p>The court has also agreed to hear a pair of challenges to admissions policies at K-12 public schools in Seattle and Louisville, Ky., that take race into account to promote diversity. These cases revisit many issues the court considered in 2003, when it upheld the University of Michigan's use of race in law school admissions. That was another 5-to-4 decision with Justice O'Connor casting the deciding vote. That ruling was right to say that schools should be able to take race into account, and the court should not change its stance now -- opening the door to even more challenges to affirmative action.</p>
        <p>Among the other important cases the court will hear is one about global warming. A group of states and environmental organizations have sued the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to do its duty under the Clean Air Act to regulate new cars' emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. The court can and should prod the Bush administration to do more to protect the earth from the buildup of greenhouse gases, by requiring it to enforce the law that Congress passed.</p>
        <p>If Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito turn out to be conservatives with a deep respect for precedent, the court is likely to remain fairly centrist. But the biggest factor is likely to be Justice Anthony Kennedy, who began last term to fill Justice O'Connor's role as a voice of moderation. We hope he continues to do so.</p>
