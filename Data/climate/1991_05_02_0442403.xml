        <p>Chaotic, costly and even cruel, the nation's health care system may pose the supreme political test of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Never before have so many groups -- including many doctors, large corporations, public officials, economists and worried citizens -- called urgently for sweeping change in American health care.</p>
        <p>Everyone agrees on the goals: insuring access for all and cutting down runaway costs while preserving high-quality care.</p>
        <p>But there is still no consensus on how to restructure the system, a fiendishly tangled thicket of traditions, expectations and special interests that has long defied rational control. Many of the proposed solutions would require new tax dollars and all would mean wrenching change for someone.</p>
        <p>And remedies will almost certainly mean new constraints, limits on choice in an area where Americans are accustomed to demanding the best, regardless of price.</p>
        <p>"We are inconsistent," said Gail Wilensky, who as head of the Health Care Financing Administration presides over the increasingly costly Federal medical programs for the elderly and the poor. "We want everybody to have everything, and we don't want to wait for it. But we certainly don't want to increase taxes." Push for Overhaul</p>
        <p>Congress is taking up health care with a fervor not seen since the 1960's, when creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs brought a temporary reprieve. For its part, the Bush Administration says it also is developing proposals for change.</p>
        <p>Partial measures to extend health insurance to more people could be adopted in the next year or two, lawmakers predict. Broader measures that guarantee care for everyone, or reorganize the way care is paid for or delivered, seem more distant, though that could change as runaway costs shake up more parts of society.</p>
        <p>The United States spends far more on health per person than any other country. And technically the care is often superb, the envy of the world. Yet the United States is the only advanced industrial nation that fails to insure care for everyone, the only nation that leaves families vulnerable to medically induced financial disaster.</p>
        <p>In Europe, Canada and Japan, governments not only play bigger roles in financing health care; they also play more powerful roles in setting medical prices and limiting overall spending.</p>
        <p>The payment system, a chaotic mix of private and public insurers, encourages overuse and overpricing. Doctors and hospitals are forced to spend ever more energy trying to reap funds from the bewildering array of payers, each with different rules. The mounting paperwork and second-guessing are deflating morale in the medical profession, leading more doctors to retire early and fewer young people to apply to medical school.</p>
        <p>"We have a badly organized, improperly motivated delivery system, and an inefficient, wasteful payment system," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine who is a leading critic of American health care.</p>
        <p>In the current structure, rising payments do not reflect a social choice for better health; costs are eluding anyone's control. There is no leveling in sight.</p>
        <p>"We spend 12 percent of our income on health, and 6 percent on education," said Daniel Callahan, a medical ethicist who is director of the Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. "Thirty years ago we spent the same amount on each."</p>
        <p>"We really have to ask how much is enough."  When the Solutions Create New Problems</p>
        <p>As its failings become more apparent, the system is responding, but with partial steps that often create new problems as they solve old ones.</p>
        <p>Free-market mythology aside, government already plays a central role. More than 40 percent of all health spending is paid by Federal, state and local governments through the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled, the Medicaid program that covers some of the poor and the military medical system.</p>
        <p>Medicare has made pioneering efforts to contain costs by paying uniform fees for hospital care. But, like a balloon that is squeezed in one spot only to bulge in another, these efforts are undermined by shifting of costs. If beleaguered hospitals receive lower public payments, they charge private payers more; if doctor's fees per service are capped, then the number of services jumps.</p>
        <p>While government has led the battle to restrict fees, private insurance companies are trying to slow inflation by encouraging "managed care," including aggressive scrutiny of treatment decisions and more use of health maintenance organizations. The scrutiny saves money, but it also means more bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Already, administrative costs soak up one-fifth of the country's health spending, twice the share as in Canada, said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler of the Harvard Medical School, a co-author of a study on administrative costs published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Woolhandler is also a leader of some 3,500 physicians who are calling for national health insurance, along Canadian lines. Their position goes well beyond that of the powerful American Medical Association, which supports measures to extend private insurance to all workers and Medicaid for the poor, but opposes national insurance or spending ceilings. In a sign of shifting attitudes, though, other mainstream groups representing tens of thousands of doctors have declared their willingness to consider radical overhaul, even including national health insurance.  A Blizzard of Choices For Congress to Sort Out</p>
        <p>For decades there has been talk of closing the gaps in the insurance system. Now, even as concern about access is surging, so is fright about soaring cost, creating new obstacles to change. Many in the debate, including major labor unions that had long stressed the access side of the equation, now oppose major new programs to extend care without cost control. And that is a far more complex and divisive matter.</p>
        <p>Congress, according to major legislators, is still sorting out the myriad of possible responses. This year, it will consider proposals to reduce the uninsured by requiring most companies to offer health benefits or else pay into a public insurance pool.</p>
        <p>To work, this approach should be accompanied by new regulations to make insurance more accessible to small businesses, said George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader. It must also be accompaned by effective cost controls, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, has made health care a personal crusade. He says measures that "build on the current system" should be tried before the country considers national insurance or the setting of national spending limits.</p>
        <p>These deeper changes face the fierce opposition of private insurance companies, manufacturers of drugs and medical equipment and some medical groups, among others that could lose income or influence.</p>
        <p>"If you nationalize health insurance, you'll have Americans covered very poorly in 10 years," said Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, the industry's trade group. "Government hasn't kept its promises to either the poor or the aged."</p>
        <p>Huge political obstacles confront even the more modest proposals, said Senator Mitchell, who drew a comparison with legislation against acid rain, which he first offered in 1981 but that did not pass for nine years.</p>
        <p>Requiring companies to offer health insurance, for example, is opposed by small-business owners, while proposals for new public programs run up against budgetary fears.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most likely legislation to pass in the next year or two will be aimed at insurance rules, trying to reduce the skyrocketing rates for small businesses and individuals. "I think that this year it's feasible to do something by way of small-business insurance reform," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the crucial Senate Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>As for broader change, he said, "I've got senators coming at it from all different directions."</p>
        <p>Democrats accuse the President of a lack of leadership. President Bush has passed the issue to Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sullivan has described the system's problems in detail in recent speeches and exhorted the public to lead healthier lives. He has not yet announced any proposals for change, though he has made his instincts clear. "We need to build on our achievements by getting an even higher percentage of people covered by insurance," he recently said, "rather than replacing our system with something that Americans do not need and would not tolerate."  The Day of Reckoning With a New Life of Limits</p>
        <p>However financing and care are reorganized, Americans are destined to confront unfamiliar limits.</p>
        <p>"Medicine is not going to conquer death," said Dr. Callahan, the ethicist. "But it's going to find every more expensive way to stave off mortality."</p>
        <p>Agreeing on how and when to limit spending may pose the hardest political test of all.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, better ways are needed to judge the merits of costly procedures and actively discourage their overuse.</p>
        <p>"All of us are interested in seeing that useful new technology gets out there," said Dr. Wilensky, the Federal official. "But all the pressures in the system are to do more, expect more, want more."</p>
        <p>Where procedures are clearly useless, the decision is easy. More often, real medical gains must be weighed against huge increases in cost. Is a thousand-dollar scan with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging device warranted to rule out a small risk of brain disease? Should insurers pay for an antibiotic that is 10 percent more likely to be effective but costs 10 times as much as the alternative?</p>
        <p>The Federal Government, as it decides what Medicare will cover, is gingerly entering the slippery arena of cost-effectiveness. It hopes, through studies of medical experience, to promote more cost-conscious guidelines for appropriate treatment. These studies might clarify, for example, which patterns of headache justify using the costly M.R.I. scanner, and which patients with heart disease truly benefit from now-overused bypass surgery.</p>
        <p>But it is one thing to issue guidelines, and another to deny payment against a doctor's professional judgment. And in any case, will more prudent practice be enough to contain overall spending? Some experts say society will have to cross the murky zone between urging sensible, cost-effective treatment and overt rationing, refusing to pay for some kinds of care to hold down costs.</p>
        <p>Questions are raised especially about huge payments for patients with poor odds of survival -- $100,000 bone-marrow transplants in certain cancer patients who are unlikely to be saved, for example, or $5,000-a-day intensive care for aged, extremely ill patients who are unlikely to regain consciousness.</p>
        <p>Many experts insist that at current spending levels, the country should have ample funds to provide all medically useful treatments -- if only the system could be overhauled to get rid of its pervasive waste.</p>
        <p>"Maybe 20 or 30 years out, with a more aged population and even better technologies, maybe then we won't be able to do everything we know how to do," said Karen Davis, a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University. "I don't think we're near that point now."</p>
        <p>"Things that work, we should do," Dr. Davis said. "Kidney transplants work, heart transplants work. They are expensive, but we can afford that in a $650 billion budget."</p>
        <p>But Dr. Callahan, who believes the country must begin debating health priorities, said: "Efficiency will only stave off the day of reckoning. An aging society and increasingly expensive technology are going to force limits on us sooner or later."</p>
        <p>A more politically feasible way to limit care may be the less direct path now followed by Canada and other countries: limit investment in costly machines, medical specialists and intensive-care services.</p>
        <p>"Once you're there in the intensive care unit, it's extremely hard to withhold things," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. "If you wish to ration, I feel the only way to do it is not to put the resources there in the first place."</p>
        <p>But first, the country must do something about another kind of rationing, already here and more shameful, that through expense and indignities prevents the poor from getting decent medical treatment.</p>
        <p>"Our public hospital system is withholding care in a brutal fashion," Dr. Reinhardt said.</p>
