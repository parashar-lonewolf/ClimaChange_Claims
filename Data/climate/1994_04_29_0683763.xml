        <p>The reduction of fresh air in airline cabins since the mid-1980's poses no harm to passengers and crew members, according to a study commissioned by the airline industry that was made public today.</p>
        <p>"Both older aircraft, with an all-fresh air system, and newer aircraft that have a combination of fresh and recirculated air, meet or exceed standards that are designed to insure a healthy environment," said Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which financed the study and represents major airlines.</p>
        <p>Consolidated Safety Services, a Virginia consulting firm that conducted the study for the industry, tested the air in jetliner cabins during 35 flights without notifying the airlines or the crews. It found that the air quality met Federal health and safety standards for workers in offices and factories.</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for flight attendants criticized the study on the ground that air quality standards for offices and factories are not appropriate for judging the crowded confines of a loaded airplane. Workplace Standards Used</p>
        <p>Aaron Sussell, an industrial hygienist with the National Institute of Occupational Safety, said the study had improperly used his agency's standards and those of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Those standards were meant to protect people in the workplace, he noted, but airplanes serve the general public, which requires more stringent rules because passengers include infants, the elderly and disabled people.</p>
        <p>A case in point were carbon dioxide levels as high as 1,395 parts per million. These were well below OSHA's maximum of 5,000 but above the limit of 1,000 parts per million set for the general public by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditional Engineers.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, airlines in the United States reduced the amount of fresh air circulated in the cabins, from 100 percent fresh air pumped in every three minutes, to half fresh air and half recirculated air every six or seven minutes. The airline industry says the reduction of fresh air saves an average of $60,000 per jetliner each year because less fuel is needed to cool the air that comes in through the plane's engines.</p>
        <p>Since the change was introduced, some flight attendants and passengers have complained of headaches, nausea and other health problems, especially after long flights. Many attribute the problems to the reduced ventilation. House Hearings Planned</p>
        <p>The Air Transport Association's study has disputed this claim. "Results of the study did not reveal a potential for human health hazards," said Dr. Jolanda Janczewski, president of Consolidated Safety Services Inc. of Okaton, Va., which has conducted studies for Federal agencies.</p>
        <p>The study was made public in anticipation of Congressional hearings on the issue that are scheduled for next month by the Aviation Subcommittee of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. "We thought it was important to get this study out in advance of the hearing," Mr. Landry said.</p>
        <p>The study measured contaminants aboard 35 flights involving two older planes that provided 100 percent fresh air and two newer aircraft that provide 50 percent fresh air and 50 percent recirculated air. The older aircraft were a Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.; the newer aircraft were a Boeing 757 and a McDonnell Douglas MD-80.</p>
        <p>The newer aircraft generally had a higher level of contaminants than the older aircraft, but these were still within the range allowed by the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Public Health Service's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the study said.</p>
        <p>"Total and average levels for volatile organic compounds, respirable particulates and bacterial and fungal contaminants were relatively low for all types of aircraft, seating configuration, flight duration and airlines," the study said.</p>
        <p>A 1986 study recommended that fully loaded airline cabins have "maximal airflow" of 100 percent fresh air. The study was conducted for Congress by the National Research Council, which includes the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.</p>
        <p>The study noted that the fresh air varied from less than 7 cubic feet per minute for economy-class passengers to 50 cubic feet per minute for first-class passengers to up to 150 cubic feet per minute for the cockpit, where the air is needed to cool electronic equipment.</p>
        <p>Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Manhattan and Brooklyn, has introduced a bill that would provide a minimum of 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute for all passengers.</p>
