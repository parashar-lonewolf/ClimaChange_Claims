        <p>In the roaring hot interior of the Philip Sporn electric plant here, giant pulverizers work around the clock to reduce coal to the consistency of talcum powder. Howling fans then blow it into giant boilers.</p>
        <p>Every second that the plant operates, it grinds and burns 200 pounds of coal. Every second, it produces enough energy to run a medium-sized city.</p>
        <p>To its owner, the American Electric Power Corporation, Sporn is an engineering marvel, the first coal plant in the world to produce a kilowatt-hour of power with less than 10,000 B.T.U.'s, which is well under a pound of the coal it uses. This level of efficiency is far better than the industry average.</p>
        <p>To the Environmental Protection Agency, the problem is that Sporn set that standard 50 years ago. The plant, environmental regulators say, is a relic of the era when the symbol of prosperity was a smokestack spewing a fat black plume; now, they say, it is time to clean up or shut down.</p>
        <p>But Sporn and plants like it are, for now at least, doing neither. Entering what might have been their twilight years, they are producing more electricity than ever by running for more hours every year, as utility deregulation promotes shipment of their cheap electricity over increasingly long distances, from the banks of the Ohio River here to the big load centers of the East Coast.</p>
        <p>And if their owners have their way, plants like this may be nearly eternal. Rather than being replaced by new generating stations with younger technology, Sporn may be an example of the past replacing the future.</p>
        <p>''The lifetime is 35, 40 or 45 years on many components, but not all components,'' said Mark A. Gray, manager of American Electric Power's environmental services division, during a recent tour of the plant. ''Some may have an expected design life of 10 years or 15 years,'' he said, but some major parts, with proper painting and cleaning, will endure ''for centuries.''</p>
        <p>And the end of a component's life does not mean the end of a plant's, he said; it just means time for replacement, and then a plant can run like new for years.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. emphatically disagrees. ''If you want to treat it as a newish unit, you should have newish controls,'' Sylvia Lowrance, the agency's principal deputy assistant administrator, said in an interview in Washington.</p>
        <p>Sporn is one of the coal-fired plants cited by the E.P.A. in a suit filed last month against seven utilities that are charged with violating the Clean Air Act, in what the agency says is one of the largest investigations in its history. When the act was passed in 1970, it set strict emissions limits for new plants and looser ones for those already running, as long as no modifications were made. At Sporn and 23 other plants, the agency alleges, utility companies have quietly rebuilt, bit by bit, and the plants have lost their grandfathered status.</p>
        <p>In Washington, many people say they never foresaw the idea of a 50-year-old power plant being viewed as in its prime. Sporn these days is an interesting hybrid, with high-technology computers replacing the old control panels in its control rooms.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Clean Air Act has meant big changes for Sporn. The two-foot-high letters that spell the plant's name are mostly obscured now by precipitators erected around it to reduce fly ash, and its stacks now produce only modest white wisps. Its sulfur output is way down, too, because it has switched to cleaner coal. But it still emits far more sulfur, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog, than a new plant would.</p>
        <p>Until the 1960's, utilities retired old plants, the way people today replace personal computers, because new ones were cheaper and better. But by the 70's, the pace of progress in generating stations had slowed, and the new plants were not necessarily better than the old ones.</p>
        <p>The environmental regulations themselves had an effect -- what David G. Hawkins, a high-ranking official at the E.P.A. during the Carter administration, referred to as ''the Heisenberg effect.''</p>
        <p>Werner Heisenberg was a physicist who postulated that observing an experiment would change its outcome. The Clean Air Act, said Mr. Hawkins, who is now with the Natural Resources Defense Council, also changed the outcome: it created an incentive to avoid the new rules by never replacing old plants with new ones. The act, he said, ''had built into it the potential for abuse.''</p>
        <p>Leon G. Billings, who was Edmund S. Muskie's chief aide on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee from 1966 through 1978 and thus an important player in the debate over the Clean Air Act and its 1977 amendments, said such legislation created a problem for utilities. As a result of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires public hearings and environmental impact statements, as well as various other legal challenges, building a new power plant has become an ordeal, he said.</p>
        <p>''If you're a utility manager,'' Mr. Billings said, ''you say, 'A new one wouldn't be a whole lot more efficient, and they're not letting me build nuclear; maybe what I should do is just gussy up what I've got.' ''</p>
        <p>And now there is uncertainty over the deregulation of the utility industry, and over whether new generating technologies will emerge that make central-station power plants obsolete. As a result, hardly any new coal plants have been built in the last 10 years. Plants like Sporn are thought of by their owners not as old, but as almost eternal.</p>
        <p>And as demand for power has grown, companies like American Electric Power, operating in an increasingly competitive market, have found they can maximize their investment by running fewer plants for more hours, rather than building new ones. ''They're operating at 80, 90 percent of capacity, instead of 60 percent,'' said Mr. Billings, who is now a consultant on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Billings pointed out in an interview that the word ''grandfather'' is not in the 1970 act. What the law did, he said, was to allow the government to set new controls on old plants strict enough to solve local pollution problems, and to demand that new plants use the best available technology at the time they were built.</p>
        <p>The problem, Mr. Billings says -- and many people agree -- is that the E.P.A. dropped the ball, and did not pay close attention to changes at the plants.</p>
        <p>The agency did sue, but not until 1989, when it asserted that the Wisconsin Electric Power Company had modified a plant in a way that made it subject to the rules for new plants. A court agreed with most of the agency's arguments, and now officials are arguing that the utilities have been on notice since then.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials declined to give details about their accusations against Sporn, because, they said, the company was contending that some of what it had divulged to regulators was confidential business information. But there is no dispute about what was done -- only about how to characterize it.</p>
        <p>For example, surrounding the combustion zone in Sporn's boilers are pipes, lined up a little like bars on a cell, and inside is water. At the top and bottom, big metal parts called headers connect all the pipes, so the water can flow into one larger pipe. At various times in 1990 and 1991, American Electric Power replaced headers in four of Sporn's boilers.</p>
        <p>After the water has been boiled into steam and run through turbines, to convert steam energy into the mechanical power of a turning shaft, the steam must be turned back to water. To do that involves running the steam through yet more pipes in a device called a condenser; outside those pipes is water from the Ohio River. But the pipes corrode over time, and the utility replaced all the pipes in three condensers in 1990 and 1991.</p>
        <p>To engineers here, the issue is simple. Sporn operates with steam under pressure of 4,500 pounds per square inch and temperatures at 1,100 degrees, far higher than a nuclear plant, and produces nearly a million pounds of steam per hour. Consequently, the engineers do not hesitate to replace heavy metal parts that show signs of corrosion, or of erosion from steam or water flowing past at 45 miles an hour, for months on end. Not to do so, they say, would be suicidal.</p>
        <p>But according to Ms. Lowrance of the E.P.A., replacing major components year after year eventually becomes the equivalent of building a new plant. Congress set up the rule on modifications, she said, ''so that life extension projects don't go on forever.'' If they could go on forever, she said, Congress would never have agreed to let old plants operate on laxer standards than those applied to new ones.</p>
        <p>Some people agree with her. Gaylord Nelson, a senator from Wisconsin from 1963 to 1981 and the organizer of the first Earth Day in 1970, said of the grandfather provisions, ''That compromise had to be made if you were going to get enough votes to pass the act.'' But an eventual phase-out was assumed, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gray, on the other hand, pointed out that the law does not set any time limit on the plants; if Congress had wanted one, he said, it would surely have written one in.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials say they hope to settle the case, but negotiations have dragged on for months. If it goes to court, they say, they will argue that the work constitutes ''modifications'' partly because it was financed as capital investments, not maintenance.</p>
        <p>Plant officials say that has no bearing on the nature of the physical work, and they add that Sporn's construction cost was paid off in the early 1980's. Every penny of value that Sporn and other old plants in its system carry on the utility's books, they say, is postconstruction expenditure.</p>
        <p>Among environmentalists and utility experts, there is no certainty about which side will prevail. The uncertainty also extends to the plant workers.</p>
        <p>In the control room here, Brent Watts, a 31-year-old engineer who has worked at Sporn for seven years, reflected for a moment on the idea that the plant was older than he was. ''I hope it gets us till we get old enough to leave,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He looked uncertain, though.</p>
