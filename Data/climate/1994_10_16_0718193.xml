        <p>Reading TERMINAL CAFE (Spectra/Bantam, paper, $12.95), by Ian McDonald, was hard work.

Unfortunately, the excesses of diction and design that sometimes got in the way of the storytelling in "The Broken Land" have grown to appalling dimensions in "Terminal Cafe."</p>
        <p>In a decadent near-future America, the development of "nanotechnology" -- bioengineering on a molecular level -- has made possible the resurrection of the dead. Those who are resurrected retain their memories and quirks of character, although they lose interest in their former attachments. They also lose their civil rights; in the eyes of the law, they are no longer people. This is a promising conceit, capable of sustaining a number of different narrative strategies, from straightforward horror to social satire to philosophical meditation to psychological exploration. Unable or unwilling to choose his ground, Mr. McDonald ends up with an all but incomprehensible mix of tall tales and pseudohistorical lectures that fails to hold our attention, much less engage our intellect or emotions.</p>

        <p>Reading TERMINAL CAFE (Spectra/Bantam, paper, $12.95), by Ian McDonald, was hard work. I persisted only because of my admiration for Mr. McDonald's last novel, "The Broken Land," which created a haunting science-fictional analogue for the self-destructive frenzy that has gripped Mr. McDonald's homeland of Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, the excesses of diction and design that sometimes got in the way of the storytelling in "The Broken Land" have grown to appalling dimensions in "Terminal Cafe."</p>
        <p>In a decadent near-future America, the development of "nanotechnology" -- bioengineering on a molecular level -- has made possible the resurrection of the dead. Those who are resurrected retain their memories and quirks of character, although they lose interest in their former attachments. They also lose their civil rights; in the eyes of the law, they are no longer people. This is a promising conceit, capable of sustaining a number of different narrative strategies, from straightforward horror to social satire to philosophical meditation to psychological exploration. Unable or unwilling to choose his ground, Mr. McDonald ends up with an all but incomprehensible mix of tall tales and pseudohistorical lectures that fails to hold our attention, much less engage our intellect or emotions.</p>
        <p>There are five main characters and many secondary figures, all of them larger than life and none of them even slightly sympathetic. As if the relationship between "meat" and "dead" in his nightmarish Los Angeles weren't complicated enough, Mr. McDonald piles on layer after layer of invention and speculation about designer drugs, cyberpunkish "virtuality," space wars, corporate wars and generational wars. A reader attempting to make sense of this too-muchness must also contend with the author's penchant for stirring new characters into the mix 10 or 20 pages before he explains who they are and what they are up to. At times, even Mr. McDonald seems to lose his place; the resolution of a key plot element, having to do with the creator of this ghastly world, turns on a violation of the book's basic conceit.</p>
        <p>All writing is a compact with the reader. The greater the effort required, the greater should be the rewards. "Terminal Cafe" asks too much of the reader and gives too little in return.</p>
        <p>HEAVY WEATHER (Spectra/Bantam, $21.95), by Bruce Sterling, gets the match between reach and grasp just right. The year is 2031. The buildup in the atmosphere of "greenhouse" gases like carbon dioxide has distorted weather patterns, causing droughts in some places, floods in others and an ominous increase in tornado activity. A group of "tornado freaks" who call themselves the Storm Troupe track the ever larger and more frequent twisters across the west Texas plains.</p>
        <p>The leader of the Storm Troupe, a brilliant maverick mathematician named Jerry Mulcahey, concludes that conditions are ripe for the greatest of all weather disturbances, a twister that will reach the never-before-attained magnitude of F-6 on the scale used to measure tornadoes. Dr. Mul cahey and his followers have one goal: to be there when the F-6 touches down.</p>
        <p>As characters, the members of Storm Troupe are no more deeply drawn than they need be. Mr. Sterling makes obsession seem not only believable but attractive, and that is sufficient for his purposes. He creates an air of verisimilitude with a seamless blending of current and futuristic weather science. Through an ingenious subplot involving Dr. Mulcahey's equally brilliant but quite differently obsessed brother, he succeeds in dramatizing the cumulative effects of global pollution. And while he does not shirk describing the fury of a tornado, he knows that the most terrifying moment is the calm before the storm: "There was a low-level yellowish haze everywhere, a dust haze like the film on an animal's teeth."</p>
        <p>PEACE ON EARTH (Harcourt Brace, $19.95) is a belated parable of the cold war, written in 1987 by the distinguished Polish author Stanislaw Lem and only now being published in English (translated by Elinor Ford with Michael Kandel). Despite the grim subject matter, "Peace on Earth" shows Mr. Lem in one of his playful moods, as the intrepid first-person narrator Ijon Tichy -- whose notable memoirs of "The Futurological Congress" first appeared in English in 1974 -- travels to the moon to find out how the arms race is going up there.</p>
        <p>It seems that the nations of the world have agreed, in the name of mutual security, to export their hostilities to our planet's airless satellite, where, thanks to automation, the war machines can continue their endlessly evolving game of thrust and counterthrust without anyone getting hurt.</p>
        <p>When fears arise that the machines on the moon may be developing aggressive tendencies of an interplanetary nature, Tichy is dispatched to learn the truth. He returns somewhat the worse for wear, having had the hemispheres of his brain disconnected in a "remote callotomy" so that his right hand no longer knows what his left hand is doing. How everything works out for the best (if that is what it can be called) entails several twists of fate and plot that I have sworn to keep secret. But given the current debate about who did and who did not foresee the impending demise of the Soviet Union, I cannot resist quoting the prescient Ijon Tichy on the subject: "Even a fool could see that one didn't need a war, nuclear or otherwise, to destroy oneself; the rising cost of weaponry could do that quite nicely."</p>
        <p>HAPPY POLICEMAN (Harcourt Brace, $21.95), by Patricia Anthony, is a crisp police procedural set in the town of Coomey, Tex., which just happens to be cut off from contact with the rest of Earth by the Torku, a group of aliens who seem determined to kill their detainees with kindness. The book begins with the murder of Loretta Harper, who sold mail-order cosmetics back when the mail still came. The investigation by Police Chief DeWitt Dawson must contend not only with the multiple suspects, petty jealousies and rampant adulteries that typically bedevil small-town law enforcement, but with the incomprehensible behavior of the Torku, who are given to comments like: "I create my universe in brightness, and you create yours in dark. You drag us down with you. But if this is what you want, it becomes so."</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the solution to the murder and the solution to the mystery of the Torku are intertwined, but in ways I could never have predicted. You may not grok everything -- the denouement touches on the relationship between truth and justice, and how secrets can undermine the fabric of the universe as well as the fabric of society -- but you won't be bored.</p>
