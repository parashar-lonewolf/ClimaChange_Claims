        <p>Imagine a giant vacuum cleaner for the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The British billionaire Richard Branson and Al Gore, the former vice president, aimed for just that on Friday when they announced a $25 million prize to meet possibly the biggest challenge faced by humankind: to reduce the planet's warming gases that have collected in the atmosphere since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
        <p>''We are now facing a planetary emergency,'' said Mr. Gore, the author of the book ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' which formed the basis for an Oscar-nominated documentary film about global warming.</p>
        <p>At a news conference here, Mr. Branson urged governments to match the prize money he offered. He spoke of past efforts to encourage leaps forward in technologies, like a competition sponsored by the British government that led to more accurate measurement of longitude, saving thousands of lives at sea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who with Mr. Branson, will be one of six judges, said the prize was intended for a project that would be different from technologies currently under development that capture and store large amounts of carbon dioxide from heavy emitters like coal-fired electric plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also said the winning project must be more than a stop-gap against global warming gases. ''This is a very new and different way of thinking,'' he said. Even so, experts in climate change said the prize money might be better spent on projects with more of a chance of success, like building cleaner engines for cars and ensuring that new technologies reach the marketplace.</p>
        <p>''This project may hold particular appeal in the aviation industry as there really are no other viable, cleaner fuels in the pipeline,'' said Steve Rayner, a professor of science and civilization at Oxford University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rayner said plans for a extraction device to clean carbon from the air had been developed by Klaus Lackner, a professor at Columbia University. But Mr. Lackner's project never left the drawing board, Mr. Rayner said. Steve Howard of the Climate Group, a nonprofit organization that Mr. Branson said would help the judges with the deliberations, acknowledged that there were few technologies on the horizon. But he said he hoped the prize would encourage innovators to go to work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore acknowledged that the prize was ''highly speculative'' and that it could be seen as a gimmick. But he said organizers should ensure that the prize was not ''seen as a substitute or distraction from the main event which is to reduce the amount of CO2  which is being emitted.''</p>
        <p>Air transport represented about 3.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 but that figure could grow to about 15 percent by 2050, according to United Nations figures, as cited by the Aviation Environment Federation in London.</p>
        <p>The Virgin Group, owned by Mr. Branson, operates airlines.</p>
