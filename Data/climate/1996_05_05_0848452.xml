        <p>FIRST a quick surprise quiz. On the honor system, using your finger to point: Which way is north?</p>
        <p>My hunch is that test results can be broken down into thirds. The first group consists of those who have no idea where north is, let alone south, east or west, and what's more, could hardly care less. The second group has a rough idea, but only by remembering where the sun comes up, then doing the geometry needed to get the other directions in place. The third group (the group that judging by my own experience is smallest) knows where north is immediately, their fingers pointing straight as a compass needle, and not just on home grounds, but wherever their travels happen to take them.</p>

        <p>FIRST a quick surprise quiz. On the honor system, using your finger to point: Which way is north?</p>
        <p>My hunch is that test results can be broken down into thirds. The first group consists of those who have no idea where north is, let alone south, east or west, and what's more, could hardly care less. The second group has a rough idea, but only by remembering where the sun comes up, then doing the geometry needed to get the other directions in place. The third group (the group that judging by my own experience is smallest) knows where north is immediately, their fingers pointing straight as a compass needle, and not just on home grounds, but wherever their travels happen to take them.</p>
        <p>It's not surprising that in a disoriented, rootless society, many people are themselves literally directionless, have no sense of those great compass points  that once ordered so much of life. Our modern landscape doesn't help in this respect, having long ago lost its anchorage on fixed geographic points. Knowing  where east and west are is relatively easy in a borough like Manhattan, where, even for the directionally challenged, there are all those abbreviated reminders on the majority of streets.</p>
        <p>Venture out into the suburbs and it's a different story, the compass points having been obliterated by malls, interchanges, cul-de-sacs and those other dizzying components of the maze we live in. Add to this the general decline of geographical knowledge, the urbanization-mechanization of a world that doesn't really need to know where the sun first hits the fields or the predominate direction of the wind, and perhaps what's surprising is that there is anyone left who remembers where north is.</p>
        <p>It's the third group I'm interested in, since I belong to it myself -- the ones who have a compass card engraved on their senses (and in one of those convenient but maddening compromises fate has worked out for us, many of the perpetually oriented are married to those who don't have a clue). Here in northern New England it's still relatively easy to stay in touch with the compass, especially if you live, as I do, a short distance from a major landmark.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut River, among other virtues, serves as the watery equivalent of a compass needle, running in a reliably straight north-south line for over 400 miles, the central axis for four New England states. Up here toward its headwaters, it's a comforting, ever-present geographic fact, albeit one that for old-timers is so intrinsic it's hardly worth mentioning. Upriver is north, downriver is south, across the river is west, back this way is east . . . and for most intents and purposes this is all the orientation needed as you go about your day.</p>
        <p>Some of us like to pinpoint things a little more precisely. Farmers, of course, have always paid close attention to the compass, and have to, in a land where spring may come one month sooner to a south-facing slope than it will to a north. Something of a seasonal connoisseur, I like to keep track of not just the main coordinates, but the oblique ones that come in between. The northwest is where the cooling, restorative winds blow from to clear out spring's dampness; northeast, where Cygnus and the other summer constellations rise over our mountains like coming attractions scrolled over a dark orange screen. Even more precisely, east southeast is where our sun disappears to in winter; east northeast, the direction of so many storms.</p>
        <p>Live up here long enough, pay attention to things, and you come to realize the compass points are engraved very deeply in this land -- in the geologic underpinnings, the history, the very currents of life. Take that north-south axis the Connecticut runs on, the groove that is most fundamental to our landscape, most obvious. At least four times in the last three million years massive ice sheets have descended from the north, not only scouring out the trenches so many of the larger rivers run in, but also setting up their southward declination; the same north-south trend can be discerned in the shaping of many of our hills, with their uniformly sloping north sides (the glacier smoothing up the hard bedrock), and their jumbled south (the glacier plucking down).</p>
        <p>History takes up the story next, deepening the groove that geology carved for it, so it becomes engrained in the culture as well. The tide of settlement was originally south-north here, with the first settlers moving up from the flatlands -- a migration mirrored in the duplicate place names that still line the river (Hartford, Conn., becomes Hartford, Vt., etc.); many of their descendants, in turn, moved back south to the cities when the hardscrabble farms began to give out after the Civil War, setting up a back and forth current that  -- with exurbanites, summer people and tourists -- continues.</p>
        <p>And comes spring there's the northward migration of birds. Even our ponds act as a compass this time of year, with ice-out occurring in successive meltings toward the north. The trend of the main highways, the easiest bike routes on your legs, the side of stone walls moss grows on, the easterly progression of the weather. Pick your experience, your groove, and it seems to extend between compass points, so even without the sunrise to prompt you, the river to back you up, a person alive to life's currents can always find something vital for alignment.</p>
        <p>There's an east-west grain in northern New England as well, but it's a quirkier, grittier kind of trending; the east-west valleys tend to be higher, narrower, more abrupt than the north-south ones, slowing down travel times, edging their inhabitants farther out from the mainstream. East can be a mysterious and intimidating direction for us, the path of maximum resistance; it's the direction of the coast, the larger and foreign world, but with the barrier of hills between us, our allegiance is more to the familiar towns upriver and down. West, of course, has always exerted its own allure, from the beauty of the sunsets to the promise of unspoiled lands (I think of Thoreau here, and how, even in pastoral Concord, his favorite walking direction was west, toward wildness, the sense of expanse).</p>
        <p>But again, the point is that each compass coordinate seems to carry with it a difference, a clear and definite choice. North, home and solace; south, city and crowds; east, ocean and travel; west, West.</p>
        <p>AND perhaps it's my countryman's bias at work, but I think it deepens a person, knowing where the compass points are, responding to them, having their sense. Here, as the millennium turns, so many of the adjectives used to explain  our predicament suggest dislocation, drifting, misdirection, and what better way to cure these than by aligning ourselves in this most basic, fundamental way? It's easy, at least in the country, at least if you try. There's Polaris for starters, the sunrise, the flow of the Connecticut (or the Hudson or the Mississippi), the springtime flight of wild geese -- telling us where to look, where to find ourselves, which direction we spin.</p>
        <p>Which way is north? Makeup test is tomorrow, and this time I expect everyone  to know!</p>
