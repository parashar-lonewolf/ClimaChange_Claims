        <p>If natural gas ever had a chance to move closer to center stage in supplying the nation's energy needs, the time is now. The war in the Persian Gulf exposed anew America's vulnerability to imported oil. Five years after Chernobyl, nuclear power is still shunned. And global warming has further darkened the cloud over coal.</p>
        <p>Cleaner and cheaper than oil, natural gas has become the favored fuel among manufacturers and power generators -- but only ideologically. Despite reserves in the United States and Canada that could last 50 years or more, gas has taken a back seat to oil, supplying only 23 percent of its fuel needs in 1989. A tangle of regulations has choked demand, produced shortages and kept prices low and most gas producers too small to vie for lucrative long-term industrial contracts. And unless it can overcome its reputation as an unreliable long-term fuel source, the gas industry will blow the nation's best chance for clearer skies, lower fuel bills and fewer geopolitical scares in the future.</p>
        <p>"In many ways, the natural gas industry has been its own worst enemy," said Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the Enron Corporation and perhaps the country's most outspoken proponent of shifting the economy toward gas.</p>
        <p>But his company, the nation's largest company devoted almost exclusively to the gas business, thinks it has found a way to make the most of the industry's hodge-podge of gas patches. To woo big users -- the electric power generators that are the best shot for gas to replace oil -- Enron is building what it calls a "gas bank." Instead of deposits, Enron pools supply commitments from producers for varying lengths -- two years, six years, eight years, say. Enron then stitches these commitments together, pitching some of its own supplies into the pool, to create long-term contracts of 15 years or more for industrial users.  'A Portfolio of Supplies'</p>
        <p>"We're conducting an activity like asset-liability management at a bank," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, a former consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company who joined Enron last year to help set up the gas bank. "We have a portfolio of supplies and a portfolio of markets. To the buyer, it's all coming from Enron in the sense that Enron has a corporate guarantee behind the contract."</p>
        <p>For Enron, with $13.2 billion in revenues in 1990 and $9.8 billion in assets, the plan is part of a wide-sweeping vision to sells and deliver gas to industrial America and to build and operate the power generators that keep their plants humming. Eventually, it even hopes to sell compressed natural gas to a host of service stations for use in cars, buses and trucks.</p>
        <p>If it pulls off these ambitious plans, as many on Wall Street and in the industry are betting, Enron could point the way to the long-forecasted bright future for natural gas and give the country the gift of reduced dependency on foreign crude that has eluded Washington for more than a decade. Enron predicts the gas industry could cut this reliance by at least three million barrels a day of oil by the end of the decade -- a bit more than the country now imports daily from the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>"Natural gas probably has the greatest potential to displace foreign oil of any alternatives over the next 20 years," said the 49-year-old Mr. Lay. "But we can't realize that growth unless we package our product to meet what the market needs."</p>
        <p>Since it formed its gas marketing group two years ago to package these long-term contracts, Enron has signed up about 35 producers and more than 50 customers, including six buyers and two suppliers in the last week, Mr. Skilling said. Premium Prices</p>
        <p>Because gas is much more economical than oil, industrial customers and power generators are willing to pay a premium for a guaranteed extended supply. Some Wall Street analysts say Enron has sold some gas in fixed-price, 10-year contracts at an average price of as high as $3.50 per 1,000 cubic feet. In today's depressed market, gas is selling for $1.30.</p>
        <p>As an intermediary, Enron could insure a tidy profit as long as it maintains a comfortable spread between what it pays and what it sells gas for. With limited reserves and resources, many producers are squeezed, living hand to mouth by selling supplies on the open market, where buyers have the upper hand. Eager for the cash advances offered by Enron, some are willing to lock in prices slightly higher than those on the open market for a few year to keep their businesses alive.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the gas services unit contributed to Enron's 49.3 percent increase in the first-quarter earnings, excluding transactions not related to operations, to $101.5 million.</p>
        <p>Some on Wall Street are so enthusiastic about these and other prospects of the company that they have sharply increased 1990 earnings forecasts. Ronald J. Barone, a managing director at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company, thinks Enron will earn $3.70 a share this year and $4.35 in 1992, rather than the $2.90 for both years that he had projected last month. Curt Launer, of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Securities, raised his 1992 estimate to $5.15 a share.</p>
        <p>And while market values of most natural gas companies are slumping, Enron's shares have been trading not far below their all-time high of $62.75, set last November. They closed Friday at $58.25.</p>
        <p>Still, some producers wonder whether Enron can sign up enough producers to keep its customers in gas. The healthiest producers are unlikely to sign up with Enron because they would rather hold out for higher gas prices than get locked into a long-term commitment at a fixed rate. And if prices do spurt, even some weaker producers may not be so eager to give up potential sales for the security of a predictable cash flow.  Harvesting the Needy</p>
        <p>That leaves Enron the hard-luck cases. "Enron is replacing commercial banks, which no longer loan on reserves," said Jeff Sandefer, president of Sandefer Offshore, a small oil and gas producer in Houston with 25 employees. "Some companies are in such trouble they can't borrow enough from Enron to get them out of trouble. Others are more bullish on prices and don't want to give up the up side to do a deal with Enron. That's where we are."</p>
        <p>Enron, however, says there are plenty of needy producers for it to draw on. Few of the nation's 2,000-plus producers escaped unscathed when a mild winter and new discoveries of gas fields in Alabama, Oklahoma, New Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico forced prices down 20 percent from a year ago.</p>
        <p>What is more, producers are still reeling from the lower prices that followed the Government's decontrol of gas prices in the mid-1980's and a supply glut that has persisted since 1981. The surplus developed when gas prices jumped in tandem with crude oil. When many gas users responded by switching back to coal or fuel oil, a drilling binge sparked by high prices collapsed and pipelines and producers were stuck with massive supplies and few customers. To save the industry from collapse, the Government eventually canceled long-term contracts amounting to more than $8 billion owed by pipelines to producers.</p>
        <p>The long-term gas contract became nearly extinct and producers resorted to plying the spot market, where 80 percent of all gas is now sold, under contracts that typically are for 30 days or less, with some as long as five or six months.</p>
        <p>But without ironclad guarantees for 15 years or more of supply, lenders have refused to finance the construction of gas-fired power plants for utilities. And even if prices were to rise enough to stimulate drilling, producers might resist making long-term pledges. Unlike the 25-year life cycles of gas fields in Canada and those of 200 years in Indonesia, American gas fields often give out within 10 years, or as few as two in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
        <p>Even so, taken together, reserves of natural gas in North America are far more abundant than crude oil by most accounts. The Energy Department estimates that proven supplies of recoverable gas in the United States would last less than eight years at current consumption rates, or just as long as the nation's known quantities of recoverable oil. And many industry executives and analysts say that new discoveries and technological improvements have increased the supply to 50 years or more.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, oil continues to provide 40 percent of the country's energy needs. The United States consumed about 6 billion barrels of crude last year, 42 percent of it imported, according to the Energy Department. That compares with about 19 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with all but 1.5 trillion cubic feet, from Canada, produced domestically. A Connected Champion</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lay, for one, hopes to alter those proportions. And his political influence could help his cause. A former economics professor and head of energy affairs at the Interior Department, the Republican casts a long shadow in Washington and in local politics and counts the President among his acquaintances. He helped orchestrate last year's economic summit in Houston for President Bush. His connections clearly helped get ideas championed by the natural gas industry included in the National Energy Strategy crafted earlier this year by the Administration.</p>
        <p>Although industrial customers are generally wary of the gas industry, having been burned badly in the helter-skelter of deregulation, Enron has moved to blunt some of their worries. Enron removes producers from the picture by guaranteeing long-term supplies and reduces the risks associated with drawing on only one supplier by allying with many. And it is able to fill any last-minute gaps that may surface in a contract with its own gas and, in fact, says about 20 percent of the gas pledged in long-term contracts will come from its own reserves.</p>
        <p>While buyers are responsible for setting up their own deliveries, Enron -- as the country's largest pipeline network, it ships 18 percent of daily gas supplies -- can be of service. Half of the gas sold by the gas bank so far will be shipped over its pipeline. And its role as a pipeline gives it access to critical information about pricing gas.  The Biggest Deal</p>
        <p>The gas bank's biggest deal so far is with Florida Power and Light, which ordered 343 million cubic feet of gas a year for 15 years, enough electricity a day for 1.7 million homes. The New York Power Authority has agreed to buy 34 million cubic feet of gas a day for 23 years, starting in January. The deal enabled the power authority, New York State's largest electricity producer, to win a bidding competition to build a new power plant in Suffolk County that, when completed in 1994, will produce 150,000 kilowatts a day for the Long Island Lighting Company. That utility currently generates 70 percent of the electricity it produces from oil-fired plants.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the power authority, said the Enron contract "will be a key factor in our efforts to reduce New York's dependence on foreign oil and diversify its fuel mix for electricity production." Despite its growing alliance with often forlorn gas producers, Enron has taken precautions to minimize its risks. After spending several million dollars and 18 months on legal research, Enron came up with a plan under which it legally acquires the rights to specific gas reserves from producers under what are called production payment agreements. That way, Enron provides money for producers to invest in other gas development while avoiding losses if any of its producers stumble into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Little of the money comes from Enron's coffers. Much of the cash is coming from big pension funds, insurers and credit companies, which buy securities backed by Enron's fixed-price gas contracts, just as they buy securities backed by home loans from mortgage bankers.</p>
        <p>While it is still too early to tell if Enron can create a market for long-term gas deals, many are betting that it can. "They've done a lot of business," said Mr. Sandefer. "They've placed a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars."</p>
        <p>Mike Naeve, who specializes in energy issues as a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, in Washington, and who is a former commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, agrees. "My view is they are making a dent," he said. "One way they are making a dent is in the development of sophisticated hedging and packaging techniques that enable them to enter into these transactions. Clearly they are a leader in that area. A lot of people are watching Enron to see how it works."</p>
        <p>And if others pile into the gas banking business, if nothing else to keep their customers from signing up with Enron, as some analysts expect, it may be only a matter of time before long-term contracts become a fixture of the gas world once more.  A NEED FOR NEW PLANTS</p>
        <p>Part of Enron's plan for creating a market for long-term gas contracts depends on utilities' need to build new gas-fired plants. Some energy analysts say the timing is just right.</p>
        <p>Gas-fired projects are scarcer than those fueled by coal and nuclear energy. For nine years, until 1987, the Government banned construction by utilities of gas-fired plants, fearing that conversion to gas under deregulation would renew shortages that gripped some regions in 1977. Utilities have built few gas plants since, discouraged by the lack of long-term contracts that lenders insist upon. And many regions had plenty of electricity, thanks to the overbuilding of capacity in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The industry may be ready to build again. "Demand for electricity is growing faster than in the mid-1980's," said Mike Naeve, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom in Washington and a former commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "There is an opportunity for gas to fill that void, especially given the environmental benefits."</p>
        <p>New technologies make gas very efficient. Modern combined-cycle plants include one gas turbine and a second powered by heat from the first one. Their operating costs are up to 30 percent below those of oil- or coal-fired plants. FROM TEXAS TO SCOTLAND, A SPRAWLING GAS EMPIRE</p>
        <p>From searching for new gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico to building the world's largest electricity plant powered by gas in Scotland, Kenneth L. Lay has assembled a sprawling empire since the 1985 merger that created Enron.</p>
        <p>The deal married two big pipeline companies, the Houston Natural Gas Company, headed by Mr. Lay, and the larger Internorth Corporation at a time when Washington was loosening its grip on price controls for pipelines and in the gas fields and competition was heated. As Enron's chairman and chief executive since 1986, Mr. Lay has exploited advantages endowed by the company's size. His latest attempt to hook industrial users on gas will benefit many of its businesses.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, he became the first executive of a major American gas company to expand into Europe in ventures unrelated to gas production. On the northeast coast of Scotland, in Teesside, Enron's power generation unit is building the world's biggest cogeneration plant. The colossus will consume 300 million cubic feet daily of natural gas shipped from North Sea fields more than 140 miles away by a group of gas producers headed by Amoco Inc. The plant will displace the equivalent of 52,000 barrels a day of crude oil that would have been needed.</p>
        <p>The same construction unit has completed four gas-fired cogeneration plants in the United States since 1987, including one in Bayonne, N.J., for Jersey Central Power. In addition to producing electricity, cogeneration plants recapture heat generated by turbines and transform it to steam used by nearby industrial plants. In conventional electric power plants, heat generated by turbines is wasted. Enron is building another gas-fired plant for a group of investors in Milford, Mass., which will supply power to the local utility, the New England Power Company. Mr. Lay is counting on Enron's new gas-marketing units to accelerate this business.</p>
        <p>Enron's pipeline network could also benefit. It dominates in the Middle West and Florida and has new links to California, but has no connections in the northeast, the region where analysts expect gas demand will grow most rapidly in years ahead.</p>
