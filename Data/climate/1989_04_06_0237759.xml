        <p>LEAD: Smoking causes people to use more calories, a new study has found, so when smokers quit, they are likely to gain weight even if they eat the same amount as they did when they smoked.</p>
        <p>Smoking causes people to use more calories, a new study has found, so when smokers quit, they are likely to gain weight even if they eat the same amount as they did when they smoked.</p>
        <p>The study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, counters the widely held belief that people gain weight when they stop smoking because they substitute food for tobacco.</p>
        <p>In another study, to be published later this year, the scientists also found that it is the nicotine in cigarettes that makes smokers use more calories. The researchers have not determined why it has this effect.</p>
        <p>The report ''relieves smokers of the guilt that it's all their fault,'' said Dr. Nancy Rigotti of the Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy at Harvard University. Weight gain when they quit smoking ''is probably an effect that they can't do much about,'' she said. Suspected for Years</p>
        <p>Although researchers have suspected for years that smokers may have faster metabolic rates than nonsmokers, thereby causing them to use more calories, most previous studies found a much smaller increas in the use of calories among smokers.</p>
        <p>The new study, by Kenneth A. Perkins and his colleagues at the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh, differs from others by looking at the number of calories smokers use during mild activity. Other studies looked at people while they were at complete rest.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rigotti cautioned that the study does not find diet unimportant. Instead, it finds that metabolic changes have a bigger effect than previously suspected.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perkins said that eventually people who stop smoking will reach a new weight that is, on average, 5 to 10 pounds greater than their weight when they were smoking. Still, he said, it is much healthier to stop smoking. Nonsmokers ''would have to gain more than 50 pounds to be at the same risk of cancer and heart disease as smokers,'' he said. 'Unhealthy Way to Be Thin'</p>
        <p>''Smokers walk around all the time at an artificially depressed weight,'' Dr. Rigotti said. But ''they are trading their health for a very small gain or, in this case, loss,'' she added. ''We know there is such a thing as an unhealthy way to be thin. Just as binging and starving is an unhealthy way to be thin, so is smoking.''</p>
        <p>Other researchers have reported that many smokers, particularly many women, do not stop because they are afraid they will gain weight. And Dr. Rigotti said some studies suggest that a few teen-agers may start smoking to lose weight.</p>
        <p>The latest study found that smokers use an average of an extra 100 calories a day, about the same number of calories that would be expended by walking a mile. Over a month, an extra 100 calories a day translates into about a pound of fat.</p>
        <p>In Dr. Perkins's study, smokers rode a stationary bicycle at slow speeds to simulate the light exercise that occurs when people move about in normal daily activities like walking, typing and filing. To compute the metabolic rate, the researchers used a complex formula that involved measurements of the oxygen and carbon dioxide expelled from the lungs. Nicotine Nasal Spray Used</p>
        <p>Other studies had assessed metabolic rates at rest, the calories burned when people are lying down or sitting still in a comfortable chair. These studies had shown that smoking makes people use about 60 extra calories a day.</p>
        <p>In their separate study determining that nicotine is what raises smokers' metabolic rates, Dr. Perkins and his colleagues gave volunteers a nasal spray of nicotine and then measured the metabolic rate at rest. They found that the spray had the same effect on these volunteers as smoking had on others.</p>
        <p>In addition, Dr. Rigotti said, some researchers have found that people who chew nicotine gum when they are stopping smoking gain less weight than people who do not chew it.</p>
