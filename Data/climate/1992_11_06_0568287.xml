        <p>New Library Branch</p>
        <p>Riverside Branch  of the New York Public Library  127 Amsterdam Avenue (at 65th Street)  (212) 870-1810  Recommended for all ages</p>
        <p>This new addition to Lincoln Center combines the Riverside Branch Library and the children's performing-arts collection from the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts across the street. The new branch has a children's library on the second floor.</p>
        <p>The children's library is accessible by marble stairs or an elevator; the mint-green walls and picture windows look out to Martin Luther King Jr. High School and a slice of New Jersey. There is a small stage for storytellers. The Heckscher Room, a private room with rose-colored children's chairs and a huge rocking chair for readings and other programs, has three stations where children may listen to the library's collection of 500 records, CD's and cassette tapes. The reference and lending sections offer a general selection as well as one focused on performing arts.</p>
        <p>The library, designed by Davis Brody &amp; Associates, was financed by New York City and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The Children's Room is open Mondays through Thursdays from 2:30 to 5:30 P.M., and Saturdays from 1 to 5 P.M. 'Eyes on Oppression'</p>
        <p>Downtown Community Television Center  87 Lafayette Street  TriBeCa  (212) 966-4510  Recommended ages: 10 and up  Through Sunday</p>
        <p>Just what is on the minds of young video makers? Sensitive subjects like homophobia, racism, Puerto Rican nationalism, teen-age drug dealing, sex and homelessness. The Downtown Community Television Center, a media center in a landmark former firehouse, is holding its first children's video festival.</p>
        <p>The 11 videos are diverse. "Our Documentary on Drugs," for example, was taped by youngsters in conjunction with the Children's Museum of Manhattan. The children visited a drug-rehabilitation clinic, interviewed the residents and talked about their own misconceptions. (One girl said she had thought the place would be "slimy.") In Los Angeles, 16-year-old Kimiko Roberts's autobiographical video, "Cultural Identity Crisis of an All-American Girl," is an unself-pitying account of her life as the daughter of a black man and a Japanese-American mother.</p>
        <p>"No Way Out," made by 18-year-old Darryl T. Cohen, is a highly charged depiction of a young man's struggle to avoid the materialistic trap of drug dealing. "Accidents Can Happen," made by students involved in Spark, a New York City high-school video program, is a look at a couple who forgot to use birth control once and are now facing the consequences.  In one of the best videos, "Beyond the Color of Authority," 16-year-old Rachael Fielding interviewed her father, a Los Angeles County Sheriff, before, during and after the city's riots last spring. Mr. Fielding likens the sense of hopelessness in the ghetto streets to the disillusionment he felt in Saigon during the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>The 90-minute festival, at 3 P.M. tomorrow and on Sunday, will include a panel discussion of New York City teen-agers. Admission is $3; refreshments will be available. Junior Museum Science Club</p>
        <p>Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences  75 Stuyvesant Place  St. George  (718) 727-1135  Recommended ages: 8 to 13  Saturdays</p>
        <p>Once a month, Clay Wollney leads older children through a two-hour scientific journey that touches on biology, chemistry and physics. Mr. Discovery, as he is known, is the chairman of the science department at Staten Island Academy, a private school. Tomorrow, children can learn about their cardiovascular and respiratory systems.</p>
        <p>Take lung capacity: children will blow into a spirometer and then into an inverted bottle of water to determine how much air their lungs hold. Each child can measure his cardiovascular strength by taking his pulse at rest and after running in place. If there is time, Mr. Discovery will have children examine the circulatory, digestive and skeletal systems of a starfish.</p>
        <p>The sessions run from 10 A.M. to noon and from 1 to 3 P.M. Admission is $7 for institute members and $9 for nonmembers. Free parking is available; the institute is a five-minute walk from the Staten Island Ferry terminal: turn right on Richmond Terrace, walk two blocks to Wall Street and climb the hill, one block, to Stuyvesant Place, where the institute is on the corner. The next Mr. Discovery session, on Dec. 19, will explore acid rain and wildlife in wintertime.  'Dragonwings'</p>
        <p>Triplex Theater  199 Chambers Street  TriBeCa  (212) 346-8510  Recommended ages: 5 and up  Tomorrow</p>
        <p>"Dragonwings" is a play based on a children's book by Laurence Yep, a playwright. It portrays the story of an immigrant Chinese family in San Francisco, and the graces and horrors of Western life as seen by Moon Shadow, a newly arrived Chinese boy.</p>
        <p>Tickets to tomorrow's 11 A.M. and 1 P.M. shows are $7. The play is produced by the Lincoln Center Institute, which provides arts-education programs to schools. "Dragonwings" will also be performed on Dec. 5 at La Guardia Community College's Performing Arts Center, 31-10 Thomson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 482-5151.</p>
