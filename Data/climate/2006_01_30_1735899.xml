        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I'll say this for Thomas L. Friedman: he doesn't lack for imaginative dreams. Asking President Bush to dedicate the nation to achieving energy independence (''State of the Union,'' column, Jan. 27) is pretty far-fetched.</p>
        <p>But more important, why isn't there a mass uprising of the American people that would force such a policy? Why don't we divert even 10 percent of our military budget to a ''Prometheus Project'' of serious research into serious energy alternatives, thus eventually freeing us up from our serfdom to the oil-rich states of the Middle East?</p>
        <p>In order for Americans to understand this administration's energy policy (or lack thereof), they would also have to start questioning the hegemony that Big Oil holds over the nation. It's no longer merely a question of environmental policy (even though global climate change continues apace); it's now clearly a question of national security policy.</p>
        <p>Why can't we get past the entrenched power interests on this? Perhaps we should ask Halliburton and the Carlyle Group.</p>
