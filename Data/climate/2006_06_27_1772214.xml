        <p>A few months back, I wrote about the mind-blowing, perspective-altering four days I spent at TED (Technology * Entertainment * Design) in February. It's a conference that features fifty prominent speakers.</p>
        <p>As I wrote at the time: "It's four days of talks, each no longer than 18 minutes. The speakers are either famous, pioneers in their industries or just fascinating people--and often all three...They addressed climate crisis, the depletion of fossil fuels, African AIDS, third-world poverty, human-rights violations, the spiral of West-Islamic global hatred, lethal viruses, and other cheery subjects...The organizer of TED makes no bones about the fact that he wants this astonishing network of speakers and audience members to throw their expertise, brainpower and connections behind efforts to address the world's problems."</p>

        <p>A few months back, I wrote about the mind-blowing, perspective-altering four days I spent at TED (Technology * Entertainment * Design) in February. It's a conference that features fifty prominent speakers.</p>
        <p>As I wrote at the time: "It's four days of talks, each no longer than 18 minutes. The speakers are either famous, pioneers in their industries or just fascinating people--and often all three...They addressed climate crisis, the depletion of fossil fuels, African AIDS, third-world poverty, human-rights violations, the spiral of West-Islamic global hatred, lethal viruses, and other cheery subjects...The organizer of TED makes no bones about the fact that he wants this astonishing network of speakers and audience members to throw their expertise, brainpower and connections behind efforts to address the world's problems."</p>
        <p>The darned shame of all this is that the theater holds only 500 people; an overflow room holds 500 more who watch on flat-panel screens. (The other darned shame is that a ticket to TED costs $4,400, which keeps out a lot of people.)</p>
        <p>Suddenly, though, access to TED just got a lot easier. Starting today, the conference organizers will be posting videos of the talks online--for free. Six of them just went live today, among them talks by Al Gore and Tony Robbins. (My own presentation, on software simplicity, is also one of the debut six.)</p>
        <p>To TED's credit, it's making these videos very easy to find and to spread. It's publishing them in every conceivable format (Flash Video, QuickTime, MP4 video, MP3 audio) and location (TED.com, iTunes, GoogleVideo, RSS feeds, and so on). You're even free to re-post them on your own Web site.</p>
        <p>The main thing, though, is to watch them. The first batch, in particular, includes some absolutely astonishing moments; watch professor Hans Rosling, for example, as he turns reams of dull government statistics into animated, living graphs that show how a small shift in a country's national policy winds up rocketing its population into health and prosperity.</p>
        <p>I think TED is a singular, extremely special institution; its only downside was its limited audience. Starting today, that's changed; I wish the project well.</p>
