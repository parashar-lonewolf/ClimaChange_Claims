        <p>LEAD: Mayor Koch, citing concern over the environment, announced a drive yesterday against one of the most familiar of packaging materials, polystyrene foam.</p>
        <p>Mayor Koch, citing concern over the environment, announced a drive yesterday against one of the most familiar of packaging materials, polystyrene foam.</p>
        <p>He singled out the fast-food giant, the McDonald's Corporation, as one of the biggest users of the substance.</p>
        <p>''I'm asking McDonald's to give us a break today and discontinue its use of polystyrene foam,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''These products have only a very short span of usefulness yet remain with us in nondegradable form for hundreds of years,'' he said at a City Hall news conference. Threat to Earth's Atmosphere</p>
        <p>In doing so, the Mayor joined a campaign mounted by New York State consumer officials and several localities around the nation that are worried about dwindling landfill space. Berkeley, Calif., and Suffolk County in New York are considering banning the use of some plastic packaging by fast-food restaurants. The City of Seattle is seeking a broader change, calling for a statewide ban in Washington on nonrecyclable material.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say polystyrene foam, which is usually produced with a gas called chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, is breaking down the earth's protective ozone layer and is partly responsible for a global warming trend that is gradually raising ocean levels.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said he had taken steps to halt the city's purchasing of polystyrene foam materials.</p>
        <p>City schools and the Department of Corrections, for example, buy large amounts of the material, commonly referred to by the trade name Styrofoam. No Suitable Substitutes</p>
        <p>The Mayor pointed out that a McDonald's competitor, Burger King, packs its foods in biodegradable paper cartons.</p>
        <p>Richard Christian, a regional vice president for McDonald's in New York City, said that the company was willing to explore alternative methods of packaging its foods, but that it was not now considering abandoning the use of polystyrene foams.</p>
        <p>He said the containers provide the best quality of service to McDonald's customers. No suitable substitutes have been found, he said.</p>
        <p>McDonald's, after intense national pressure from environmental groups, announced last August that it would begin phasing out polystyrene foam that includes chlorofluorocarbons, which are the agents believed to deplete ozone. Berkeley, Calif., has already passed a measure banning fast-food containers containing the substance, effective Jan. 31, but is considering a broader measure. No 'Meaningful Impact'</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, acknowledged that McDonald's had been phasing out containers made with CFC, but added ''that they still have Styrofoam that does have them.'' He added, ''We want that eliminated immediately.''</p>
        <p>Additionally, polystyrene foam products present a disposal problem because they do not compress well in landfills and resist breaking down like paper products do, said Sanitation Commissioner Brendan Sexton.</p>
        <p>As for landfill problems, ''plastics account for less than one percent of the total garbage waste,'' Mr. Christian said.</p>
