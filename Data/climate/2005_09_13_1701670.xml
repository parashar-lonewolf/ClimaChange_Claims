        <p>''There's a real fire hose of information coming out of the networks,'' said David Fanning, the executive producer of PBS's ''Frontline,'' addressing the question of how his program would cover Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>''The emotional stories are the business of the 'Today' show, 'Dateline,' '20/20,''' he said, adding that the challenge for ''Frontline'' is ''to find an angle into it that will at least promise you some level of surprise.''</p>

        <p>''There's a real fire hose of information coming out of the networks,'' said David Fanning, the executive producer of PBS's ''Frontline,'' addressing the question of how his program would cover Hurricane Katrina.</p>
        <p>''The emotional stories are the business of the 'Today' show, 'Dateline,' '20/20,''' he said, adding that the challenge for ''Frontline'' is ''to find an angle into it that will at least promise you some level of surprise.''</p>
        <p>''My rule of thumb is, if we all agree enthusiastically on an approach, we probably shouldn't do it,'' he said. ''It's the conventional wisdom at that point.''</p>
        <p>Public television and cable executives are scrambling to figure out angles on the storm and its aftermath. Like network news personnel, their reporters and crews have gathered respirators, gallons of gas, sleeping bags, food, water and press credentials and headed to work in the Gulf Coast region.</p>
        <p>Each outlet or program will play to its strengths. CNN, with its deep pocket of reporters and producers, is pulling many staff members ''off day-to-day news coverage and live shots to put them on the trail of more in-depth, longer-form storytelling,'' said Jonathan Klein, president of CNN/U.S. Over the weekend CNN broadcast a one-hour special, ''Is America Prepared? Lessons of Hurricane Katrina,'' and more are in the works, including programs on children affected by the storm, a series on heroes to be updated weekly, and a more investigative program that Mr. Klein hopes will be similar to David Ensor's recent report, ''Dead Wrong,'' about intelligence failures leading up to the invasion of Iraq.</p>
        <p>A&amp;E was still sorting out its programming at the end of last week, but it will be of the ''Biography'' nature -- ''survivors and heroes,'' said Abbe Raven, president of A&amp;E Television Networks.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for HBO said it was still ''too early to talk about'' its plans.</p>
        <p>''Frontline'' is producing ''The Storm,'' the details of which Mr. Fanning declined to reveal, except to say that the program, to be broadcast Nov. 22, will be about ''the political decisions leading up to the disaster and beyond.''</p>
        <p>''Nova Science Now,'' an offshoot of the PBS program ''Nova,'' will broadcast a Katrina report on Oct. 18. It will essentially be an update of a broadcast on Jan. 25 in which the program visited with scientists and emergency management officials who very accurately predicted what would happen if a storm like Katrina hit New Orleans. ''We've spent the past five days trying to track these people down,'' Sam Fine, executive producer of ''Nova Science Now,'' said last Wednesday. ''We're leaving Sunday and filming Monday and Tuesday.'' The crew arrived Sunday night.</p>
        <p>The National Geographic Channel is planning to run a program of two hours in early November that will be ''a minute-by-minute chronology, starting well before the storm was sighted, going back to the time when people were saying, 'New Orleans's time is coming,''' said John Ford, executive vice president for programming. Another National Geographic program is in production in New Orleans and will be broadcast in January. ''It's a one-hour special for our 'Explorer' series on basically the science of what happened, the geography of New Orleans, the changes at the mouth of the Mississippi, the receding wetlands, the reduction of the barrier islands over the years,'' Mr. Ford said.</p>
        <p>National Geographic has a producer originally from New Orleans, Lawrence Cumbo, who is staying with his parents in Baton Rouge, La., and using family connections to get access to various engineers and people involved in the recovery effort.</p>
        <p>The A&amp;E-owned History Channel worked with ABC News Productions for an hour called ''Katrina: American Catastrophe.''</p>
        <p>''We've been lucky: ABC has been in and around the gulf area, with some 200 people, correspondents, producers, editors,'' said Lisa Zeff, executive producer of ABC News Productions. That program was to be broadcast last night as the opening segment in four hours of programming focused on putting the hurricane in historical context. Two programs were to be rebroadcast as part of that package, ''Isaac's Storm,'' about the hurricane that devastated Galveston, Tex., in 1900, and ''Modern Marvels: Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.''</p>
        <p>PBS's ''Now'' spent four days last week in Mississippi for a report that was broadcast on Friday, and it is devoting the month of September to Katrina coverage, featuring, this coming Friday, a town meeting from Baton Rouge moderated by David Brancaccio.</p>
        <p>Todd Gitlin, professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University, suggested several possibilities for documentaries, including ''the big picture,'' which would include ''everything from the increasing violence of storms in the gulf region, which may be related to global warming, to the long-term instability of New Orleans and the construction on the delta.'' Also included could be patterns of corruption and cronyism in Louisiana; FEMA; the oil industry; class and race; and institutional failings that lead to catastrophe.</p>
        <p>All acknowledge that there's much more to be done. As Mr. Klein of CNN noted, ''This is still a breaking story.''</p>
