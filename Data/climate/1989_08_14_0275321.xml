        <p>LEAD: A new kind of census taker took to the streets of Manhattan yesterday, one armed not only with pencils and enumeration sheets but with measuring tapes and a book showing how to tell an oak leaf from an elm leaf and a bark shedder from a fungus victim.</p>
        <p>A new kind of census taker took to the streets of Manhattan yesterday, one armed not only with pencils and enumeration sheets but with measuring tapes and a book showing how to tell an oak leaf from an elm leaf and a bark shedder from a fungus victim.</p>
        <p>More than 80 volunteers took part in New York's first street-tree census that both counted the boulevard dwellers and gave them medical checkups.</p>
        <p>Working in pairs, the volunteers, who ranged from teen-agers to elderly people, covered a quarter of Manhattan yesterday, counting and rating most of the trees below 14th Street and some of the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>If the project finds enough volunteers, all 700,000 of the city's street trees - trees in parks don't count - will be checked off by October.</p>
        <p>Every year, the city loses shade, oxygen and a bit of countryside. About 13,000 trees a year succumb to insects, have their roots cut by backhoes, are hit by trucks or meet other untimely ends, and only about 10,000 are replaced, said Gerard Lordahl of the Council on the Environment. Tree-Counting Weekends Coming</p>
        <p>The goal of the project, which was initiated by the Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern and organized by seven concerned volunteers, is to construct a data base that will help the Parks Department take care of the trees and plan future plantings.</p>
        <p>Staten Island's census was taken earlier this summer, said Leni Schwendinger, one of yesterday's organizers. Before this project began, only 2 percent of the city's street trees had ever been individually counted, she said. If it finds the volunteers, the Parks Department plans to finish Manhattan and move into Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx on two tree-counting weekends in September and one in October.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's intermittent rain didn't seem to stop the census takers as they grouped at the north end of Union Square to get their kits, hats, T-shirts and maps. Sample branches from virtually every tree found on the streets, avenues and traffic islands of Manhattan were laid out on nearby picnic tables. Mr. Lordahl gave quick tips on how to identify the trees and any diseases they might have. The current equivalent of the bubonic plague among London plane trees is sycamore anthracnose fungus. Look for eaten-away leaves and, in severe cases, complete defoliation. The trees are rated good, fair, poor and dead. Over-diagnosis can be a problem. ''If they see a dead branch, they'll say the tree is dead,'' Mr. Lordahl said. ''Unless you're absolutely sure it's as dead as a doornail, don't mark it dead.'' 'We Need to Breathe'</p>
        <p>''I love trees and I think we need to breathe,'' said Vera Lightstone, a sculptor who lives at 347 West 39th Street. ''The whole thrust of this program is to plant more trees'' to help the city's air quality and counter the greenhouse effect, Debra Italiano, one of the seven organizers, said.</p>
        <p>Con Edison supplied the sodas, Marino Ices and Sedutto's supplied the ice cream and the Parks Department supplied the enumeration sheets and the descriptions of pin oaks, American elms, gingkoes, honey locusts and the diseases that threaten them.</p>
        <p>''This poor thing is confetti,'' said Ms. Lightstone, pointing to the fungus-eaten leaves of an American elm during a practice run in the park. She rated the tree ''poor.'' Mr. Lordahl complimented her on her diagnosis.</p>
