        <p>On his day job in 1982, Lonnie G. Johnson, a 32-year-old aerospace engineer, was preparing an interplanetary spacecraft for its atomic battery. But he dreamed of inventing something that would change life on earth.</p>
        <p>He often worked at home as his wife and children slept. One weekend, while tinkering in his bathroom, Mr. Johnson hooked up to the sink a prototype cooling device.</p>
        <p>Meant to run on water, it bore at one end a length of vinyl tubing and a homemade metal nozzle. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
        <p>''I turned and shot into the bathtub,'' he recalled. The blast was so powerful that the whoosh of accompanying air set the bathroom curtains flying. ''I said to myself, 'Jeez, this would make a great water gun.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson is the inventor of the Super Soaker, what industry experts call the world's most powerful and popular squirt gun.</p>
        <p>Its 14 models cost up to $60 each and fire volleys of high-pressure water up to 50 feet, surprising parents who remember 39-cent guns that shot inches. Mr. Johnson's happenstance of science two decades ago not only redefined summer fun but began an industry that takes in more than $200 million a year.</p>
        <p>''Wetter is better!'' goes the slogan for the Super Soaker, one of the world's top-selling summer toys.</p>
        <p>The secret of the Super Soaker is its deft storage and release of energy. With a few strokes of a hand pump and some intricate tubing and pressure bottles, Mr. Johnson did for water pistols what he had done earlier in his career for energizing space probes.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Johnson is still at it. His business, Johnson Research and Development, lies outside Atlanta and has 14 employees. With 60 patents to his name and 20 pending, he talks confidently of bigger things to come: novel batteries, cars, spacecraft.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that he will come up with some revolutionary invention,'' said Dr. S. Mostafa Ghia asiaan, an engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who has worked with Mr. Johnson for a decade. ''He really enjoys it. He's almost like a kid.''</p>
        <p>Lonnie George Johnson was born on Oct. 6, 1949, and grew up in Mobile, Ala., the third of six children. He excelled in science and math. In 1968, as a high school senior, he won first place in a science fair at the University of Alabama.</p>
        <p>Significantly, his three-foot mechanical robot ran on compressed air, which in time would also power his water blasters.</p>
        <p>His tinkering with air, Mr. Johnson recalled, ''goes way back.''</p>
        <p>In college, on math and military scholarships, he dreamed of advancing the nuclear power industry and learned the complexities of atomic fission and high pressure. He graduated in 1975 from Tuskegee University with a master's in nuclear engineering.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's, he worked at the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, overseeing the safety of projects involving space nuclear power.</p>
        <p>In 1979, he moved to California and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an aerospace mecca.</p>
        <p>There his nuclear skills helped integrate an atomic power plant into Galileo, a $1.6 billion spacecraft destined to study Jupiter and its 16 moons. It needed an atomic battery because sunlight would be too weak there to power solar panels.</p>
        <p>David M. Durham, a spacecraft engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, recalled that Mr. Johnson was known not only for professional excellence but for testing his wife's patience with his moonlighting.</p>
        <p>''At one point, his wife nearly threw him out of the house because all he did was tinker,'' he said. After minor successes with inventions, he added, Mr. Johnson finally ''came up with one that allowed him to no longer have to work for anybody.''</p>
        <p>It happened in 1982 while Mr. Johnson was working at home on a new kind of cooling device. At that time, refrigerators often used Freon, a gas that destroys the earth's ozone layer. He envisioned one that ran on water. It would not only be efficient but would also be environmentally friendly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson was tinkering with parts for his device when he experienced his squirt-gun eureka. He built a prototype for his 6-year-old daughter, and rave reviews from around the neighborhood convinced him that it had commercial potential.</p>
        <p>For decades, the science of squirt guns was simple: pulling a trigger  forced water in a small chamber out through a narrow opening. That principle has worked not only for water pistols but also for dispensers of perfumes, window cleaners and other household products.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's squirt gun was different. Most important, it abandoned the small water pump and made it possible to employ much more than the energy of a single finger squeeze. Instead, a child drove a large air pump repeatedly, with each stroke adding more air to produce greater compression and store more energy.</p>
        <p>''A small kid would not have enough strength to create the level of force needed to make the gun shoot a long way,'' he recalled. ''So I had to put the energy in a little bit at a time.''</p>
        <p>Repeated pump strokes sent air into a strong chamber filled with water. The pressure grew and grew, until a pull on the trigger unleashed torrents.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 14, 1983, Mr. Johnson applied for a patent. While it was common, he wrote, to use compressed gas to power ''high-velocity water flow from a nozzle,'' doing so with squirt guns was a novel idea.</p>
        <p>The first company to which he licensed the idea went bankrupt. But he kept trying and tinkering, refining his design, filing for new patents. Soon, prototypes were topped by a distinctive thick plastic bottle that held water under high pressure. A more modest bottle would explode.</p>
        <p>After years of setbacks, Mr. Johnson went in February 1989 to a toy fair in New York City and approached the Larami Corporation, a maker of squirt guns.</p>
        <p>''He was dejected,'' recalled Al Davis, now the company's executive vice president. ''He told me he had this amazing water gun'' that nobody would manufacture.</p>
        <p>Invited to the company's headquarters outside Philadelphia, Mr. Johnson impressed his future partners by blasting coffee cups off the table and firing across the boardroom. ''I'd never seen anything like it,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>The manufacturer, now a Hasbro subsidiary called Larami Limited, moved fast. It had the first gun in the stores by late 1989 and sold it for $10. In November, Johnny Carson turned one on Ed McMahon during ''The Tonight Show.'' Sales in 1990 were fairly strong.</p>
        <p>Excited, Larami asked Mr. Johnson for more ideas. How could the gun be improved? What new models might be introduced?</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson came up with an advance that made the gun far more efficient. Each stroke of a child's arm would store more energy, increasing the possibilities for wet fun.</p>
        <p>The improvement again centered on the pump. Mr. Johnson decided to switch to having the child pump water into the pressure chamber instead of air, and that change gave the gun more squirts per stroke. In the first-generation Super Soaker, the arm stroking the pump had to overcome rising resistance as pressures mounted in the reservoir bottle. As friction rose, the air in the pump would become increasingly compressed, getting hot.</p>
        <p>''It would get so hot that it would melt the check valve,'' Mr. Johnson said of early prototypes.</p>
        <p>The new model of the Super Soaker pumped water -- which is incompressible under most conditions and immune to such heating and energy losses -- but did so in a way that was far different from early squirt guns. The signature of Mr. Johnson's new design was two bottles, a reservoir with thin walls and a pressure chamber with thick walls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's new gun pumped water from the unpressurized thin-walled reservoir into the thick-walled pressure bottle. Now, with high efficiency, each stroke of the pump pushed in water, and the air inside the bottle became more and more compressed, increasingly ready to fuel a gusher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson cannot recall how he got the idea. But once he did, he said, ''it was obvious.''</p>
        <p>The new gun was a hit. High-efficiency Super Soakers became a mainstay of Larami's line. Today, such models have one or two pressure bottles ready to fill and fire.</p>
        <p>To avoid both explosions and injuries, the guns have a relief valve that limits how high the pressures can go. Instructions for Super Soakers nonetheless carry a number of cautions. ''Warning!'' one says. ''Do not shoot at anyone's face or eyes.''</p>
        <p>In striking a balance between fun and safety, the designers also made the streams of water fairly wide. That avoids any cutting action or anything more painful than a mild sting.</p>
        <p>In 1991, as Super Soaker sales took off, Mr. Johnson founded his own firm, Johnson Research and Development, in Smyrna, Ga.</p>
        <p>The company develops new products, specializing in areas like heat transfer, thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.</p>
        <p>When Inventors' Digest asked Mr. Johnson in 1995 what advice he would give a struggling neophyte, he replied: ''Perseverance! There is no short, easy route to success.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Johnson is still refining his water-based cooling machine, the gadget that started it all. Known as the Johnson Tube, the patented device is 25 percent more efficient than conventional heat pumps and air conditioners. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has studied it as a means of controlling heat in spacecraft built to carry astronauts.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Johnson said the device was fast evolving into a high-efficiency engine. One day, he said, it might power cars.</p>
        <p>He is also designing a generation of electrical batteries based on ceramics and having solid-state features, the same as integrated circuits. Mr. Johnson sees them as ideal for powering micro machines.</p>
        <p>Through his company, Mr. Johnson is working on new ways to make life better, and he hopes to make things a little better in Atlanta, too. He said Johnson Research and Development had recently bought some  property in downtown Atlanta, where it plans, with the city's help, to create new jobs.</p>
        <p>Asked why he invented, Mr. Johnson laughed.</p>
        <p>''That's a tough one,'' he said. ''I have these ideas, and they keep on coming.''</p>
