        <p>North Korea asked South Korea to join in pressing America to sign a nonaggression treaty. The request comes as the United States, Japan and South Korea have initiated sanctions for North Korea's violation of nuclear arms control agreements.</p>

        <p>Justice Department Uses New Tools in Terror Inquiry  The Justice Department, moving quickly to use its expanded powers for spying on possible terrorists, plans to assign federal lawyers in counterintelligence to terrorism task forces in New York and Washington to help secure secret warrants against suspects, officials say.</p>

        <p>West Coast Port Agreement  West Coast port operators and the longshoremen's union announced a tentative agreement, ending a dispute that had closed 29 seaports before President Bush obtained an injunction to reopen them last month.</p>

        <p>Rash of Foreclosures  Home mortgages nationwide are being foreclosed at the highest rate in 30 years, according to a recent report. Nowhere is the problem more severe than in Indiana, a trend experts attribute to the state's relatively loose lender regulations and its sharply rising unemployment rate.</p>

        <p>Rebound in Border Crossings  Recent statistics compiled by the United States Border Patrol show that apprehensions of illegal immigrants are roughly back to where they were before Sept. 11.</p>

        <p>Problems With Contractors  The Department of Energy's experience with contractors, with projects routinely running over budget and past deadlines, serves as a sobering counterpoint to the Bush administration's proposal to turn about half of the federal government's civilian jobs over to private companies.</p>

        <p>City Property Tax Rate Will Rise by 18 Percent  The city's property tax rate, frozen for a decade, will rise by 18 percent on Jan. 1 under an agreement announced between the Bloomberg administration and City Council leaders. Faced with a deficit of $1.1 billion this year and $6.4 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2003, Mayor Michael R.

        <p>Subway Track Work Stopped  All nonemergency track work in the New York City subway system was halted after the second worker in two days was struck and killed by an oncoming train in Manhattan. New York City Transit called for the freeze to conduct a review of safety procedures after transit union officials instructed track crews to stop all work, raising the specter of major delays on subway lines throughout the city.</p>

        <p>Seeking Solar Power  The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission plans to position solar panels around the foggy city that it says will add 10 megawatts of solar power to the electricity grid over the next five years. On average, 1 megawatt is enough electricity for 1,000 homes. The long-term hope is a significant decrease in the city's reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
