        <p>LEAD: After months of brutal legislative warfare, the Senate has produced the first comprehensive clean air bill since 1977. It's a huge improvement over current law, and tougher than George Bush's proposals. It reconciles regional differences, and will encourage technology.

        <p>LEAD: After months of brutal legislative warfare, the Senate has produced the first comprehensive clean air bill since 1977.

        <p>After months of brutal legislative warfare, the Senate has produced the first comprehensive clean air bill since 1977. It's a huge improvement over current law, and tougher than George Bush's proposals. It reconciles regional differences, and will encourage technology. If matched by the House, it will let the nation breathe easier.</p>
        <p>One would not know any of this from the public posturing following the vote. Environmentalists called for ''major surgery.'' Industry complained bitterly about the heavy capital investments it says the bill would require. Both sides vow to press their claims in the House.</p>
        <p>Behind the posturing, however, there's grudging acceptance. On the three main issues - urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals - the environmentalists are better off than they thought they'd be when Mr. Bush was elected. Industry, for its part, faces $20 billion in increased and unwanted costs. But consumers will pay much of this; and industry spokesmen concede they can live with many of the bill's provisions.</p>
        <p>That the Senate produced a worthwhile bill at all says much for the majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, who struck a compromise between conviction and instinct. He favored an ambitious measure approved by the Senate Environment Committee that, among other things, called for more expensive controls on auto emissions than Mr. Bush had envisioned. His instincts told him that such a measure was doomed to defeat, either on the Senate floor or by a Bush veto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell survived even the cynicism of a few Republicans who voted for controversial provisions in the hope of undermining the bill. In the end, he helped produce honorable legislation that would halve the automobile emissions that produce urban smog, cut substantially the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain and increase Federal control over a wide range of toxic pollutants.</p>
        <p>A House committee is now drafting a companion bill. Its acid rain provision is unfinished. Its standards on auto and toxic emissions are less stringent than the Senate's. It would not seriously press the oil companies to develop alternative fuels, including ''reformulated gasoline.'' But it also gives the Federal Government more power to crack down on polluters and force cities to reduce smog.</p>
        <p>The prospect is more bitter debate - and more dealing. That's inevitable when a bill reaches so deeply into industrial society. But it would be tragic if the outcome were no bill at all. Mr. Mitchell spoke for many Americans when he told his colleagues Tuesday: ''In the 13 years since the Clean Air Act was last amended, old problems have persisted and new ones arisen. There are no simple, inexpensive answers to these problems. But the cost of inaction will be higher than the cost of this bill.''</p>
