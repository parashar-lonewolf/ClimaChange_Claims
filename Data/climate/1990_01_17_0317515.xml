        <p>LEAD: Carbon monoxide fumes from a furnace killed a woman and four children a week after they moved into their home here.</p>
        <p>Carbon monoxide fumes from a furnace killed a woman and four children a week after they moved into their home here.</p>
        <p>The victims moved into the one-story two-bedroom home a week ago, and unpacked moving boxes were found scattered throughout the house when the bodies were found, Lieut. Rich Resling of the police said Monday.</p>
        <p>The victims died Wednesday evening from carbon monoxide poisoning, said the El Paso County deputy coroner, Michael Stewart. They were identified as Sophia Gerardo, 34 years old; her sons, Daniel Gerardo, 9, Nash Gerardo, 11, and Mario Ortiz, 13, and her nephew, Mark McPeak, 15.</p>
        <p>City inspectors had found the furnace unsafe in September and ordered it shut off after fumes from it felled at least one person then living in the house, but a city official said it was unclear whether the furnace was ever repaired.</p>
        <p>When a heater fails to burn fuel adequately, odorless carbon monoxide, rather than carbon dioxide, can be produced, Mr. Stewart said.</p>
        <p>He said the woman might have become aware that something was wrong because she apparently tried to pull herself upright by grabbing a plant stand, which was found toppled next to her.</p>
        <p>''It looked like she was trying to get out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Resling said a neighbor alerted the police on Sunday after peering into a window and seeing a body.</p>
        <p>A city spokesman, John Henry, said that on Sept. 9, a previous occupant of the house was overcome by carbon monoxide and taken to a hospital and that inspectors immediately ''red-tagged'' the furnace as unsafe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henry could not say whether the furnace had since been repaired because the city does not perform follow-up inspections.</p>
        <p>Dallas Lopez, a friend of the dead woman, said he was aware of the problems with the furnace. ''They had all kinds of city workers and the fire department looking around,'' he said, adding that they later said they had fixed the furnace.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Resling said the police were continuing to investigate the matter.</p>
