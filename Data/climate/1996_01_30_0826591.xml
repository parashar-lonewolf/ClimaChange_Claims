        <p>A team of American entrepreneurs and their Russian partners have devised a novel way to turn cold-war atomic expertise to peacetime profits: by sterilizing Russian logs with radiation to make them safe for export to the United States.</p>
        <p>Backers call the plan a shining example of one nation helping another to beat bombs into buzz saws. But opponents see it as part of an environmentally reckless raid on the planet's greatest conifer forests.</p>
        <p>Already, the proposal has received financial support from a little-known venture fund sponsored by the Pentagon, and condemnation from a conservation group that likewise gets Federal aid.</p>
        <p>It is one of many joint forestry projects encouraged by the American timber industry and the Russian Federation, the kind of venture that Vice President Al  Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia are striving to nurture at their latest economic consultations in Washington this week.</p>
        <p>The idea is to bombard timber harvested in Siberia with gamma rays, emitted by radioactive cobalt, killing any pests that might accidentally infest American forests as the logs are shipped to American sawmills in the Pacific Northwest, where environmental laws have constrained logging.</p>
        <p>Supporters say the project would employ thousands of Russians and earn millions of foreign-exchange dollars while preserving American sawmill jobs.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists fear that unfettered logging could damage virgin forests and the habitat of rare species in the vast Siberian wilderness. They are also skeptical of the safety and effectiveness of the gamma-ray technology,  a sterilization method that caused a stir in the United States a few years ago when companies proposed marketing similarly processed raw foods, and that is now permitted but not widespread.</p>
        <p>Finally, the critics question the merit for Russia of building up a timber industry based primarily on exports of unfinished goods.</p>
        <p>None of this has diminished the powerful lure of the Siberian forests for American investors, often operating with Government subsidies.</p>
        <p>In September, the Defense Enterprise Fund, a private, nonprofit American venture capital company, agreed to invest $1 million in the wood irradiation project. The fund, which received its initial capital from the Defense Department, seeks to convert arms producers of the former Soviet Union into businesses serving nonmilitary markets.</p>
        <p>The project's for-profit American investors, led by REM Capital Corporation of Arlington, Va., have promised that as many as 11 radiation plants in Russia would supply enough timber to sawmills in this country to preserve domestic sawmill jobs, lower wood prices and fill what they call a gap in domestic timber supplies. The investment could approach $100 million, said Ronald E. Muller, REM's chairman.</p>
        <p>Leaders of 47 American and Russian environmental groups wrote to Vice President Gore last month to express "alarm" about several timber projects, saying Siberia and the Russian Far East could be transformed into "a massive whole-log export colony."</p>
        <p>"Siberia and the Russian Far East offer some wonderful opportunities for both protecting biodiversity and creating a model of sustainable development, rather  than promoting an economy based on the export of natural resources," said David  Gordon, head of the Siberian forests protection project at the Pacific Environment and Resources Center, a nonprofit group in Sausalito, Calif.</p>
        <p>At a White House meeting on Jan. 10, environmentalists called for assurances  that all such projects comply with both long-standing American environmental regulations and untested new Russian rules.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding to expand Russian forest products industries, calling for millions of dollars in trade of  wood, pulp, paper products and related equipment.</p>
        <p>A separate understanding pledges the two Governments to cooperate in environmental protection, and several agencies are carrying out projects in Russia to promote sustainable forestry, replanting, fire prevention and the like.</p>
        <p>A report by the Pacific Environmental and Resources Center, which is critical of the broad timber initiative, cited these actions on various logging proposals:</p>
        <p>*The Commerce Department's Trade and Development Administration has granted $500,000 to Global Forestry Management Group, a consortium of Pacific Northwest  sawmills, for a feasibility study of logging millions of acres of old-growth forests in Khabarovsk, perhaps including areas where the rare Siberian tiger is  sometimes found.</p>
        <p>*The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides political-risk insurance and other subsidies, is considering several logging ventures, including the Global Forestry Management Group project.</p>
        <p>*The Export-Import Bank, which provides lending assistance to promote trade,  is working on an agreement that would ease Russian borrowing to buy logging equipment.</p>
        <p>*Various privately managed, nonprofit enterprise corporations that receive their initial capital from Federal tax dollars are supporting forestry projects, including the Russian-American Ionized Energy Services' gamma-rays plan.</p>
        <p>Russian-American Ionized Energy Services is a joint venture incorporated in the United States. Its founding shareholders are REM Capital Corporation; the V. G. Khlopini Radium Institute of St. Petersburg, Russia, and the institute's parent organization, the Russian Federation's Ministry for Atomic Radiation. Other investors include a Norwegian shipping concern, the Russian investment arm of Paine Webber, and the newly privatized Russian Forestry Industrial Company.</p>
        <p>The plans, supporters say, would yield hundreds of millions of board feet of  timber, directly employing 11,000 Russians in the radiation plants and indirectly many times more in the woods, while supplying American sawmills that  employ 100,000 workers. In addition, they would earn hard currency for Russia and keep down wood prices in the United States, supporters say.</p>
        <p>The opposition is led by the Pacific Environment and Resources Center, which  has received environmental protection grants from the United States Agency for International Development.</p>
        <p>Although environmentalists have questioned the safety and effectiveness of the nuclear treatments, their main objection is not to the use of radiation to sterilize the wood. They contend that the planned projects will seriously damage the forests and that exporting whole logs would do relatively little to create jobs and help the Russian economy.</p>
        <p>Sponsors of the project say they expect Washington regulatory agencies to approve the technique for use in controlling pests in wood products.</p>
        <p>They even claim a potential environmental benefit: radiation treatments could substitute for the fumigation of wood chips with methyl bromide, which is often  used on chips exported to the United States from countries like Chile and New Zealand. Use of methyl bromide is being phased out because its emissions damage  the atmosphere's protective ozone layer, a major environmental concern.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 1, 1996, Thursday</p>
        <p>An article on Tuesday about proposed timber imports from Russia referred incorrectly to a Federal agency that issued a grant for a feasibility study of logging old-growth forests in Siberia. It is the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, not the Trade and Development Administration; it is an independent agency, not a part of the Commerce Department.</p>
