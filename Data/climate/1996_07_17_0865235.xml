        <p>For the first time, the United States will seek a binding international agreement to reduce the kinds of air pollution, chiefly from burning fossil fuels, that threaten to warm the global climate, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Endorsing the view that the buildup of so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide, is probably already beginning to warm the planet, the Administration will urge the world's nations to adopt, by the end of next year, "realistic, verifiable and binding" targets for reversing the trend.</p>
        <p>Although the Administration has devised no specific target or timetable, its position signals a more aggressive campaign against climate change than the voluntary measures it endorsed in the past, and puts it on a course that promises to be politically difficult.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists praised the new approach, but officials of the energy industry reacted skeptically, although they said the impact of the plan would depend on the specific goals, which have not been spelled out.</p>
        <p>The United States, with its huge appetite for energy, burns more fossil fuels than any other country in the world and its output of greenhouse gases has continued to rise despite conservation measures. Proposals for the stringent measures that would be required to reduce emissions have been politically explosive.</p>
        <p>"This is a big deal," said Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, in a telephone interview from Geneva. On Wednesday he is scheduled to present the American position at a negotiating session among some 150 nations who signed the 1992 treaty on climate change.</p>
        <p>"Saying that we want to have a target that is binding is a clear indication that the United States is very serious about taking steps and leading the rest of the world," he said. "We will be getting more and more specific as the next year and a half rolls through."</p>
        <p>The Geneva talks are a prelude to a conference in Tokyo late next year where  the signers of the treaty plan to set forth the next steps in heading off worldwide climate change.</p>
        <p>The Administration would have preferred to wait until after the election before introducing tougher measures, but the diplomatic timetable would not allow that.</p>
        <p>In the treaty, negotiated in Rio de Janeiro during the Bush Administration, industrial countries set a non-binding goal of limiting emissions of greenhouse  gases by 2000 to the levels that prevailed in 1990. But the United States and most other countries are unlikely to meet that goal, and have since conceded that even deeper cuts in pollution are needed.</p>
        <p>In remarks prepared for delivery by Mr. Wirth on Wednesday, the United States rejects some proposals for steep and immediate cuts in pollution, such as the 20 percent cut within a decade that is being sought by small island nations fearful of being swamped by rising oceans as the planet warms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth will call that goal unrealistic, given the economic disruption that would occur if energy consumption were restricted so sharply. A copy of his prepared text was obtained by The New York Times today.</p>
        <p>He will also say that the United States wants flexibility to allow every country to meet the new targets in whatever way seems best to each government, and he signaled that the Administration intends to use market-based approaches,  like the trading of pollution permits, to help its industries do so in whatever  fashion they deem most efficient.</p>
        <p>Those positions seemed intended to deflect some of the political fallout from industry groups that have strongly opposed strict new measures to combat global  warming. The Administration in the past has adopted purely voluntary approaches, which have cut the growth in pollution but have failed to actually reduce emissions.</p>
        <p>John Schlaes, executive director of an industry group that opposes quick action to head off global warming, said that the key to the Administration's proposals would lie in details of the timing and extent of any emission reductions that are to be sought. His group, the Global Climate Coalition, is made up of oil, coal and electric companies and industries that use large amounts of energy.</p>
        <p>"Any kind of binding target, without doing the appropriate analysis and assessment, and then having a dialogue with the American public, doesn't make sense," he said in a telephone interview from Geneva, where he is observing the  negotiations.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups generally reacted positively to the Administration's position, although not all of them favor the market-based approach that Mr. Wirth mentioned.</p>
        <p>"It shows that the Administration is serious about this issue," said Michael  Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist who is a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. "It shows that they have accepted the judgment of the scientific community that climate change is happening and that something has to be done about it."</p>
        <p>In his prepared remarks, Mr. Wirth calls for quick action, not decades of delay, and for concrete measures, not vague promises, in the binding measures that would be negotiated in time for the meeting scheduled in Tokyo at the end of next year.</p>
        <p>"We are not interested in grand rhetorical goals that are impossible to realize," he says in his speech. "We want the negotiations to focus on outcomes  that are real and achievable."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth and other senior leaders are expected to issue a joint statement of policy on Thursday, joined by many nations, and a key test for the Administration is the extent to which its views are incorporated into that statement.</p>
        <p>Although his statement is cautious about what steps to take next, it is unequivocal in calling the efforts to date a failure. "We have to do better," it says bluntly.</p>
        <p>The Administration had held its negotiating stance close to the vest in recent weeks, officials said, partly to avoid heavy criticism from industries that contend that acting precipitously will do economic damage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth said today that those critics, who have also attacked the scientific work supporting the theory of global warming, are "bent upon destroying" the climate treaty.</p>
