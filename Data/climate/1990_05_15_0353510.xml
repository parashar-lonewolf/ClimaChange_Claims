        <p>LEAD: Efforts are faltering to limit population growth in developing countries, and the 1990's will see the greatest increase in human numbers of any decade, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities says in its latest annual survey on the world's population.</p>
        <p>Efforts are faltering to limit population growth in developing countries, and the 1990's will see the greatest increase in human numbers of any decade, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities says in its latest annual survey on the world's population.</p>
        <p>In the report made public today, the agency predicted that the world's population, now estimated at 5.3 billion, would reach 6.25 billion by the end of this century, nearly the equivalent of adding a new China.</p>
        <p>With the growth faster than expected, the agency survey said the world's population will stabilize at the end of the 21st century at 11.3 billion rather than the 10.2 billion it previously forecast. It warned that without more vigorous efforts to control growth, worldwide population might increase to about 14 billion before it stabilized.</p>
        <p>The problem is not in the industrial world, where rates of population increase have declined. The report said the average birth rate in industrial countries is 1.9 children per woman, below the ''replacement level'' figure, with the mean in Western Europe at 1.58 children per woman.</p>
        <p>With more than 90 percent of the increase concentrated in developing countries, the report says that continuing fast population growth will lead to greater numbers of poor and hungry people. It also means increased damage to the environment from the growing pressure of people on land, forests and water supplies, and with the additional heat that more people create, the risk of climate change.</p>
        <p>Many More Using Birth Control</p>
        <p>''The choices of the next 10 years will decide whether the world population trebles or merely doubles before it finally stops growing; they will decide whether the pace of damage to the environment speeds up or slows down,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, the Pakistani executive director of the United Nations agency, wrote.</p>
        <p>The United Nations says that family planning is rapidly spreading in the third world, with about half of couples practicing some form of modern contraception, compared with only 9 per cent in the early 1960's. Over the same period, the average number of children born to each fertile woman has declined from 6 to 3.9.</p>
        <p>In 1978, only 45 governments considered their population growth rates too high. By 1988 this figure had risen to 67, which accounted for 85 percent of the developing world's population.</p>
        <p>But the report noted that the population performance of developing countries varies, with signs that in some areas popular support for such measures is weakening. In southern Asia, about 34 percent of fertile women use modern contraceptives, while in Africa the figure is as low as 14 per cent. If China, where family planning is mandatory, were removed from the statistics, the proportion of families practicing birth control in the third world falls below 40 per cent.</p>
        <p>The report notes that many developing countries that significantly lowered their birth rates during the 1960's and 1970's now find further progress harder. These include India, the Philippines, Morocco, Tunisia and Colombia.</p>
        <p>Effect of Heavy Debt</p>
        <p>In some cases, progress is slackening because the burden of debt on poor countries has forced cuts in government spending on health and family planning services or because of declining support for smaller familes.</p>
        <p>The report said that while it was relatively easy to cut the fertility rate from 6 children per woman to 3.9, it is proving harder to reduce it from 3.9 to 2 because this ''requires a deeper change in desired family size.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations agency calls for a renewed international effort to reduce the average number of children born to each mother in the developing world from 3.9 to 3.2 by the end of the century, and if possible, to 2.73. This will require an increase in the number of women planning their families from 326 million to 535 million.</p>
