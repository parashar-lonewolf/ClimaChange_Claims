        <p>Long criticized for financing environmentally damaging projects, the World Bank today announced increased lending for population-control projects and forestry development, The bank's president, Barber B. Conable Jr., told a conference on the environment that the bank was committed to environmental issues and its commitment would not detract from its primary mission of global development. He spoke at the opening of the three-day conference, which is sponsored by the Japanese Government and the United Nations Environment Program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conable announced that the bank was establishing a gas development unit to promote use of natural gas because it was the least polluting of the fossil fuels. He said lending for population-control projects had amounted to more than $500 million in the last five years and that this would increase to more than $800 million between 1990 and 1992.</p>
