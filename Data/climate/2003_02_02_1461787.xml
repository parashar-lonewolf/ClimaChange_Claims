      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Re ''Suffolk Lacks Plan for Millstone Mishap'' [Jan. 26]: Representative Timothy Bishop proposes that the Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut be closed even though it is 12 miles from the closest point on Long Island (excluding Fishers Island). Last year, both Long Island and Connecticut suffered from severe shortages of electrical generating power. Where does Mr. Bishop propose we get the electric power? New fossil fuel plants that will increase greenhouse gases and produce acid rain? Where will these plants be placed when community after community does not want them?</p>
        <p>There have been many initiatives since the 1970's to reduce energy usage and yet the total amount of energy we use has increased. The increase is because of two factors, increasing population and increasing demand. Unless that changes , we will need more energy no matter how much our efficiencies in use increase.</p>

The increase is because of two factors, increasing population and increasing demand. Unless that changes , we will need more energy no matter how much our efficiencies in use increase.</p>
        <p>Renewable nonpetroleum sources like solar, wind and hydroelectric supplies are good ideas but even after more than 30 years of innovations, they supply only a small part of our energy needs.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has been supplying electricity without hurting one American for more than 45 years. Much safer reactors can and have been designed, and there should be a push to replace old reactors with newer ones. We would all like to have low-cost electricity that is completely safe, does not pollute, and comes from somewhere else. That is not likely to occur.</p>
