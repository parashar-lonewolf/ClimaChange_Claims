        <p>A report prepared for Congress by the Bush administration recommends continuing federal incentives for ethanol-fueled vehicles. But it does so despite finding that the program has failed to live up to either of its goals: reducing gasoline consumption and substantially increasing the use of alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>Virtually no vehicles built to run on either ethanol or gasoline are actually using ethanol, partly because fewer than 1 in 1,000 of the nation's service stations sell it, according to the report. Yet by manufacturing the dual-fuel vehicles, automakers receive credits that allow them to lower the average gas mileage of the rest of their fleets. This has allowed them to sell more gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the report says, American gasoline consumption increased by 473 million gallons last year, or 0.3 percent. The extra gas consumption will rise steeply in the coming years, as more vehicles are produced under the law, the report warns.</p>
        <p>Because burning gasoline produces large quantities of carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming, the 1988 law promoting ethanol use actually increased American emissions of global-warming gases by 1.46 million metric tons last year, the report says. This meant that the rule accounted for about a tenth of the increased output of such gases by American vehicles, which have become the fastest-growing source of global-warming gases.</p>
        <p>Rather than halt the program, the report recommends that more be done to increase the amount of ethanol actually burned by the dual-fuel vehicles, although it offers few specifics on how to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department declined to comment on the report, saying that it was still in draft form. A transportation official said that the text of the report had already been approved by the Office of Management and Budget. But some wording in the report might be changed before Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta sends it to Congress, the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mineta is traveling in Europe this week on business, so any action will not come until next week at the earliest, the official added.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department was supposed to report to Congress by September 2000, on the effectiveness of the law, which was intended to reduce American dependence on imported oil and encourage the use of alternative fuels like ethanol, a type of alcohol commonly made from corn. Caught between lobbying by corn farmers and automakers who favor the law and environmentalists who oppose it, the Clinton administration did not meet the deadline and left the issue to the Bush administration. A person critical of the ethanol law provided a copy of the report to The New York Times.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's conclusion represents the second big victory this month for the ethanol lobby, a powerful group of interests ranging from the National Corn Growers Association to ethanol distillers like Archer Daniels Midland. The administration decided last week to deny California's request for a waiver of regulations requiring that ethanol be used to produce clean-burning gasoline instead of other additives that are less expensive.</p>
        <p>The ethanol program has bipartisan backing among corn state officials. Marlys Popma, the executive director of the Republican Party of Iowa, said that supporting the broader use of ethanol was crucial to the electoral success of any presidential candidate seeking votes in the state's caucus every four years, the first of each presidential campaign. ''Ethanol is just hugely important in Iowa because it drives up the cost of corn,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And according to the state's Democratic governor, Tom Vilsack, ethanol ''is a lifeline, and it is a real ray of hope to family farmers that creates not only economic opportunity but preserves a way of life that's important to preserve.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are less kind to ethanol, and particularly the current incentive program for automakers. ''The Bush administration is proposing to extend at one fell swoop a loophole that increases our oil addiction, costs consumers billions of dollars a year, manipulates the farmers and increases global warming pollution,'' said Daniel Becker, the energy policy director of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker argued that the ethanol program was costly for consumers. The report projects that continuing the program will increase gasoline consumption by nine billion gallons from 2005 to 2008. At $1.70 a gallon, a typical price now, that works out to $15.3 billion, or nearly $4 billion a year, in extra gasoline costs, Mr. Becker said.</p>
        <p>The report also noted that few consumers even know when they have bought a vehicle with the $200 sensor for burning ethanol, for which the automakers do not charge extra.</p>
        <p>General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler have made 1.2 million dual-fuel vehicles, almost all of which are designed to burn either ethanol or gasoline. These include most Chrysler minivans and some Chevrolet S-10 pickups, Ford Taurus sedans and Ford Windstar minivans.</p>
        <p>This has allowed the automakers to reduce the average fuel economy of all vehicles they sell by five-tenths to nine-tenths of a mile per gallon. Foreign automakers have not made use of the law with the exception of Isuzu, which has begun selling some dual-fuel Isuzu Hombre pickup trucks made for it by General Motors, which owns 49 percent of Isuzu.</p>
        <p>The administration's conclusions come just after President Bush faced heavy criticism in Europe for not doing enough on global warming.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Bush said he would wait for a fuel-economy report in July by the National Academy of Sciences before deciding what to do about the gas mileage of automobiles. But Vice President Dick Cheney has endorsed the expanded use of ethanol.</p>
        <p>Fuel economy has become increasingly controversial in Washington. The House Appropriations Committee approved a transportation bill today that for the first time in six years does not include a prohibition on any toughening of fuel-economy standards for sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>The Republican majority in Congress had included such a provision since 1995 to prevent the Clinton administration from tightening these standards. But auto industry lobbyists said earlier this year that they did not need such a provision again this year because they trusted the Bush administration not to make any changes that would be technologically difficult to meet.</p>
        <p>The recommendations of the ethanol report will form the basis for a formal issuance of regulations by the Transportation Department later this year, after public comment is solicited.</p>
        <p>''Based on the results of this analysis, our preliminary conclusion is that continuation of the program should consider other actions that could improve the program and its chances of success,'' the report says. Without new regulations, the federal incentives would expire with the 2004 model year.</p>
        <p>All gasoline-powered vehicles can run on a mixture of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline, and this mixture is commonly sold in the Midwest. The dual-fuel vehicles are designed to run on nearly pure ethanol, which is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, and often marketed as E85. The administration report said only 101 of the 176,000 service stations in the United States sell nearly pure ethanol.</p>
        <p>Most of these service stations are in the Midwest; there is not a single one on the West Coast and there are only two on the East Coast, one in Virginia and one in South Carolina, according to the National Ethanol Vehicle Coalition, which is backed by corn growers. Oil companies dislike ethanol because it cannot be transported in most pipelines, requiring use of costlier rail cars or tanker trucks.</p>
        <p>''I'd be the first to admit that 99.5 percent of E85 vehicles don't use E85,'' said Phil Lampert, the coalition's executive director ''We've offered to set up stations, and we'll pay 100 percent of the cost to install E85 pumps, and they refuse.''</p>
