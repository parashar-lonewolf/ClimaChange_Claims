        <p>The searing heat wave that broiled California for two weeks is now baking the Middle West and is poised to bring 100-plus temperatures to New York City. Parts of Europe, too, have been experiencing an exceptionally hot summer. It's enough to make us wonder whether this is all the fault of global warming.</p>
        <p>For some areas, this is clearly not an ordinary summer. The National Climatic Data Center says that more than 50 cities in the continental United States have set new records for high temperature. Woodland Hills, Calif., outside Los Angeles, reported 21 consecutive days of temperatures exceeding 100 degrees, beating its old mark by six days. Still, it is not clear that this heat wave is as bad as the one that struck in the 1930's, setting many records that still stand. Nor is it demonstrably worse than in the 1950's, when a thermometer in downtown Los Angeles reportedly hit 130 degrees before blowing its top.</p>

        <p>The most one can say is that, in a gradually warming world, heat waves are likely to become more intense, frequent and longer lasting.</p>

        <p>Virtually all climate experts agree that it is impossible to attribute any single weather event -- a heat wave, drought or hurricane -- to global warming given the myriad factors that influence weather. The most one can say is that, in a gradually warming world, heat waves are likely to become more intense, frequent and longer lasting.</p>
        <p>Experts disagree on whether we have entered that realm already. The only certainty is that this hot spell will remind a lot of people that global warming is something to avoid.</p>
