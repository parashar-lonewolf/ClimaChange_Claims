        <p>The Bush administration's national energy policy is a glossy, picture-filled and comprehensive look at nearly every energy issue facing the United States today, but buried in the text is single stark conclusion: Excessive regulation has produced the worst energy crisis in decades.</p>
        <p>The report states at the outset that the nation faces an energy crisis, which it defines as a ''severe imbalance between supply and demand,'' because there has been no comprehensive policy that aims to increase domestic sources of energy. Energy problems have not been this bad since the 1970's, it says.</p>
        <p>But unlike the situation in the 1970's, when the nation grappled with an international oil boycott and the enemy was undoubtedly OPEC, the only identifiable villain in this report is the proliferation of domestic regulations, most of them aimed at protecting the environment. The administration views many federal regulations, especially as interpreted by the Clinton administration, as impeding industry's ability to find oil and natural gas and to build power plants and pipelines.</p>
        <p>''Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly burdensome,'' the report says. ''Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities, making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, price spikes and supply disruptions.''</p>
        <p>The 170-page policy paper devotes the bulk of its text, which reads in parts like a nonpolitical academic study, to examining how to reduce energy demand and cultivate clean sources of energy like wind and biomass, as agricultural, human and animal waste are known. The administration has emphasized that of its 105 specific recommendations, highlighted throughout the text with blue stars, 42 deal with conservation, efficiency and renewable energy sources, while only 35 address supplies of traditional energy sources.</p>
        <p>But the report's priorities are evident from the start. The first chart in the report, which illustrates how energy consumption is outpacing production, uses a mix of government statistics to make the future shortfall in production seem more acute than it might turn out to be.</p>
        <p>The chart uses estimates from the Energy Information Administration to show rising energy consumption over the next 20 years. But it relies on data from the Sandia National Laboratories to show production increasing at the same pace it did in the 1990's, when record low prices for electricity, natural gas and oil discouraged domestic production. The energy agency actually projects that energy production will rise at a much faster pace than it did in the 1990's because of a cyclical recovery in production.</p>
        <p>The policy recommendations with the most teeth, many of which the president has the power to implement without Congressional approval, suggest that the administration views increasing the supply and improving the infrastructure of oil, natural gas and nuclear power, as overwhelming priorities.</p>
        <p>Among the many regulations it has vowed to review, streamline, expedite or eliminate are land-use restrictions in the Rocky Mountains, lease stipulations for off-shore and coastal zones where oil and gas are plentiful and environmental reviews required when utilities want to retool power plants or oil companies want to expand refineries.</p>
        <p>The federal government controls 31 percent of the land in the United States, and too much of that is off-limits to energy companies, the report says. It calls the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where drilling is banned by Congress, ''the single most promising prospect in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Democrats and moderate Republicans have already lined up against the lifting of land and off-shore drilling restrictions elsewhere, making the prospect of short-term action in those areas unlikely.</p>
        <p>The regulatory rollback singles out the Environmental Protection Agency's procedures for approving the updating of power plants, especially those using coal, and refineries. Industry executives complain that the oversight, known as New Source Review, became too aggressive in the Clinton years, resulting in widespread litigation that actually discouraged companies from taking steps to clean up operations.</p>
        <p>The report also says that the Justice Department will be asked to review pending litigation with an eye to ending lawsuits against energy companies that did not comply with the Clinton administration's interpretations of environmental rules.</p>
        <p>The Bush team's regulatory focus has already prompted a backlash in Congress, where Democrats say the solution to energy shortages is investing in new energy efficiency technologies, not loosening environmental controls.</p>
        <p>''This report relies on the heavy polluters of the past and looks to ease important environmental protections,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee.</p>
        <p>Although the report reviews all the major ways the nation could reduce energy demand or boost supply of nonpolluting energy sources in the years to come, its recommendations in these areas are relatively weak. It proposes no specific targets for energy efficiency, offers only vague guidance on financing, and puts off decisions in many areas until new research is complete.</p>
