        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Preaching to Brazil From Hawaii'' (editorial, July 24) gives credence to the ill-founded rumors that ''Brazil is the world's third-largest creator of greenhouse gases, after the United States and the Soviet Union.'' Such rumors originated in a recent report from the World Resources Institute. Its figures regarding Brazil are plainly wrong.</p>
        <p>Recent data obtained by the Space Research Institute of Brazil, independently confirmed by NASA studies, indicate that:</p>
        <p>* Deforestation in the Amazon has been progressing at a near-constant rate since 1974 and not exponentially as predicted by the World Bank.</p>
        <p>* Average rate of deforestation from 1978 to 1989 is 21,800 square kilometers a year (2.2 million hectares). This rate of deforestation is four times less than the numbers used by the World Resources Institute report.</p>
        <p>* Total deforested area until 1989 was 394,000 square kilometers (93,000 early this century).</p>
        <p>* Deforestation in Rondonia and Para has declined considerably.</p>
        <p>* The contribution of deforestation in the Amazon to carbon dioxide emissions is estimated as 0.25 gigatons per year, about 3.7 percent (not 10.5 percent) of all CO#2 emissions.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian Government recognizes that the deforestation rate of Amazon forest is still too high, and is trying successfully to curtail it. The subsidies, tax incentives and special credits conducive to forest destruction have been stopped. However, millions of people live there who burn parts of the forest to convert it into subsistence agriculture land.</p>
        <p>Relocation of populations might be a future way to attract such people to other areas of the country, but Brazilians don't want to use the same argument used by some developed countries that such actions are not cost-effective. They are already acting, and a reforestation project in denuded areas in Carajas has been started.</p>
        <p>These efforts alone will not ''stabilize greenhouse gas emissions,'' as recommended by the Group of Seven in Houston. Deforestation in the Amazon contributes less than 4 percent to worldwide CO#2 emissions. Industrialized countries need to act too, e.g., by reducing fossil-fuel burning, which is responsible for some 60 percent of all CO#2 emissions. Only a concerted effort of industrialized and developing countries in this matter will lead to a solution.</p>
