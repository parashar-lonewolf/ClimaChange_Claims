      <block class="full_text">
        <p>George E. Pataki ran for governor in 1994 promising tax cuts, tougher criminal penalties, welfare reform and not much else. It was a conservative platform well suited to the year of the Gingrich revolution and it worked, as Mr. Pataki unseated Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.</p>
        <p>Times have changed, and so, it seems, has Mr. Pataki. His signature issues lost their political bite in an era of economic expansion, falling crime and plummeting welfare rolls.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Pataki is seeking a third term on a platform of increased spending on schools and medical care, as a friend to the labor unions that once vilified him, and as the governor who has delivered gun controls, penalties for hate crimes and, prospectively, an equal-rights law for gay people, which the Senate has promised to pass in December.</p>
        <p>In short, the governor is running in the Nov. 5 election as a liberal, although he would never use the word to describe himself. Critics on the right, like Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, say Mr. Pataki has become a counterfeit conservative. Critics on the left, including the Democratic challenger, H. Carl McCall, call him a counterfeit liberal.</p>
        <p>''He defies easy labeling as right, center or left,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist at the State University of New York at New Paltz, who is a Republican and a former Ulster County legislator. ''He's pragmatic, he's opportunistic and he's very shrewd, politically.''</p>
        <p>A review of Mr. Pataki's record reveals the paradox. He has lowered taxes but increased spending, increased aid to schools but challenged a court-ordered restructuring of school finance formulas, increased the open land under state protection but fallen short of his own goals on greenhouse gases. There are more jobs under his watch, but upstate New York is hurting economically. He has expanded access to health care, particularly for low-income families, but the mentally ill languish in adult homes and nursing homes.</p>
        <p>The governor's own words complicate the task of assessing his record. He declined to be interviewed for this article. But on many issues, he has set out on a fairly conservative course, then taken a turn to the left. Democrats complain that he has a habit of joining the parade midway through the march, then claiming to lead it.</p>
        <p>Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's communications director, said the governor had been consistent. ''There are basic principles that he believes in: tax cuts, controlling spending, reducing welfare, a tough approach on crime,'' Mr. McKeon said. ''He has always been a social moderate. He's pro-choice, he opposes discrimination in any form, and he's stood up against anti-immigrant policies.''</p>
        <p>What are often taken as changes in the governor's outlook are a product of changing times, Mr. McKeon said. ''We inherited a $5 billion deficit, and then later there were record surpluses,'' he said. ''The governor has worked hard to control the Legislature's impulse to spend more than we can afford. But the governor has always been eager, when the resources have become available, to put them into providing good services.''</p>
        <p>Still, much of Mr. Pataki's record begs the question: Should he be judged on what he proposed, or what he later agreed to? How many of his original stances are merely bargaining positions, as administration officials say, taken to hold back the Legislature's excesses?</p>
        <p>With those questions in mind, here is a review of Mr. Pataki's eight-year record in some major areas.</p>
        <p>Taxes and Spending</p>
        <p>Tax cuts were the central promise of Mr. Pataki's 1994 campaign and the signal achievement of his first term. The governor maintains that he has cut 19 different taxes 63 times, reducing taxes more than any other state.</p>
        <p>His opponents complain that New York's state and local taxes are the highest in the nation and that property taxes are rising fast.</p>
        <p>Both sides are right.</p>
        <p>''We've dropped from No. 1 in the nation, all the way down to No. 1 in the nation,'' said Brian Backstrom, president of Change New York, a conservative group.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers have eliminated the income tax on suburbanites who work in New York City, the tax on utility bills and the state sales tax on most clothing, among others. But the biggest state tax, the one Mr. Pataki cut most deeply, is the personal income tax. New Yorkers are paying 21 percent less than they would be paying if the law had been left as it was in 1994, a savings of more than $5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>But by another measure, known as the effective tax rate, income taxes have declined far less. In 1994, New Yorkers paid 4.95 percent of their incomes in state income tax. In 2001, it was 4.7 percent, because the prosperity of the intervening years greatly increased the share of income taxed at the highest rates.</p>
        <p>The income tax cuts also made the system more progressive -- that is, the lower the income, the greater the savings, proportionally. That was true of Mr. Pataki's original 1995 plan, and the Legislature pushed it further in that direction.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the whole array of tax cuts, they've been very significant, and they've been distributed in a way that benefits every taxpayer,'' said Carole E. Stone, Mr. Pataki's budget director.</p>
        <p>''There was a conscious decision made not to open the governor to the charge of doing a tax cut that favored the rich,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who, as a Pataki aide, helped plan the 1995 cuts.</p>
        <p>The second-biggest Pataki tax cut was the Star program, under which the state helps pay the property tax bills school districts charge to homeowners, saving them $2.8 billion a year. But conservative critics say Star has masked fast-rising school taxes.</p>
        <p>''School districts have probably taken back something in the range of one-third of the total value of Star, by raising taxes faster than they otherwise would have,'' said Robert B. Ward, director of research at the Business Council of New York State.</p>
        <p>Critics, liberal and conservative, argue that Star was less a tax cut than a popular way to redistribute money, particularly to suburban school districts. Frank Mauro of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute also argues that renters got none of the benefit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stone said such criticism is unfair. ''Looking back, it's hard to know, would taxes have behaved differently had Star not occurred,'' she said. ''The fact is, the homeowners got a real benefit, and that many seniors now are not paying school property taxes.''</p>
        <p>Despite the cuts, state tax collections have risen under Mr. Pataki, driven mostly by rising incomes and spending, though not as fast as they did nationally. People and businesses are expected to pay $43 billion in New York State taxes and fees this fiscal year, an inflation-adjusted increase of 9 percent since the governor took office, compared with a national average of about 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Local taxes also rose during the same period. According to a 1999 Census Bureau study, New York and Connecticut were roughly tied for the nation's highest combined state and local taxes.</p>
        <p>The administration says that if it were not for Mr. Pataki's tax cuts, state taxes would be almost $14 billion a year higher, a figure that independent analysts call exaggerated. Mr. McMahon puts the net savings at $9.5 billion a year.</p>
        <p>As for spending, as Mr. Golisano often notes, New York State's budget is $90 billion, up from $62 billion when Mr. Pataki took office. That is a 21 percent increase after inflation, somewhat below the national average, mostly to cover increases in Medicaid and education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki was the first governor in memory to save a significant amount for a rainy day, but most of that surplus was used on large spending increases in the last two budgets as the election approached, leaving a glum outlook for next year.</p>
        <p>New York is the most deeply indebted state; it has been for decades.</p>
        <p>Health Care</p>
        <p>There is no clearer example of Mr. Pataki's beginning as a conservative, and then turning sharply to the left, than in health care.</p>
        <p>In his first term he cut Medicaid payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and reduced state regulation of hospitals. But he has since given money back to those same institutions in stages, culminating in a $1.8 billion deal struck in January.</p>
        <p>What that leaves as Mr. Pataki's main health care legacy is a broad expansion of coverage for the uninsured -- the most significant increase in government-subsidized medical care to be found anywhere in the country, in a state that already ranked as the most generous.</p>
        <p>New York's Children's Health Insurance Program covers more than 500,000 children, its Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program helps more than 300,000 older people pay for prescription drugs and, after the Sept. 11 attack, the state enrolled 400,000 people in temporary ''disaster relief Medicaid.''</p>
        <p>New programs to help low- and moderate-income adults get insurance have been slow to start, but they cover more than 100,000 people.</p>
        <p>Robert Hinckley, deputy health commissioner, sees no contradiction in the Pataki record. ''All of this is a natural outgrowth of the things he wanted to do, to make the system more efficient and provide better services to people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has disappointed business groups by agreeing to impose mandates on private insurance, like infertility treatment, which employers say will drive up costs for everyone.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Pataki has been generous to health care generally, he has not been for the mentally ill. He continued shrinking the state's mental hospitals to save money, but the discharged residents were far sicker than those released in the early years of deinstitutionalization. At the same time, he cut the state's investment in community-based treatment for the mentally ill.</p>
        <p>As a result, thousands more mental patients are warehoused in adult homes and nursing homes, where they are often dangerously neglected, as documented in a series of articles this year by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Education</p>
        <p>Year after year, Mr. Pataki proposed little or no increase in aid to schools and then, in negotiations with the Legislature, agreed to large increases. State aid for school operations rose from under $10 billion to more than $14 billion, and construction aid also climbed steeply.</p>
        <p>An ambitious agreement with the Legislature, to pay for prekindergarten classes and other early-childhood programs, has stalled. Mr. Pataki at first lauded the effort, then tried to kill it to cut costs, postponing the final phases indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has eliminated the longstanding practice of giving slightly less aid per student to New York City than the statewide average. Yet he vigorously contested a lawsuit that challenged financing for urban districts. When a Manhattan judge ruled against the state, issuing a scathing catalog of the New York City schools' inadequacies, Mr. Pataki appealed and won.</p>
        <p>The appellate panel found that the state was not obliged to provide more than a middle-school education, a ruling the governor at first welcomed. Under political pressure, he recently disavowed the notion that an eighth-grade education was sufficient. The case is now headed for New York's highest court.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature gave the city a $400 million loan to raise teachers' salaries, winning him the teachers' union's endorsement. And after years of wrangling, state lawmakers agreed this year to something Mr. Pataki had long sought, mayoral control of New York City's schools.</p>
        <p>How all this affects student performance is difficult to assess. Test scores have risen a bit, but some experts give more credit to the higher standards set by school officials and the State Board of Regents, over which the governor has no control.</p>
        <p>Toward higher education, Mr. Pataki has been far less friendly. He raised tuition at public colleges sharply in 1995, and tried to raise it again in 1997. It remains, however, near the national average.</p>
        <p>In his first year, Mr. Pataki also cut state aid to the colleges and tuition aid to low-income students. Adjusted for inflation, both are now about the same as in 1994. He tried to cut tuition aid several more times, but the Legislature refused.</p>
        <p>The Environment</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's oratory on environmental issues has exceeded his performance in all areas but conservation, partly because he has promised so much.</p>
        <p>He announced that he would impose the nation's toughest restrictions on power plant emissions, a major source of smog, acid rain and greenhouse gases. Three years later, there are no regulations, and draft versions show that the cuts in emissions will not be quite as deep as Mr. Pataki had promised.</p>
        <p>He appointed a task force on greenhouse gases last year, directing it to come up with plans to make New York the national leader in combating global warming. After aiming for a June release date, the task force disagreed over a consultant's bold recommendations, and postponed its decisions until after the election.</p>
        <p>While he has gotten a very resistant Metropolitan Transportation Authority to promise to convert 500 of its more than 3,000 buses from diesel to cleaner-burning natural gas, many of the nation's other urban transit agencies have done more.</p>
        <p>''He's created this super-environmentalist image, always comparing himself to Teddy Roosevelt, but the truth just isn't on the same level,'' said Val Washington, executive director of the group Environmental Advocates.</p>
        <p>One area where environmentalists are unanimous in praising the governor is wilderness preservation. He has struck deals with private landowners and conservation groups to keep hundreds of thousands of acres undeveloped.</p>
        <p>''He's been a terrific governor in the sense of conservation,'' said John Adams, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''You couldn't ask for someone who has done more or cares more in terms of land protection, parks, wildlife.''</p>
        <p>To protect New York City's Catskills watershed, Mr. Pataki, over local opposition, struck a deal that environmentalists praised, though they now question its effectiveness.</p>
        <p>And after years of refusing to take a position, last year he endorsed dredging the Hudson River to remove PCB's, helping persuade the Bush administration to order it done.</p>
        <p>But he also reduced the number of environmental conservation workers monitoring compliance with the laws, and the department reduced fines against polluters. Critics argue he is easy on corporate polluters, but the administration contends it achieves more through cooperative action.</p>
        <p>Cleanup of toxic waste sites has been a problem; the state's program ran out of money last year, and a dispute over renewing it is unresolved. Mr. Pataki wants to expand the program to include many more sites, but environmentalists and legislators are divided over his proposals to reduce the costs paid by industry and to ease cleanup standards in some cases.</p>
        <p>''Nationally, he has to be considered among the top governors, maybe the top,'' said Mr. Adams, one of the environmentalists closest to Mr. Pataki.</p>
        <p>Ms. Washington said: ''The governor hasn't been bad, but there has been a series of hints that something great was about to happen, and then it doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Economic Development</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Pataki, New York has gained 600,000 jobs, and in recent years has matched the national growth rate for the first time in decades.</p>
        <p>Yet upstate New York's economy has continued to atrophy. While the New York City metropolitan region gained 1 million people from 1990 to 2000, Buffalo lost 35,000 people, Rochester 12,000 and Syracuse 17,000.</p>
        <p>Much of the job growth of Mr. Pataki's tenure stemmed from a roaring stock market. Similarly, much of the state's current trouble can be traced to the weakening of that market, and to the World Trade Center attack. What a governor can do about all that is debatable.</p>
        <p>Business groups say Governor Pataki has reduced the regulatory burden on businesses, eliminated hundreds of rules and won changes in the worker's compensation law that lowered employers' insurance premiums by more than 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has also persuaded some large companies -- like I.B.M., which built a major computer chip plant in East Fishkill -- to remain in New York or to locate there, offering grants, loans and tax breaks. This year, a consortium of computer chip makers agreed to build a new research center in Albany.</p>
        <p>But critics like Mr. Golisano say Mr. Pataki's economic policies have been too focused on giveaways to major corporations, while neglecting small businesses that are the core of the state's economy and job growth.</p>
        <p>In the last three years, the governor has adopted a legislative plan to lure companies to blighted areas by declaring them Empire Zones and providing tax breaks, and he has promoted high-tech research, most notably by creating ''Centers of Excellence'' at state university campuses. He has also seized on gambling as a form of economic development, finally winning passage last year of a law allowing up to six Indian casinos and putting slot-type machines at race tracks. The effectiveness of all these measures remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>Ethics and Reform</p>
        <p>After the 1994 election, Mr. Pataki created two funds to pay for transition and inaugural expenses. Promising a new era of openness and rectitude, he said the funds would abide by campaign contribution limits and make their records public.</p>
        <p>They did neither. The records were released three years later under an Assembly subpoena. They showed that corporations had given more than allowed under the campaign finance law, the funds had paid large bonuses to Pataki aides, and they raised three times as much as the Pataki camp had said.</p>
        <p>No laws were broken, but the promise of a new day was.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if the ethical lapses have been any better or worse than previous administrations,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''But the governor hasn't done anything to make it better, and there has been a troubling habit of secrecy.''</p>
        <p>Ethical questions have arisen about Mr. Pataki's practice of giving paid speeches (a practice he hid for almost a year); his 1995 and 1996 trips to Hungary, which were indirectly paid for by Philip Morris and other corporations with business before the state; and the millions of dollars raised by his campaigns from companies doing business with the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golisano has reminded voters that a Pataki fund-raiser was accused of trying to trade paroles for campaign contributions. The fund-raiser was convicted of covering up his actions and three Parole Board officials were convicted of lying to investigators about the affair. A jury deadlocked on the pay-for-parole charge.</p>
        <p>Several people close to the governor have made a great deal of money from their connections to him, and Democrats have frequently questioned the governor's habit of appointing political allies, friends and family members to government jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKeon said that Mr. Pataki had reduced the number of patronage appointments a governor makes. As for political connections of the appointees, lobbyists and contractors, he said: ''There's always going to be cynics, and there's no controlling that. The people appointed by the governor have met the highest standards.''</p>
        <p>Questions have also been raised about the governor's wife, Libby, who earns $200,000 a year as a part-time consultant to several business interests, including Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics magnate, who is a major financial backer of Mr. Pataki's.</p>
        <p>On government reform, Mr. Pataki has advocated an initiative and referendum system, but did not push the Legislature on the issue until this year, as he sought the backing of Independence Party leaders. He has proposed new campaign finance restrictions and term limits, but has not worked hard to promote either. His campaign this year violates his own 1994 pledge to limit himself to two terms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has opposed attempts by the lobbying commission, good-government groups and legislative leaders to to change a major loophole that allows lobbying for state contracts to go unreported.</p>
        <p>In 1996 and 2000, Mr. Pataki worked to exclude insurgent Republican candidates from New York's presidential primary ballot, then said he regretted the effort. He lowered some of New York's notorious ballot access barriers after the 1996 primary, and tried again in 2000, but that effort has stalled.</p>
