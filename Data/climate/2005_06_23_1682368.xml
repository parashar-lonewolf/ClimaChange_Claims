      <block class="full_text">
        <p>George W. Bush on Wednesday made the first presidential visit to a nuclear plant in 26 years, and declared, ''It is time for this country to start building nuclear power plants again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush laid out steps that he said the government should take to help. None of those proposals were new, but his venue was: an office building next to the twin-unit Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant here, about 50 miles southeast of the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush offered his thanks to those who showed him around, especially control-room technicians, ''for being so gracious and kind and taking time to explain all the dials and gauges.''</p>
        <p>''I can play like I understand what I saw,'' he said, drawing chuckles from an enthusiastic crowd of about 300, including state and local officials, executives of nuclear power organizations and plant workers.</p>
        <p>The president's 45-minute speech touched on other elements that the White House groups under the heading of economic security, including his proposals on Social Security, asbestos litigation, medical malpractice, education and foreign trade. But nuclear power was the focus, more than three decades after the industry last ordered a nuclear plant whose construction was not subsequently canceled.</p>
        <p>The last president to visit a nuclear plant was Jimmy Carter, who went to Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania on April 1, 1979, the fifth day of the major accident there. Urging calm, Mr. Carter, a veteran of the nuclear Navy, wore disposable booties that day because of contamination on the floors. On Wednesday, Mr. Bush wore a hard hat but ordinary clothes; the areas he visited -- the control room and the turbine hall, where steam is converted into mechanical energy and then electricity -- are normally clean.</p>
        <p>Among those in the audience for Mr. Bush's speech was Nils J. Diaz, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who said, ''The memories people have are Jimmy Carter intervening in a moment of crisis,'' whereas Mr. Bush ''is intervening in something he believes is very important to the country.''</p>
        <p>The president emphasized a proposal he made in April for government-financed ''risk insurance'' to help reassure investors in new nuclear plants that they would not be hurt if lawsuits or government delays held up a project. Leaning over a lectern as if to make a confidential point, he said, ''You don't want to go out and build a plant, spend all the money and have the license jerked at the last minute.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that since the United States stopped ordering reactors, France had built 56 of them; China, he said, is working on 8. He contrasted oil, whose consumption in the United States grows even as the nation's production of it declines, with an energy source that he called ''completely domestic,'' though in fact the business of designing new reactors, and making fuel for existing ones, is now mostly globalized.</p>
        <p>Any aid for the nuclear industry faces stiff opposition. Jim Riccio, an energy expert at Greenpeace, said that despite much talk that nuclear power was becoming economically viable, reactors were still one-third too expensive to be competitive. Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, said subsidies for new reactors would soak up all the money that should go into solar or wind power, or into efficiency investments.</p>
        <p>As the president toured the plant here, back in Washington senators continued work on a broad energy bill. A day after adopting a provision asking companies to voluntarily reduce the emissions that scientists blame for global warming, the Senate voted 60 to 38 to defeat an amendment that would have imposed mandatory limits. The amendment, sponsored by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, would have capped carbon emissions by 2010 at levels that prevailed in 2000.</p>
        <p>The Senate then adopted a resolution, sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, expressing support for future mandatory limits.</p>
        <p>The Senate also agreed to give Washington clear authority to override states' objections to the location of liquefied natural gas terminals. By 52 to 45, it rejected an amendment that would have allowed governors to veto federal permits for such terminals because of state concerns about safety or environmental harm.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the proposal said states should have a greater say because of the possibility of terrorism or tanker spills.</p>
        <p>''We're not talking about the siting of a neighborhood ballpark or a Wal-Mart,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. ''It's a states' rights issue, plain and simple.''</p>
        <p>But opponents said that deciding where to put the terminals was a federal matter, because imports would help meet a growing demand for natural gas.</p>
        <p>A vote on the entire energy bill is expected by the end of the week. The House has already passed its own version.</p>
