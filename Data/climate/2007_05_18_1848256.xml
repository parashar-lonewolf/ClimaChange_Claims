        <p>The chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Anthony R. Coscia, called on his agency yesterday to reduce carbon emissions at its ports and airports by 80 percent over the long term. That goal, he said, could be met by using geothermal energy to heat and cool buildings, installing fuel cells and harnessing wind and solar energy. Equipment used to service aircraft at airports could use electricity and alternative fuels. The strategy, said Mr. Coscia, above, would help reduce global warming and benefit the renewable energy industry.</p>
