        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-19</p>
        <p>Asian Economic Stresses May Cause Political Waves</p>
        <p>As its juggernaut stumbles, Asian frustrations could cause upheavals in politics and social life. The threat is causing apprehension in many countries. 1</p>
        <p>Czech Premier Steps Down</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus announced his Government's resignation, after a call to do so by President Vaclav Havel. Mr. Klaus, a noted reform economist, lost standing with a financial scandal in his party. 19</p>
        <p>OPEC Plans More Output</p>
        <p>OPEC raised its oil production ceiling by 10 percent, despite fears within the group that the increase might hurt prices. But the increase is not as big as it appears, because the previous ceiling was widely violated. 5</p>
        <p>Indian Parties Try to Regroup</p>
        <p>India's main political parties maneuvered feverishly to cobble together a coalition to replace the 14-party Government that collapsed on Friday. 9</p>
        <p>Political Surprise in Taiwan</p>
        <p>Taiwan's governing party suffered surprising losses in local elections. 12</p>
        <p>The Divide in Kyoto</p>
        <p>A divisive issue at the global warming talks opening Monday will be burden-sharing between rich and poor. But there is some hope that the issue might be resolved. 6</p>
        <p>Challenge to Congo's Leader</p>
        <p>Six months in power, Laurent Kabila's Government faced its first direct challenge, in shootouts that killed as many as 18 people. 15</p>
        <p>Germany's Melting Pot</p>
        <p>Almost 9 percent of Germany's population are foreigners, but Germany resists talk of a melting pot. 3</p>
        <p>NATIONAL 20-43</p>
        <p>Plans to Test Medicines In Children Draws Dissent  Opposition has erupted over a proposal by President Clinton that would require drug companies to test their products in children before putting new medicines on the market. Mr. Clinton says such studies will improve health care for children, but drug companies say the proposal would needlessly put thousands of children at risk. 1</p>
        <p>Who Gets Water in the West</p>
        <p>From the Colorado River to California's Central Valley, water from the subsidized farms and playgrounds created by Government irrigation is being diverted to nearly extinct wildlife, long-forgotten Indian tribes and cities that barely existed when the big dams and canals were built. 1</p>
        <p>Trucks Favored by the Law</p>
        <p>If most sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and mini-vans were classified as cars, they would violate Federal standards for pollution and gasoline consumption aimed at protecting the environment and conserving energy. Instead, lawmakers have granted special favors to makers and buyers of light trucks. 1</p>
        <p>A Cookie Jar on Wheels</p>
        <p>There has never been a human fatality or serious mauling by a black bear in Yosemite National Park. There have been, however, 600 car break-ins this year, causing over $500,000 in damage, from bears drawn by careless campers who leave food on seats and in trunks. 20</p>
        <p>Gay Foster Parent Debate</p>
        <p>A Texas child welfare supervisor's decision to remove a baby boy from the care of a foster parent who is a lesbian has focused attention on a 118-year-old state statute that makes homosexual activity a crime. 20</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION 45-50</p>
        <p>Investment Fraud Spreads</p>
        <p>Investment fraud is spreading across the country, with New York at its center, according to law enforcement officials and securities regulators. The fraud involves the sale of marginal companies' low-priced stocks to amateur investors who are besieged by telephone sales calls. While the victims are usually told that the company in question is the next Microsoft or McDonald's, the shares they buy often turn out to be worthless. 1</p>
        <p>Perilous Cyclists</p>
        <p>The sight of restaurant deliverymen on beat-up bicycles riding on sidewalks or going the wrong way on one-way streets is increasingly common. And the frequent near misses and occasional, harrowing accidents, like the death of a 68-year-old pedestrian who was struck on an Upper West Side sidewalk by a deliveryman, illuminate the conflicting demands of speed and safety. 45</p>
        <p>Brooklyn's Woodlands</p>
        <p>Brooklyn's last forest, which is in Prospect Park, is being restored to the ''rich, dark, cool'' woodland envisioned by the park's designers, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. The project includes rustic bridges, three waterfalls and thousands of new plants, trees and shrubs. 47</p>
        <p>OBITUARIES 52-53</p>
        <p>Richard R. Ruopp</p>
        <p>A president emeritus of Bank Street College and a specialist in early childhood education and day care who adapted up-to-date technologies for the classroom, was 65. 53</p>
        <p>Jack Berry</p>
        <p>A Tennessee-born New York businessman and the last of the Florida citrus barons who transformed the industry in the 1960's, was 81. 52</p>
