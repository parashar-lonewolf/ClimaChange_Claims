        <p>Nonblooming Orchids</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>Last year we purchased Phalaenopsis and Cattleya orchids in Hawaii, and none have flowered since being purchased, though the leaves look healthy. But a Phalaenopsis we purchased locally has bloomed. Why?  -- Barbara Kahn, Ann Arbor, Mich.</p>
        <p>A.  It is not uncommon for plants moved to a different environment to take their time adjusting, and Hawaiian orchids moved to Michigan have had a big change. "Their cycle of growth seems to get mixed up," said Ronald Ciesinski, owner of Taylor Orchids in Monroe, Mich. His theory, based on 30 years of growing orchids, is that a climate change makes them miss their seasonal cycles. They need time to adjust, so he counseled patience and giving them a summer vacation outdoors. To encourage a new flowering cycle, feed them a 30-10-10 fertilizer now and just before Labor Day with a 10-30-20. Beautiful Weepers</p>
        <p>Q. My terrace needs a focal point. A friend suggested a weeping tree in a tub. Do you agree? -- Deirdre Glovr, Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>A.  There is no more striking plant sculpture than a weeping tree, but avoid weeping willows, rapid growers that grab too much space. Instead, choose such handsome plants as the weeping blue Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica Glauca Pendula), the weeping Nootka false cyprus (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis pendula), the weeping willowleaf pear (Pyrus salicifolia pendula), the weeping Siberian pea (Caragana arborescens pendula), or any weeping flowering crab apples or cherries.</p>
        <p>These weepers may be controlled with pruning and will grow in a terrace tub, preferably about 16 inches in each dimension. Indoor Water Garden</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I have a 10-gallon fish tank.  Please advise on setting</p>

        <p>up</p>
        <p>as</p>
        <p>a "garden</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>" -- Samuel Kramer, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A.  An indoor water garden is as easily developed, but first add a fluorescent aquarium growth light, more easily controlled than the sun. Provide an anchor for your plants, with 2 inches of coarse aquarium gravel.  Choose handsome underwater species, combining different shapes and textures as you might in a garden. Bob Scherer, the owner of the aquatic nursery S. Scherer &amp; Sons in Northport, L.I., suggests such submerged species as Cabomba caroliniana, which has dark green lacy-looking leaves; Myriophyllum, with its fine, dark, hairlike foliage; and Vallisneria americana, whose ribbonlike foliage is a medium green. Underwater plants are at aquatic nurseries and tropical-fish stores.</p>
