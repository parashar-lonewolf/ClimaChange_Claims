        <p>Your article about Long Island's looming trash disposal crisis (''A Long, Long Haul From the Curb,'' Dec. 4) and subsequent letters emphasized the need for solutions beyond long-hauling waste to a landfill. But substantial waste will still remain for disposal even after recycling. We need to focus on where to dispose of this post-recycled waste.</p>
        <p>An evaluation of the comparative benefits of on-island waste-to-energy conversion over long hauling to a landfill reveals that for each ton processed on Long Island, we would achieve a savings of 630 pounds of greenhouse gases as well as a savings of one barrel of fossil fuel equivalents. In addition, overall emissions would be reduced, an additional 40 to 60 pounds of metals would be recycled for each ton processed, there would be a reduction in truck traffic, and costs to municipalities would be contained or reduced.</p>
        <p>Any waste-to-energy project considered for Long Island could incorporate design specifics that offer the potential for additional resource improvements through green building practices, alternate fuels and vehicles, and possibly additional improvements in recycling.</p>
