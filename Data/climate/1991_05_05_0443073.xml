        <p>The article "Out of Love and Necessity, Cars Boom on L.I."  [ March 31 ]  points up what is going to become an unprecedented problem in the not-too-distant future. This problem, pointed out by a British land-planning expert who visited Long Island last year, is the eventual need to tear down a great deal of Long Island's housing and build new, more densely compacted housing units.</p>
        <p>The reason for this will be forced reduction in the use of private automobiles as world oil reserves are used up and the price of fuel inevitably soars, and as the world agrees to cut back on fuel use to control the overheating of our planet by the "greenhouse effect." Mass transit will have to replace a substantial portion of private-car use, and it can be effective only if people live closer to the transportation lines than they now do, on average, on Long Island.</p>
        <p>President Bush and his advisor, John Sununu, are fighting national and local efforts to reduce highway traffic. The President actually is calling for more highway funding and opposing significant mass-transit expansion. Local government, too often tied to shortsighted real-estate interests, generally opposes multiple-unit housing and encourages single-family housing, with more or widened roads to carry the extra traffic.</p>
        <p>So we are still moving in a direction we know is the wrong one, and the eventual price for this folly is rising every year. The attitude in Washington and at many local levels is the old one of, "After me, the flood." FREDERICK S. LIGHTFOOT  Greenport</p>
