        <p>LEAD:</p>
        <p>A BIT OF HISTORY</p>
        <p>A BIT OF HISTORY</p>
        <p>An open house celebrating George Washington's birthday will be held from 2 to 4 P.M. today at the recently restored Jacob Purdy House in White Plains. It is the first of a series of events planned ''to acquaint people with a bit of history in their midst that is largely unrecognized,'' said John W. Harrington, president of the White Plains Historical Society, which acquired the building in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>''We have documentation that General Washington spent seven days in the house in 1776, before and during the Battle of White Plains, and six weeks in the summer of 1778,'' he said. Purdy was a captain in the militia and his 123-acre farm was a convenient meeting place and rallying point for the military.</p>
        <p>The house, on two acres at 60 Park Avenue, was built in 1794 and remained in the Purdy family until 1963. ''The city moved it for us from a nearby urban-renewal area to its present site in 1973, saving it from demolition and restoring the exterior with H.U.D. funds,'' Mr. Harrington said.</p>
        <p>Restoration of the interior was completed by the historical society last fall at a cost of $85,000. International Business Machines contributed $25,000, the rest was raised from private donations. All the original wide-plank flooring and most of the wainscoting was preserved, along with the mantel in the main parlor, where Washington held his conferences. Funds must now be raised for appropriate antique furnishings. ''The house was empty and badly vandalized when we got it,'' Mr. Harrington said. ''It had been a rooming house and for a time, a brothel.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Holden Jr., a local lawyer, will portray General Washington and act as host, while a number of costumed hostesses will serve gingerbread made from Martha Washington's recipe and a selection of teas and coffees. Five costumed militiamen will fire a musket volley for the raising of the American flag and the Washington Headquarters flag - a solid blue field with 13 white stars.</p>
        <p>A special feature of the afternoon will be a harpsichord performance by Robert Canfield. The all-Early American program includes the Federal Overture by Benjamin Carr, written in 1794; Washington's March; the Marseilles Hymn; Carmagnole; Ca Ira; and Yankee Doodle.</p>
        <p>To reach the house, proceed up Church Street opposite Macy's and turn left on Park Avenue to the red farmhouse. Everything is free, including refreshments.</p>
        <p>ENSOR SELF-PORTRAIT</p>
        <p>An exhibition called ''James Ensor: Self-Portrait in Prints'' opens today at the Neuberger Museum of the State University of New York at in Purchase, running through April 15. Devised by a student, Carrie Brewster, as her senior project in art, the show contains two lithographs and 14 etchings, all in black and white and all modest in size - up to about 20 inches - and all self-portraits.</p>
        <p>One is called ''The Entry of Christ Into Brussels in 1889'' and is indicative of the Belgian artist's perception of himself as persecuted by the critics. ''Demons Tormenting Me'' has a tombstone in the background with his name on it, illustrating his preoccupation with his own death. He died in 1949 at the age of 80.</p>
        <p>Museum hours are 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tuesdays through Fridays, and 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. weekends. Admission is free but a donation of $2 is asked.</p>
        <p>ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</p>
        <p>A moot-court competition and series of environmental-litigation workshops will be held at the Pace University School of Law in White Plains from 2 to 9 P.M. Thursday, from 10 A.M. to 9:30 P.M. Friday and from 10 A.M. to 9 P.M. Saturday.</p>
        <p>Among the issues to be discussed are local and municipal recycling programs; protection of United States wetlands; the environmental role of the United States and the Soviet Union among developing nations; President Bush's proposal to amend the Clean Air Act; criminal environmental-law enforcement; regulation of petroleum transport; alternatives for energy management, and groundwater pollution.</p>
        <p>A forum from 7 to 9:30 P.M. Friday titled ''Attack on the Venus Sky Traps: Strategy and Tactics to Abate the Roots of Global Warming'' will feature Richard L. Ottinger, a former Representative from Westchester who is now a member of Governor Mario M. Cuomo's Environmental Advisory Board, and a panel of government, academic and private-sector representatives.</p>
        <p>Among the workshop speakers are John Meagher, director of the wetlands strategies and state programs division of the United States Environmental Protection Agency; Andrew Praschal, senior environmental counsel for BASF Chemicals; Judy LaBelle, deputy director and counsel of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation; Lieut. Mike Kearney, assistant port safety officer for the United States Coast Guard; Victor Rocque, vice president and general counsel for Orange and Rockland Utility.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael H. Robinson, director of the National Zoo at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, will address an awards banquet for competition winners from 52 teams representing 37 law schools in the United States and Canada, scheduled from 6 to 9 P.M. Saturday at the White Plains Hotel.</p>
        <p>All aspects of the program are open to the public. Registration, from noon to 2 P.M. Thursday, is $50, or $25 for any law student and $10 for other students, in the Glass Lounge on the campus, at 78 North Broadway. Tickets for the banquet are $25. Call 422-4360 for more information.</p>
        <p>A SILENT WILDE</p>
        <p>The rarest of the films to be shown in a series beginning this week at Westchester Community College in Valhalla is ''Lady Windermere's Fan.'' Made in 1925 from an Oscar Wilde play, it was filmed as a silent feature starring Ronald Colman. Although not a word of Wilde's witty dialogue can be heard, Ernst Lubitsch's direction was credited with making the movie a hit. At the screening on March 3d the silence will be breached with a live and original piano score composed and performed by Lee Erwin, a specialist in the field.</p>
        <p>''Pelle the Conqueror,'' the 1988 Danish film with Max von Sydow opens the series this Friday, followed on successive Fridays at 8 P.M. by ''Murmur of the Heart,'' France, 1971; ''Wuthering Heights,'' United States, 1939; ''Made for Each Other,'' United States, 1971; ''The Navigator,'' New Zealand, 1988; ''Lady Windermere's Fan''; ''Wings of Desire,'' West Germany, 1988, and ''Queen of Hearts,'' Britain, 1988.</p>
        <p>A performance of the 1989 British film ''My Left Foot'' will end the season June 1 as a benefit for the college's Arts Fund. Subscriptions for the rest of the series cost $27, or $20 for the elderly. Single tickets are $4, or $3 for the elderly. Benefit tickets are $10. Each film is preceded by a reception at 7:15 P.M. Call 285-6700 to subscribe or obtain more information.</p>
        <p>THE AIDS TRAGEDY</p>
        <p>''AIDS: The Science and Ethics of a Social Tragedy'' will be discussed by Dr. Robert C. Gallo, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus at noon Wednesday at the Performing Arts Theater of Lehman College in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gallo, who is chief of the Tumor Cell Biology Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Washington, also heads the institute team that developed a blood test used to detect the AIDS virus and is at work on developing a vaccine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gallo is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and has been awarded honorary degrees from several universities in the United States, Italy, Israel and Belgium. Admission is free. For more information, call (212) 960-8441. $90ELEANOR CHARLES</p>
