        <p>THERE'S not much magic left on Long Island, but there are a few things that remain -- the white ribbon of sand, the roiling crest of surf, the glorious beaches. They're the things that remind people that Long Island is, well, an island, a special place, not just an endless loop of concrete and cul-de-sacs.</p>
        <p>So, yes, there were familiar notes from the Not In My Backyard aria on Monday night when hundreds of people packed a high school auditorium in West Babylon for the first public hearing on a proposal to build the nation's first offshore wind park off the south shore of Long Island.</p>
        <p>But, to be fair, there are things many people legitimately don't want in their backyard, particularly one as imperiled and degraded as the environment of Long Island.</p>
        <p>So here's the question that was hanging in the air, one as tantalizing and uncertain as the promise of getting electricity from air: What's worse, spending more than $400 million to build a grid of huge wind-turbine generators in the ocean off Jones Beach, or not spending more than $400 million to build a grid of huge wind-turbine generators and relying on fossil fuel instead?</p>
        <p>If you think there's an easy answer, you haven't been paying attention.</p>
        <p>The proposal calls for the Long Island Power Authority to build 40 wind-turbine generators in a grid covering eight miles that would be 3.6 miles from shore. Each would be 440 feet high, double the height of the Jones Beach water tower. Officials say they would be slightly visible on clear days, and impossible to see when it's hazy. Locals say, sorry, a beach is not an industrial park. This was the first public forum in a decision process that is supposed to culminate in the spring of 2008.</p>
        <p>It wasn't hard to tell who was who on Monday night. Most of those who looked as if they just got off work, who got out of Chevys and pickups, who had that wary Long Island look in their eyes, who twitched and rolled their eyes when they heard the word Shoreham, were the locals. For the most part, they weren't buying it. And they were not forgetting that the project was off the public beaches, not off those catering to the richer precincts to the east.</p>
        <p>Jayne Johnes lives and breathes for her proximity to Gilgo Beach.</p>
        <p>''This is heaven, this is my church,'' she said. ''And now they want to put a power plant in the middle of it?''</p>
        <p>Aside from a few stray politicians attuned to the local mood, most of those wearing suits, people with the pro-wind T-shirts, and the representatives from the environmental groups were on the other side. Some proponents saw a bit of magic there, too. Jim Calcigno of Deer Park said he would be inspired to look out into the ocean and see turbines making clean energy as opposed to the pollution that existing generators cause now.</p>
        <p>''I say put wind turbines in the water, on the land, in each backyard, on every rooftop, and on top of each of the hundreds of thousands of utility and light poles we have on Long Island,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But most of the others made reference to the grim, inescapable realities of environmental and economic life -- cutting back on OPEC oil, reducing the need for new power plants, producing cleaner energy with less environmental impact, moving away from fossil fuels, producing energy that won't contribute to the global warming that could leave those lovely beaches under water. Proponents say the project would power the equivalent of 44,000 Long Island homes a year.</p>
        <p>If it were that simple, who could say no? But questions remain: if the project will produce enough energy to make sense, if other alternatives like upgrading and modernizing existing plants aren't preferable, if this is just another way to make big money on big energy. So when William T. Lauder, a former Babylon town supervisor, got up and said, ''I'm convinced this is the biggest boondoggle I've yet seen,'' he broke the applause meter.</p>
        <p>Similar projects have existed for years in Europe (though there's something of a backlash there, too; claims that they've been oversold as environmental panaceas).</p>
        <p>It's easy from afar to think seeing a few wind turbines on the horizon is a very small price to pay for a blessed miracle like clean energy with no OPEC strings attached. Maybe, compared with other options, it is.</p>
        <p>But we still want our bigger and bigger houses with their Sub-Zeros and central air. We want inexpensive and abundant energy, and we don't want to pay too much for it. Maybe energy from wind is as close to magic as we get. Or maybe we've long since run out of magic, everything has its costs, and in the end, it will be one more slice of Long Island's soul.</p>
