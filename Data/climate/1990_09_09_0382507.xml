        <p>LEAD: When the television producer Bruce Paltrow, known for the St. Elsewhere series, and his wife, the actress Blythe Danner, bought almost 40 acres of property on Lake Waccabuc in the Westchester town of Lewisboro two years ago, their neighbors in this tight-knit community were thrilled. And not because of their celebrity status.</p>
        <p>''The greatest concern was the construction on the steep slope running down to the water,'' said Peter Beardsley, a resident of Waccabuc since 1974 and former president of the Three Lakes Council. ''He had already cleared trees to push the road through. And when it rained, the building debris ran right into the lake. Also, that kind of job requires lots of fill and truckloads of rock, and obviously that's going to disturb the vegetation around the lake.''</p>
        <p>When the building inspector came to examine the site, he immediately revoked Mr. Paltrow's wetland permit, claiming that the construction was unauthorized and posed an environmental hazard to the lake. Work was halted in March 1989.</p>
        <p>According to observers, Mr. Paltrow at a later planning board hearing admitted that things were out of control at his job site and agreed to restore the disturbed shoreline, including replanting 100 feet of vegetation.</p>
        <p>A few months later, neighbors were surprised when Mr. Paltrow filed a $2 million suit against the town and individual planning board members.</p>
        <p>''The Paltrows were issued valid wetland and building permits to build the tennis court and access road near the lake,'' said his attorney, Michael F. Sirignano. ''This is unlawful revocation of a lawful permit.''</p>
        <p>He added that the acting wetland inspector made ''serious permit mistakes, for which the town is holding the homeowner responsible.''</p>
        <p>The town attorney, Charles B. McGroddy, admits the wetland permit was ''improvidently granted, but Mr. Paltrow was caught doing a huge amount of work for which no permit was ever issued,'' including building an access road.</p>
        <p>Special permits are required for any construction within 100 feet of a wetland, which is defined by type of soil and vegetation.</p>
        <p>''Any activity within that area has to proceed in a controlled and protected manner,'' according to Murray Crandell, Lewisboro's building and wetland inspector.</p>
        <p>The spot where the Paltrows were to build their tennis court is ''a beautiful and unique piece of environmentally sensitive land that we've worked hard to protect,'' said Mr. Beardsley. From the Paltrows' perspective, they had little choice.</p>
        <p>''Most of their property is hilly,'' said Maureen Carpenter, of Ginnel Real Estate in Bedford. ''There's not a lot of level ground to build a tennis court.''</p>
        <p>Even so, trying to build that close to the lake could prove disastrous to the health of the lake, according to members of the Three Lakes Council. ''Top-soil runoff is exactly what we don't want,'' said Mr. Dickens. When ground is disturbed and washes into the lake, it contaminates the water with phosphates, ''the number one nutrient that's detrimental to the watershed.''</p>
        <p>''Before I started construction, if somebody had told me they didn't want to me to build a tennis court I wouldn't have done it,'' Mr. Paltrow said, ''but after spending tons of money it's not right to come along and say you can't do it.''</p>
        <p>Since 1970, the Three Lakes Council has been working hard to protect the waterfronts of Lakes Waccabuc, Oscaleta and Rippowan, which are connected by narrow feeder streams. Staffed by volunteers and funded by donations, the group regularly tests all three lakes, and ''so far we're managing to keep them in pretty good shape against some difficult odds'' said Peter Beardsley.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest concerns is leakage from septic systems. When these lake communities were first developed in the 1920's, lots 35 to 50 feet wide and 100 or 150 feet deep were sold as summer properties. People built summer cottages with septic systems right near the lake. The area has changed a lot over the years and there are now many million-dollar properties around the lakes, including the home of the ''Today Show'' host, Bryant Gumbel, on Lake Waccabuc. But many of the original, smaller homes still pose a threat to the lake.</p>
        <p>A lot of the older houses have since been winterized, but ''the septics were only designed for seasonal use,'' said Ed Delaney, an engineer with Westchester's Department of Health. ''Now they can't keep up, and it's having an impact on the lakes.'' Most homes in Lewisboro have septic systems and wells, and homes built within the last 10 years could not have a septic tank within 100 feet of a designated wetland.</p>
        <p>The Three Lakes Council tries to get all lake residents to upgrade and maintain their septics ''but sewage runoff is still our biggest short-term problem,'' said Mr. Dickens. The council also educates residents on the proper use of fertilizers and pesticides near the lake.</p>
        <p>''And we encourage people to cut down on their laundry loads,'' Mr. Dickens said, ''and to use non-phosphorus soaps.''</p>
        <p>In 1973, Lake Waccabuc was singled out for special attention when Union Carbide installed two aerators in it as part of an experiment in replenishing the oxygen levels of older lakes. A few years later, the Three Lakes Council inherited the aerators and continues to run them in Lake Waccabuc at a cost of $10,000 a year.</p>
        <p>And in 1986, Waccabuc became the only Westchester lake that is regularly tested by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation for nutrient content, clarity, pH., conductivity and other indicators of its health.</p>
        <p>''The Three Lakes Council really pushed to get Waccabuc included'' in the special D.E.C. testing program, said Scott Kishbaugh, a department employee who coordinates the program. ''The lake's in better shape now that it was 10 or 15 years ago.''</p>
        <p>It is classified as a ''moderately productive lake,'' he said, compared with some lakes in the Adirondacks that have become ''highly unproductive'' as a result of the killing off of plant and animal life by acid rain.</p>
        <p>''This is the healthiest lake in Westchester due to the constant monitoring and aeration,'' Mr. Kishbaugh said. ''After all the hard work involved to keep it that way, I can certainly understand the community's concern about any construction taking place near the shoreline.''</p>
        <p>Residents of Lake Waccabuc are hoping for a quick and amicable settlement to the Paltrow suit that is fair to all concerned.</p>
        <p>''No one likes telling a homeowner how to use his private property,'' said Susan Henry, a neighbor of the Paltrows and a member of the Westchester Land Trust, a organization dedicated to preserving the county's open land. ''But this is a special case, and I hope they can work with the town. The goal should be to retain the rural look and atmosphere of Lake Waccabuc and avoid any inappropriate development.''</p>
        <p>''We complied with all the environmental impact studies and we did no damage to the lake,'' Mr. Paltrow said. ''I have no animosity toward the members of the Three Lakes Council. They do a good job. I just think they're misinformed and prejudiced on this issue.''</p>
        <p>Depositions in the case will be filed this month and Mr. Sirignano expects ''many layers of litigtion'' and probably no resolution for a couple of years.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, this case has degenerated into an emotional issue now,'' said Mr. Dickens. ''Whatever happens, all we can do is continue to protect the lake as we've always done, amd make sure it doesn't become the victim.''</p>
