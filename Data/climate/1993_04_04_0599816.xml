        <p>1. False. In the early 19th century, centers of forestry education were established in many European nations.</p>
        <p>2. Smoky the Bear.</p>
        <p>3. Lightning. Some 8 million bolts of lightning strike Earth each day. Every year lightning starts approximately 50,000 forest fires worldwide, including 10,000 in the United States.</p>
        <p>4. A surface fire burns on the forest floor, destroying shrubs and floor litter. A crown fire burns the tops of trees and, fanned by winds, can be much more dangerous and faster moving than a surface fire.</p>
        <p>5. False. Factors are weighed such as whether life and property are endangered or whether weather conditions are such that the fire could spread out of control. And some fires benefit forests, consuming litter on forest floors that provides a habitat for many tree-killing insects.</p>
        <p>6. b) 8,000 gallons.</p>
        <p>7. It is a cone-bearing tree.</p>
        <p>8. Leaves on deciduous trees emit a great deal of water. In winter months in the North or during dry spells in warmer climates, little moisture can be drawn up from frozen or arid ground. So, trees would dry up and die if they retained their leaves.</p>
        <p>9. Conifers. The oak is deciduous.</p>
        <p>10. All of the answers are correct.</p>
        <p>11. In a narrow belt that girdles the globe at the Equator in regions where the temperature ranges from 68 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit and more than 80 inches of rain on average falls per year.</p>
        <p>12. Tree farming; the process of developing and raising trees for their ability to meet various human needs. Forests created by silviculture often feature one type of tree (monoculture), and thus attract a limited variety of wildlife.</p>
        <p>13. Tropical rain forests never have a dry season. Most of the trees have broad leaves that are never bare. Because little sunlight filters through the thick treetops, there is relatively little undergrowth on the rainforest floor. By contrast, jungles are characterized by dense, low vegetation and may grow in dry or wet climates. Some jungles have few trees and only impassable thickets of low shrubs.</p>
        <p>14. b) 50 percent.</p>
        <p>15. a) teak/tropical rain forest; b) oak/temperate deciduous broad-leafed forest; c) Douglas fir/temperate Northern hemisphere forest; d) cypress/Southern coniferous forest.</p>
        <p>16. c) the tendency of trees to bend toward light.</p>
        <p>17. Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>18. a) 50 years.</p>
        <p>19. a) Ouachita Forest/Arkansas; b) Tongass National Forest/Alaska; c) Petrified Forest/Arizona; d) Black Forest/Germany.</p>
