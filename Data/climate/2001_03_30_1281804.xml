        <p>Three weeks ago, Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, returned from a meeting in Italy to report that she had had ''varied success in buying us time to fully engage'' in international negotiations on global warming.</p>
        <p>Today, at another international gathering, Mrs. Whitman seemed to have had less success still.</p>
        <p>With the White House having abandoned any pretense of support for the most far-reaching international treaty intended to tackle the problem, she heard mostly dismay and disappointment from counterparts who called the stand an enormous setback on an issue that should allow little room for patience.</p>
        <p>''Kyoto clearly is not perfect, but Kyoto is what we've got,'' a top Canadian negotiator on the issue, Paul Fauteux, said outside a meeting of environment ministers here. In criticizing the American opposition to the treaty, which was approved in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, Mr. Fauteux said: ''We would rather work from what we've got than to call it quits. Climate change is a critically important problem, and it's too important to start from scratch.''</p>
        <p>For her part, Mrs. Whitman tried to put a forward-looking outlook on the American position. In private meetings, and in brief remarks to reporters, she said President Bush was ''absolutely committed to full engagement with the international community'' on global warming.</p>
        <p>But as for any alternative to Kyoto, which would require industrialized countries to reduce emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, Mrs. Whitman had little more to say than that the United States intended to propose ''other solutions.''</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Whitman, the former New Jersey governor, the day's appearance could not have been easy. In a confidential memorandum to President Bush after her trip to Italy, she had explicitly recommended that the administration avoid being seen as opposed to the Kyoto accord.</p>
        <p>And when that advice was overruled, administration officials sympathetic to her position said, she had asked in vain at the State Department and the White House for specific instructions about what more she might tell American friends and allies about what the new administration position might be.</p>
        <p>Citing ''other commitments,'' Mrs. Whitman left the two-day environment ministers' conference this afternoon, choosing not to remain for a news conference scheduled for Friday that is likely to lay bare even further the raw mood of other delegates, from 34 other countries in the Western hemisphere.</p>
        <p>''Her position has to be very uncomfortable,'' said one high-level delegate, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Mexico's environment minister, Victor Lichtinger, was among several delegates who said he had no doubt that the American abandonment of the Kyoto accord would greatly complicate efforts to find common ground on the issue.</p>
        <p>''I'm certainly disappointed,'' Mr. Lichtinger said this morning after a private meeting with Mrs. Whitman. ''Without the United States, it is difficult. It is a very important issue, and that's why we need to push, we need to react, we need to keep the United States in the process.''</p>
        <p>The meeting was part of preparations for a Summit of the Americas, an annual gathering of heads of state from around the Western Hemisphere, which is scheduled for next month, so global warming was not the only issue on the agenda. Delegates said discussions had been cordial, and a spokeswoman said Mrs. Whitman had been pleased with the open session and with one-on-one meetings with other delegates, who included representatives from Canada, Belize, Chile, Colombia, Chile and Panama, as well as from Mexico.</p>
        <p>''It all went very well,'' said the spokeswoman, Stephanie Bell.</p>
        <p>Still, the fact that the meeting followed so quickly after this week's reaffirmation of the American position seemed to have given an unusually tense air to what might otherwise have been an uneventful gathering. At a picture-taking session that was the only time the meeting was open to the news media, David Anderson, the Canadian environment minister, quickly cut off reporters' efforts to question Mrs. Whitman about the American position.</p>
        <p>''The agreement was that we would wait in our seats, we would talk with one another, and there would be an opportunity only for photographers to take pictures,'' Mr. Anderson said somewhat dryly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said before the session that he feared the American position would undermine the climate-change battle altogether. ''This is unraveling,'' he said, The Globe and Mail reported. ''We have to try our best to keep this together.''</p>
        <p>Today, the Canadian Government issued a statement reiterating that sense of urgency. ''Climate change is a critical global problem requiring global solutions,'' he said. ''The science behind climate change is increasingly compelling and the human impacts increasingly evident.''</p>
        <p>Of the 35 countries at today's session, only Canada and the United States would be obligated under the Kyoto accord to specific cuts in emissions of the gases believed to contribute to global warming. At least initially, developing countries like Mexico and Brazil would be exempt from such an obligation, a factor that Mr. Bush has identified as one of the treaty's major weaknesses.</p>
        <p>The Mexican delegate, Mr. Lichtinger, said that his country and others would ''make an effort'' to reduce their emissions, but that they believed the United States, Canada and Europe should take the lead.</p>
        <p>In her remarks to reporters, Mrs. Whitman did not say when she believed a Cabinet-level review of global warming policy that is under way in the administration might be completed. But she said Mr. Bush was ''confident'' that process would lead to a better approach than the one hammered out in Kyoto.</p>
        <p>''We can work together with our international friends and allies and neighbors and come up with market-based incentive solutions that can get us to the end of the day with this issue,'' she said.</p>
