        <p>Hoping to give scientists a new tool to study the earth's atmosphere and peer into outer space, a small Texas company has developed what is almost certainly the world's most astonishing high-altitude balloon.</p>
        <p>Huge and filled with helium, the unmanned balloon has a diameter that is longer than a football field, can carry up to four tons of scientific equipment and, its inventors say, can drift more than 22 miles above the earth, near the edge of outer space, for as long as a year at a time.</p>
        <p>Improbable? No. A working prototype has already been built and will be launched on a test flight some time in the next few months by the Air Force at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.  Platform for Telescopes</p>
        <p>If the monster balloon is successful, it could give scientists a valuable new approach for studying atmospheric trends like global warming, depletion of the ozone layer and the spread of pollutants that cause acid rain. In addition, because the balloon can climb above 99 percent of the earth's murky atmosphere, the inventors say it can serve as a platform for telescopes and provide a view of the stars that is almost as clear as one obtained by telescopes launched by rockets into orbit.</p>
        <p>The balloon was invented by researchers at Winzen International Inc. of San Antonio, a company that has been building and selling advanced balloons for scientific purposes since the 1940's. The invention was developed in part with financing from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p>
        <p>High-altitude balloons are not in themselves new, said James L. Rand, president of Winzen and the lead inventor. The key breakthrough here, he said, was in developing a balloon that could be both big enough to carrylarge amounts of heavy equipment and could stay up for more than about five days at a time.</p>
        <p>The advantage of prolonged explorations, Mr. Rand said, is that they allow a balloon to track atmospheric currents around the globe and to watch for events that occur only at erratic and infrequent intervals, like solar flares.</p>
        <p>Most conventional balloons, he said, can fly for a limited duration because they must gradually vent their gas in response to daily temperature cycles of heating and cooling. The problem is that the gas inside the balloon expands during the heat of the day, and some must be released to keep the balloon from rupturing. For a few days, the balloon can maintain altitude by dropping ballast when it vents. But after a while, it runs out of gas, ballast, or both.</p>
        <p>Using double-layered polyester fabric, it has long been possible to build smaller balloons that can endure the expansions and contractions without needing to vent. But when the Government tried to scale up these balloons during the 1970's, they developed tears and ripped apart.</p>
        <p>The new balloon uses a form of nylon that stretches uniformly in all directions. Mr. Rand said most experts had considered nylon unworkable because extended stress caused it to "creep," or lose shape over time. What the researchers at Winzen discovered, however, is that this is not a problem in cold air at high altitudes.</p>
        <p>Patent 5,104,059 was issued to Mr. Rand; Loren G. Seely, vice president of Winzen, and other researchers at the company.</p>
