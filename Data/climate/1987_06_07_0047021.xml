        <p>LEAD: THEY battled the bugs, balanced themselves on rocks in the streams and cleared away the branches of trees - all to get accurate readings on the elevations of the land for their topographic maps.</p>
        <p>THEY battled the bugs, balanced themselves on rocks in the streams and cleared away the branches of trees - all to get accurate readings on the elevations of the land for their topographic maps.</p>
        <p>The map activity, which required the use of rulers, compasses and surveying instruments, was designed to give the students some practical experience in the concepts and processes they had studied all year.</p>
        <p>''The idea of the earth-science weekends,'' explained Steve Boyar, an earth-sciences teacher at Pleasantville High School, ''is to reinforce what the students had been learning in class and, at the same time, show them what it's like in real life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyar said that when the two weekends - held in May each year -were over, 66 ninth graders would have participated in the science activities. In addition to the map exercise, these include a land-use study, a stream evaluation, a geology hike and an orienteering course.</p>
        <p>The earth-sciences weekends take place at the Madden Outdoor Education Center in Kent Cliffs, in Putnam County. The center is 120 acres of forest and wetlands run by the Putnam/ Northern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. The property, on which there is a 200-year-old dairy barn, a maple-sugaring house, a pond and a stream, was donated to Boces 17 years ago by John Madden, a New York City advertising executive who spent his summers there. The center serves about 14,000 students each year in its environmental-studies program, according to Dorna Schroeter, the center's director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyar said he learned about the center through a Boces newsletter. ''The year I began the science trips,'' he recalled, ''I took the students through the iron mines in Fahnestock State Park, but the next year the State Department of Parks wouldn't allow us to return, so I had to come up with another alternative.'' The state considered it unsafe to have school groups in the mines. He said the ''best geological setting for the field work'' would have involved ''too much travel and expense'' so he settled on the Boces facility and planned the earth-sciences work around it.</p>
        <p>He said that to help the students determine the best possible uses for a piece of land, three holes were dug on the Madden property by the Putnam County Highway Department. ''Inside the holes,'' said Mr. Boyar, who developed the exercises with Putnam County soil and conservation experts, ''the kids run some tests to find out the texture of the soil. Then they analyze the drainage characteristics, measure the depth of the soil to the bedrock and note the seasonal level of the water table. These factors help them to evaluate whether the land would be good for roads, buildings, septic tanks or ponds.''</p>
        <p>A favorite activity, according to many of the students who recently participated in the weekends, is the stream study. ''Just putting on the hip boots and sloshing around in the water appealed to me,'' said Brendan January, a ninth grader. His group, which included Peter Feldman, Andrew Gallo and Danielle Martin, conducted a dissolved-oxygen test in the stream to see whether the water could support living organisms. Then they took a sample of the water to check its acidity and noted its velocity and volume of flow.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the students' finding concerning the low level of acidity in the water, Miss Schroeter said: ''The reason we may not have as much of a problem with acid rain here as compared to the Adirondacks is because we have a lot of limestone deposits in the Peconic region, and limestone acts as a neutralizer, bringing down the level of acidity.''</p>
        <p>Elise Hilf Levine, a chemistry teacher at the high school and an assistant during the weekends, said she often ''refers back to the chemical investigations carried out by these students'' when they take her 11th-grade chemistry course. ''They always remember the stream experience,'' she said, ''and, as a result, really understand the concepts that are involved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyar said that during the weekends the students are required to record the information and observations about their experiences in a field notebook.</p>
        <p>The earth sciences teacher, who will take a sabbatical next year to do research on volcanoes at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory in Hawaii, attributes much of the success of the weekends to the enthusiasm and dedication of his teaching assistants. All are members of the school's geology club and former earth sciences students. Mr. Boyar said he recruits them in the 10th grade, and they stay with the program as teachers until they graduate.</p>
        <p>Referring to her participation as an assistant, Kristina Brown, an 11th grader who has been teaching the science activities for two years, said: ''A lot of people ask me 'Why do you want to go back to Madden?' I really like the kids, and it's fun to see their faces light up when they discover what they've learned.''</p>
        <p>Miss Brown, who is considering a career in child psychology or teaching, said that when she was a freshman, the weekend ''had brought the whole year together'' for her.</p>
        <p>''I'm taking physics now,'' she added, ''and I wish we had a trip like this one.''</p>
        <p>Many of the ninth graders said they would like to return to the center next year as teachers. ''The older students get a lot of respect and they deserve it,'' said Peter Feldman. ''They know what they are talking about, explain everything clearly and do a great job.''</p>
