        <p>TO design the perfect solar house, Heather Korb and her fellow architecture students at the New York Institute of Technology wanted to do more than just harness the sun with solar panels.</p>
        <p>''Our philosophy is to live in harmony with the earth as part of one sustainable ecology,'' said Ms. Korb, 26, of St. James, a fourth-year student at the institute's Old Westbury campus.</p>
        <p>Ms. Korb's run-by-the-sun design, called Green Machine/Blue Space, is not just a series of sketches or a scale model.</p>
        <p>Since last spring, between classes, on weekends and all summer long, 70 students have been hammering and sawing, running wires and installing solar panels, turning the plans for an 800-square-foot house set at the edge of a parking lot into reality.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the contemporary-style house, clad in cedar, can be lived in without spending a penny on energy. Its regenerative hydrogen fuel-cell energy storage system means the house actually produces more electricity than it needs. David Schieren, 26, of Hewlett Harbor, a graduate student in engineering and the energy team leader on the project, said the challenge was to build a house ''that is energy self-sufficient.''</p>
        <p>The house, which cost $500,000 to construct, is the university's entry in the 2005 Solar Decathlon competition sponsored by the federal Department of Energy.</p>
        <p>The New York Institute of Technology is one of 19 colleges around the world, and the only one in the metropolitan region, to be selected as a finalist in the international competition. The college chose Ms.Korb's design after a weeklong design event in which four teams of students came up with ideas for a truly sustainable house.</p>
        <p>At the end of this month, the house is to be broken down into seven sections, trucked to the Mall in Washington and reassembled for the three-week final competition.</p>
        <p>Brainstorming with her teammates, Heather Castelli and Jason Dames, Ms. Korb designed an airy, light-filled house using recyclable materials and lessons for future housing design. A discarded shipping container became the heart of the house: the Green Machine, an 8-foot-by-20-foot space that resembles a trailer, houses the kitchen, bath and mechanical room.</p>
        <p>''It is economical and energy-efficient to reuse something,'' Ms. Korb said, noting the abundance of shipping containers that could be salvaged worldwide. ''The idea was to take all the mechanics of the house, anything that is heat-producing, and condense it into a smaller area, so that the living space is wide open.''</p>
        <p>A breezeway called the ''and'' helps provide natural ventilation and connects the container to the Blue Space, a combination living room, dining room and work area with a bedroom loft above. A two-tiered roof with wide overhangs shelters it all.</p>
        <p>Windows stretch across the front of the house, with a line of clerestory windows on the balcony level. A bridge over the breezeway connects the balcony to the Green Machine's roof garden, where vegetables and herbs will be grown. Leftovers from the kitchen become compost; rainwater collected from the roof is used to water the plants.</p>
        <p>During the day, advanced solar panels are the home's primary power source. But what happens at night and on cloudy days?</p>
        <p>''We have to store energy,'' Mr. Schieren said. While other teams in the competition went the traditional route and used storage batteries, the institute's students chose a hydrogen fuel-cell energy storage system instead.</p>
        <p>When the sun shines, electricity generated by the roof-mounted photovoltaic system -- the solar panels -- is put to work separating hydrogen from water by electrolysis, Mr. Schieren said. The hydrogen, stored in tanks, can be drawn on to power a fuel cell, providing electricity and heat on demand day or night, summer or winter.</p>
        <p>''Hydrogen is the fuel of the future, and it offers true energy independence and the opportunity for a clean environment,'' he added. ''We don't need natural gas, we don't need an oil tank, we are not connected to the grid. We are working on the future, the home of the future.'' Not to mention utility bills kept at a comfortable zero dollars.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said more than 500 homes on the Island were using solar power in some form. And the timing could not be better, he said, for the students' efforts.</p>
        <p>''We are just at the beginning of an energy tsunami,'' Mr. Kessel said, citing the skyrocketing prices for oil and natural gas and the threat they pose to the Island's economy. ''The answer in the long run is to reduce our dependence on oil and other fossil fuels, through efforts like this solar house and renewable energy resources.''</p>
        <p>There are many financial incentives for solar pioneers. Mr. Kessel said LIPA offers rebates to customers who install solar energy systems on their roofs. New York State offers tax credits, and recently exempted solar equipment from state sales tax. The Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, recently proposed legislation that would spare homeowners from county sales tax on the systems as well.</p>
        <p>''The future is now for solar energy,'' Mr. Kessel added. ''I don't believe that solar energy or fuel cells or wind power are a luxury anymore. They are a necessity.''</p>
        <p>Michael Catalano, 23, a fifth-year architecture student from Islip Terrace, led the team in charge of the Green Machine. He said the energy-efficient design principles could be used on much larger homes.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to demonstrate a different way of living, but applying it to what people value,'' Mr. Catalano said.</p>
        <p>The house's eco-friendly ideas extend beyond energy. The kitchen counter is made from compressed newsprint. The insulation protecting the walls of the container is made of a soy-based foam. In the leisure areas, walls eight inches thick are made from Agriboard, a wallboard made of compressed wheat straw.</p>
        <p>''The straw releases a natural adhesive, so these walls are completely biodegradable,'' Ms. Korb said. ''When the house is finished, you can grind it up and leave it for mulch, and it just goes back to the earth.'' Not for a while yet, though: when the competition is over, it will be reassembled on campus for use as a solar educational center.</p>
        <p>While architecture students worked on the overall design and engineers labored over the energy plan, interior-design students considered self-sufficiency and sustainability in their plans. The sofa, for instance, has photovoltaic panels on the back that can collect enough energy to power two lamps connected to the sofa's frame, or drive small fans for heating and cooling embedded in its cushions.</p>
        <p>Alexandra Logue, vice president for academic affairs and provost of the college, said the competition was unusual in requiring students from different disciplines to work together, applying classroom learning to a real-life project.</p>
        <p>''They are doing it with something that is important for our society: how to harness the power of the sun to provide energy for an entire house,'' Dr. Logue said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Korb said the Green Machine/Blue Space was her dream.</p>
        <p>''I'd love to live in a house that is not connected to the grid or any pipelines,'' she said. ''You just don't have to take from the government or from the local power supply. You are producing your own, along with the sun and the earth. It's a nice feeling.''</p>
        <p>Saved From the Dumpster</p>
        <p>Two years after Barrie and John Overend moved from an apartment in Manhattan to a house in Garden City, they still had boxes in the basement that they hadn't unpacked.</p>
        <p>Many of the knickknacks were things that John, 41, had grown up with; other boxes came from Ms. Overend's parents' basement or from her office. Some of the keepsakes had been on display in their previous apartments.</p>
        <p>''Once we boxed things up, we realized we wanted to decorate a different way,'' said Ms. Overend, 38. ''A lot of things we decorate with now, we collected together.''</p>
        <p>Hoping to get rid of the clutter and fix up the basement as a play area for their children, Nathan, 8, and Addie, 4, and as a workout space for herself and her husband, Ms. Overend responded to an ad in a local weekly newspaper seeking homeowners with antiques to sell.</p>
        <p>The following day, she received a call from the producers of ''Cash in the Attic,'' a new weekly program on the HGTV cable television network. The program, a twist on the typical appraisal show, takes families on a treasure hunt through their own homes, finding forgotten heirlooms that can be sold at auction to finance home improvements. It has its premiere Monday at 8 p.m.; the Overends are featured in the first segment.</p>
        <p>''We recycle clothes, bottles, cans,'' Ms. Overend said. ''The thought of recycling household items is also neat.''</p>
        <p>John Scencio, the program's host, and Tim Luke, an appraiser, helped the couple select pewter pitchers, wooden bookends, a Mickey Mouse phone and a Victorian wooden writing slope that could be liquidated. An old medicine cabinet and an antique desk that Mr. Overend used as a child were also packed into the ''Cash in the Attic'' van and taken to an auction house in Westchester.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Overend, a real estate developer, decided that a walking stick with a silver knob that his parents had collected and a painting of a windmill that had hung in his boyhood room had more sentimental than monetary value. They never made it to the auction block.</p>
        <p>As it worked out, they didn't have to: The other items fetched a total of $2,400 at auction, more than enough to pay for the Overends' basement makeover, including a new treadmill.</p>
        <p>''He is the one that is all sentimental,'' Ms. Overend said of her husband. ''I am the one that is giddy and happy and wants to get rid of everything.''</p>
