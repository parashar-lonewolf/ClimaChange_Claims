        <p>Reaching far beyond the bad breath of their smokestacks at home, Dutch power stations have begun an ambitious cleanup project that involves replanting thousands of acres of forests in the tropics and helping to clear Eastern Europe's choking air.</p>
        <p>The power companies argue that they can achieve much faster and more impressive results by combating air pollution in poorer or less developed countries than they can by spending huge sums to yield small improvements in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Under this unusual plan, the Netherlands Electricity Generating Board will immediately finance a $35 million plant to reduce the load of sulfur now fired into the air by antiquated power stations in Poland. The board has pledged $300 million more to restore razed forests in tropical countries over the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>In northern Europe, where industry is already aroused by an approaching wave of strict new environmental rules, the Dutch program is the first of its kind. But other responses are coming from companies in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Britain, where manufacturers will be held more and more accountable for dealing with their own waste.  Companies Spending Millions</p>
        <p>As concern for nature is reaching deeper into the region's laws and consumer habits, companies are hiring consultants to adjust their environmental behavior. Many are spending millions of dollars to change the ingredients in their products or developing new lines of goods.</p>
        <p>They are also turning to image makers to spread the word. From Belfast to Berlin, shoppers are already being courted with new "green" logos and labels on products that claim to be less destructive or more degradable. Even though the facts behind those labels are not always clear, sales of "green" goods have started to soar.</p>
        <p>Consumers in the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway have been told that they must help finance clean air projects at home and in poorer regions abroad.</p>
        <p>"It's one of the few options left to a society that keeps demanding more energy," said Irene Carsouw, a spokeswoman for the Dutch electricity board. "We can compensate for pollution somewhere else."</p>
        <p>Few other places in the world have as much acid air and filthy river water as the crowded quarters of northern Europe.  Norway Plans 'Climate Fund'</p>
        <p>Norway in November announced plans for a new "climate fund" to help poor countries fight their own so-called greenhouse gases, which may lead to warming of the earth.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway said the money for the fund would come from the country's offshore oilfields, which will be expected to pay new "carbon dioxide taxes." Norway's oilfields are among Europe's largest producers of oil and natural gas, which on burning produce carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>The Dutch, who are putting together a far-reaching plan to clean up the nation, have not objected to the power companies' program to plant forests in the tropics or to help clean the air in Poland.</p>
        <p>Dutch consumers are to pick up part of the cost, which means adding a little less than a dollar a year to the average home electricity bill. The privately owned power companies hope they can also tap some of the $40 million in taxes that they must now pay the Government for emitting carbon dioxide. The 30 power plants account for one-fifth of the country's total carbon output. They also give off sulphur dioxide, one of the major causes of acid rain.  Removing Most of Sulfur</p>
        <p>Miss Carsouw, the electricity board spokeswoman, explaining the Dutch-Polish project, said: "We are already removing 92 percent of the sulfur from our emissions here. By investing $35 million, we can remove another few percent, some 6,000 tons of sulfur."</p>
        <p>But that same investment, she added, will now pay for a desulfurization plant that will remove 45,000 tons of sulfur in Poland, where power stations depend on high-sulfur brown coal.</p>
        <p>The Dutch plan to replant more than 300,000 acres of tropical forests is expected to start off in Bolivia, Ecuador and Indonesia, where projects are ready. Talks with other nations are said to be under way. The forests' capacity to take carbon dioxide from the air and transform it into oxygen is supposed to offset the carbon dioxide that will be produced when two new power plants are built near Rotterdam.</p>
