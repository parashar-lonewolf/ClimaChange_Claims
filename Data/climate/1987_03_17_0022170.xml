        <p>LEAD: The extensive interstate sharing of coal-generated electric power strengthens the case for broad sharing of the costs of cleaning up acid rain, according to a new report.</p>
        <p>The extensive interstate sharing of coal-generated electric power strengthens the case for broad sharing of the costs of cleaning up acid rain, according to a new report.</p>
        <p>A crucial political impediment to the control of acid rain has been the split between the Midwestern states, where much of the sulfur pollution that falls to earth as acid rain is generated by electric plants, and the Northeastern states, where much of the acid precipitation lands. The major polluting states have argued that they would bear an inordinate share of the multibillion-dollar cost of controlling sulfur pollution to achieve uncertain benefits elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Both past pollution-control expenditures and current electricity trade patterns argue for sharing of cleanup costs, James S. Cannon asserted in a report for Inform, a private research group in New York. Although northeastern states have made major progress in reducing their own sulfur pollution, five states that are major contributors to acid rain pollution -West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio - achieved even greater reductions during the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Four of these states number among the nation's top 15 electricity-exporting states, the report found. In contrast, five of the northeastern states that consider themselves ''victims'' of acid rain produced elsewhere -Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire - fall within the nation's top 15 electricity importers. More data and more cooperation among states are needed to determine the actual consumers of coal-generated electricity, the report said. But it concluded: ''If we assume that all consumers of electricity share in the responsibility for acid rain cleanup, then the most equitable acid rain control program would include some form of a broadbased tax on electric power.''
