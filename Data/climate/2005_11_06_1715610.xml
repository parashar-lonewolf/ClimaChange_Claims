        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Power Couple,'' your Oct. 9 article about the chiefs of KeySpan and the Long Island Power Authority:</p>
        <p>LIPA's chairman and chief executive, Richard M. Kessel, seems intent on moving toward life after fossil fuels, which is something all Long Islanders should applaud. It has taken elected officials, though, to put a fire under the feet of KeySpan's chairman and chief executive, Robert B. Catell, to re-power the ancient KeySpan power plants. The problem with Northport's plant, and the one polluting my community, is that it burns high-sulfur oil.</p>
        <p>New York City power plants have been limited to 0.3 percent emission of sulfur since 1972, a change that has contributed heavily to cleaner air there. We must regulate Suffolk County plants similarly. The air quality gain would be substantial, reducing both soot in the air and sulfur dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Long Islanders can also push to reform rate structures so that high volume users pay more per kilowatt hour and phasing in time-of-use rates so that peak usage is billed at its higher cost, while off-peak usage gets discounted. People changing their time of use in reaction to their bills will make good decisions that benefit all of us. Developing energy alternatives, beginning with the Jones Beach offshore wind project, is a real first step on the road Mr. Kessel talks about.</p>
