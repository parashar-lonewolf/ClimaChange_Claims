        <p>In its first comprehensive analysis of the quality of the environment in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency said today that the nation's air, water and land were cleaner and better protected than they were 30 years ago but that problems remained with impure waterways, polluted air and the acceleration of suburban sprawl.</p>

        <p>In its first comprehensive analysis of the quality of the environment in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency said today that the nation's air, water and land were cleaner and better protected than they were 30 years ago but that problems remained with impure waterways, polluted air and the acceleration of suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>The report, a draft of which was released for public comment through December, comes in a colorful reader-friendly version in addition to a longer, more technical version. It is a two-year synthesis of information available from some 30 federal agencies, states, tribes and nonprofit organizations that took part.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials emphasized a number of environmental improvements in the report. Air pollution has declined 25 percent over the last three decades even as the nation's population, economy and number of vehicles have grown, the report says. The volume of toxic chemicals released, mostly from industry, appears to have declined 48 percent since 1988.</p>
        <p>But the report also noted that 14 percent of river miles, 28 percent of lake area and 100 percent of the Great Lakes waters are currently under fish consumption advisories because of contaminants like mercury, dioxins and PCB's.</p>
        <p>The report said that the pace of land development accelerated in the 1990's even as land conservation efforts increased. The rate of development in the 1990's was approximately 1.5 times the rate in the 1980's, according to the report. As of 1997, 4.3 percent of total land was development, up from 3.2 in 1982.</p>
        <p>While the report's discussions of issues involving land use and air and water polution are extensive, the references to the politically charged matter of climate change -- called ''global issues'' in the draft -- are relatively cursory. This section was heavily edited by the White House, according to documents obtained last week by The New York Times. The edited version released today eliminates references to many studies that conclude that global warming is at least partly caused by human activity, like the rising concentrations of emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes, and that global warming could threaten health and ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Agency officials said last week that they had decided to delete the entire discussion on global warming to avoid criticism that they were selectively filtering science to suit administration policy.</p>
        <p>Today, Christie Whitman, the agency's administrator, said at a news conference: ''This is not a selective document to make a case for any one particular policy mindset or another. This is, What do we know today about where we are and what should that tell us about going forward?''</p>
        <p>Paul Gilman, the agency's science adviser and head of its office of research and development, said the report tried to focus on national rather than global issues: ''We did include some of the global issues and ultimately decided in the case of climate that the debate on climate and the status of climate was something better kept to the Climate Change Research Initiative that is ongoing, that E.P.A. is participating in.'' The report refers readers to most of the studies.</p>
        <p>The climate change section is now limited to one paragraph, though Dr. Gilman said that in the original version it ran two pages.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman said that the purpose of the report was to set up a baseline for future comparisons. ''This is about the state of the environment today, what we know today, in order to inform our decision-making for the future, where to put our resources, where to put our scientific eye,'' she said. ''This isn't about comparing one administration to another.''</p>
        <p>Since this report is a draft, it is unclear whether a more complete section on global warming will be included in the final version. By then, the agency should have a new administrator, since Mrs. Whitman is stepping down at the end of this week. But that decision will probably be made by the White House.</p>
        <p>Officials in President Bush's Council on Environmental Quality and in the Office of Management and Budget oversaw the draft and made extensive changes. For example, they deleted a reference to a 1999 study showing that global temperatures had risen sharply in the previous decade compared with the last 1,000 years. In its place, administration officials added a reference to a new study, partly financed by the American Petroleum Institute, questioning that conclusion.</p>
        <p>The administration's interference with the draft provided ample fodder for critics today. Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and presidential contender, issued a statement saying: ''If the Bush administration wouldn't even allow the draft report to be released without first omitting important, science-based findings on climate change, I'm at a loss to understand how any of the findings in this report will ever be translated into meaningful action.''</p>
        <p>But the report also generated its share of praise.</p>
        <p>''This report belies the scare tactics of environmental groups, who sing the constant refrain that, for a variety of reasons, things are getting worse, threatening the nation's health and well-being,'' read a statement from Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has been skeptical of government regulation as the Republican chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. But the report attributes many of the continuing improvements in cleaning air and water to proactive measures taken by the E.P.A. over the decades, like the tightening of regulations on hazardous waste disposal and the banning of lead in gasoline.</p>
        <p>A significant part of the report is devoted to examining the links between the environment and health, a major theme that Mrs. Whitman has pushed in her two years in office. It paints a generally positive picture, saying that over the last century, the life span for women has increased to 79.4 years from 51 years and for men to 73.9 from 48.</p>
