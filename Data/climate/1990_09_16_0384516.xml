        <p>LEAD: The Democratic National Committee tried to accomplish a difficult task here today: express full support for the American troops in the Persian Gulf while criticizing the Republican Administration that put them there.</p>
        <p>The Democratic National Committee tried to accomplish a difficult task here today: express full support for the American troops in the Persian Gulf while criticizing the Republican Administration that put them there.</p>
        <p>''We'll stand up to Saddam Hussein, but we won't stand by as the new Republican recession wreaks havoc with the economy,'' Ronald H. Brown, the party chairman, told the committee.</p>
        <p>Today's meeting reflected a party scrambling to adjust to a political world made new by the events in the Middle East. Democratic leaders were still pressing the economic themes they hope will dominate this fall's campaigns, but they also carefully embraced the Bush Administration's gulf policy, which has overwhelming support in the public opinion polls.</p>
        <p>''The Democratic Party stands united behind our President as he acts to roll back Iraq's blatant aggression,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Saddam Hussein will get no mixed signals from America or from this party. But the perils and costs we face in the Persian Gulf cannot lead to paralysis at home.''</p>
        <p>Committee members approved a resolution sounding similar themes, beginning with its title: ''Stop Aggression in the Persian Gulf and Start Fighting a Recession at Home.'' In that resolution, and in Mr. Brown's address, the Democrats sought to place the blame for the economic downturn on ''a decade of Republican disinvestment and debt'' and to lambaste the Bush Administration's domestic policies.</p>
        <p>The members asserted that any spending reductions and tax increases necessary to ease the Federal deficit ''must not fall first on working Americans.'' And Mr. Brown assailed the President for calling again for a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains.</p>
        <p>''It is long past time, my fellow Democrats, to abandon Republican economics,'' he said. ''We've got to stop them before they do it again.''</p>
        <p>Democrats also took the Republicans to task on energy policy, passing a resolution that ''the 10-year failure of three successive Republican administrations to develop a national energy policy can no longer be tolerated.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the party rejected the notion of easing the United States' dependence on foreign oil primarily through expanded exploration in offshore areas. Instead, the committee embraced a much vaguer, and more politically palatable, solution: ''expanded U.S. energy conservation efforts and fuels development compatible with the global warming threat and our national public health.''</p>
        <p>In their two-day meeting here, the Democrats also adopted the formal call for their 1992 nominating convention, including the rules that will govern the selection of about 4,200 delegates to the convention. Party leaders said this was remarkably early for Democrats to be approving their call to the convention, and cited it as a sign of new harmony.</p>
        <p>''We needed to get this housekeeping business out of the way and get on with what our real mission is - that is, sweeping the elections this fall and winning the White House in 1992,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Still, while the Democrats now have their rules and their convention city, New York, their Presidential candidates have yet to emerge. And today's meeting suggested they are still scrambling to cope with a popular President.</p>
