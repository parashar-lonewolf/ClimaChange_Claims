        <p>The Administration is seeking a record $33.9 billion for environmental programs next year, an increase of 5 percent over this year's spending.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the hardest part of the budget to sell in Congress will be the $4 billion for fighting the risk of global warming, mainly by spurring research and investments in energy efficiency. But even industry lobbyists who have opposed a proposed international treaty to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases welcomed some of the proposals, saying they would help companies take voluntary steps.</p>
        <p>Along with hefty increases in Federal energy research, the budget seeks $3.6 billion in tax breaks over the next five years for renewable energy investments and for purchases of energy-efficient homes, cars and appliances. Congress has turned down similar ideas before.</p>
        <p>Another major initiative calls for spending $1 billion next year to buy land for conservation, a record amount. Like several other environmental proposals, this one had already been announced by the White House.</p>
        <p>Other highlights include $312 million for restoring the Everglades, $2.3 billion for programs to clean up polluted waters, $1.5 billion for cleaning up Superfund toxic waste dumps, and $1.8 billion for transportation programs intended to ease traffic congestion to help cut air pollution.</p>
        <p>The environmental proposals emphasize aid to states and cities, including matching grants for air pollution programs and $700 million in tax credits over five years to subsidize the issuance of $9.5 billion in conservation bonds. Of the Environmental Protection Agency's request for $7.2 billion next year, 40 percent would be funneled to state and local governments, officials said.</p>
