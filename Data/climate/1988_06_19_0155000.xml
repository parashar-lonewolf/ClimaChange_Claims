        <p>LEAD: AT least until fall, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is calling for, as it did last year, a 33-inch minimum-length limit for striped bass.</p>
        <p>AT least until fall, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is calling for, as it did last year, a 33-inch minimum-length limit for striped bass.</p>
        <p>That restriction is aimed at protecting female stripers of the Chesapeake Bay's 1982 year class. Historically, the Chesapeake has accounted for most of the bass that range up and down the East Coast, but in past decades their numbers have dwindled alarmingly.</p>
        <p>No one cause has been singled out as the reason, but among those cited are pollution, including that caused by agricultural runoff and acid rain, and overfishing by sporting and commercial interests.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, stripers emanating from the Hudson River, the other main source of migrating coastal stocks, have been thriving. But they contain such a high concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) that New York has continued its ban - in all the state's waters - against commercial fishing for the species.</p>
        <p>Stripers spawn in spring in rivers. The success of that endeavor is measured by a juvenile index: the number of young-of-the-year bass that survive through summer.</p>
        <p>This index, derived from nettings, by haul seine of the fish in July, August and September, has been obtained from the Chesapeake system for more than 30 years. The multiple nettings are done with identical gear in the same locations each year. The index figures are the average of the numbers of stripers taken per haul.</p>
        <p>In one banner year, 1970, the index exceeded 30.0, but 8.0 is the approximate mean over the three decades and the commission says that regulations should not be relaxed until a three-year average of 8.0 is achieved. In '80, it was 1.9; in '81, 1.2; in '82, 8.4; in '83, 1.4; in '84, 4.2; in '85, 2.9; in '86, 4.1, and last year 4.8.</p>
        <p>When the 33-inch minimum was established, it was believed that it would protect the surviving females of the 1982 year class until about 95 percent were able to spawn at least once.</p>
        <p>It was originally supposed that about 95 percent of female bass have spawned by their sixth year, when most would be less than 33 inches long. New data suggest that significant numbers of them may delay spawning for another two years, and fisheries biologists have been monitoring the Chesapeake's spawning stripers this spring in an effort to determine the percentage of '82 females that have returned. Scales, from which age may be determined, are taken from netted fish, both males and females.</p>
        <p>According to Steve Early of Maryland's Department of Natural Resources, biologists know that all male stripers are on the spawning grounds by age 4. Thus the ratio of 6-year-old (or '82 year class) males to 6-year-old females spawning this spring in the Chesapeake system provides the answer to the spawning participation level of the latter. (This assumes that the production of males and females in any year is roughly equal and that the natural attrition of the sexes is also equal. A few unripe females travel with those of their year class to the spawning grounds, but they can be so identified when netted.) If, for example, only 75 percent of the 1982 females show up this spring, the commission might - unless the juvenile index for '88 proves unusually high - increase the length limit by another few inches early this fall.</p>
        <p>For several years as striped bass stocks dwindled, many coastal states were slow in responding to the commission's request for stiffer regulations. These states, however, were eventually prodded by two events: Maryland's total ban on catching the species, and the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act of 1985, which gives the Department of the Interior the right to ban all striper fishing in the waters of states that do not meet the commission's recommendations. That law has not been tested. For the most part, the basic regulation in all states allows anglers to take one fish a day, 33 or more inches long.</p>
        <p>This applies to Massachusetts, which also has a significant commercial fishery (rod and reel, only) for the species.</p>
        <p>In Massachusetts, $10 buys a special permit that allows anglers to take all the stripers they wish, from June 1 through Sept. 30, that are 33 inches or longer. After that, the one-fish sport-fishing regulations apply. The state issues about 1,500 commercial striper permits a year, and the average annual permit harvest is about 100,000 pounds.</p>
        <p>Rhode Island, which has the same one-fish regulation for anglers, does not allow the sale of stripers caught in its waters because of PCB's. That state's net fishery once captured substantial numbers of small Hudson stripers.</p>
        <p>Connecticut, which has long banned the sale of stripers taken in its waters, also has the one-fish, 33-inch bag limit. New York has the same regulation for angler-caught stripers in its marine waters. In the Hudson, the angler limit is one fish a day, 18 or more inches long. The marine district ends at the George Washington Bridge.</p>
        <p>New Jersey bans the sale of stripers, and the daily angler limit is 5 fish, 33 or more inches long.</p>
        <p>California is also having its difficulties with striped bass, which were transplanted there from the East Coast near the turn of this century.</p>
        <p>According to Alan Pickard of that state's fish and game department, striper populations in the San Franciso Bay area began declining in the early 1970's. They appear to be nearly stabilized, he adds, but their numbers are about a third of what they were in the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>There is poor survival of larval fish, but no one cause for this can be identified. California has no commercial fishery for the species. Anglers, who must possess a $3.50 striper stamp, may, in the Bay Area, take two fish a day, 18 inches or more long.</p>
