        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Rethinking Foreign Aid'' (editorial, April 9) is on target in calling for revitalization of United States development assistance policies in the face of radically changed international circumstances. But the alternative you suggest is only half a program.</p>
        <p>The principal rationale you put forth for new development assistance initiatives is promoting America's own economic well-being and political security. That's undeniably important, but it is an incomplete justification that would lead to a seriously deficient program.</p>
        <p>The Four Horsemen of the modern age have been the ascendancy of militarism and the vast armadas it has spawned; the authoritarian suppression of human rights; the widespread poverty and hunger afflicting one-fifth of humanity, and the unrelenting assault on the environment and the natural systems. Here, on the cusp of the 1990's, as the cold war seems winding down and democracy rising, America should commit itself to encouraging these geopolitical developments and to starting a new era of action against world poverty and environmental deterioration, with particular focus on helping those who need it most.</p>
        <p>In the developing world, the foremost challenges are mass poverty and environmental decay, with excessive population growth contributing to each. The United States should make these the primary focus for cooperation and assistance in the third world. Our goal should be to promote sustainable, nondestructive livelihoods for the rural and urban poor. And to promote environmental protection that conserves the resource base for long-term production; protects public health, and establishes a sound basis for international environmental cooperation. None of the great environmental challenges of the 1990's - global warming, ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, soil and water deterioration - can be met without increasing North-South cooperation.</p>
        <p>Americans have shown they want this country to stand for more than short-term political and economic self-interest. The time is ripe for a new United States mission internationally, one based on the concept of cooperative action to sustain the earth and its people.</p>
