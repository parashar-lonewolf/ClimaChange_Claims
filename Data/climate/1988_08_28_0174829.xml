        <p>LEAD: THE worst of this summer's searing heat may be over, but the concerns that it raised about a global warming trend - known as the greenhouse effect - seem certain to linger.</p>
        <p>THE worst of this summer's searing heat may be over, but the concerns that it raised about a global warming trend - known as the greenhouse effect - seem certain to linger.</p>
        <p>Whether the earth is really warming is still a matter of debate. One thing is clear, however: finding a way to slow or stop the accumulation of gases thought to be responsible for the greenhouse effect would involve a drastic change in the amount of fuel we burn and in our sources of energy. The shifts could ultimately affect the cost and availability of all types of energy and be felt in every corner of society, changing manufacturing processes, construction techniques, even driving habits.</p>
        <p>''The implications go very deeply into modern industrial society,'' said William R. Moomaw, director of the climate, energy and pollution program of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based study group that has played a prominent role in the greenhouse debate.</p>
        <p>''In many ways we're talking about changing the quality of life of everyone in the world,'' said Carl Crawford, a spokesman for the American Electric Power Company of Columbus, Ohio, the nation's biggest user of coal.</p>
        <p>The burning of coal, oil and other combustion energy sources produces carbon dioxide, a natural constituent of the atmosphere. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide are thought to be responsible for half the greenhouse effect. There is good reason to do something now to curb that production, many experts argue; enough carbon dioxide has been sent into the atmosphere already, they say, to cause a significant temperature increase - and energy use continues to grow.</p>
        <p>Indeed, scientists are already scrambling to think of ways to limit the potential effects. And Congress is weighing what it can do. Curiously, business, which produces most of the energy used and whose products are so energy-dependent, seems largely to have stayed out of the debate.</p>
        <p>Perhaps for good reason. Barring some futuristic technological solution that scientists can now only fantasize about, the choices facing business - as well as policy makers - are tough ones.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the magnitude of the changes could easily dwarf the conservation efforts of the early 1970's sparked by the oil embargo. This time around, cutbacks in energy use and the search for alternative energy sources would be just the beginning.</p>
        <p>The main event would likely involve a fundamental restructuring of every industry that is dependent on energy, as well as the energy industry itself. In particular, the warming trend poses critical problems for coal producers and users, unless cost-effective pollution control techniques can be developed. At the same time, it could provide new life for nuclear power, which produces virtually no greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The gases thought to be responsible for the greenhouse effect - besides carbon dioxide, they include methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons - are a byproduct of many industrial processes. But mostly they are produced when fossil fuels are burned in boilers, furnaces and car engines. The gases cause the earth's surface to warm by trapping the infrared radiation that otherwise would be reflected back into space, just as a greenhouse keeps in heat that would otherwise escape.</p>
        <p>A change of just a few degrees in atmospheric temperature over the next century could be catastrophic. A parade of scientists appearing before a Senate committee in June painted a graphic picture of what that could mean: melting icecaps and rising sea levels that would inundate seaboard cities and drown thousands in fierce storms; rainfall shifts that would make the deserts bloom and turn breadbaskets into dustbowls; and, of course, heat everywhere.</p>
        <p>Proposals are coming from various camps to meet the potential threat. Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, has introduced a bill to spend $4.3 billion to study ways to combat the greenhouse effect. The bill, which would provide more money for conservation research and for a new generation of nuclear plants, is sure to have a host of competitors.</p>
        <p>But the challenge confronting all the planners is the scope of the greenhouse issue. ''If this is a problem,'' American Electric's Mr. Crawford said, ''it is so global and so diffuse in our economy, it's going to be very hard to come up with a strategy.''</p>
        <p>THE heart of the problem, said Jay Agarwal, vice president for technology assessment of Charles River Associates, a consulting firm based in Boston, is that energy consumption is fundamental to the economy. ''You can't make steel without energy, or make copper, or aluminum, or food, or clothing,'' he said. ''The transformation of things we eat, things we consume, all takes energy.''</p>
        <p>And energy, to a large degree, currently means the combustion of hydrocarbons in coal, oil and gas - and the resulting production of carbon dioxide. Combustion provides nearly 90 percent of the energy needs of the United States. The balance comes from hydroelectric power, which has a limited potential for expansion, and nuclear fission, which has been consigned to slow extinction in this country because of its high cost and safety concerns.</p>
        <p>Before concerns about global warming, carbon dioxide was considered a harmless byproduct of combustion. But if it comes to be considered a pollutant, a new pecking order could emerge among energy sources.</p>
        <p>The two criteria that have determined the choice of fossil fuels for more than a century are price and availability. The new standard would be how much carbon dioxide a fuel produces. For the amount of heat that results in four pounds of carbon dioxide when coal is used, oil would produce only three pounds and natural gas, two.</p>
        <p>Switching to fuels that produce less carbon dioxide would require huge dislocation. The Shell Oil Company, for example, estimates that in 1987, total world energy production of hydrocarbon fuels was the equivalent of 135 million barrels of oil a day. Of that amount, 32 percent was coal, 45 percent was oil and only 23 percent was natural gas, the best of the lot.</p>
        <p>Shifts are possible, but they would create new strategic problems. The United States has enough coal to last more than 300 years, but there are just a few decades' worth of gas reserves at current rates of consumption. While there is more gas to be discovered, the total would still be a small fraction of the coal supply.</p>
        <p>At the moment, some utilities are interested in gas, especially for a new generation of power plants that produces more electricity and useful steam from a given quantity of fuel. Over all, however, energy users have considered natural gas unattractive because of questions about availability and whether the price will remain competitive in years to come. Demand is low and production has fallen by more than 25 percent since the early 1970's; recently natural gas has lost market share to cheaper oil. And coal is far cheaper than either.</p>
        <p>The biggest users of coal - and therefore, perhaps, the biggest greenhouse targets - are the electric utilities. American utilities alone contribute 7.5 percent of the world's carbon dioxide output, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. If the utilities could curb their carbon dioxide production, the benefits would be twofold. Their own electricity would be ''cleaner,'' and more electricity could be used to heat homes and run factories, replacing fossil fuels burned in boilers and furnaces. With a few advances in battery technology and provisions for easy recharging, electricity could begin to replace gasoline to power cars.</p>
        <p>But producing ''clean'' electricity now is not practical. The utilities have already spent billions of dollars to install equipment to capture the sulfur dioxide created by their plants that is linked to acid rain. In theory, they could install equipment to capture carbon dioxide, as well. The cost would be staggering, however.</p>
        <p>A study earlier this year by the Brookhaven National Laboratory, commissioned by the Department of Energy, estimated that the capital cost of installing the technology would be 70 to 150 percent of the cost of the original plant. The average cost of electricity itself, the study estimated, would rise 75 percent. And there are equally daunting concerns about storing the millions of tons of carbon dioxide gas that would be captured each year.</p>
        <p>Another possibility for the utilities would be more nuclear plants. There are 109 nuclear plants licensed to operate in the United States, but the technology became uneconomic in the early 70's and the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 raised safety concerns that have not receded. As a result, all plants ordered after 1974 were canceled or abandoned during construction.</p>
        <p>THE manufacturers, not surprisingly, think it is time to bring them back, especially in light of the greenhouse effect. At the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, for example, Richard J. Slember, vice president and general manager of the energy systems unit, ran down the list of technologies his division, the energy systems business unit, is doing business and research in: photovoltaics (or electricity directly from sunlight), windmills, coal, waste-to-energy plants, fuel cells (which combine oxygen and hydrogen to make water and electricity) and coal-bed methane production (in which a burnable gas is made in coal mines).</p>
        <p>''It seems that the major solution that's available presently is to stop burning,'' he said. ''The only one you're really left with, in a very pragmatic sense, is nuclear.''</p>
        <p>Westinghouse, which has sold some plants overseas during the long hiatus in American orders, is working on what it calls ''a new half-generation'' of reactors, with more backup safety systems and a ''user-friendly'' standardized design. Besides offering improved safety, the new design would be far more economical, the company said.</p>
        <p>To some, the Westinghouse program and similar ideas from other reactor builders make nuclear energy more attractive than it used to be. Senator Wirth said at a hearing earlier this summer that it might be time for the country to get over its case of ''nuclear measles,'' and his bill calls for spending $500 million on research for a reactor that would be ''passively safe,'' with non-mechanical features to prevent meltdown, and which would minimize the volume of nuclear waste.</p>
        <p>''We have to re-think nuclear,'' he said. ''We really have to start all over again, but we've got time to do it.'' Some climate changes may already be inevitable, he said, and mankind will be fighting the greenhouse problem for decades. ''The environmentalists will come around,'' he added. ''They can't help but come around.''</p>
        <p>But some experts are not convinced. ''Let's remember why nuclear power died before we suddenly say let's restart it,'' said John Ahearne, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now a vice president of Resources for the Future, a Washington study group. ''Costs were rising rapidly, a number of plants were seen to be operated very poorly and electricity demand wasn't there.''</p>
        <p>''How does the greenhouse effect change that?'' Mr. Ahearne asked. ''It's really only the electricity issue. The greenhouse question for the first time says, maybe all those coal plants should be significantly cut back or closed. But the first two problems don't automatically go away.''</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists are reviewing their options. ''I think it's time to re-think our energy policy as a whole,'' said Jan Beyea, a scientist at the Audubon Society, which is based in New York. ''I don't think the current generation of nuclear plants is a viable option, even if one wanted to solve the greenhouse problem that way. With public fears, you're just not going to get enough built.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Beyea said, ''There certainly should be research into inherently safe nuclear power plants, provided that an equal amount is put into photovoltaics.'' He added that photovoltaic cells were likely to be a cheaper energy source.</p>
        <p>Others believe the construction of new reactors should be made contingent on solving the nuclear waste problem. ''The waste problem is of overwhelming importance,'' said Lynn A. Greenwalt, vice president for resources conservation of the Washington-based National Wildlife Federation.</p>
        <p>Even without safety concerns, the higher costs of nuclear power would appear to be prohibitive.</p>
        <p>But nuclear energy has the edge over a conservation approach to the problem in at least one respect, said David G. Hawkins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. ''You're dealing with human beings whose psychology tends to be dominated by what appears to be the easiest fix,'' he said. ''How do you get attention focused on more diverse issues like energy efficiency, when you're sitting at a table with nuclear people who say, 'Here, we're willing to sell you the answer, in a technological box'?''</p>
        <p>A general increase in energy efficiency, from gas mileage in autos and trucks to foot-candles per watt in light bulbs, would be a faster and cheaper answer to the greenhouse effect than building more nuclear plants, environmentalists say. And the conservation route is certainly within reach. ''In West Germany today, per capita energy consumption is just about half what it is in the U.S.,'' Mr. Hawkins said.</p>
        <p>Scott G. Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, a coalition of environmental and anti-nuclear groups in Washington, made a similar point. ''Today we spend 10 percent of our G.N.P. on energy,'' he said. ''Japan, our primary competitor in many areas of the economy, spends only 5 percent on energy.''</p>
        <p>The group favors increasing the Federal standards for car and truck mileage, which were scheduled to rise to 27.5 miles per gallon but which the Reagan Administration lowered to 26. ''If we want to mine for oil, Detroit is the biggest field we have,'' Mr. Denman said. ''We can be contributing to a healthier economy and a healthier environment,'' he added, suggesting that the standard be doubled over the next few decades.</p>
        <p>EFFICIENCY can also be achieved by getting more power from each ton of fuel used to produce energy. Mr. Moomaw of the World Resources Institute, for example, foresees a strong future for a new model of generators, of a type under development by the General Electric Company. The generators are expected to be about 25 percent more efficient than current models.</p>
        <p>In the long term, many existing technologies may benefit from the fear of the greenhouse effect. Mr. Moomaw points to the burning of trash to make electricity, an idea that cities are turning to as they exhaust their landfill space.</p>
        <p>Trash burning has environmental hazards of its own, producing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. But the landfill process produces methane gas, which also contributes to the greenhouse effect. As long as garbage results in greenhouse gases of one kind or another, Mr. Moomaw suggested, society should try to get the maximum energy benefit from it; the electricity generated by burning trash could replace some generated from coal or oil.</p>
        <p>Another obvious technology is photovoltaic solar power, whose cost is dropping but is still not competitive. Engineers at the Electric Power Research Institute have recently made enough progress in the fabrication of photovoltaic cells to suggest that the technology will soon be competitive with the more expensive fossil-fired electric plants.</p>
        <p>The importance of future technological innovation is difficult to measure. ''It's hard to imagine powering 20th century industry with sunshine,'' said Gerald Kraft, an analyst at Charles River Associates. ''But maybe we can. Nobody knows.'' And nobody knows, as the long hot summer of '88 draws to a close, just how serious the greenhouse effect will prove to be.</p>
        <p>But while it is too soon for a scientific consensus about the extent of the warming trend, most experts say enough evidence already exists to place everyone - business included - on the alert.  A PAIR OF PAINFUL SIDE EFFECTS</p>
        <p>THE greenhouse effect has some odd twists. One is that it will probably raise electric demand, and thus help perpetuate itself.</p>
        <p>The Electric Power Research Institute calculated that an increase of slightly under 1 degree centigrade in atmospheric temperature by the year 2015 would make it necessary for utilities in the Southeast and New York to have 10 to 20 percent more generating capacity.</p>
        <p>That capacity is most likely to come from additional burning of fossil fuels, which will create more of the gases that cause the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Another twist concerns chlorofluorocarbons, which contribute to the greenhouse effect and also help to destroy ozone in the stratosphere. Curbing chlorofluorocarbons to stem the depletion of the ozone layer would also help to ease the greenhouse effect. But according to one theory, easing the greenhouse effect would damage the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>That is because the rate of ozone destruction increases with the temperature of the stratosphere, according to Douglas G. Cogan, a researcher at the Investor Responsibility Research Center and the author of a recent study of the problem.</p>
        <p>If heat cannot escape the lower atmosphere because of the greenhouse effect, then it cannot heat the upper atmosphere, and the loss of ozone is slowed.</p>
        <p>But if the greenhouse effect is curbed and the upper atmosphere heats up, the global ozone loss may increase, and with it the risk of cancer.</p>
