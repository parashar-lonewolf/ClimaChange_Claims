        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>RED SKY AT MORNING: America and the Crisis of the Global Environment, by James Gustave Speth. (Yale University, $24.) A profoundly sobering study, by an environmental adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton, of the nation's failure to address the probability of global warming both in the past, when there might have been time, and now, when there may not.</p>
        <p>SONTAG &amp; KAEL: Opposites Attract Me, by Craig Seligman. (Counterpoint, $23.) An eager, confiding book, by an experienced writer and editor, about two widely discussed and influential critical icons who arose at the same historical moment (mid-1960's). They come to represent a quarrel, never explicit, between attitudes that Kael might call solemnity and that Sontag might call frivolity.</p>
        <p>BIRTH OF THE CHESS QUEEN: A History, by Marilyn Yalom. (HarperCollins, $24.95.) A wide-ranging exploration of the origins of chess and of its most powerful piece, the queen. Chess was once queenless, and Yalom attributes the queen's arrival and empowerment to the rising status of women in medieval Europe.</p>
        <p>INSIDE THE VICTORIAN HOME: A Portrait of Domestic Life in Victorian England, by Judith Flanders. (Norton, $34.95.) A nimble piece of social history that draws from archives, novels, advice manuals and newspapers to show home becoming what it still ideally is: a refuge from the Industrial Revolution and an expression of morality sequestered from the harsh world.</p>
        <p>PORT MUNGO, by Patrick McGrath. (Knopf, $24.) This immensely clever, tautly composed novel concerns a Gauguinistic artist who flees the suffocating confines of London for New York, then Havana, then Port Mungo, at the end of world and mind, where his genius flourishes. Unless it doesn't, since we learn that the narrator of all this is quite unreliable and full of hidden purpose.</p>
        <p>THE CREATION OF THE MEDIA: Political Origins of Modern Communications, by Paul Starr. (Basic Books, $27.50.) A scholar's cautious, detailed, convincing account of the deliberate framing of information carriers, from cheap postage to privatized electronics (telegraph, telephone, radio) to saturation by movies, networks and magazines.</p>
        <p>THE FATE OF FAMILY FARMING: Variations on an American Idea, by Ronald Jager. (University Press of New England, $26.) Jager, a former Yale philosophy professor and onetime farm boy, argues for a connection between healthy agriculture and a healthy democratic society; both require strength, endurance, independence, responsibility, skepticism and sometimes even crankiness.</p>
        <p>YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN THE LAND OF THE FREE, by James Kelman. (Harcourt, $25.) Jeremiah Brown, Kelman's hero in this novel, is a down-and-outer, authority hater and epic drinkist. Brought up Glaswegian, he has lived in the United States for 12 years and acquired the analytical powers that make this paranoid performance, set mainly in bars, a brilliant gloss on the political and social reverberations of 9/11 in this country.</p>
