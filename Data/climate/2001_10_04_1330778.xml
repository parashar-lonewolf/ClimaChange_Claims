        <p>Some 35 forest fires have ravaged almost 200 square miles in Russia's far east near the China border this week, officials said.  The Emergencies Ministry said its firefighting efforts were hamstrung by a lack of equipment; only one airplane and two helicopters are in use, said a spokeswoman in Khabarovsk, only miles from the fire zone.  Carbon dioxide levels in Khabarovsk were said to be five times higher than what is considered safe.</p>
