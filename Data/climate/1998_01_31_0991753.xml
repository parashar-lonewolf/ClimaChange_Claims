        <p>Support for Hussein Is Said to Deepen in Iraq  Many diplomats, business executives and residents of Baghdad say that despite the hardships imposed by the embargo, political support for President Saddam Hussein is growing.</p>

        <p>France moved closer to acceptance of military action unless Iraq allowed inspections of suspected chemical and biological weapons sites to resume.</p>

        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright expressed skepticism about a diplomatic solution, but her Russian counterpart asserted after their meeting in Madrid that the negotiating process was just beginning. At the United Nations, China called for a peaceful solution.</p>

        <p>Pacific Skies May Open  The United States and Japan agreed to remove most restrictions on air traffic between the two countries, ending one of their largest trade disputes. Some airlines will see their restrictions removed, and airlines from any nation will be allowed to team up and offer the same flights. But the pact did not set aside more landing slots for the new flights at Narita airport, outside Tokyo.</p>

        <p>The Party Grows in China  As China shifts toward market economics and flirts with consumerism, university students are flocking to join the governing Communist Party. Whether seeking power and personal gain or drawn by the party's philosophy, they have helped to raise party membership to an historic high of 58 million, 10 million more than in 1989, the year of the massacre at Tiananmen Square.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The State Department reported that China took ''positive steps on human rights'' in the last year. The department's previous annual report on human rights found that all dissent against the Government had been ''effectively silenced.''</p>

        <p>New Clashes in Kenya  A new round of tribal clashes has broken out in Kenya's Rift Valley, claiming at least 80 lives in the last two weeks. The police said the killings were the work of cattle rustlers. But opposition leaders and clerics said the violence was part of a drive to force Kikuyu people out of the fertile Rift Valley, which is a political stronghold of President Daniel arap Moi. Most Kikuyu voted against Mr. Moi in last month's election.</p>

        <p>Drug Link in Mexican Inquest  The gangland-style execution of a federal police commander in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, across from El Paso, Tex., has upset a Government inquiry into the disappearance of scores of people. The police officer had ties to narcotics traffickers, according to Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar. He said he intended to appoint new prosecutors and detectives to carry out the sensitive investigation. At least 90 people, including several Americans, have vanished in the border city since early 1994.</p>

        <p>Ex-White House Worker Defends Her Credibility  Linda R. Tripp, the former White House worker who secretly taped some of her conversations with the former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, issued a statement defending her credibility and accusing the White House of a ''smear'' campaign. She also asserted that she had witnessed Ms. Lewinsky receiving an early-morning phone call from Mr. Clinton. The grand jury heard testimony from Evelyn Lieberman, the former White House deputy chief of staff who had Ms. Lewinsky transferred to the Pentagon, and from Bob Weiner of the President's drug control policy office, who had called Maryland Democratic officials concerning the legality of Ms. Tripp's taping.</p>

        <p>Lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones have been unable to find credible new witnesses willing to swear that they had a sexual relationship with President Clinton, witnesses and lawyers say. In pretrial depositions, at least five women have denied rumors of such a relationship. Only two women have described affairs with Mr. Clinton, and their accounts were known before the Jones lawsuit was filed. Two other women have provided sworn depositions describing encounters that echo aspects of Ms. Jones's claims.</p>

        <p>Gambling, On Line  Bookmakers have set up operations in Central America and West Indies countries like Antigua, where they have created jobs for local residents, and, often using the Internet, have rapidly built an offshore sports book industry that gaming analysts say is taking in 1 to 5 percent of the $100 billion that is illegally bet on sports each year in the United States.</p>

        <p>Abortion Clinic Blast  More than 100 investigators in Birmingham, Ala., interviewed witnesses and searched a four-block area for clues in the bombing of an abortion clinic on Thursday that killed an off-duty police officer. The clinic's head nurse was in critical condition with with wounds to her face, abdomen and legs. Investigators were considering the possibility that the bombing might be linked to explosions in Atlanta over the past two years.</p>

        <p>Tax Credits for Efficient Cars  The Clinton Administration is proposing generous tax credits for consumers who buy advanced cars that use emerging technologies to go two or three times as far on a gallon of gas as today's models. The credits would lower an auto buyer's Federal income tax bill by $3,000 to $4,000, substantially cutting the net cost of vehicles that are likely, at first, to be more expensive than today's models. The subsidies, which would begin in 2000, are at the center of a $6.3 billion package to fight the threat of global warming caused by emissions from burning fossil fuels.</p>

        <p>Glue Instead of Stitches  Scientific advisers recommended that the Government approve the nation's first surgical glue, a modified version of Super Glue that can be a painless way to close wounds instead of using stitches or staples.</p>

        <p>Grand Jury Clears Officer In Killing of Unarmed Man  Michael J. Davitt, a police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man, William J. Whitfield, 22, in a Brooklyn grocery store last month, was cleared of all criminal charges. A grand jury found his actions justified under a law governing the use of deadly force, officials said.</p>

        <p>Food Stamp Waiver Is Sought  Governor Pataki sought a second waiver of Federal welfare rules that require able-bodied adults to work for food stamps, virtually guaranteeing that thousands of New Yorkers would keep their benefits.</p>

        <p>Budget Gets Mixed Reviews  Financial experts who watch the city's finances reacted positively to Mayor Giuliani's budget proposals, but advocates for social programs questioned his handling of the city's $1.2 billion surplus.</p>

        <p>A Witness Finds Own Trouble  Government prosecutors in the drug-racketeering trial of the nightclub owner Peter Gatien, left, had to abandon a witness who they had hoped would provide important evidence against him, court records showed. The witness was arrested and charged with lying about her selling of drugs, the records showed. Mr. Gatien is accused of turning two Manhattan clubs into ''drug supermarkets.''</p>
