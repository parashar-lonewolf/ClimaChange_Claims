        <p>LEAD: The tropical rain forest, nature's great but beleaguered treasure house, may face a somewhat less gloomy future if experts gathered here have their way.</p>
        <p>The tropical rain forest, nature's great but beleaguered treasure house, may face a somewhat less gloomy future if experts gathered here have their way.</p>
        <p>Delegates from 42 nations are attending a 10-day conference of the International Tropic Timber Organization, a new body and the first to bring together the owners of the world's rain forests and the rich nations that consume their precious but dwindling hardwood trees.</p>
        <p>The organization is essentially a trading group, but the underlying theme here is the survival of the rain forests. And two questions appear to dominate all others on the agenda: Can new techniques make the rain forest profitable while keeping it alive? If so, who will pay for this?</p>
        <p>''Everyone here is very aware that world pressure to safeguard the tropical forests is growing,'' said Peter Ashton, professor of biology at Harvard University and a consultant to the organization. ''This is a very different world from 10 years ago. There is great pressure on both producers and consumers of hardwoods.'' Forests Dwindling Rapidly</p>
        <p>Mainly because of timber harvesting, the spread of farming and the collection of wood for fuel, forests in many tropical regions are dwindling rapidly, at a rate of nearly 30 million acres a year. Experts say this is causing shortages of valuable timber and environmental problems like soil erosion and the extinction of plant and animal species. Widespread destruction of tropical trees may also contribute to the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that scientists fear is causing a global warming known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Much of the pressure to save the forests has come from international conservation groups, whose representatives have also arrived here in large number to prod and buttonhole delegates and journalists. They say they are determined to keep the timber conference to its charter, which accepts the need to regenerate rather than despoil the tropical forests.</p>
        <p>The conservationists, who include foresters, agronomists and biologists, say they are supporting the organization and appear to have formed an uneasy alliance with the timber concerns that sell the trees. 'This Is Worth Pursuing'</p>
        <p>''This is the only arena where producers and consumers are together and have an explicit mandate toward conservation,'' said Kenneth Cook, an American representative of the World Wildlife Fund. ''We feel this is worth pursuing and supporting.''</p>
        <p>In asides, however, some of the European lobbyists say they will stage street protests actions against some of the members here should the organization be of no help in halting the rapid destruction of the forests.</p>
        <p>Delegates and lobbyists warn that the organization is still a tenuous one and, in the view of one American delegate, a ''body that is still trying to find its niche.''</p>
        <p>After almost 10 years of talks, the group was formed nearly two years ago and its members represent 95 percent of the tropical timber trade. This meeting is the group's third and its first in a producing nation. Brazil has almost a third of the tropical forests in the world.</p>
        <p>The group has been short of money, and of the rich nations, only Japan, Switzerland and the Netherlands have pledged contributions for projects. Several, including the United States, are in arrears in their dues. Japan a Big Supporter</p>
        <p>Most support has come from Japan, the single largest importer of tropical hardwood. It lobbied hard to become the seat of the organization's headquarters, which opened in Yokohama last year.</p>
        <p>Divisions run deep. The rich countries say they want to stabilize their supply. The poor countries who own the forests say that the rich importers control prices and refuse to pay enough to permit large-scale replanting.</p>
        <p>They call the timber trade a classic example of the economic distortions between the developed and developing world. While the nations of the tropics export almost $6 billion worth of logs and planks yearly, the same nations import more than $10 billion worth of finished wood products.</p>
        <p>''We need better wood prices for investments,'' said Julio Centeno, a Venezuelan forester. ''When we say, let's talk about the world trade, we're losing more than $3 billion, the countries from the North here get angry and refuse.''</p>
        <p>There appears to be wide agreement, however, that more thoughtful exploitation can protect forests without depriving consumers in the United States, Europe and Japan of precious wood for home construction and furniture. 'Sustainable Resource'</p>
        <p>The phrase most widely heard here, even among conservationists, is the need to manage the rain forest as a ''sustainable resource,'' which is another way of saying that it can be harvested in perpetuity. But no nation, they say, has yet used this strategy successfully.</p>
        <p>''Sustained management requires a total change of attitude toward the forest,'' said Gerardo Bodowsky, a Costa Rican agronomist and one of the earliest expounders of this idea. ''It means not cutting all the best species and letting the forest degrade.''</p>
        <p>So far, the discussion of who will pay for experiments in ''sustained management'' has taken up much conference time, to the exasperation of some delegates and many conservationists. They argue that there is no time to waste on years of bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>''There is enough technical knowledge now to manage the tropical forest,'' said Ronald van der Giessen, a Dutch forester, ''It is held back only by a lack of political will.''</p>
