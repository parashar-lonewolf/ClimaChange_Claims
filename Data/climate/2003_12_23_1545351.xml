      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A Danish government agency has concluded that a scientific ethics panel erred earlier this year when it ruled that a popular book on environmental trends displayed ''scientific dishonesty.''</p>
        <p>The book, ''The Skeptical Environmentalist,'' by Dr. Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish statistician, rebuts contentions by environmental groups that the planet is in peril and has been acclaimed by conservative groups and some scientists since it was published in English in 2001.</p>
        <p>Last January, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty said Dr. Lomborg had used ''systematic one-sidedness'' in selecting data. The report led to calls for Dr. Lomborg's removal from the directorship of a government agency that examines environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>But last week the Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation said the committee had exhibited ''significant neglect'' by failing to identify where the author had been dishonest, and had been ''clearly wrong'' for failing to offer Dr. Lomborg a chance to respond before its findings were published.</p>
        <p>The rebuke is not a formal rejection of the report. Most of the ministry's criticisms were of the panel's methods, not its findings. About those, the ministry said the panel had relied entirely on a review of previous criticisms of the book.</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message, Dr. Lomborg said he felt vindicated. ''It is clear from the Ministry of Science decision that the committee's verdict cannot still be said to stand,'' Dr. Lomborg wrote. ''With this smear exposed, it means that we can get back to arguments over environmental prioritization based on facts, not mudslinging.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lomborg's book reviewed reams of data on forests, climate change, food supplies, population growth and other issues, challenging what he called the ''environmental litany'': predictions of imminent crises from rising temperatures, dwindling resources and destruction of habitat.</p>
        <p>The book has been criticized elsewhere, notably in Scientific American, which in January 2002 published an 11-page deconstruction of Dr. Lomborg's arguments and later engaged in a series of rebuttals and counterrebuttals with him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Patrick J. Michaels, a climate scientist with the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington, said the criticisms of Dr. Lomborg were part of a broader effort by ''the keepers of the environmental-gloom paradigm'' to attack anyone with a contrarian view.</p>
