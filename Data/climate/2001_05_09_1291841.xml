        <p>Administration and congressional officials  expressed anger today at the United Nations for the loss of a United States seat on the Human Rights Commission, and influential Republicans and Democrats in the House  threatened to hold $244 million in dues to the organization if Washington's seat is not restored next year.</p>

        <p>Administration and congressional officials  expressed anger today at the United Nations for the loss of a United States seat on the Human Rights Commission, and influential Republicans and Democrats in the House  threatened to hold $244 million in dues to the organization if Washington's seat is not restored next year.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview this evening, shortly after the House deal  was reached, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell acknowledged that American officials had been taken by surprise by members of the United Nations Economic and Social Council who voted the United States off the panel in a secret ballot last week. ''One thing I can guarantee you is that we will be back on it next year,'' General Powell said today.</p>
        <p>He said that the vote, combined with another secret ballot that resulted in the loss of the American seat on the International Narcotics Control Board, reflected the fact that ''we left a little blood on the floor'' in votes involving the Palestinians, Cuba and China, and that a number of countries were looking to retaliate.</p>
        <p>General Powell spoke as the Administration was both venting its anger over the committee seats and attempting to head off a movement in Congress to cut off American funding for the United Nations. In the last days of the Clinton administration, the United States agreed to pay more than a billion dollars in back dues.</p>
        <p>Today, Democratic and Republican leaders of the House International Affairs Committee agreed to go ahead with the next United Nations dues payment of $582 million. But in an effort by Republicans to calm conservatives who are demanding a cutoff of money to the United Nations, an accord was reached in which a later payment of roughly $244 million would be withheld unless the United States is reinstated. The next election for slots on the Human Rights Commission is in spring 2002.</p>
        <p>Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, predicted that when the House took up a bill later this week on State Department programs it would vote to restrict the repayment of some of the dues.  ''This is an affront,'' he said, ''more to the whole notion of international human rights than it is to us as a nation.''</p>
        <p>General Powell did not say whether he thought withholding dues might  further inflame relations between the United Nations and Washington. ''We have to look at the language,'' he said. General Powell, in a telephone call he made to The New York Times, said a number of countries were seeking to dilute American influence at the United Nations. ''As one of my colleagues here said, this was a vote looking for a venue to happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The ratcheting up of pressure on the United Nations began today at the White House, where Mr. Bush's spokesman, Air Fleischer, blamed the countries that had reneged on promises to the United States to vote for American seats on both panels.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to be committed to the cause of human rights when you've put Sudan and Libya on a panel that's dedicated to fighting for the cause of human rights,'' he said in a briefing. ''The real losers in this equation are people around the world who are struggling to be free.''</p>
        <p>But in private, some American officials acknowledged that they had failed to detect a sea change in the 54-member Economic and Social Council, which selects the members of the human rights and drug commissions.</p>
        <p>China had quietly lobbied to get the United States removed, striking back for the annual resolution that Washington sponsors condemning Beijing's treatment of dissidents and, this year, the Falun Gong movement.</p>
        <p>Other developing nations joined. Europe's vote was split: Three European countries and the United States were vying for three slots. France received 52 votes, Austria 41, and Sweden 32. The United States came in fourth, with 29, losing the seat it has held since Eleanor Roosevelt helped establish the commission.</p>
        <p>Some American officials say the seat might have been saved if the American nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, John Negroponte, had been confirmed by the Senate and in place. Others say that the Bush administration had relied too heavily on the 43 promises from other nations that they would vote to keep the United States on the panel. Such vows are regularly broken.</p>
        <p>Tonight General Powell said he was ''reviewing the vote to see if we were not anticipating things right.'' But he declined to release a list of the countries, 14 of which voted for other nations. ''I think that would just complicate our relations with those countries,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also defended the diplomat temporarily running the United States mission at the United Nations, James Cunningham. ''He's no rookie,'' General Powell said. ''We just have to take our hit and move on.''</p>
        <p>The loss of the seat on the Human Rights Commission has a practical effect: The United States cannot sponsor resolutions within the group, like the resolutions it offered up earlier this year condemning China and Cuba for their human rights violations. The China resolution failed; the Cuba resolution passed.</p>
        <p>Now at least for the next year, those countries do not have to worry about dealing directly with the Bush administration. If the United States wants to renew those resolutions next year, it must find another country on the committee to act as the main sponsor, and the United States will not be able to vote.</p>
        <p>The loss of the seat on the International Narcotics Control Board has a less dramatic effect. The 13-member board monitors compliance with United Nations' drug conventions on trafficking and substance abuse, but has little real power. Herbert Okun, the American representative for the past decade, was voted off the panel. Iran, Brazil, Peru, India, the Netherlands, France and Austria were elected to the board.</p>
        <p>General Powell said tonight that ''A lot of this has to do with the aggressiveness with which we have pressed our human rights agenda.'' But he said ''we will continue to show that aggressiveness this year.''</p>
        <p>Harder to measure, however, is whether the vote was also a reflection of mounting resentment over  America's role as the world's sole superpower, and the Bush administration's suggestions that it would walk away from the Kyoto treaty on global warming and eventually replace the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>When the United Nations vote took place on Thursday, Congress was just going out of session for the weekend, so the reaction was delayed. But when it reconvened today, the anger at the United Nations was not limited to its conservative critics.</p>
        <p>Representative Tom Lantos of California, the ranking Democrat on the House International Affairs committee, reached the accord on back dues with Henry J. Hyde, the Republican chairman of the committee.  ''The vote to exclude the U.S. from the U.N.H.R.C. last week was outrageous and only damaged the institution and undermined the cause of human rights worldwide,'' he said. But he added, ''We should not compound the damage by withholding the bulk of our arrears payments to the United Nations.''</p>
