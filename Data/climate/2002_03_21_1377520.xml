        <p>As debate flares anew over White House plans to revise air pollution regulations, a study that ranks the biggest air polluters in the power industry is expected to be issued today.</p>
        <p>The study was conducted by two environmental organizations and a large New Jersey utility and uses government data. It contends that a handful of companies accounts for at least half of the industry's most noxious emissions, including those that contribute to smog, acid rain and possibly global warming. Moreover, the study shows a wide disparity in the relative level of emissions produced by power plants, a gap that the authors say reflects the level of investment that companies have made toward improving their environmental performance.</p>
        <p>The report's release is timed to sway the current discussion about revisions to air pollution rules.</p>
        <p>One author, David Gardiner, said such changes could end up protecting the biggest polluters and removing incentives for the industry as a whole to reduce its rate of emissions.</p>
        <p>''The very large disparity between the cleanest and the dirtiest companies,'' said Mr. Gardiner, one of the report's lead authors and the former director of climate change policy in the Clinton administration, ''demonstrates that a large number of companies are relatively clean, and a relatively small number are responsible for the vast portion of emissions. It shows that clean electricity is both possible and profitable.''</p>
        <p>The study, ''Benchmarking Air Emissions of the 100 Largest Electric Generation Owners in the U.S. -- 2000,'' is a collaboration between the environmental groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, and the utility, the Public Service Enterprise Group,  based in Newark.</p>
        <p>P.S.E.G., as the utility is known, reached a settlement in January with the federal Environmental Protection Agency that calls for the company to invest more than $300 million in the next decade to reduce emissions from its coal-fired plants in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The study relies primarily on data that companies provided to the E.P.A. and the Energy Department for 2000. It details which corporations are the largest polluters and the relative emission levels of various pollutants by companies. In gross terms, the biggest polluters  tend to be the companies that have the most power plants and that generate the most electricity.</p>
        <p>The three largest electricity companies in the United States -- American Electric Power, the Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority -- together accounted for 17 percent to 24 percent of total industry emissions of the four pollutants tracked in the study. Those are sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to acid rain and haze; mercury, which is toxic to humans; and carbon dioxide, which is widely linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>Southern, the Tennessee Valley Authority and other energy companies high on the study's list have lobbied the Bush administration strenuously to ease air pollution regulations, according to environmentalists, government officials and Washington lobbyists.</p>
        <p>The study also ranks companies  based on the amount of pollution produced relative to their power output. By that measure, Basin Electric Power Cooperative, a relatively small utility in Bismarck, N.D., that relies primarily on coal-fired power plants to supply over 100 rural electric co-ops, was identified as producing the highest output of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity. But the company contends that its plants are among the cleanest coal-burning plants in the nation.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Aquila, a midsize utility in Kansas City, Mo., was 52nd among the 100 companies for the total amount of nitrogen oxides emitted, which reflects how many fewer plants it has, compared with the likes of American Electric Power.</p>
        <p>But Aquila's plants emit significantly more nitrogen oxides than American Electric Power's for each measure of energy generated, the study's data show. Aquila, formerly known as Utilicorp United, ranks third among companies that have the highest relative level of nitrogen oxide emissions, while American Electric Power ranks 11th.</p>
        <p>The study points out that relative pollution levels vary according to the kinds of power plants. For example, utilities with a preponderance of plants using natural gas or nuclear fuel produce smaller relative pollutant levels than those with mostly coal-fired plants. Yet even among coal-fired plants, Aquila ends up third for nitrogen oxide emissions, according to the study.</p>
        <p>The companies cited in the study did not have the opportunity to read it before its official publication. But based on information he received about the report, Ethan Hirsh, a spokesman for Aquila, contended that it failed to take note of how his company had improved its environmental performance. ''We're constantly improving our emissions reductions,'' Mr. Hirsh said. ''Looking strictly at the numbers would fool you a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Pat Hemplepp, a spokesman for American Electric Power, said the study was ''giving you a snapshot of a year rather than a movie of what's been happening over the last decade.'' He noted that the industry had to function within Clean Air Act requirements, which grow more stringent with time, and that his company had reduced its emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides since 1990 and would continue to do so.</p>
        <p>But Mark Brownstein, director of environmental policy at P.S.E.G., noted that such a benchmark report was routinely done in the industry to compare companies on things like safety or earnings. P.S.E.G. itself fell within the 25 companies with the highest rate of sulfur dioxide emissions at their coal plants, a result that showed the company how much work it still had to do, he said.</p>
        <p>''This is to get a sense of companies that have made investments in cleaner technology versus those that haven't,'' he said. ''It asks: 'What kind of company are you? How are your investments paying off?' ''</p>
