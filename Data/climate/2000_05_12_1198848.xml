        <p>The Ford Motor Company, which depends on sport utility vehicles for much of its profit, acknowledged today that they cause serious safety and environmental problems.</p>
        <p>In its first ''corporate citizenship report,'' issued at the company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford said that the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted more smog-causing pollution and endangered other motorists.

        <p>The Ford Motor Company, which depends on sport utility vehicles for much of its profit, acknowledged today that they cause serious safety and environmental problems.</p>
        <p>In its first ''corporate citizenship report,'' issued at the company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford said that the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted more smog-causing pollution and endangered other motorists. The automaker said that it would keep building them because they provide needed profit, but would seek technological solutions to the problems and look for alternatives to the big vehicles.</p>
        <p>Ford Motor's voluntary admission that it faces an awkward situation  because its most profitable products do not meet its goals for social responsibility has few parallels, according to Business for Social Responsibility, a corporate group in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>In an interview, William C. Ford Jr., 43, the company's chairman and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, depicted the company's statements as a combination of altruism and long-term business planning. He said that he worried that automakers could wind up with reputations like those of big tobacco companies if they ignored sport utilities' problems.</p>
        <p>''The court of public opinion sometimes decides before you're ready for them to decide, and I want to make sure we're ready and ahead of the curve,'' said Mr. Ford, who became chairman 16 months ago. The company has sought to portray itself in recent months as the most environmentally responsible automaker.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Ford and Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that they had no plans to stop making sport utilities, including the immense Ford Excursion, which weighs as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees and gets just 10 miles to the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway.</p>
        <p>''If we didn't provide that vehicle, someone else would, and they wouldn't provide it as responsibly as we do,'' Mr. Ford said.</p>
        <p>For the last two years, Ford Motor has voluntarily built its sport utilities to emit far less tailpipe pollution than allowed by law. Ford has also voluntarily installed bars below the bumpers of the Excursion to reduce the risk that it will override cars during collisions, even though there are no federal regulations on this.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists welcomed the automaker's stance. ''While this isn't quite the fall of the Berlin Wall, we applaud Ford's recognition of the environmental and safety problems posed by S.U.V.'s,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasser cautioned that while customers consistently said in market surveys that they wanted more environmentally responsible products, they were unwilling to pay more for them or to sacrifice features on their sport utilities.</p>
        <p>With sport utilities accounting for a fifth of Ford's sales -- up from 5 percent in 1990 -- and the bulk of its profit, the automaker's stability could be affected if the sport utility market slumped, warns Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency. While Ford does not release profit margins by model, financial analysts say that the company earns $10,000 to $15,000 apiece on Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators and up to $18,000 apiece on Ford Excursions.</p>
        <p>Yet today's report clearly expressed the company's concern that the big vehicles have problems. ''Sustainability concerns associated with SUV's raise issues relative to Ford's corporate citizenship commitment,'' the report said, adding: ''We believe that the steps Ford has taken to date are only a beginning in addressing the issues raised by these products. Our task is to develop additional technological solutions and identify and implement alternative ways to satisfy customers that build a sustainable competitive advantage while meeting our environmental, social and economic objectives.''</p>
        <p>While admitting that the company was not being specific, Mr. Ford said that progress was being made. ''It's sort of a 'watch this space' thing, it's going to get better as time goes on.''</p>
        <p>In a question-and-answer section of today's report, Mr. Ford said that it might be difficult to persuade Wall Street that it was worthwhile for Ford Motor to take big steps to be perceived as progressive and environmentally friendly. ''Analysts are focused on the next quarter's report, and at most, your next year's report,'' he said. ''And the kinds of issues we've been discussing today have payoffs 5, 10, 20, 50 years down the line. I do believe that I'm building a stronger Ford Motor Company for my children and grandchildren. But that's not a theme that resonates very well with most analysts.''</p>
        <p>John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that Wall Street would tolerate the company's emphasis on social responsibility provided that it did not prove enormously expensive. ''It's not going to make the stock go up, it may make the stock go down, but good companies are respected,'' he said. ''It may take years before consumers buy a Ford because it's a responsible company, but it won't take years for regulatory authorities and communities to say, 'This is a company we can work with.' ''</p>
        <p>The Ford family has a long tradition of public service, best shown by the family charity, the Ford Foundation. The Ford family controls 40 percent of the votes at Ford Motor through a special class of shares.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's comments today confirm a shift in his position on sport utilities. An ardent fly fisherman who bought his own fly fishing rod company, he has been active in environmental causes since his days at prep school and then Princeton. But he was also one of the board's most enthusiastic supporters of the decision to introduce the Expedition sport utility vehicle in 1996.</p>
        <p>Sport utilities are three times as likely as cars to kill the other driver in a crash, but the death rate for sport utility occupants is just as high as for car occupants because of sport utilities' tendency to roll over and their lack of crumple zones. While current regulations allow large sport utilities to emit up to 5.5 times the smog-causing pollution of cars, President Clinton announced rules in December that will require sport utilities to meet the same standards as cars by 2009.</p>
        <p>Business for Social Responsibility said one parallel to Ford's actions lay in BP Amoco's vow two years ago to reduce the global warming caused by oil consumption, even though it is the world's second-largest oil company. Another, less direct parallel lies in the Liggett Group's acknowledgment in March 1997 that cigarettes are addictive and cause cancer -- an admission that followed years of litigation and medical studies, the group said.</p>
        <p>Executives at DaimlerChrysler defend their record. ''We're every bit as responsible on safety and environmental issues'' as Ford, said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, while adding that ''all of the manufacturers are pursuing whatever we can do on safety while meeting consumer demands, and sometimes those are at odds.''</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler canceled plans in December to build a full-size Jeep. Bud Liebler, the vice president for marketing, said in January that one reason for the decision had been a fear that safety and environmental concerns would sour the public on large sport utility vehicles before Chrysler could get the vehicle to market.</p>
        <p>By contrast, General Motors plans to increase its production of full-size sport utilities by 20 percent next year. G.M. declined to comment today on Ford's position. G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler are roughly tied in global sport utility sales.</p>
        <p>While Ford started the sport utility boom in 1990 with the Explorer, the company has not been as aggressive in expanding production as its rivals since Mr. Ford took over the leadership of the company at the beginning of last year. And while automakers spend up to $100 million on advertising to promote a new model, Ford spent just $420,000 in the fourth quarter of last year to announce the Excursion's introduction.</p>
