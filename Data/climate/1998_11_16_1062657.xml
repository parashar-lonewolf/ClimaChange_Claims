        <p>WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED  Mapping the Secrets of the Universe, the Origins of Life and the Future of the Human Race  By John Maddox  Illustrated. 434 pages. Martin Kessler Books/ The Free Press. $26.</p>
        <p>The title of John Maddox's arresting new book, ''What Remains to Be Discovered,'' is in one sense self-contradictory, simply because you can't foresee what must still be obscure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maddox, for 23 years the editor of the journal Nature and now its editor emeritus, is the first to concede this point. In his introduction, he reviews the high points of all that has been discovered in the last four centuries, and he emphasizes how little of what was to come was discerned in the years 1700, 1800 and 1900. ''The record of previous centuries,'' he concludes, ''suggests that the excitement in the years ahead will spring from the answers to the questions we do not yet know enough to ask.''</p>

        <p>WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED  Mapping the Secrets of the Universe, the Origins of Life and the Future of the Human Race  By John Maddox  Illustrated. 434 pages. Martin Kessler Books/ The Free Press. $26.</p>
        <p>The title of John Maddox's arresting new book, ''What Remains to Be Discovered,'' is in one sense self-contradictory, simply because you can't foresee what must still be obscure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maddox, for 23 years the editor of the journal Nature and now its editor emeritus, is the first to concede this point. In his introduction, he reviews the high points of all that has been discovered in the last four centuries, and he emphasizes how little of what was to come was discerned in the years 1700, 1800 and 1900. ''The record of previous centuries,'' he concludes, ''suggests that the excitement in the years ahead will spring from the answers to the questions we do not yet know enough to ask.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he writes, if ''the nature of the discoveries that will deepen understanding of the world cannot be perfectly anticipated,'' those discoveries will tend to ''spring from current understanding, and usually from contradictions that have become apparent.''</p>
        <p>So he sets as his task in ''What Remains to Be Discovered'' a review of the current understanding of and apparent contradictions in the areas he identifies as ''Matter,'' ''Life'' and ''Our World.'' He asks the big questions and reviews the current status of answers that have been proposed. How did the universe begin? How does it work? What came first, the galaxies or the stars? How did life begin? When did sexual reproduction arise? What is consciousness? Memory? Imagination?</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, great progress has been made in offering some answers to these questions. Einstein's ''general relativity (gravitational) theory'' and the theory of quantum mechanics are ''perhaps the two outstanding intellectual achievements of this century,'' Mr. Maddox writes. ''As a direct consequence of the structure of D.N.A.,'' he continues, ''both the internal working of the cell and the mechanism of inheritance in plants and animals (including the development of embryos from fertilized eggs), has become susceptible to laboratory investigation.''</p>
        <p>And, he adds, ''the past century has marvelously described and catalogued the properties of the cells in the working brain as well as its several separate structures.'' Yet, he concludes, the more we have come to understand in these various fields, the deeper are some of the contradictions that have arisen. And out of these contradictions must come future discoveries.</p>
        <p>For instance, he argues, the fact that the amount of matter estimated in the universe ''obdurately falls short of expectation'' suggests that ''there is more to empty space than the name suggests'' and that out of it may come ''what many physicists refer to as a 'new physics,' a physics regulated by principles not yet imagined.''</p>
        <p>For another instance, he argues, the more that is understood about genetics, the more complex appears the challenge of ''understanding how a particular sequence of DNA determines the character of the organism to which it belongs.''</p>
        <p>He concludes: ''Already it seems probable that the protein products of most genes will turn out to have more than one function -- that for which they are named and several others. Like the cell biologists, geneticists will be driven to make computer models of the genome before they will be able to make sense of all this complexity.''</p>
        <p>Finally, he argues, for all that has been learned about brain cells, ''how the brain functions both in the everyday world and as the human attribute of mind is hardly clearer now than at the beginning of the century.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Maddox these gaps and contradictions suggest how science will progress. To his limited predictions he adds practical suggestions. ''Cosmology has a crying need of an accurate map of the nearby universe,'' he writes. Progress must also be made on the Human Genome Diversity Project, a debated plan to study systematically the genetic structure of different populations. ''It is potentially a way,'' he says, ''of uncovering in great detail the cultural and even ethnic history of Homo sapiens.''</p>
        <p>And the human mind should be further modeled by means of computers, the author's implication being that by this means such mysteries as long-term memory and imagination will eventually be cleared up.</p>
        <p>More practically still, Mr. Maddox concludes his book by envisioning four potential calamities to humankind and by proposing what might be done to avoid them.</p>
        <p>These are climatic change resulting from ''the accumulation of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere''; the rise of ''novel and resurgent infections''; the possibility of ''meteoric impacts on the surface of the Earth,'' and the possible unstableness of the human genome, meaning that people could simply cease to exist, there being no guarantee that even the fittest of species must survive indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''In reality,'' the author concludes, ''there is no reason why any of the potential calamities now foreseen, even the most scary among them, cannot be avoided. But avoidance requires vigilance and courage. Will we have enough?''</p>
        <p>A reader sizing up Mr. Maddox's book 100 years from now would no doubt be struck by how little he was able to foretell. But ''What Remains to Be Discovered'' is still useful as a summing up of present knowledge. Future readers will gain perspective on the latest millennial juncture in history. Present readers can learn just how much we already know.</p>
