        <p>LEAD: Embarrassed by the international outcry against the destruction of the Amazon rain forest, the Brazilian Government has begun a nationalist campaign that includes denunciations of foreign meddling and charges that the rich nations themselves covet the region's immense spaces and mineral wealth.</p>
        <p>Embarrassed by the international outcry against the destruction of the Amazon rain forest, the Brazilian Government has begun a nationalist campaign that includes denunciations of foreign meddling and charges that the rich nations themselves covet the region's immense spaces and mineral wealth.</p>
        <p>From the President down, officials in recent weeks have used every public occasion to denounce dark foreign designs to occupy the Amazon and complained of hypocrisy among the industrialized nations, asserting that they commit far greater ecological sins.</p>
        <p>Yet recognizing that the environment has suddenly become a major international political issue, Brazil has also begun preparing its own public relations campaign aimed at demonstrating that it, too, is concerned with preserving the Amazon, its Indian population and the richest ecosystem on earth. New Laws Are Planned</p>
        <p>The announcement of a new environmental program, planned for April 6, is being billed as a major event and the President's office is mustering prestigious foreign guests to come to give weight to the ceremony.</p>
        <p>President Jose Sarney will propose far-reaching new laws affecting the Amazon, said Fernando Cesar Mesquita, the head of the Government's newly formed environmental agency. The measures will include a drastic change in the tax system, a ban on deforestation for agriculture and cattle and controls on the sale of mercury, with which hundreds of thousands of gold prospectors have been polluting the rivers.</p>
        <p>There are also plans to enlist the help of the army and the air force in the coming dry season to diminish the huge forest fires that farmers set to clear the land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarney's program is expected to be an expanded version of steps he announced last October after a rush of international protests against devastation in the Amazon. At the time, he called for a new Amazon policy to be formulated by mid-February. That deadline passed and the new policy is now due in April. Subsidies Spur Deforestation</p>
        <p>Although environmentalists contend that the poorly staffed and equipped Government agencies will have great difficulty in putting new rules into effect in a region larger than Europe, proposed changes in the laws and tax breaks could make a significant difference. According to a recent World Bank study, official subsidies over the last decade have made ranching in the Amazon artificially profitable. The study said that from 1975 to 1986 the Brazilian Government in effect promoted vast deforestation and ecological damage with subsidies for ranchers and settlers totaling more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Yet a basic conflict in the Government's response on the Amazon -bowing to foreign pressure to take the environment into account while condemning outside interference - is increasingly evident.</p>
        <p>At a military ceremony this month, Mr. Sarney made his strongest statement yet as he told the armed forces high command that ''now more than ever'' they had the ''mission'' to defend the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''Brazil is being threatened in its sovereign right to use, exploit and administer its territory,'' the President said. ''Every day brings new forms of intervention, with veiled or explicit threats aiming to force us to take decisions that are not in our interest.''</p>
        <p>He said the industrialized nations were conducting ''an insidious, cruel and untruthful campaign'' against Brazil to distract attention from their own large-scale pollution, acid rain and ''fantastic nuclear arsenals'' that threaten life. The Specter of Occupation</p>
        <p>By ''intervention,'' Mr. Sarney was apparently referring to foreign credits that have either been postponed or conditioned on environmental measures as well as recent proposals from countries including the United States, the Netherlands and France that Brazil exchange discounted parts of its foreign debt for conservation projects. Most recently, at a high-level environmental conference in the Netherlands this month Brazil successfully fought against a plan to form an international environmental agency that it feared could intervene in the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''There is a true danger of foreign occupation of the Amazon,'' Mr. Mesquita said. ''We are seeing a concerted international effort to hold back development in Brazil.''</p>
        <p>When asked to explain this danger, officials offer various conspiracy theories. One is that the rich countries do not want Brazil to develop its vast mineral deposits, its gold, tin, bauxite and uranium, because this would affect their industrial interests and depress world prices. Another theory is that the big multinational companies are using environmental concerns to postpone exploitation of the Amazon's wealth until they themselves can gain control of it.</p>
        <p>The President himself has described environmentalism as ''a Trojan horse'' that hides other interests and ''uses the pure spirit of the young people'' for economic ends. The Target of Hostility</p>
        <p>Leaders of Brazil's fast-growing environmental movement say they have recently become the target of deep hostility from official circles.</p>
        <p>''These days officials are treating me like an anti-patriot, a traitor,'' said Fabio Feldmann, the only member of Congress elected on an environmental platform.</p>
        <p>A group of conservative Brazilian senators have even created a parliamentary commission of inquiry to investigate the motives behind the world's heightened interest in the Amazon. Some liberals, including Mr. Feldmann, say they are supporting the inquiry because they feel it will debunk the ''foreign conspiracy myth.''</p>
        <p>The Government conspiracy theories have so far not been adopted by Brazilian newspapers and television, which are themselves becoming increasingly environment-minded. But the slogan ''the Amazon is ours'' is used widely by the Rural Democratic Union, a right-wing movement of landowners, and by members of Congress who have ties with the construction companies that have large stakes in the continuing development of the Amazon. Governors Welcome Outcry</p>
        <p>Critics of Mr. Sarney and foreign diplomats here say the President has taken to beating a nationalist drum to rally support for a Government that is weak and discredited.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the governors of the states of the Amazon Basin have made it clear that they welcome the outcry over the Amazon abroad because the federal Government has traditionally ignored their problems.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time Brasilia is taking the Amazon seriously and consulting us,'' Amazonino Mendes, the Governor of Amazonas, told reporters at a recent meeting of the region's governors in Manaus. Mr. Mendes said the notion of foreign intervention was ''absurd'' and added that he and his colleagues, whose treasuries are empty, welcomed any foreign funds.</p>
        <p>Last month, an uproar over plans for a new highway - from the west Amazonian state of Acre into Peru -illustrated Brasilia's sensitivity. The Governor of Acre, Flaviano Melo, has said that while Brasilia was never interested, he discussed construction of the road 18 months ago in Tokyo with officials of the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, who showed great interest. He added that although he had also discussed the project with Japanese diplomats who have visited Acre since then, no official loan request had been made because a viability study that had been asked was not completed. Japan Denies Involvement</p>
        <p>After the highway project was reported in the United States, President Bush used the occasion of Emperor Hirohito's funeral to urge the Japanese authorities not to finance a road that environmentalists said could speed destruction of the jungle. Japan then strongly denied any involvement in the project. Indignant to see the United States and Japan discussing Brazil's future, Mr. Sarney declared the road to be a national priority and said it would be built with or without foreign financing.</p>
        <p>The large public relations event planned for the announcement of the new Amazon policy has drawn bitter criticism from Brazilian scientists. It has been disclosed that the President's office has appropriated $2 million for the event, much of it to be spent on air fares and Amazon visits for guests.</p>
        <p>This has rankled scientists because across-the-board budget cuts have badly hurt all research related to the Amazon. At the National Institute for Space Research, which processes satellite images that register Amazon fires and deforestation, for example, researchers said they had not been able to finish analyzing last year's data because there was no money to repair a broken computer or even to develop the film.</p>
        <p>Forest wardens in Rondonia state complained last month that there was no money for fuel or spare parts for their vehicles. During severe forest fires in Bahia state this month, the Forestry Institute said it had only 50 men to combat a blaze covering thousands of acres.</p>
        <p>''Who does Sarney think he is kidding with all this public relations stuff?'' one frustrated scientist said.</p>
        <p>But opponents contend that until the elections in November the Sarney Government is likely to use the ''foreign threat'' to the Amazon as a rallying point. The President has now closely involved the military chiefs of staff in all deliberations on Amazon issues. The military has opposed any proposals that foreigners pay for or create nature reserves in the Amazon. Double Standard Charged</p>
        <p>The Government has also ordered its diplomats to go on a counteroffensive. At a meeting in Ecuador this month, Brazil succeeded in enlisting other Amazon Basin countries - Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela - to repudiate outside interference in the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''What infuriates us is the double standard,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official who still felt rankled by recent sharp criticism of Brazil by France, a country that he said had ''no enchanting environmental record.'' Also, he said, Brazil was rebuffed when at the conference on chemical weapons in Paris late last year it tried to introduce a clause in the final resolution saying chemical weapons were also extremely harmful to the environment.</p>
        <p>''We were told that was too controversial,'' the official said. ''So we say, all right, let's discuss the environment, the Amazon. But not just the Amazon, but the whole agenda, the whole industrial model we are all a part of.''</p>
