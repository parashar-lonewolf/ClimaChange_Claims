        <p>Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, and two of his top aides braved a sleet storm in Washington on Thursday morning, traveling to Capitol Hill to pay a call on Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, with whom President Clinton has had an often testy relationship.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the President and Mr. Gephardt appeared together smiling at a White House photo opportunity. On Saturday, Mr. Gephardt and his wife, Jane, will have a private dinner with Al and Tipper Gore at the Vice President's mansion. Mr. Gephardt, an expected challenger to Mr. Gore for the 2000 Democratic Presidential nomination, will presumably check his weapons at the gate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore and Mr. Gephardt, all making nice? What's going on?</p>
        <p>Ordinarily such contacts between Government leaders of the same party to discuss political and legislative strategy would be of little moment. But Mr. Clinton's relations with his fellow Democrats have never been quite ordinary.</p>
        <p>Just last month, Mr. Gephardt, speaking for many of his Democratic colleagues in Congress, accused the President of conducting a Government of timid ideas and neglecting the nation's major challenges.</p>
        <p>''We need a Democratic Party that is a movement for change and a movement for values, and not a money machine,'' Mr. Gephardt said at Harvard on Dec. 2, in an address that infuriated the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt's speech marked a new low in a relationship that had already veered from mutual suspicion to open hostility. It was delivered three weeks after House Democrats had dealt Mr. Clinton a humiliating defeat over a measure that would have expanded his ability to negotiate trade agreements.</p>
        <p>But today all appears rosy between Mr. Clinton and his fellow Democrats, as they join arms in public displays of unity on a political agenda for the coming year.</p>
        <p>''The love fest continues,'' said a senior Democratic Congressional aide.</p>
        <p>''Just one big happy family,'' chirped a top White House official.</p>
        <p>Has this marriage been saved?</p>
        <p>Perhaps -- for now.</p>
        <p>There are a number of reasons for the new civility among Democrats, including a realization that division and pre-Presidential-campaign jockeying would hurt the party's efforts to regain the House in the elections  this year.</p>
        <p>The White House has made concerted efforts to appease Mr. Gephardt, both on a personal level and in  policy proposals intended to appeal to Democratic officials and voters.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Clinton has announced initiatives that sound much like traditional Democratic something-for-everyone interest-group politics: more spending on child day care for working mothers,  expansion of Medicare to younger beneficiaries, a big school-construction program and a plan to train thousands more teachers, endorsement of Jesse Jackson's plea to Wall Street to hire more women and members of minority groups, a $5 billion program of grants and tax credits to address global warming and a $4 billion package for workers displaced by foreign trade.</p>
        <p>''If you look at what Mr. Gephardt said in his speech, he was raising many of the issues that are beginning to be addressed in the President's agenda,'' said Laura Nichols, Mr. Gephardt's director of communications.</p>
        <p>White House officials dispute that the President's proposals were intended to cater to Mr. Gephardt and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. The ideas, they say, were entirely consistent with what they call Mr. Clinton's fiscally responsible ''new Democrat'' philosophy.</p>
        <p>''The Gephardt speech was a catalyst for everyone realizing that it was in all of our interests to find things we can work together on,'' said John Podesta, deputy White House chief of staff.</p>
        <p>''That speech obviously rubbed us the wrong way,'' Mr. Podesta added, ''but the President said that if we work together there are a number of things we can accomplish, like electing more Democrats to the House and Senate. After that, most of the tension melted away.''</p>
        <p>Still, a reservoir of mistrust remains among many Democrats.</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Clinton's embarrassment on the  ''fast track'' trade legislation ''got the President's attention.''</p>
        <p>''His post-fast-track speeches have been terrific,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''He's starting to address the problems of Americans who are outside the economic loop.''</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Rangel said, he is not entirely convinced that Mr. Clinton is committed to pursuing policies that will help the Congressman's urban constituents.</p>
        <p>Richard Bond, former Republican national chairman, said the White House had panicked after Mr. Gephardt's Harvard speech, concerned that Presidential politics would undermine Mr. Clinton's ability to pursue any agenda in 1998.</p>
        <p>''The post-Clinton wars were about to seriously break out,'' Mr. Bond said. ''But Clinton has now bought himself some time by making nice with Gephardt in social terms and making nice with the left wing of the Democratic Party in policy terms by these extensions of the dependency culture that they favor.''</p>
        <p>White House realists expect the  truce to be only temporary, lasting until perhaps the day after the November elections.</p>
        <p>And if the Democrats lose seats in Congress or statehouses -- a common off-year experience of the party that holds the White House -- lesser officeholders are sure to blame the President, as they did after the Republican sweep of 1994.</p>
        <p>Even if the marriage hangs together through the year, said one senior White House political aide, ''things will get a lot more complicated in 1999.''</p>
