        <p>An agreement conceived in the spirit of Noah's mission to rescue every beast, every fowl and "whatsoever creepeth upon the earth" became international law this week.</p>
        <p>The agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, is both a global conservation pact and a guide to help rich and poor nations share in the profits of biotechnology, a fledgling industry that uses organisms with unique genetic characteristics to create new products like cancer-fighting drugs.</p>
        <p>The United States is among the 167 nations that have signed the treaty, although ratification by a two-thirds vote of the Senate is needed.</p>
        <p>The treaty commits countries to draw up national strategies to conserve not only the plants, animals and microorganisms within their borders, but the habitats that sustain them. It also requires that countries pass laws to protect endangered species, expand protected areas and restore damaged ones, and promote public awareness of the need for conservation and sustainable use of biological resources.</p>
        <p>The treaty, first presented for signature at the so-called Earth Summit in Brazil in June 1992, began to take shape a decade ago in response to warnings by scientists that the pace of extinctions had risen to 25,000 times the natural rate. By the year 2050, some experts say, half of all remaining species may have vanished, largely because of the various effects of the exploding human population.</p>
        <p>Although chemical pollution, poaching, overharvesting and trafficking in wildlife are all factors in the accelerating wave of extinctions, experts say the biggest threat comes from the destruction of natural habitats, ranging from tropical rain forests to grasslands and coral reefs. The possibility of global warming from increased use of fossil fuels could also have profoundly destructive effects on ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Three broad political principles are at the heart of the treaty: the idea that countries have "the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies"; that wealthy countries have an obligation to help their poorer neighbors abide by the pact, and that species-rich but cash-poor nations should share in the profits from their resources.</p>
        <p>But many potential snags are likely to face treaty signers when they meet in late 1994 to decide how the agreement will actually function. There is considerable scientific uncertainty about how -- or even if -- many species can be saved. And questions remain about how the treaty will be financed, the technology shared and a permanent secretariat established.</p>
