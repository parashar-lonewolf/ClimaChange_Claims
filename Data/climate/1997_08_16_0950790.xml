        <p>Letter from Annie Petsonk says Aug 12 article on climate failed to note that environmentalists are not only ones to feel that now is time to take step to control greenhouse gas, because opportunity may not arise again anytime soon (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''U.S. and Japan Key to Outcome in Climate Talks'' (news article, Aug. 12), you ascribe to environmentalists alone the view that unless a step to control greenhouse gas is taken now, it may be years before the opportunity comes again. But as your article also notes, many nations are becoming interested in the Clinton Administration's flexible, cost-effective approach, which combines a legally binding cap on emissions with emissions trading and joint implementation with developing nations.</p>

        <p>Delay would curtail options for flexibility because businesses would make expensive, inefficient energy and transport investments, particularly in rapidly industrializing countries like China, and the resulting boom would make it more difficult to curb climate change.</p>
        <p>An agreement at the international climate meeting in Japan in December could provide incentives to cut emissions when most needed, during the peak of the international development boom.</p>
