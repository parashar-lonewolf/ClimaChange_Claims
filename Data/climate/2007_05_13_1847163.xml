        <p>ONE of the most striking images to come out of the final days of France's recent presidential campaign was Nicolas Sarkozy astride a white horse, at first glance looking every bit a Texan.</p>
        <p>To some American readers, it might have been tempting to take the picture as a sign that Mr. Sarkozy wasn't too French after all and, as president, would bring his long wayward nation back into Washington's foreign policy camp.</p>
        <p>But such signs can be deceiving, as can the language that politicians use.</p>
        <p>Where Americans saw a cowboy, the French saw a ''gardian,'' the traditional horseman of the Camargue region in southern France, where the picture was taken. Mr. Sarkozy's red plaid shirt was a Ralph Lauren, but it fit right in with the brightly colored long-sleeve shirts worn by gardians while rounding up the black Camargue steers used in annual contests.</p>
        <p>The Brotherhood of Camargue Horsemen was founded in 1512 to formalize the traditions of life among the cattle and pink flamingos on the alluvial plains of the Rhone River delta. Their main enemies were mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Each year, they round up small black steers from the salt marshes for a stylized game in which young men try to snatch a ribbon from between the horns. Some of these games are staged in local arenas, with the bulls herded through town by the gardians.</p>
        <p>It has the look and feel of a rodeo. But instead of dominating the beast, the trick is to be quick enough to get close without getting gored -- and then get away even quicker. In this game it's not the wrangler who is the star. It's the steer.</p>
        <p>From the United States, Mr. Sarkozy's white horse may have looked like the Lone Ranger's Silver, but it was a Camargue breed, which are famously white. White horses in France are more closely associated with Napoleon than cowboys anyway.</p>
        <p>So it is with Mr. Sarkozy's promised pro-Americanism, which looks far more ambiguous from France than it does from the United States. He may not be sending a new message so much as just putting it in a new wrapper whose colors -- red, white and blue -- mean something different depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy mentioned France's ''American friends'' in his acceptance speech after the election a week ago, but what he went on to say sounded no different than what President Jacques Chirac has been saying for years. People in Washington focused, perhaps, on Mr. Sarkozy's assurance that ''France will always be by their side when they will need her.'' The French, on the other hand, heard the rest of the statement: ''friendship is accepting that one's friends can act differently.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy has always supported Mr. Chirac's opposition to the American invasion of Iraq, the issue at the core of recent Franco-American tensions. The war is so unpopular in France that no one expects Mr. Sarkozy to send troops to help, no matter how much the United States might wish it.</p>
        <p>He followed his reference to American friends with a call for them to abide by the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, which the Bush administration has refused to sign. During the campaign, Mr. Sarkozy suggested introducing a carbon tax on products from countries that have not ratified the protocol, something that would be sure to infuriate Washington if he ever followed through with the idea.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of other areas where France's foreign policy is likely to remain at odds with the United States. Mr. Sarkozy has talked about pulling French troops out of Afghanistan altogether, while Washington wants France to increase the number of its soldiers stationed there.</p>
        <p>He adamantly opposes Turkey's membership in the European Union, something pushed heavily by President Bush as a way of building a bridge between the West and the Muslim world. He has been cool to the Bush administration's proposed antimissile shield based in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarkozy has vowed to be tough in pressuring Iran to stop its production of nuclear fuel, a stance surely welcome in Washington. But if Washington eventually feels it needs to turn to a military response, don't expect Mr. Sarkozy to go along.</p>
