        <p>LEAD: COULD taxes on carbon dioxide emissions stop atmospheric warming that threatens to flood coastlines and turn farmland to desert? Perhaps, concludes a study released last month by the Congressional Budget Office. But even in the best of plausible worlds, taming the global economy's addiction to carbon fuels would cost trillions of dollars.</p>
        <p>COULD taxes on carbon dioxide emissions stop atmospheric warming that threatens to flood coastlines and turn farmland to desert? Perhaps, concludes a study released last month by the Congressional Budget Office. But even in the best of plausible worlds, taming the global economy's addiction to carbon fuels would cost trillions of dollars.</p>
        <p>That does not necessarily mean the price would not be worth paying. But the budget office does counsel a hard look at two strategies: containing emissions of other ''greenhouse effect'' gases, or learning to cope in a warmer environment.</p>
        <p>Some air pollutants, notably carbon dioxide from burning oil, gas and coal, help to trap heat from the sun. And while there is no consensus on the rate of warming or the likely environmental damage, hardly anyone is eager to play Russian roulette with the biosphere.</p>
        <p>Western Europe is pressing Washington for a commitment to reduce carbon emissions to 1988 levels, and then roll them back another 20 percent in future decades. The least intrusive way to reach the goal, economists believe, is through carbon charges - taxes on fuels in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide they release.</p>
        <p>The budget office used a variety of computer models to simulate the effect of a $100-a-ton carbon charge, equivalent to $13 for a barrel of oil, phased in over the next decade. It found that the $100 charge would indeed induce a lot of fuel conservation. Equally important, it would encourage industry to fire its boilers with natural gas, which emits roughly half as much carbon dioxide for each unit of heat as coal. By the year 2000 carbon emissions would be somewhere between 5 percent less and 6 percent more than emissions in 1988.</p>
        <p>But the likely price, $100 billion a year in reduced output for the American economy alone, would be nothing to sneeze at. And after the year 2000, the task of holding the line on emissions would be increasingly problematic.</p>
        <p>Under one cheerful scenario, based on the computer model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, engineering would save the day. Advances in energy-conserving technologies - efficiencies apart from those induced by rising fuel prices -would permit America to roll back carbon emissions at a continuing sacrifice of just 1 percent of the gross national product.</p>
        <p>But this would only be possible if the amount of energy required to generate a dollar's worth of output fell by 1.5 percent annually. And research by Dale Jorgensen, an economist at Harvard, suggests that is far too optimistic. Without conservation induced by higher oil prices, Mr. Jorgensen calculates, Americans would actually be using more energy for each unit of output than they did in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Two other researchers, Alan Manne at Stanford and Richard Richels at the Edison Electric Institute, offer an intermediate path. Assuming gains in energy efficiency of half a percent annually, their simulations suggest that energy demand could not be met without a switch to non-carbon fuels - nuclear, solar and the like. The tax needed to induce the transition, they calculate, would run to about $50 a barrel. And the resulting drag on productivity would reduce the G.N.P. by 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Confronted by such awesome costs - $300 billion annually by midcentury - some economists speculate that it would make sense to learn to live in the greenhouse. Thomas Schelling of Harvard suggests that the trillions of dollars needed to keep the atmosphere cool might be better spent on dikes, irrigation and air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>The budget office suggests another approach: Other greenhouse gases, notably chemicals known as CFC's that are used in refrigeration and plastics, might be restricted first. CFC's are already high on the environmentalists' hit list because they destroy the protective atmospheric ozone layer. A crash program to eliminate them would be more cost-effective than attacking carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Daniel Dudek, Alice LeBlanc and Peter Miller, analysts for the Environmental Defense Fund, offer a variation on the same theme. Sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants stunt wildlife and may eventually reduce crop yields. And one way or another sulfur emissions must be reduced. Regulation that encouraged utilities to switch to natural gas rather than to ''scrub'' the offending chemical from coal smoke would serve as a double whammy, reducing carbon emissions as well as sulfur.</p>
        <p>Such incentives are, in fact, part of the amendments to the Clean Air Act now grinding their way through Congress. Passage of the bill may thus prove to be the most practical attack on the greenhouse effect to emerge this year from Washington.</p>
