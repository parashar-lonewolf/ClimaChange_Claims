        <p>Sixteen days ago, Sasha Cockx bought his midday Coke at the School of St. Mary and flipped back the bottle cap to collect the token underneath. Collecting 500 points -- one from each small bottle, three from a large one -- could produce a cellular telephone for only about $75, the 14-year-old scholar said. It is a prize he is not likely to collect.</p>
        <p>An hour after he drank the Coke, his head began to ache and his stomach hurt. His friend Timothy Alen, who drank two Cokes, even though both he and Mr. Cockx said they thought the soda had smelled strange,  said his knees started to tremble and he felt nauseated.</p>
        <p>Two hours later, both boys were on their way to the St. Joseph's Clinic in this neat, prosperous town of 20,000 people to be told that they were suffering from what a physician there called ''probable intoxication.''</p>
        <p>''I'll never drink Coke again,'' Mr. Cockx said today. That is exactly the sentiment the Coca-Cola Company fears most in Belgium and many other parts of Europe after the biggest recall in its 113-year history, caused by the experiences of people like Mr. Alen and Mr. Cockx who blame Coke for their sickness. Since then, Coca-Cola products have been under suspicion in European lands from Portugal to Germany.</p>
        <p>The routine lunchtime drink was the beginning of a nightmare for the Atlanta-based company, which has now discovered that the venerable Coke brand is vulnerable, not just to lapses in quality control that may have led to the contamination of its products but to the shifting perceptions and political sensitivities of its customers.</p>
        <p>First, Coca-Cola recalled 2.5 million bottles around this area of Belgium, 25 miles northwest of Brussels. Then, Coca-Cola plants in Antwerp and Ghent were ordered closed. ''Quite honestly, we let the people of Belgium down,'' said M. Douglas Ivester, the Coca-Cola chief executive. Only on Wednesday, when the Government lifted a 10-day ban, was the giant American company permitted to restart production in Belgium. [France followed suit Thursday, permitting a bottling plant at Dunkirk, which had supplied the Belgian market, to reopen. Page C2.]</p>
        <p>Whatever the financial cost to the company, the challenges in regenerating faith in its brand may only be beginning.</p>
        <p>''Coca-Cola has said they'll pay the medical expenses, but there's a moral responsibility, too,'' said Odilon Hermans, the director of the School of St. Mary, whose 280 students are either 13 or 14 years old and which was unusual among the six schools here because in addition to other beverages it sold Coke to its pupils to augment their lunch packs from home. ''For two weeks now the children have not been so good. The parents are distressed. Four pupils are still off school.''</p>
        <p>The school, he said, has instructed a lawyer to write to Coca-Cola saying it holds the company legally as well as morally responsible. Altogether, he said, 39 children at his school were taken ill, 33 on the first day of the crisis and 6 more the following day. All underwent throat X-rays and urine and blood tests. Some needed to use respirators. Fifteen were hospitalized overnight. Two days later, some were still complaining of sickness and were sent home again.</p>
        <p>''This was not psychological or mass hysteria,'' Mr. Hermans said, referring to suggestions by the Belgian Government that some of the scores of Coke drinkers who subsequently reported becoming ill might have overreacted -- a view shared by some sociologists and physicians.</p>
        <p>Rather, in this town, as elsewhere in Belgium, there is a questioning not so much of consumers' reactions but of the company's and the Government's.</p>
        <p>The Coke crisis erupted at a particularly fraught moment. Across Europe, supermarket shoppers have begun to question the provenance of products on store shelves. And in Belgium the Government was reeling from a scandal over the contamination of meat and poultry traced to the discovery of the cancer-causing chemical dioxin in animal feed grains. Moreover, the Government faced elections on June 13, so anything that smacked of negligence in the food chain carried heavy political freight. Then came the Coca-Cola recall -- just days before the election.</p>
        <p>Luc Spiessens, an administrator in a local mental health clinic, said: ''There had been the dioxin business. Elections were coming. This was the last straw.''</p>
        <p>As he shopped today at an outlet of Colruyt, a discount Belgian supermarket, where the soda section offered mineral water, Pepsi and a local brand of cola called Eldorado, Mr. Spiessens commented: ''Most people still have doubts. They fear that they haven't been told the whole truth.''</p>
        <p>Even the Government in Brussels said on Wednesday that it did not accept Coca-Cola's explanation, which attributed the illnesses to traces of sulfur used to produce carbon dioxide bubbles in the soda, and to creosote, an oily liquid distilled from tar that is used on wooden storage pallets as a preservative and disinfectant.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hugo Bontinck, medical director of the St. Joseph's Clinic, said he was one of the first physicians to treat the sick children here. ''Mainly they had headaches, dizziness, nausea and muscular vibration,'' he said in an interview today. ''Some of them were vomiting, but there was no fever.''</p>
        <p>He, like the Government, has doubts about Coca-Cola's version of events. ''The mechanism that created the symptoms is not very clear,'' he said, arguing that the contaminants identified by Coca-Cola were found in such small amounts that ''it is not so likely that these low concentrations can explain the symptoms.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said, the cause of the sickness may never be determined because the contaminants may have dispersed rapidly so that they did not show up in the blood and urine samples.</p>
        <p>Belgian toxicologists, he said, are examining the plant extracts and sulfide gases used in the recalled Coke, trying to establish whether it had higher-than-normal levels of substances that are usually found in Coke. But that seemed to be problematic as well, because the formula for Coke is secret -- so secret, in fact, that it resides in a locked bank vault in Atlanta and even top executives are said to be unable to see it without a formal vote by the company's directors.</p>
        <p>A senior Government official in Brussels said investigators were examining whether any of a staggering 15,000 substances could have caused the symptoms.</p>
        <p>As part of a marketing drive to reclaim the public trust, Mr. Ivester, the Coca-Cola chief, said on Wednesday that he would buy everyone in Belgium a Coke. That might not be too enticing for people who were sickened.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't accept it,'' Mr. Alen, one of the stricken 14-year-olds, said shortly before his year-end English exam today.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola might have better fortune with people like Diane Heymans, a worker in one of the light industrial plants fringing this town. She stopped buying Coke only when it was recalled, she said at the Colruyt store today after buying a bottle of Eldorado cola whose label proclaims ''The Original Taste.''</p>
        <p>''I'll buy Coke again as soon as it comes back onto the shelves,'' she said. ''I'm not afraid. I'm sure it's safe.''</p>
        <p>Safe or not, it will disappear from the School of St. Mary. ''We had decided even before this to stop selling Coke at school,'' said Mr. Hermans, the director. ''We thought there was too much sugar in it for the children's health.''</p>
