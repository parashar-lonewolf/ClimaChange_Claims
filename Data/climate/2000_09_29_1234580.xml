        <p>With oil prices up, consumers agitated and the winter heating season looming, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are going at it on energy policy, seeking to draw sharp distinctions over an issue on which both candidates have political vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>It is a topic that the two parties see as touching consumers every time they fill up at the pump or adjust their thermostats, and one that is inextricably linked to broader environmental, foreign policy and economic issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore forced the topic back onto the campaign agenda last week with his call, acceded to by President Clinton, for the government to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to head off shortages of home heating oil -- an action that both the president and the vice president had opposed earlier in the year. Mr. Bush, who criticized the decision as a political ploy to drive down prices just ahead of Election Day, is scheduled to discuss energy policy in a speech on Friday.</p>
        <p>The most basic question facing the country on energy is how to keep supply and demand in line. Mr. Bush, like most Republicans, emphasized finding new oil and ensuring a flow from other oil-producing nations. Mr. Gore, like many Democrats, focuses on trying to use less energy, or at least on using existing energy supplies as efficiently as possible.</p>
        <p>''In very simple terms, the Republicans would approach an energy problem from the supply side: 'What can we do to increase supply?' '' said Robert E. Ebel, director of the energy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''The Democrats would say: ''What can we do to make better use of what we've got?' ''</p>
        <p>There are a number of other clearly defined differences between them. Mr. Gore sees global warming as a serious threat, and strongly backs an international agreement reached three years ago in Kyoto, Japan, which calls for substantial reductions in emissions of industrial gases from burning coal, oil, wood and natural gas. Mr. Bush acknowledges that global warming is a potential problem, but says the Kyoto agreement would be too costly to the United States and would not ensure that developing countries do their part.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who worked for years in the oil industry and whose running mate, Dick Cheney, ran an oil field services company, supports opening some environmentally sensitive areas, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, to oil exploration and production. Mr. Gore opposes such steps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has long said he is willing to pay a political price for his environmental principles, has suggested that the United States needs to take drastic steps, like eliminating the internal combustion engine, a goal that is widely mocked by Republicans.</p>
        <p>In an effort to encourage conservation, Mr. Gore has also supported higher taxes on energy consumption, including a broad-based energy tax proposed by the Clinton administration in 1993 but never adopted, and a 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax, which became law in 1993 over the objection of every Republican in Congress.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the two candidates are not as far apart as they seem. For all his focus on reducing demand, Mr. Gore has supported limited expansion of domestic exploration and production, including in the Gulf of Mexico and on federal land. Mr. Bush backs policies that promote conservation and energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore would rely more heavily on a government role than Mr. Bush, both candidates see the market as the most powerful force for addressing energy problems. Both generally support the deregulation of the electric power industry to allow power producers to compete in serving consumers.</p>
        <p>In their own way, both of them have had to manage balancing acts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's general philosophy, and some of the specific positions he has taken over the years, are based in part on the idea that higher oil prices could be a good thing in holding down consumption and encouraging conservation and use of alternative energy sources.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Gore has also sought to portray himself as defender of the consumer against higher gasoline and heating costs. During the summer, he called for a federal investigation into whether oil companies were unfairly jacking up gasoline prices. And with winter looming and crude oil prices rising, he tried to pre-empt a possible spike in home heating oil prices with his call last week for release of supplies from the reserve.</p>
        <p>''Gore is right that there is vast potential for alternative technologies and fuels,'' said Pietro S. Nivola, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-leaning research organization. ''But every time we try to manipulate or depress the price of oil, we put off the day when some of these innovations come online.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said the surge in oil prices this year has resulted from  what he says is the Clinton-Gore administration's ineptitude in dealing with the oil-producing nations of the Middle East and on its failure to promote new oil production and modernization of power plants, pipelines and refineries at home.</p>
        <p>But his own close ties to the oil industry and problems with air quality in Texas have sometimes left him on the defensive, and his choice of Mr. Cheney as a running mate only exacerbated the problem. And while Mr. Bush's advisers say his criticism of Mr. Gore for tapping the nation's oil reserves makes the vice president look like a crass panderer, it is unclear whether voters will appreciate that kind of principle more than immediate action to help them deal with surging prices.</p>
        <p>Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, told reporters this week that energy was the ''best issue'' for the Texas governor in the campaign right now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsey said Mr. Bush's policy prescriptions would center on promoting more domestic exploration and production of oil, speeding the process of granting permits for new refineries, power plants and pipelines, more active diplomatic efforts to persuade oil producing nations to keep oil prices stable and at reasonable levels and a greater emphasis on working with Western Hemisphere oil producers, especially Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would also work with industry to promote conservation and efficiency through innovations like time-of-day pricing, under which energy users would pay more at peak hours of demand, Mr. Lindsey said.</p>
        <p>''Eight years of neglect cannot be made up overnight,'' Mr. Lindsey said. ''It's going to take a lot of years of work on our part to rectify the problems that have accumulated.''</p>
        <p>In a series of speeches this year, Mr. Gore set out a list of energy initiatives. He relies heavily on tax credits -- for the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles and homes, use of low-polluting fuels and solar power, investment by business in energy efficient equipment and for production of electricity from renewable and alternative fuel sources.</p>
        <p>But the core of his message is that developing efficiency-enhancing products and cleaner sources of energy is not an economic burden but an opportunity that can create jobs and profits for the United States.</p>
        <p>His plan, Mr. Gore said at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania last week, would ''create millions of new jobs by getting out in front of the market for these new boilers and new furnaces and new cars and trucks and buses and revamped power plants and new technologies that help us to conserve more energy.''</p>
        <p>What neither candidate is saying explicitly is that the best policy in the long run, according to some analysts, may be to promote prices that are substantially below the nearly $38 a barrel level that crude oil hit briefly last week before declining to around $30 today, but well above the $12 level that made gasoline so cheap two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton acknowledged as much this week. He told reporters on Wednesday that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' target range of $22 to $28 a barrel was ''reasonable,'' but that he did not want to see prices ''go back down to $13 or $12 or $10 again because that was also disruptive.''</p>
