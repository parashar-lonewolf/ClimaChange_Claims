        <p>LEAD: The broadest Soviet-American accord on scientific cooperation in almost a decade was signed here today by the heads of the two countries' top scientific academies, paving the way for greater joint efforts in fields ranging from AIDS research to nuclear reactor safety.</p>
        <p>The broadest Soviet-American accord on scientific cooperation in almost a decade was signed here today by the heads of the two countries' top scientific academies, paving the way for greater joint efforts in fields ranging from AIDS research to nuclear reactor safety.</p>
        <p>The new agreement was successor to a more modest two-year program signed during the 1985 Geneva summit meeting. It was described as returning scientific relations between the two countries to the cooperative footing of the 1970's, before the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan and the Soviet crackdown on scientists prominent in dissident circles.</p>
        <p>''We have obtained a tremendous advance in our scientific relationship, of which there is no better proof than this agreement,'' Guri I. Marchuk, chairman of the Soviet National Academy of Sciences, said at the signing ceremony today.</p>
        <p>For the American side, the agreement was signed by Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences. Optimism on Human Rights</p>
        <p>At a subsequent news conference, Dr. Marchuk gave a qualified prediction that the most troublesome remaining human rights issue for American scientists - the Soviet contention that some Jewish scientists can be denied emigration because they possess undefined ''state secrets'' - is on the way to resolution.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marchuk referred to ''negative dogmas'' that he said ''once held sway in our society,'' adding, ''We are in the process of breaking this up.''</p>
        <p>''You cannot at a stroke address all the issues there are,'' said Dr. Marchuk. ''We are trying to do things stage by stage, a process which will practically, I am sure, result in the complete or nearly complete resolution of all cases.''</p>
        <p>Details of most of the scientific workshops and cooperative efforts planned for 1988 and 1989 under the new accord remain to be worked out. They include such traditional areas of cooperation as earthquake prediction and areas of high current concern, including the AIDS epidemic, depletion of the ozone layer, and nuclear reactor safety.</p>
