        <p>FARMING AND CLIMATE</p>
        <p>FARMING AND CLIMATE</p>
        <p>Dr. D. Allan Bromley, chief science adviser to President Bush, professor of physics at Yale and a past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, will be the principal speaker at Plant Science Day, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Wednesday at Lockwood Farm in Hamden. His talk, ''Agricultural Research and Global Climate Change,'' begins at 11:30 A dozen barn exhibits, accompanied by short talks by staff scientists, include a report on a five-year study of blood tests for Lyme disease by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, organizer of the event. Other exhibits focus on testing apples for Alar and the possibility of returning to old-fashioned rock salt as a deterrent to diseases that appeared in asparagus crops when herbicides were introduced.</p>
        <p>Out in the field, displays and experiments cover 16 subjects, including corn, other vegetables, fruit, bees, gypsy moths and the hemlock woolly adelgid. Hemlock trees in nurseries, forests and backyards are undergoing an attack from the white cottony insects, which can kill a tree in one season. Also on the agenda are methods of discouraging woodchucks from destroying the bark of apple trees, and deer from browsing on red oak black walnut, white pine and other forest trees.</p>
        <p>The farm is at Evergreen and Kenwood Avenues in the Mount Carmel section of Hamden. Admission to the event is free. Bring or buy lunch; coffee and punch are free. Call 789-7272 for more information.</p>
        <p>AUGUST AND THE ARTS</p>
        <p>For the past 14 years, August and the SoNo Arts Celebration have been synonymous in South Norwalk. All day Saturday and Sunday, and far into Saturday night, Washington Street will be closed to traffic while the neighborhood resonates with jazz, zydeco, country, blues, classical and folk music, and the siren scents of exotic and down-home foods fill the air.</p>
        <p>One of the highlights of recent years is the Sculpture Race, in which artists propel their rollable, pushable, pullable or flappable works of art around the block in competition for a variety of prizes. Some will win for speed, others for originality, beauty, or comic relief.</p>
        <p>Some 100 visual artists and more than 25 performance artists and groups will supply a continuous stream of entertainment. Children will have their special place for games, entertainment and participatory art. Admission is free. Hours on Saturday are from 10 A.M. to midnight, Sunday from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Call 849-9366 for more information.</p>
        <p>STAGED READINGS</p>
        <p>Patrick Cook, a recent graduate of the Juilliard School of Music and a performer in the national tour of the musical ''1776,'' has written the book and lyrics for a musical version of ''Captains Courageous,'' with music by Frederick Freyer. Mr. Freyer studied music at Harvard and has scored several films. The work is one of three new musicals to be performed at the O'Neill Theater Center's National Music Theater Conference Saturday through Aug. 17 in Waterford.</p>
        <p>A second production, ''Il Musico,'' has a libretto by Ian Strasfogel, director of two New York City Opera productions, and music by Larry Grossman, composer of ''Grind'' and ''A Doll's Life'' on Broadway. ''Swamp Gas and Shallow Feelings'' has a score by Jack Eric Williams, who appeared in the Broadway production of ''Sweeney Todd,'' and a book by Shirlee Strother and Randy Buck.</p>
        <p>The works will be presented as staged readings in repertory. Following the Waterford performances, they will be seen in readings at the New Dramatists in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The O'Neill Center is at 305 Great Neck Road. Performances are at 8 P.M. Wednesday through Saturday, and 2 P.M. on Aug. 11. Tickets are $7 and $9. Call 443-1238 for reservations and more information.</p>
        <p>EARLY PHOTOGRAPHY</p>
        <p>''American Photography: 1839-1900,'' the new exhibition at the Whitney Museum in Stamford, puts in perspective America's prodigious accomplishments in a field that it substantially transformed from a repertorial tool into a fine art.</p>
        <p>Among more than 100 portraits, landscapes and Civil War pictures, many of which are being exhibited for the first time, are Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies of a galloping horse; works by Mathew Brady, and unpublished pictures by James Wallace Black, John Moran and John Adams Whipple.</p>
        <p>Some of the examples were in an 1851 exhibition in London, where Americans walked off with the prizes for daguerreotypes, a process invented in France in 1839 by Louis Daguerre.</p>
        <p>The museum, on Atlantic Street at Tresser Boulevard, is open without charge from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, with gallery talks given at 12.30 P.M. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The exhibition will remain through Sept. 29. Call 358-7652 for more information.</p>
        <p>'MOBY-DICK' MARATHON</p>
        <p>If your passion is Herman Melville's ''Moby-Dick'' you may be one of the stalwarts who takes part in the first overnight reading of all 135 chapters at Mystic Seaport. The five-year-old tradition of reading the novel, formerly held for three days from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. was started by Jan V. Larson, a seaport supervisor. Some die-hard participants reserve chapters months in advance.</p>
        <p>This year's reading starts at noon on Tuesday aboard the wooden whaling ship Charles W. Morgan, moored at the Seaport dock. Staff members, seaport members, volunteers and visitors will read until 8 P.M., when daily visitors must leave the grounds. During that time the reading will be accompanied by sea chanteys and costumed role players. At 6:30 P.M. on Tuesday, the National Theater of the Deaf will perform a reading and signing of Chapter 9, ''The Sermon,'' a particularly dramatic segment.</p>
        <p>The reading will continue through the night by staff members and invited interns and volunteers. At 8 A.M. on Aug. 1, when the Seaport reopens, the public may again participate until noon on Wednesday, when the event ends. ''We have the book timed to the minute,'' said Ms. Larson.</p>
        <p>Overnighters will have sleeping bags and snacks provided, and anyone attending the reading will be supplied with a copy of the book. Admission to the seaport is $13, $6.75 for children. Call 572-0711 for more information.</p>
