        <p>For years, officials here and in other state capitals have hailed competition as a way to lower electricity bills, and New York is one of just five states that have actually begun letting some customers choose their supplier of power.</p>
        <p>But the price framework the Pataki administration has created provides very little room for competition, less than in almost any other state that has begun the process. Customers are learning that they cannot find a price much lower, or even slightly lower, than the one being offered by their old, familiar utilities.</p>
        <p>As a result, most of the nation's major energy retailers have stayed out of New York, although they are competing aggressively for customers in several other states.</p>
        <p>''We are not about to jump into the New York market and lose money,'' said Howard Fromer, director of government affairs in New York for Enron Corporation of Houston. ''I can't believe any outside marketer is making money in the New York market.''</p>
        <p>Even some officials at the Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates utilities, concede privately that there is far less competition than they had hoped for. It was the commission, whose members are appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, that designed the system for competition.</p>
        <p>But the commission's chairwoman, Maureen Helmer, said that while New York might have less robust competition than some states have now, it has laid the groundwork for more competition in the future. ''I think when you look in one or two years, you're going to see a very different picture,'' she said.</p>
        <p>New York has some of the highest electricity rates in the country, about 50 percent above the national average. Business groups say that makes the state less competitive economically, and they have long pushed for a freer energy market.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, too, have high hopes for competition. They predict that companies marketing ''green power,'' power generated by the cleanest sources, will find ready takers even if the companies charge a little more for electricity, a theory borne out in other states. Power plants, particularly older ones burning coal and oil, are a major source of air pollution and acid rain.</p>
        <p>''People are going to realize that the choice of an energy provider is the single most important environmental decision they can make,'' said Ralph Kavanagh, energy program co-director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>But if the rate structure does not leave room for the biggest energy marketers to turn a profit in New York, smaller companies offering green power say they stand even less of a chance.</p>
        <p>''New York's setup is just not supportive of competition,'' said Julie Blunden, vice president of Green Mountain Energy of South Burlington, Vt., a leading seller of green power that has shunned New York. ''We don't market ourselves as being cheaper, but price competition helps us because it means people are out shopping for a new supplier.''</p>
        <p>Industry officials and analysts say they believe that New York's regulators wanted to shield the state's seven established regional utilities, including Consolidated Edison, from the pressures of competition. But some also contend that in making trade-offs, the Public Service Commission believed that it had no choice but to restrict competition.</p>
        <p>As part of a five-year transition from the traditional monopolies to a competitive market, New York's utilities are being radically reorganized. They are selling their power plants and each one is splitting into two companies, one to own and maintain the transmission and distribution system, and the other to sell power to consumers. The commission was never sure that it had the legal authority to order such changes -- the utilities threatened to tie the state up in litigation for years if it tried -- so it negotiated the transition with the utilities, reaching agreements with them in 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Pataki administration was determined to begin the process with across-the-board rate reductions, which turned out to be 10 percent in Con Edison's territory and less in other parts of the state.</p>
        <p>''To get the utilities to agree to restructuring and rate cuts, they settled for less competition than they might have gotten,'' said Larry Shapiro, staff attorney at the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>Ms. Helmer said New York has been more aggressive than other states in getting utilities to sell their power plants. That, she said, will mean vigorous wholesale competition among power producers, which will eventually translate into retail competition and lower prices. The result, she said, will be ''more sustainable benefits for New Yorkers than they may get in other states.''</p>
        <p>Advocates of competition laud the sale of the power plants, but they say the price structure the state set still poses a long-term problem.</p>
        <p>Competition in New York began last year in Con Edison's territory, New York City and Westchester County, where about one-fifth of the market has been opened up to competitive bidding.</p>
        <p>Consumers snapped up that power as soon as it was available, but it is unclear how much real competition that reflects. Retailers were able to offer only a very small savings over Con Edison's rates, based mostly on a tax loophole that the administration has warned it will close this year. And many of the consumers who took advantage of the competition did not sign up with an outside retailer, but with Con Edison's own new, competitive subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Even after states introduce competition, the old utilities still hold monopoly control of the system that distributes power and delivers it to homes and businesses. So a portion of every customer's bill will continue to go to the utility, even if the customer buys electricity elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In a highly subjective process, state regulators look at the old, monopoly-style utility bill and decide which charges represent those services the utilities will continue to provide and which reflect the actual price of electricity. The electricity portion of the bill is known as a ''shopping credit'' or a ''back-out rate,'' meaning that consumers can stay with the utility, for now, at that price, or shop for a better deal.</p>
        <p>The lower the shopping credit, the higher the guaranteed revenue for the established utility, and the harder it becomes for any company to undercut the utility's price.</p>
        <p>Among four of the five states where competition has begun -- New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -- as well as a few others that have set their price structures but have not yet ushered in competition, New York allows the least room for competition by setting the lowest shopping credits. The fifth state, California, is an anomaly in that regulators did not set specific shopping credits, letting them fluctuate instead, and its system effectively leaves even less of a margin for competition than New York's does.</p>
        <p>The rate structure the Public Service Commission created for Con Edison allows a shopping credit averaging about 3.5 cents a kilowatt-hour out of a total bill of about 15 cents per kilowatt-hour, though both figures can vary widely. The credits are smaller, often less than 3 cents, for customers of upstate utilities like Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation.</p>
        <p>By comparison, most residents and businesses in Pennsylvania have shopping credits of 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour; the credits are scheduled to rise over the next few years until the average is above 5 cents. New Jersey, which is scheduled to begin some competition on June 1, has decided on a framework with shopping credits generally above 5 cents. In Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the average shopping credit is about 3.5 cents.</p>
