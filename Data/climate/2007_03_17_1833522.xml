        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-9</p>

        <p>A11</p>
        <p>Battle Over Casino Licenses  The legal battle over appeals filed by four companies that lost out in the recent round of bidding for casino licenses in Pennsylvania could cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in gambling tax revenue and delay property tax relief.</p>
        <p>A11</p>
        <p>Three Divers Killed in Florida  Three New Jersey men, all advanced certified divers, were killed off the Florida Keys while scuba diving and embarking on a risky exploration of a sunken vessel.</p>
