        <p>The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved a bill today that would require substantial reductions in emissions by utility companies, over the objections of determined opponents who said the measure would never become law.</p>
        <p>With the backing of one Republican and all but one of the committee's Democrats, the chairman, James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, pushed through his Clean Power Act on a 10-to-9 vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jeffords said the bill could provide the impetus for serious negotiations over emissions cuts. ''Today's action sends a clear message to this administration that the Senate is willing to engage on clean air and climate change,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added that the bill and other alternative proposals ''should be the starting place for our discussions, whenever the administration is ready to get serious.''</p>
        <p>While the bill's backers insist it is not a symbolic measure, its prospects are uncertain even in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and even darker in the House and at the White House.</p>
        <p>Under the Jeffords bill, utilities would have to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by 83 percent from current levels, mercury by 90 percent and carbon dioxide by 23 percent by 2008. The measure would also give operators of older power plants until 2013 to adopt the newest emissions technology.</p>
        <p>The inclusion of carbon dioxide in the bill was the main point of contention. The Bush administration and many lawmakers have rejected limits on carbon dioxide, saying its role in global warming is unclear. But backers of the bill said science showed that carbon dioxide was a crucial factor.</p>
        <p>Republican critics of the measure joined Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, in saying the Jeffords plan would cause major manufacturing disruptions, drive up electricity costs and devastate the coal industry by causing a fuel shift from coal to more price-variable natural gas.</p>
        <p>''This bill as written is not fair to my state of Montana and is not fair to the West,'' Mr. Baucus said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jeffords avoided another fight with the administration today, postponing his attempt to subpoena the Environmental Protection Agency for documents he had requested on plans to change some requirements for coal-burning plants. The agency agreed to begin turning over some of the material. Mr. Jeffords said that if he concluded the agency was not serious, he would renew the push for the subpoena next month.</p>
