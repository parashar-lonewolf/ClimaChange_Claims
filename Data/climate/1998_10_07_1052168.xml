        <p>Seeking to seize an issue from his Democratic opponent's quiver, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato testified at a Senate hearing today in support of legislation intended to reduce acid rain, which he called ''airborne terrorism'' that is defoliating New York's forests and destroying its lakes.</p>
        <p>Without the legislation he is sponsoring, ''we could never, ever protect those lakes,'' Mr. D'Amato told the Senate clean air subcommittee. ''If we were to shut down every motor vehicle in New York, close all of our factories, we would still have the same degradation of our quality of life.''</p>

        <p>Seeking to seize an issue from his Democratic opponent's quiver, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato testified at a Senate hearing today in support of legislation intended to reduce acid rain, which he called ''airborne terrorism'' that is defoliating New York's forests and destroying its lakes.</p>
        <p>Without the legislation he is sponsoring, ''we could never, ever protect those lakes,'' Mr. D'Amato told the Senate clean air subcommittee. ''If we were to shut down every motor vehicle in New York, close all of our factories, we would still have the same degradation of our quality of life.''</p>
        <p>But two hours later, Mr. D'Amato's Democratic challenger, Representative Charles E. Schumer, held a news conference near the Capitol to accuse Mr. D'Amato of trying to  whitewash nearly 18 years of anti-environmental votes.</p>
        <p>''Today, a leopard is trying to change his spots,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''Al D'Amato's environmental record is one of the worst in the nation. New York's families can't trust Al D'Amato to protect the environment.''</p>
        <p>The dueling events spotlighted the importance of the environment to both men's political calculations in what is shaping up to be perhaps the tightest Senate race in the country.</p>
        <p>For Mr. D'Amato, a Republican whose record is considered spotty by many environmental groups, the issue provides a way of distancing himself from conservative Republicans and softening his image among moderate New York voters.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Schumer, who has received consistently high ratings from environmental groups, the issue provides a way of showing a clear difference between him and Mr. D'Amato, a three-term incumbent whom Mr. Schumer has sought to portray as a right-wing extremist.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato's bill would require industries to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, which are typically released by coal-burning factories in the Midwest and drift on the prevailing winds to the Northeast, where they turn to acid rain and snow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer and some environmental groups scoffed at the timing of the Senator's testimony in support of the legislation, contending that Mr. D'Amato's allies in the Senate Republican majority had scheduled  the hearing to provide Mr. D'Amato an election-season platform. The Senate is scheduled to go into recess on Friday and Mr. D'Amato's bill has no chance of passing before then, and thus no chance to be approved this year.</p>
        <p>''Today's hearing is a total farce designed to give Al D'Amato a little election-year cover,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
        <p>But some environmental advocates -- as well as aides to Mr. Moynihan, the New York Democrat who endorsed Mr. Schumer last Saturday -- came to Mr. D'Amato's defense today, saying that the Republican has been pushing his bill for more than a year and had nothing to do with scheduling the hearing in the heat of the election.</p>
        <p>Tony Bullock, chief of staff for Mr. Moynihan, said that it was Mr. Moynihan, co-sponsor of the bill, who  requested the hearing last month and that it was delayed until now to allow for the release of a major acid rain study.</p>
        <p>''I'm saddened to see a partisan spin to it,'' Mr. Bullock said. ''It has a way of hurting what we are trying to do.''</p>
        <p>Several environmental groups that support the bill also praised Mr. D'Amato's work on the issue, saying that they wanted a hearing before the recess to give them a jump on passing the legislation next year.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue whose time has come,'' said Timothy J. Burke, executive director of the Adirondack Council. ''It's not about politics.''</p>
        <p>But other environmental groups used today's events to attack Mr. D'Amato. The Sierra Club, which has been running an independent campaign against the Senator this year, delivered black balloons emblazoned  ''D'Amato's hot air'' to Mr. D'Amato's office.</p>
        <p>''This is a classic case of election- year environmentalism,'' said Kathryn Hohmann, the club's director of environmental quality.</p>
        <p>The League of Conservation Voters also issued score cards showing that Mr. D'Amato's lifetime environmental voting record, as judged by the group, was 32 out of 100, while Mr. Schumer's was 88.</p>
        <p>The group noted that Mr. D'Amato ranked consistently lower than other Republicans from the Northeast, with his scores even hitting zero twice, in 1994 and 1996. Mr. Schumer routinely scored higher than Democrats from the region.</p>
        <p>''There is an enormous difference in their voting records,'' said Linda Davidoff, executive director of the New York League of Conservation Voters.</p>
