        <p>LEAD: The reckless destruction of the Amazon rain forest is surely among the worst of the world's ecological disasters. Encouraged by Brazil's Government, cattle ranchers and landless settlers have set fire to huge sections of Rondonia, in western Brazil, fouling the air and laying waste to a rich and precious natural wonder.</p>
        <p>The reckless destruction of the Amazon rain forest is surely among the worst of the world's ecological disasters. Encouraged by Brazil's Government, cattle ranchers and landless settlers have set fire to huge sections of Rondonia, in western Brazil, fouling the air and laying waste to a rich and precious natural wonder.</p>
        <p>President Jose Sarney now offers a plan to guide the forest's commercial development. It's disappointingly sketchy, aimed more at calming international outrage than saving Amazonia. Yet his willingness to address the problem at all reflects growing strength among Brazil's environmentalists. His successor may offer more credible proposals when Mr. Sarney leaves office in the fall. The West should be ready to respond generously.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarney's main proposal is to spend $100 million over five years to divide the forests into zones for agriculture, mining and conservation. The plan would leave huge parts of the 1.9-million-square-mile basin vulnerable to further exploitation. And Mr. Sarney made clear he would go no further. He invoked the Brazilian nationalist battle cry ''The Amazon is ours,'' and denounced what he called a worldwide campaign of ''scientific falsehoods.''</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have been pressuring Mr. Sarney for a year. In Rondonia alone, nearly 20 percent of the forest has disappeared. At risk is not only a priceless biological nursery but also the atmosphere. The fires may account for 7 percent of the world's annual production of carbon dioxide, intensifying the global warming known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>What role can industrial nations play to save the Amazon? Even when the xenophobic Mr. Sarney goes, the task will be to make Brazil feel part of a global solution to global problems, rather than a pariah deserving special scorn. Indeed, given its $115 billion foreign debt, Brazil needs special help.</p>
        <p>One answer lies in so-called debt-for-nature swaps that, in simplest terms, would forgive foreign debt in exchange for conservation. Foreigners would bear most of the cost, and many Brazilians like the idea. But Mr. Sarney says swaps would insult Brazil's sovereignty.</p>
        <p>The industrial nations might also announce their readiness to offer aid whenever Brazil seems genuinely ready to save the Amazon. Such concerted action is increasingly plausible now that environmental issues have become part of the Western political agenda and have inspired solutions that leap national boundaries. In March, for example, 12 European Community countries agreed to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, which threaten the ozone shield, by the year 2000. That initiative arguably helped persuade the U.S. to adopt the same goal.</p>
        <p>A logical conduit is the World Bank. Its president, Barber Conable, believes that environmental concerns are an important aspect of ''sustainable growth.'' It is expected to announce soon as much as $300 million in loans to spur development elsewhere in the country and remove pressure from the Amazon. That could serve as a starting point for a common effort to provide cash and persuade Brazil that the battle is not a challenge to its sovereignty but a joint struggle to save the planet.</p>
