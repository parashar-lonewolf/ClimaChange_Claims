        <p>HOLLYWOOD'S PRIME  Robert D. Lippet of Great Neck has film clips and will travel. Since his retirement from the advertising business, Mr. Lippet has turned his interest in old movies - he's a card-carrying member of the Society for Cinephiles - into a full schedule of library-hopping throughout the three-state area with his film-illustrated lectures.</p>
        <p>The current edition is ''Hollywood Vintage Years Revisited'' and, armed with his knowledge and such rare clips as ''King Kong'' outtakes, Al Jolson's screen test, George Raft and Carole Lombard dancing the bolero and James Cagney speaking Yiddish, Mr. Lippet will be at the Islip Public Library, 71 Monell Avenue, at 2 P.M. today and at the East Meadow Public Library, Front Street, at 8 P.M. Friday.</p>
        <p>Both sessions are free.  EUCUMENICAL 'MESSIAH'</p>
        <p>With the holiday season fast approaching and, along with it, the coming of Handel's ''Messiah,'' the Nassau chapter of the American Guild of Organists has scheduled a lecture today that should be of interest to Handel fans of all religious persuasions.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Paul Joseph will offer ''An Old Testament Interpretation of Handel's 'Messiah.' '' Backed by Biblical text and taped musical selections, Rabbi Joseph will explore the oratorio and its meaning to Jews and Christians alike. Guests are asked to bring their own scores for a group performance of the ''Hallelujah Chorus'' as a finale.</p>
        <p>The free program is at 3 P.M. at St. James United Methodist Church, St. James Place, Lynbrook.  MOUSE ON ICE</p>
        <p>That Mickey Mouse is celebrating his 60th birthday this year should come as no surprise to anyone who's been exposed to electronic and print media for the last 11 months.</p>
        <p>And now, the festivities surrounding the joyous occasion cool off a bit as ''Walt Disney's World on Ice'' devotes most of this year's edition to its star, Mickey Mouse. The show chronicles Mickey's career from his first cartoon, ''Steamboat Willie,'' to his current status as, to quote the advance publicity, a ''globe-trotting, continent-hopping international superstar.''</p>
        <p>Joined by his buddies, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, the Three Pigs and Pluto, and his enemies, Captain Pete and the Marvelous Madame Mim, Mickey glides into the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale Tuesday for an 11-performance stand through next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Ticket information: 587-9222.  LEAF SCULPTURE</p>
        <p>For three weeks now, Karen Shaw, an artist from Baldwin, has been in the Fine Arts Gallery at the Southampton campus of Long Island University, creating ''Nature Morte: The Late Great Lakes.''</p>
        <p>A three-dimensional work on the gallery floor, it is fashioned out of dry, dead leaves to form the shape of the Great Lakes. And with the help of campus art, theater and music department students, it comes complete with light and sound effects.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday at 4:30 P.M., Ms. Shaw will lead visitors through and around the work in a gallery talk, telling them all about her comment on the effects of acid rain on the Great Lakes.</p>
        <p>''Nature Morte'' will be on exhibit through Dec. 9, and can be seen noon to 5 P.M. weekdays.  CHOCOLATE CELEBRATION</p>
        <p>Dieters beware! Hofstra University is giving its academic imprimatur to chocolate and, indeed, is devoting an entire three-day conference to ''Chocolate: Food of the Gods.''</p>
        <p>Starting Wednesday with a pre-conference ''Chocolate Film Festival'' and reception (yes, ''Willie Wonka'' will be shown) at 6 P.M. at the student center, and continuing through Saturday, there'll be almost nonstop discussions of, and homage paid to, the candy.</p>
        <p>These will include scholarly panel explorations of such weighty subjects as ''Chocolate and Children,'' ''Chocolate and Psychology'' and even ''Chocolate and Your Health.''</p>
        <p>And, of course, there'll be performances of the ''Hot Chocolate Dance'' from the ''Nutcracker'' and the operetta, ''The Chocolate Soldier,'' as well as an all-chocolate banquet on Friday and a Chocolate Fair from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday.</p>
        <p>For a complete schedule and ticket and reservation information, call 560-6818.  HOLIDAY TOURS</p>
        <p>Sturdy shoes are called for Thursday and Saturday, when two charities stage their traditional Holiday Home Tours.</p>
        <p>The Nassau County Women's Division of the Salvation Army will hold its annual fund-raiser from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Thursday in Rockville Centre.</p>
        <p>Of the four homes on the docket, two, including the original DeMott homestead, date to the 18th century. Other stops on the tour are the Phillips House Museum, a restored Victorian residence, and the Baptist Church.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $8 in advance or $10 at the door. For reservations, call 747-4902.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the Junior League of the Amityville Woman's Club offers three holiday-decorated homes filled with plenty of handcrafted gifts and home-baked specialties for sale.</p>
        <p>Complete with coffee and cake, the tour, from noon to 4 P.M., costs $5. Information: 598-1700.  TAPPING AWAY</p>
        <p>Thanks to Affiliate Artists, a national organization that brings artists to local communities, Anita Feldman, a tap dancer-choreographer, is on Long Island for a three-week residency under the aegis of the Islip Arts Council and the Metropolitan Life Foundation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feldman, who earned a National Endowment for the Arts Choreographers Fellowship this year and who has performed solo or with her company, Body and Sole, throughout the United States and Japan, begins her stay Thursday with an appearance at the New York Institute of Technology in Central Islip.</p>
        <p>She'll offer ''Informance,'' which combines performance with chatting with the audience. This will take place at noon in the Student Cafeteria in Building 69, off Carleton Avenue.</p>
        <p>Before she leaves after a full-fledged concert appearance at the institute at 8 P.M. on Dec. 15, Ms. Feldman will have ''informed'' at schools, centers for the aged and at companies throughout the area.</p>
        <p>For a complete schedule of the events - all are free and open to the public - call 224-5420.  WINTER FESTIVAL</p>
        <p>Each December, Planting Fields Arboretum opens its gates and turns its mansion and outbuildings over to Winter Festival celebrants. This being December, Saturday is the day the five-day event begins.</p>
        <p>And so from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday and next Sunday, and from 10 A.M. to noon Dec. 5 through 7, Coe Hall, the Tudor revival mansion, will be decked out in traditional Christmas finery provided by neighboring garden clubs. Luncheon will be served in the Great Hall.</p>
        <p>Shoppers can drop in on the Holiday Arts and Crafts Fair at the Hay Barn Saturday and next Sunday. Also, the main greenhouse will be in full bloom with its colorful poinsettia display.</p>
        <p>Admission is $3 (children under 12, free). For reservations for the preview dinner-dance Friday night, call 922-0479.  ORCHESTRAS ON KEY</p>
        <p>What with one major American orchestra visiting Long Island and two local symphonies tuning up, Saturday is a great night for those who like their music big.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco Symphony, under Herbert Blomstedt's baton, plays Mozart, Ledholm and Tchaikovsky at 8 P.M. at Tilles Center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville. Ticket information: 626-3100.  Spotlighting opera by Verdi, Mascagni, Puccini, Ponchielli and Leoncavallo, the Nassau Symphony Orchestra, with Alfredo Silipigni conducting and Rebecca Copley, soprano, and Maurice Stern, tenor, will be at the Adams Playhouse on Hofstra University's Hempstead campus, also at 8 P.M. Ticket information: 877-2718.  Finally, with the violinist Gil Shaham as soloist, the Massapequa Philharmonic Orchestra, under Bartolomeo Ferrara's direction, is offering works by Bruch, Borodin and Brahms.</p>
        <p>The concert is at 8:30 P.M. at Massapequa High School, across from the Bar Harbor Shopping Center on Merrick Road, and is free.  A-CHORALING</p>
        <p>Just in case there were doubts about what time of the year it is, rest easy. The local choral societies begin doing their things Saturday, a sure sign that the holiday season is officially here.</p>
        <p>For example, the Waldorf Choral Society sings works by Bach, Britten, Palestrina, Hassler and Byrd at 8 P.M. at the Cathedral of the Incarnation, Cathedral Avenue, Garden City. Ticket information: 742-3434.  The Long Island Singers Society offers selections from Handel's ''Messiah'' and Honegger's ''Cantata de Noel'' at 8 P.M. at St. Paul the Apostle Roman Catholic Church, Route 107, Old Brookville (676-6598), while the Port Singers present their fall concert of Hannukah and Christmas music at 8 P.M. at Schreiber High School, Port Washington.

        <p>Hannukah comes early this year, with the first candle on the menorah to be lighted Saturday at sundown.</p>
        <p>While most of the local festivities do not take place until later in the eight-day Festival of Lights, the Shelter Rock Jewish Center gets things started Saturday with a Cantors Hannukah Concert.</p>
        <p>Three cantors - Abraham Albrecht, Dov Keren and Avshalom Zfira - and their combined choirs will sing a program of holiday music with an international flavor at 8:15 P.M. at the center on Shelter Rock Road in Roslyn.</p>
