        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I applaud the tenacity of Tanja Vogt, the West Milford, N.J., high school sophomore who led a campaign to ban polystyrene trays from her school cafeteria (news story, April 28). Unfortunately, her actions will exacerbate the problem.</p>
        <p>There is a growing feeling in this country that it would be environmentally responsible to ban plastics. But we need simply to look at the title of Tanja's inspiration, Thomas Paine's ''Common Sense,'' to see what is missing in this debate.</p>
        <p>Let's look quickly at the arguments underpinning her efforts:</p>
        <p>* Polystyrene foam packaging is taking up shrinking landfill space.</p>
        <p>It does take up space; one-quarter of 1 percent of municipal landfill space. Paper, yard wastes and food wastes comprise almost two-thirds of the waste stream. Banning polystyrene will have a nearly unmeasurable effect. The school board's all-paper policy will increase solid waste headed for the landfill because used paper food packaging cannot be recycled.</p>
        <p>* Polystyrene foam food packaging contains chlorofluorocarbons, which deplete the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Some did. About 30 percent were manufactured using harmful CFC's. But not anymore. The food-packaging industry voluntarily reduced its use of harmful CFC's by 100 percent in one year.</p>
        <p>* Polystyrene does not decompose.</p>
        <p>Tanja is right. But it can be recycled. Students in Massachusetts took a different approach from hers. They are collecting polystyrene trays in their cafeteria to be picked up by a recycling company. The polystyrene is cleaned, pelletized and manufacured into materials not for food service. R. JERRY JOHNSON  Executive Director  Polystyrene Packaging Council Inc.  Washington, May 2, 1989</p>
