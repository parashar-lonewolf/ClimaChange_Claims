        <p>LEAD: EVEN if rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere do not cause the earth's climate to warm, they will probably work dramatic changes in natural and agricultural ecosystems, plant physiologists and ecologists say.</p>
        <p>EVEN if rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere do not cause the earth's climate to warm, they will probably work dramatic changes in natural and agricultural ecosystems, plant physiologists and ecologists say.</p>
        <p>In a research effort that has been accelerating over the last five years, scientists are uncovering intricate patterns of plant responses to higher levels of carbon dioxide. But they are a considerable distance from understanding the full range of responses or achieving a consensus on how the positive and negative effects add up on balance.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere so rapidly, largely because of the burning of fossil fuels, that the global concentration will double by the end of the next century if the present rate of buildup continues, experts say. While scientists are still uncertain about the ultimate impact of the gas's heat-trapping properties on global climate, some believe that they can already detect the early stage of a worldwide explosion of vegetation stimulated by carbon dioxide, and their latest experiments suggest that astonishing developments may lie ahead.</p>
        <p>In a controlled experiment at a Federal laboratory in Phoenix, for instance, orange trees raised from seedlings have been exposed to nearly doubled levels of carbon dioxide for the last three years. The combined volume of their trunks and branches is almost triple that of orange trees grown in normal air.</p>
        <p>For some experts, this eye-opening growth portends major improvements in agricultural productivity, promises a lusher and more robust natural world, and suggests that burgeoning trees and other vegetation might remove enough carbon dioxide from the air to stablize atmospheric concentrations, although at higher levels than now.</p>
        <p>Scientists have found that plants growing amid higher carbon dioxide levels also are hardier in some respects. They use water more efficiently and because of their greater mass, they can better resist stress in general.</p>
        <p>''I'm really sold on carbon dioxide; I think it's very beneficial,'' said Dr. Sherwood B. Idso of the Agriculture Department's water conservation laboratory in Phoenix, where the orange-tree experiment is under way.</p>
        <p>But other scientists, urging caution, are not so sure, and some say it is possible that greater carbon dioxide levels may be harmful on balance. They say the growth can be limited or even canceled out by a number of offsetting factors, particularly shortages of soil nutrients. They also say a growing body of research leaves no doubt that the growth spurt induced by carbon dioxide affects some plant species much more than others, and some very little if at all. Some trees, grasses and other plants will flourish at the expense of others, they say, disrupting the ecological makeup of croplands, forests, marshes and grasslands with consequences that will reverberate through entire ecosystems.</p>
        <p>And because the nitrogen content of unfertilized plants is diluted as carbon dioxide stimulates their growth, they say, many will be less nutritious. Experiments suggest that some insects that eat such plants do not develop properly and display higher mortality rates even if they eat much more plant material to compensate for the lower quality. This, scientists fear, could reduce insect populations and affect entire food chains.</p>
        <p>Scientists are also turning up evidence that increased carbon dioxide may alter the timing of plants' flowering, disrupting the interaction between some plants and their pollinators to the detriment of both.</p>
        <p>''The consequences are unbelievably complicated and there are so many of them,'' says Dr. Fakhri A. Bazzaz, a plant ecologist at Harvard University who is in the forefront of research on the question. Experimental work suggests there is ''no reason to be sanguine'' about the responses of both natural and human-made ecosystems to higher levels of carbon dioxide, he said.</p>
        <p>The Dynamics</p>
        <p>Carbon Dioxide And Plant Growth</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is the primary raw material used by plants in manufacturing carbohydrates from which they build their tissues and enzymes. Using energy acquired from visible light in photosynthesis, plants ''fix'' or capture carbon dioxide molecules from the air.</p>
        <p>In the last century, roughly the industrial age, atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased to about 350 parts per million from about 280 parts per million. In the latter half of the next century, many scientists say, it will reach 600 to 700 parts per million if the current rate of increase continues.</p>
        <p>Scientists have established that doubled concentrations of the gas would have startling effects on the growth of many types of plants, greatly increasing rates of photosynthesis and agricultural yields. One survey of 700 agronomic studies by Dr. Bruce Kimball at the Phoenix laboratory found that crop yields improved by 34 percent where carbon dioxide was doubled.</p>
        <p>Trees and plants usually grow taller, produce more and bigger branches, flowers and fruit, display more and thicker leaves with more chlorophyll and send out more extensive root systems to search out more nutrients in the soil. Scientists have also established that increased carbon dioxide causes small pores on the outside of leaves, called stomata, to close slightly. This reduces the amount of moisture lost from the leaf to the atmosphere, enabling the plants to withstand drought better.</p>
        <p>A number of studies have suggested that the carbon dioxide increases of the last few years are stimulating a worldwide surge of plant growth. Some scientists say this is reflected in increased widths of tree rings and in changes in the number of stomata on plant leaves.</p>
        <p>But the chief evidence comes from studies by a number of independent researchers in the late 1980's showing that terrestrial vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere is absorbing more and more carbon dioxide in the spring and early summer and releasing more to the atmosphere as plants die in the fall.</p>
        <p>''This tells me the biosphere as a whole is being stimulated,'' said Dr. Idso. ''More carbon dioxide is being taken out of the atmosphere and more is being put back in; the biosphere breathes once a year and is breathing deeper.''</p>
        <p>Although plants emit oxygen as part of photosynthesis, he said, the amount added to the atmosphere because of increased growth would not be enough to have a significant effect on the vast pool of oxygen that animals breathe.</p>
        <p>The Caveats</p>
        <p>Not All Plants Respond Alike</p>
        <p>Not all plants are taking in carbon dioxide at the same rate. The difference shows up most broadly between two main classes of plants, C3 and C4, so named because of differences in the way they absorb carbon dioxide. In the first stage of absorption, C3 plants manufacture a molecule with three carbon atoms, while C4 plants manufacture a four-atom molecule. The C4 molecule is part of a chemical mechanism, or ''pump,'' that enables the plant to assimilate carbon dioxide more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Lacking the more efficient mechanism of the C4 plants, the C3's depend on simple diffusion of carbon dioxide through their tissues. Higher concentrations of the gas in the air aid this diffusion, but make less difference to a C4 plant. The result is that C3's benefit more than C4's from the higher concentrations.</p>
        <p>In the salt marshes of Chesapeake Bay south of Annapolis, scientists led by Dr. Bert Drake of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center at Edgewater, Md., have studied the effects of increased carbon dioxide on naturally growing C3 and C4 marsh grasses for the last four years. Surrounded by special chambers that allow the plants to be saturated with carbon dioxide, the C3 grasses showed increases in photosynthetic rates and mass of 60 to 80 percent. The C4 grasses showed no increase. Both species demonstrated greater efficiency in water use. Other species of C4 plants show some increase in growth amid increased carbon dioxide, but generally the C3's outperform them. Among C3's are many important field crops, including wheat, rice and soybeans, although a few field crops, like sugar cane and corn, are C4's. Virtually all trees and most broadleaf plants are C3's, while grasses may be either.</p>
        <p>Some scientists say that with increased carbon dioxide, C4 crops will find it more difficult to compete with C3 weeds and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Even within each of these broad classes, species respond differently. In a study led by Dr. Boyd Strain, a plant ecologist and physiologist at Duke University, two common Southern species of C3 trees, sweet gum and loblolly pine, were subjected to higher carbon dioxide levels. Loblolly is the South's most important timber crop, and sweet gum is a major competitor for resources in the ecosystem they share. The study found that sweet gum seedlings, largely because of their broad leaves, responded more dramatically than the pines.</p>
        <p>Many scientists believe differences in species' response to enhanced carbon dioxide, and other problems some attribute to the enhancement, can be satisfactorily managed and minimized in agricultural settings where one crop predominates, and that higher carbon dioxide levels will be an agricultural boon.</p>
        <p>''Agriculture has survived so many catastrophic events,'' said Dr. David T. Patterson, a plant physiologist for the Department of Agriculture associated with Dr. Strain's laboratory. ''It's likely that this change will also be weathered.''</p>
        <p>But the price of this might be high, says Dr. Bazzaz, since crops do not benefit from higher carbon dioxide levels unless more fertilizer is applied and more pesticides are used to kill insects and, in the case of C4 crops, competitive C3 weeds. This would increase costs, and farmers in some development countries might not be able to afford it, he said.</p>
        <p>Natural Ecosystems</p>
        <p>The Impact On the Wild</p>
        <p>Natural ecosystems cannot be managed like agricultural fields, Dr. Bazzaz said. Both Dr. Strain and Dr. Bazzaz, whose work deals mainly with natural ecosystems, say shifts in competitive advantage among plant species could produce far-reaching changes in the wild and even reduce the number of species.</p>
        <p>In his laboratory at Harvard, Dr. Bazzaz has found that some annual plants do not do as well as others amid increased carbon dioxide. This, he said, suggests that annuals will leave fewer seeds when they die and that other species that do better in elevated carbon dioxide will become dominant the following year. Other experiments at Harvard have found that increased carbon dioxide altered the relative strength of five species of tropical trees.</p>
        <p>While there is cause for concern on this score, Dr. Idso wrote in a 1989 review of research on the subject, it is possible that ecosystems could adjust much as forests did in the remote past, when carbon dioxide levels were higher than now. In those forests, he wrote, tree species came to co-exist rather than compete.</p>
        <p>Humans also have little or no control over what Dr. Bazzaz and Dr. Strain say is a drop in the nutritional quality of natural vegetation that accompanies its jump in quantity at higher levels of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''Without fertilizing the soil,'' said Dr. Strain, ''you pump more carbon into the plant and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen or phosphorus goes way up.'' He said this means insects and other plant-eaters have to eat more plant material to get enough protein.</p>
        <p>In an experiment at Dr. Bazzaz's laboratory, Dr. Eric D. Fajer found that larvae of the buckeye butterfly ate 20 to 30 percent more vegetation from plants when they were grown in an atmosphere of doubled carbon dioxide, but that even so they developed more slowly and had higher mortality rates. Dr. Bazzaz suggests such effects could ''cascade down the food chain'' as fewer insects survive to provide food for predators. Dr. Idso, in his recent review, wrote that while some studies have found harmful repercussions for a number of insect species, they have not done so for others. ''The final word on this matter is not yet in,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Reduced nitrogen in plants could slow the decay of leaves and other plant litter, said Dr. Bazzaz, reducing soil fertility and producing a thick carpet of undecayed leaves and twigs that could hinder seed germination and, ultimately, the regeneration of forests. Dr. Idso says this could be offset by higher populations of litter-eating microorganisms that would be attracted to the larger root networks, and by an increase in earthworms.</p>
        <p>While scientists struggle to learn how all these factors play out in nature, another question looms: If the global climate does warm substantially, how will this change the picture? Dr. Idso says the stress of high temperatures can be mitigated by carbon-dioxide enrichment. But studies at the University of Florida found that at both present and higher levels of carbon dioxide, grain yields decrease as temperature rises. A world 5 to 6 degrees warmer than now, as climatologists now predict by the end of the next century, ''may not overpower the carbon dioxide effect, but we haven't run the numbers,'' said Dr. Hartwell Allen, a plant physiologist with the university and the Agriculture Department.</p>
        <p>Sorting Out Mixed Effects Of a Profound Change</p>
        <p>Scientists expect rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to stimulate the growth of many kinds of plants. Some say this will bring about a global explosion in vegetation. But others say growth could be limited by stress and lack of nutrients. The net effect could be negative, some scientists say, especially on natural ecosystems.</p>
        <p>NUTRITION VALUES MAY ALTER</p>
        <p>Rising levels of carbon dioxide cause the nitrogen content of plants in nutrient-poor soils to decrease proportionally relative to the starch and sugar content. Consequently, some plant-eaters must consume more vegetation to get enough nitrogen-based protein.</p>
        <p>SOILS MAY CHANGE</p>
        <p>Leaves may not decompose as fast, some scientists say, slowing re-release of nutrients into soil and smothering some types of tree seedlings. Other scientists say the process could be offset by an increase in earthworms and soil microbes.</p>
        <p>NEW FLOWERING PATTERNS</p>
        <p>Phlox studied in Texas responded to higher levels of carbon dioxide by flowering earlier. The food supply for pollinators was no longer available when they expected and required it. Theoretically, this could lead to a reduction in pollinating insects.</p>
