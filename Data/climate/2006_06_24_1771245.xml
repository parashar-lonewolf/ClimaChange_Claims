        <p>10 P.M. (Discovery Channel, DTimes) ADDICTED TO OIL: THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN REPORTING -- The cry of ''Go Green!'' is ricocheting around the country as the war on terror takes a toll on the American economy, and global warming, conservation and energy alternatives become more important than ever to national security. In this hourlong special, Mr. Friedman (above), a columnist for The New York Times, riffs on petropolitics -- a phrase he coined to define the relationship between oil prices and oil-rich nations -- and discusses the political, strategic and economic impact of the country's reliance on fossil fuels while proposing solutions for beating the addiction. Forget the gasoline lines of the 1970's. ''This is not your parents' energy crisis,'' Mr. Friedman says.</p>
        <p>8 A.M. (HBO Family) POSTMAN PAT -- Since 1981, British children have gone postal over Pat, a mail carrier in the make-believe hamlet of Greenfield in Yorkshire. In 2004, the series was retooled with stop-gap animation and multicultural story lines, and Pat was exported to the United States -- by FedEx, we're guessing. In these two new episodes, the warm-and-fuzzy Pat (above left, with his cat, Jess, in New York) paints a rainbow on the playground wall, complete with a pot of gold, and helps knight a brave child.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Oxygen) BANSHEE -- Talk about lousy planning. In this made-for-television action drama, a tough girl (Taryn Manning) boosts the car of a serial killer -- and he's dead set on getting it back.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Logo) THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM -- They are outcasts in either corner: the gay community doesn't want them and neither does the Republican party. This ''Real Momentum'' documentary looks at three gay Republicans fighting to gain acceptance, love and victory while sticking tight to their principles.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Spike) THE ULTIMATE FIGHTER -- Prepare to be pounded in this three-hour season finale of the mixed martial arts reality series in which bitter competitors suffered the indignities of training and living together. Four matches will be shown in their entirety, live from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, with the winners in the light heavyweight and middleweight rounds being crowned Ultimate Fighters and rewarded with six-figure U.F.C. contracts. Those who missed the pummeling up to this point can watch all of Season 3, starting at 9 a.m. this morning.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sci Fi) ANDROID APOCALYPSE -- A hard-working human (Scott Bairstow) loses his job in the last city on Earth to an android, and in a fit of rage kills another. Now he's sentenced to a prison deep in the wasteland, and only the android (Joseph Lawrence, above right, with Mr. Bairstow) he is shackled to can get him out.</p>
