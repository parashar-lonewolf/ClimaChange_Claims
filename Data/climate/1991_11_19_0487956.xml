        <p>For more than 30 years, residents of this 264-year-old town northeast of Concord have been hearing about missing gravestones. Old slate markers belonging to their long-dead ancestors had been stolen, the story went, and were on display in a major Massachusetts museum.</p>
        <p>Over the years, several of the most determined community residents took their binoculars and traveled about 115 miles to Sturbridge, Mass., in an effort to see what was in the fenced-off burial exhibit at Old Sturbridge Village, the 200-acre re-creation of an 1830's New England settlement. But with little knowledge of whose tombstones they were looking for, they had no luck unraveling the mystery.</p>

        <p>For more than 30 years, residents of this 264-year-old town northeast of Concord have been hearing about missing gravestones. Old slate markers belonging to their long-dead ancestors had been stolen, the story went, and were on display in a major Massachusetts museum.</p>
        <p>Over the years, several of the most determined community residents took their binoculars and traveled about 115 miles to Sturbridge, Mass., in an effort to see what was in the fenced-off burial exhibit at Old Sturbridge Village, the 200-acre re-creation of an 1830's New England settlement. But with little knowledge of whose tombstones they were looking for, they had no luck unraveling the mystery.</p>
        <p>"We had no proof," said Marion McIntyre, the town librarian, registrar and unofficial historian. "It was just a story."</p>
        <p>Then, with the help of a reporter from The New Hampshire Sunday News, Mrs. McIntyre recently obtained a list of the names on 13 gravestones that had been given to the Sturbridge museum in 1960 by a New Hampshire antiques dealer. Using a town history book, a 1940 list of those buried in one of the town's cemeteries, and hints from local history buffs, she traced all 13 names back to Gilmanton.</p>
        <p>"There's just no question about it," she said. "It's a miraculous miracle." Stones Removed From Display</p>
        <p>How the antiques dealer obtained the headstones may never be known. He has since died, and no one at the museum remembers the transaction, said Michelle Meehan, a museum spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>But embarrassed museum officials removed the headstones from the exhibit a day after learning of Mrs. McIntyre's discovery. Trustees later voted unanimously to give back 11 headstones; the other two will stay because Gilmanton families had erected new markers on those graves.</p>
        <p>Unwittingly, Gilmanton's search for pieces of its history put Sturbridge in the middle of a debate about whether museums should keep such personal artifacts at all, or act to preserve them from theft, vandalism, bad weather and even acid rain.</p>
        <p>"Some people maintain that the stones should stay as monuments whether they get totally obliterated or not," said Miranda Levin, executive director of the Association for Gravestone Studies in Worcester, Mass. "Others believe they are works of art and should be preserved and replaced by replicas."</p>
        <p>Interest in preserving America's oldest gravestones is growing, said Ms. Levin, whose organization is made up of 1,000 professionals and hobbyists involved in gravestone conservation.</p>
        <p>Tales of gravestone thefts and of old headstones found abandoned are common, she said. When the Gilmanton headstones were taken, few people seemed to care about old cemeteries.  But that was before so many of them started to disappear beneath shopping malls and big developments.</p>
        <p>"A lot of these old cemeteries have been bulldozed for development, and I think that's been a big source of interest," Ms. Levin said. Still, most states do not have or do not enforce laws pertaining to how old gravestones are to be treated, she said, adding, "It's a big mess."</p>
        <p>With 23 headstones left in its burial display, Sturbridge Village will probably not need to replace the Gilmanton stones, Ms. Meehan said. No other towns have called looking for lost markers, but the museum has put together a list documenting who sold or donated the markers it still has.</p>
        <p>There apparently are no hard feelings in Gilmanton. "We don't hold them responsible in any shape or form," said Mrs. McIntyre, who is busy arranging for the transfer and storage of the headstones. She plans to ask the town for a special appropriation to anchor them at the gravesites next spring.</p>
        <p>Among those being returned are markers for the founder of the town's oldest operating tavern and the daughter of a woman who was immortalized in a poem for riding 80 miles to Boston with her infant son to see if her husband had been hurt in the Battle of Bunker Hill.</p>
        <p>The discovery has given a lift to Mrs. McIntyre's favorite cause: cleaning up little-known cemeteries in town. In the last decade she identified 30 abandoned burial grounds and began clearing them herself. Since the headstones were traced to Sturbridge, offers of help have poured in and volunteers have cleared five more cemeteries.  But at one site, only one headstone remains.</p>
        <p>"Whether you like this world or not," Mrs. McIntyre said, "it's all we've got, and these are the people that made it that way."</p>
