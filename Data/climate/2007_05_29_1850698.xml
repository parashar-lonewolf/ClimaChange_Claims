        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Frank G. Zarb (''How to Win the Energy War,'' Op-Ed, May 23) is right that the politics of creating a concrete plan to move America toward energy independence would be tricky.</p>
        <p>Research by Public Agenda indicates that this is a great time for leaders to step up on this issue. Almost all Americans -- 89 percent according to our most recent Confidence in U.S. Foreign Policy Index -- say reducing dependence on foreign energy would improve America's security.</p>
        <p>In fact, to the public, energy independence is second only to better intelligence gathering as a security strategy. And nearly as many, 85 percent, think the government can do something to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. The public clearly sees energy dependence as an issue that goes way beyond gas prices.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that the public will gladly accept Mr. Zarb's suggestions for very substantial gasoline taxes and other remedies. But Americans definitely do want leaders to step up with new ideas and be clear about the pros and cons of various approaches.</p>
        <p>Scott Bittle  New York, May 23, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is the executive editor of Public Agenda Online.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Geopolitical, economic and environmental considerations support an increasingly urgent need for a credible energy policy that would overcome the United States' dependency on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>As the centerpiece of such a policy, Frank G. Zarb calls for increases in the gas tax with a tax rebate for lower-income taxpayers. Broader-based tax relief to accompany the gas tax increase would be better. Ideally, the proposal could be designed to be tax-neutral, with broader tax cuts offsetting the gas tax increase.</p>
        <p>A report commissioned by the Institute for Socioeconomic Studies during the 1980 energy crisis found that a universal gas tax rebate would provide more general relief, while protecting the poor and middle class from the regressive nature of the gas tax.</p>
        <p>Recent Congressional Budget Office research suggests that the overall economic impact of higher energy prices could be minimized through broad-based tax relief. Such an approach could overcome political resistance on economic grounds to measures that would address America's vulnerability because of its dependency on imported oil.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dependence on foreign oil affects military decisions and our economic well-being. We can do something as citizens, in time of war, to help.</p>
        <p>I offer a suggestion: Exclude gasoline-powered vehicles from New York City on weekends. Bicycling, skateboarding and scootering can provide health benefits in numerous ways. It would be wonderful to see plays and dine out without the chaos of traffic-riddled streets. And this would help give us the freedom to breathe in nonpolluted air.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers are very resourceful, as we demonstrated during the last transit strike. We can and must set an example for the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>Norman Singer  Brooklyn, May 24, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is clear that we need to conserve on fossil fuels, construct an extensive rail system and engage in regional urban planning, with public transportation to employment hubs. It is also clear that no significant effort has been put forth in this regard.</p>
        <p>In his nostalgic view of President Gerald R. Ford's initiatives following the 1973 Arab oil embargo, Frank G. Zarb, Mr. Ford's energy assistant, recalls a conversation with Senator Henry M. Jackson in which the senator asked Mr. Zarb whether he knew how to start another Arab embargo. Mr. Zarb then writes: ''He was right. Without a crisis, a real national energy program could not get past normal political paralysis.''</p>
        <p>Doesn't Mr. Zarb or anyone in Washington consider the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a crisis worthy enough of a national commitment to energy independence?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The only safe nuclear reactor is the Sun, which provides a clean, inexhaustible energy supply. Building new nuclear or fossil power plants would cost the same as building solar power plants, even if we disregarded the costs of global warming and the coming energy wars.</p>
        <p>The only way to end public confusion is to build solar-hydrogen demonstration plants. After operating them, we could firmly establish their costs and feasibility. Until then, the lobbying interests will continue to block progress by debating facts.</p>
        <p>Building that demonstration plant would take a statesman in Washington -- but so did the Moon landing and rebuilding Europe.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree that nuclear power is the cleanest and best option for America's electric power supply.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power has an outstanding safety record in this country. In addition, current plants produce electricity at the lowest production costs in the United States today.</p>
        <p>New nuclear power plants that are to be ordered in late 2007 and beyond are estimated to be just as economically competitive with new base-load coal plants.</p>
        <p>The disposition of nuclear power's only by-product, solid radioactive waste, in a geologic repository has been the preferred solution since its inception in the 1950s. We need to continue the Yucca Mountain project with steady and measured engineering planning and licensing based on a solid safety case. It is by far the best long-term option.</p>
