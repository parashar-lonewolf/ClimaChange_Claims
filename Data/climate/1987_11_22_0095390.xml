        <p>LEAD: The six Democratic Presidential candidates jockeyed for position at the New Hampshire Democratic convention today, heating up a cold autumn afternoon with tough talk about the Reagan Administration, the Federal budget and the importance of this state's primary.</p>
        <p>The six Democratic Presidential candidates jockeyed for position at the New Hampshire Democratic convention today, heating up a cold autumn afternoon with tough talk about the Reagan Administration, the Federal budget and the importance of this state's primary.</p>
        <p>The convention drew more than 1,000 delegates and guests to the campus of St. Anselm College here, including scores of partisans who covered the meeting hall with signs, ballons and banners on behalf of one campaign or another. The floor demonstrations were long, the oratory energetic.</p>
        <p>The gathering came less than three months before New Hampshire holds the first Presidential primary election of 1988. Gov. Micahel S. Dukakis of Massachusetts holds the lead in the polls here, but his opponents say recent surveys show him to be increasingly vulnerable in the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis tried to project a winning image today, saying he had countered the critics who held that a New England governor could not run well around the country. ''We've proved them wrong,'' he said. ''We're running a national campaign.'' Stand on Seabrook</p>
        <p>He went on to pledge continued opposition to the nuclear power plant in Seabrook, N.H., just over the border with his own state, as well as action on such environmental issues as acid rain. He also presented himself as the candidate who ''knows how to make those tough budget choices.''</p>
        <p>The latest front-runner in the Iowa polls, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, used the forum to try to answer the charge of inconsistency, stemming from his call for a range of new domestic programs as well as a balanced budget.</p>
        <p>''I am here because I want a Government that cares,'' Mr. Simon said. The Illinois senator asserted that it was time for the nation to aid senior citizens with the cost of nursing home care. But he added, ''We have to do it on a pay-as-you-go basis,'' meaning he would find new revenues to pay for it.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri devoted his speech to a stinging assault on President Reagan. ''No more cue cards, no more teleprompters, no more sleeping Presidents,'' he said. Attack on Budget Law</p>
        <p>The Rev. Jesse Jackson, while his organized demonstration was smaller than most, roused the audience with an appeal for ''moral leadership'' from the party and its eventual nominee. He began with a sharp attack on the budget-balancing law whose provisions President Reagan put into effect Friday. He said the law was unfair because it applied equally to programs for the rich and poor.</p>
        <p>''As Democrats, we shouldn't be weak and feeble on how we get out of this budget deficit,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Look how we got in.'' He went on to call for sharp cuts in military spending and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. ''America is militarily strong, Reagan is morally weak,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''We need strong leadership and a new direction.''</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona, as he has in recent weeks, urged his fellow Democratic candidates to confront the Federal deficit.</p>
        <p>And Senator Albert Gore Jr. delivered a harsh appraisal of the Reagan Adminsitration, saying ''on issue after issue, they have given us catastrophe.''</p>
        <p>Today's convention, which basically convened to hear the candidates, gave campaigns the opportunity to test their organizations, New Hampshire party officials said. ''The better technicians in the campaigns looked on this as a dry run,'' said Joseph Grandmaison, the state Democratic chairman.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, the six candidates squared off in Needham, Mass., for a debate that was taped for later broadcast on the Fox Television Network. Gore Sees a Left Lean</p>
        <p>The debate featured some sharp exchanges between Senator Gore and his colleagues. He pressed his argument that the Democratic nominating process, particularly the Iowa caucuses, pushes candidates to the left and thus diminishes their chances in the general election. Mr. Gore has staked his campaign on that argument, and recently pulled most of his staff out of Iowa to focus his efforts on the batch of Southern primaries and caucuses scheduled for March 8.</p>
        <p>''The Iowa caucuses encourage all the candidates to tailor a message for a group that's not really representative of the electorate as a whole,'' Mr. Gore asserted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon, who took the lead in the most recent Iowa Poll published in the Des Moines Register, jumped to the state's defense. ''Iowa is not unrepresentative of the nation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis countered that they may have ''an honest disagreement'' on defense policy, ''but please don't tell me I'm doing it because of somebody in the Iowa caucuses.''</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the exchange, Mr. Simon asserted: ''I understand the politics of it. Sam Nunn got out of the race and all of a sudden we saw a new Al Gore emerge.'' The Illinois senator was referring to Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democrat whose defense expertise and conservative philosophy made him the first choice of many Southern Democrats.</p>
