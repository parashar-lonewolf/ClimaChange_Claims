        <p>LEAD: Environmentalists and politicians can argue the costs and benefits of international action on global warming from now until doomsday, and they probably will. But nothing will get done without an institutional mechanism to develop, institute and enforce regulations across national boundaries.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and politicians can argue the costs and benefits of international action on global warming from now until doomsday, and they probably will. But nothing will get done without an institutional mechanism to develop, institute and enforce regulations across national boundaries.</p>
        <p>The need for a mechanism emerged clearly from this week's meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group sponsored by the United Nations. President Bush's speech at the conference, in which he called for more research on the ''uncertainty'' of global warming, may have disappointed some. But that misses the larger point.</p>
        <p>Little can be accomplished in the absence of multilateral institutions that will eventually carry out whatever remedial environmental actions the world community can agree upon. In short, we need an international treaty, modeled perhaps on the Law of the Sea Treaty, to coordinate and enforce international action on the environment.</p>
        <p>Of course, many scientific questions need to be answered. We need to know the costs and benefits of various means of stopping the buildup of greenhouse gases. We need to discuss regulatory standards and cost-effective enforcement measures. Eventually, however, we will have to act.</p>
        <p>The world cannot afford to rely on independent action by individual countries. The results are bound to be highly uneven: One nation could cut back on its carbon dioxide emissions; one could stop the destruction of its own forests; still another could do nothing. The least responsible transnational corporations will seek out and encourage the most permissive regulatory environments.</p>
        <p>For maximum impact as well as equitable burden-sharing, there will have to be universal standards universally accepted. Deliberation about the political palatability and enforcement of these standards should be concurrent with, not subsequent to, deliberation about science and regulation.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, the question of whether to strengthen organizations like the United Nations Environmental Program or the International Maritime Organization, combine them or build a new one - a global Environmental Protection Agency -from scratch. Or take the question of what powers should be granted to the chosen institutions. Should these institutions be limited to formulating recommendations or should they also have the power to promulgate and enforce regulations?</p>
        <p>Political considerations must also be discussed. Will there be a single governing body with universal representation? What kind of voting arrangement will govern its decisions - a one-nation, one-vote system like the United Nations General Assembly, a weighted system like the World Bank or Intelsat or something in between? Dispute-resolution mechanisms must be put in place.</p>
        <p>Whether the international institution is given power to enforce rather than merely recommend regulations obviously affects representational and decision-making issues. In fact, the more power the organization will be expected to exercise and the more money it will be authorized to spend, the fiercer will be the battles.</p>
        <p>The arena in which these battles are fought will be an international conference of some 160 sovereign states to be held in Brazil in 1992. These states will vastly differ in their contributions to environmental degradation. Their delegates will represent every race, culture, ideology, geographical circumstance and state of economic development on earth.</p>
        <p>Given the scope and complexity of this conference's task, a thorough preparatory process is indispensable. The U.N. took four years to lay the groundwork for the Law of the Sea Conference, and the conference spent nine more years, with twice a year meetings, to produce a treaty.</p>
        <p>The U.S. has not yet taken a prominent role in laying the groundwork for an environmental treaty. Our leadership in such effort nevertheless can make a critical difference. It is in our own interest and in that of the entire world community to take the initiative.</p>
        <p>Our responsibility, our economic stake and our breadth of regulatory experience are unequalled. It is not too late.</p>
