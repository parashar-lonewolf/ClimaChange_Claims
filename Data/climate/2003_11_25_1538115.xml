        <p>Beetles' Energy Booster</p>
        <p>For certain scarab beetles, a tropical philodendron is like a short-stay motel. Males and females check in to the plant's floral chamber, mate and leave sometime the next day, pollinating the flower in the process. The beetles get food (in the form of pollen) in addition to a love nest (though they don't get much privacy, as a single flower can be host to a lot of beetles).</p>
        <p>Now Australian and French researchers suggest that the insects get another reward as well, energy. The philodendron flowers they pollinate are self-heating, or thermogenic, and the researchers report in the journal Nature that the beetles take advantage of the heat to expend far less energy for their activities.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who reported on their studies in the journal Nature, measured the temperatures inside flowers of Philodendron solimoesense, which is found in French Guyana. Like other thermogenic plants, the philodendrons undergo an alternative type of respiration, in which their mitochondria produce heat instead of the energy-storing compound A.T.P. The researchers found that the temperature inside the floral chamber averaged about seven degrees Fahrenheit higher than the surrounding air.</p>
        <p>The scientists then studied the metabolic rates of Cyclocephala colasi, a beetle species that frequents the philodendrons, at different temperatures. They found that an active beetle (as opposed to one that is just resting) uses 2 to 4.8 times as much energy outside in the cold air as it does in the warm confines of the flower.</p>
        <p>Old Horses Faded Away</p>
        <p>When the hero rides off into the sunset at the end of a western, he and the horse get smaller and smaller as they recede from view.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the Pleistocene Epoch in what is now Alaska, the region's last native horses rode off into the sunset: they became extinct. And as they did, a paleontologist from the University of Alaska at Fairbanks says, they literally got smaller and smaller.</p>
        <p>The paleontologist, Dr. R. Dale Guthrie, measured and dated fossilized leg bones of two horse species from about 27,000 to 12,500 years ago. He found that leg length declined rapidly: the forelimbs were about 12 percent shorter at the end of the period than at the beginning. The findings were reported in Nature.</p>
        <p>Many large mammal species became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene, and there has been a long debate as to whether climate change or human hunting was to blame. Dr. Guthrie points out that in the case of the Alaska horses, at least, human activity seems to have not played a role. The earliest signs of settlement date from 500 years after the horses died out.</p>
        <p>By contrast, he notes, the end of the Pleistocene in Alaska was a time when climate change produced a shift in vegetation, from grasslands that grazing animals like horses thrived on to a tundra-and-shrub landscape that offered far less food. The shrinking size of the horses is evidence that they slowly starved into oblivion.</p>
        <p>Small Audience for Eclipse</p>
        <p>What if they gave a solar eclipse and nobody came? That almost happened on Sunday, when the first total eclipse in Antarctica in a century was witnessed by a relative handful of viewers.</p>
        <p>The path of totality missed the pole itself, sweeping instead across Queen Maud Land. Only two permanently staffed research outposts were in the path (Mirny Station, operated by Russia, and India's Maitri Station). Several Australian centers were close, including Casey Station, where Webcam views showed a near-total eclipse partly obscured by clouds. Viewers in Australia, New Zealand and southern Argentina and Chile also got partial views.</p>
        <p>Some eclipse researchers and tourists traveled to Antarctica specifically for the event.</p>
        <p>The next total eclipse, on March 29, 2006, should be easier to see: the path of totality will cross Africa and parts of the Eastern Mediterranean, including Turkey.</p>
