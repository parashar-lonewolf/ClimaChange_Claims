        <p>EVER since Israel and Egypt struck their peace deal 22 years ago, Camp David has symbolized American influence: A superpower brought a divided corner of the world to its own mountaintop and reshaped it.</p>
        <p>It's no wonder that President Clinton chose to use the seclusion of the Catoctin Mountains again, camping out this week with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, in a grand experiment to determine if lightning can strike twice in the same place.</p>
        <p>It may work, it may fizzle. But whatever the outcome, this summit raises anew the overarching question dogging Bill Clinton, his would-be successors and the Congress. Toward what ends should America harness -- not for a few days in July, but day in and day out -- the astounding economic, military, political and cultural power it has accrued?</p>
        <p>Put another way, why is the country having so much trouble establishing its international priorities? The truth is, hegemony's not all it's cracked up to be. It seemed easier in the early 1990's, after the Cold War had been won, but before the American economy had begun its flight into the stratosphere. Twenty million new jobs ago, making the world safe for American exports, for freer and fairer trade, was a rallying call that resounded far beyond the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Since then, as American economic might has soared  the confusion about how to wield it has deepened. One day American power is about expanding democracy, the next it is about a (short-lived) ''Clinton Doctrine'' of humanitarian intervention, even in places where America's national interests are remote. In the last two years the emphasis has turned to new initiatives to combat old threats, from  nuclear proliferation to narco-terrorism, and to bestowing  national security threat status on new issues, such as cyber-crime, global economic meltdown and AIDS.</p>
        <p>What unites this laundry list is that none of the items on it will ever achieve the bumper-sticker simplicity of fighting Communism, the great national purpose for nearly half a century after World War II.</p>
        <p>''If the nostalgia is for a single word that is decisive in every issue that you face, like 'containment' was, well that world is gone,'' said Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser. ''Nobody said it would be easy to construct a foreign policy for a global era.''</p>
        <p>Thus far the two leading Presidential candidates, while eagerly asserting their intention to make America's international agenda more cohesive and effective, have shown little inclination to offer bold answers to the basic question of what American power should be for.</p>
        <p>In truth, both men have calculated, probably correctly, that there is little political advantage to announcing grand new architectures for foreign policy. Such pronouncements invite only mockery now, and trouble later, when the trade-offs of policymaking collide with the neat slogans of campaigning.</p>
        <p>But if the candidates want to sidestep the issue, history suggests this may not be possible. As the Romans discovered long ago, and the British not so long ago, the concentration of power in a single nation invariably creates a balance-of-power reaction. ''It's a law of political physics,'' says Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, noting the ''intense American reaction against British economic and military power,'' which lasted from the Revolutionary War until  World War II.</p>
        <p>Americans, however, tend not to be equally mindful of how their own power is viewed around the world today. It is resented. So much so, says Mr. Beschloss, that ''one of the most important questions Americans should be asking the presidential candidates is, 'How do you plan to respond if Russia and Japan and China and Europe find ways to frustrate American power?' ''</p>
        <p>What sort of foreign policy agenda makes sense at this moment, when American power is unquestioned, but its authority is anything but? The first step may be to recognize that the very fact of that power can make it more, not less, difficult for the nation to act unilaterally.</p>
        <p>It's also true that, while resistance to America's power is growing, it is also inconsistent. Chinese students celebrate Michael Jordan as they denounce American imperialism; Europeans are not about to give up Microsoft Windows (or McDonald's), despite their recent obsession with American electronic surveillance systems; and Russian leaders happily take American-backed aid even as they rail that the International Monetary Fund is stuffing American-style capitalism down their throats.</p>
        <p>Still, how they react is their business. As Richard N. Haass, a Brookings Institution scholar and former official in the Bush Administration, noted recently, any ''effort to assert or expand U.S. hegemony will fail. Such an action would lack domestic support and stimulate international resistance, which in turn would make the costs of hegemony all the greater and its benefits all the smaller.''</p>
        <p>A second step is to recognize that even a superpower must focus its resources. If AIDS and global warming, say, are regarded as equivalent national security crises to reducing nuclear arms or stabilizing Russia, then American diplomacy will find its energies and its influence dissipated.</p>
        <p>The third step lies in recognizing that the inseparability of economic and foreign policy is here to stay -- even if State Department traditionalists and C.I.A. covert operations types continue to look at trade and  globalization as ''low diplomacy'' compared to the life-and-death struggles of the Cold War.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Clinton's lasting imprint on American diplomacy may well be his recognition that preserving the peace and creating a stable global economic system are two sides of the same coin.</p>
        <p>''Had we not bailed out Mexico in 1995, I'm not sure we would have been celebrating the emergence of democracy there last week,'' Mr. Berger argues. He may be overstating the case, but even Mr. Clinton's harshest critics say that Nafta, the administration's first major international initiative, was primarily about assembling a political alliance under the guise of a trade accord.</p>
        <p>ON the other hand, the battle over trade within the Democratic party got so intense that the White House dropped its drive to expand Nafta to much of the rest of Latin America. The administration allowed the need to placate labor unions to hinder the United States from exercising its influence.</p>
        <p>''If the U.S. is going to use its power over time it's got to be committed and consistent,'' said Robert Zoellick, a former top official under President Bush and now a top adviser to his son. ''The strategy the U.S. applied to Mexico needs to be expanded to the western hemisphere at large.''</p>
        <p>Commitment also means following through on the boring stuff even after it has fallen far off the front page. Mr. Clinton couldn't stop talking about the need for a ''new economic architecture'' during the Asian crisis. But as the worst effects faded, so did the talk of lasting solutions.</p>
        <p>It was reminiscent of how Mr. Clinton focused like a laser on opening Japan's markets in his first term, threatening sanctions if American carmakers were not given access. Once the American economy took off, Mr. Clinton barely mentioned market opening. Yet American cars are not exactly tying up traffic in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>A final requirement for a workable  new approach to foreign policy is that it factor in the erosion of national sovereignty -- America's and everybody else's.</p>
        <p>When the World Trade Organization rules that the United States cannot subsidize exporters, or block fish from countries that fail to protect sea turtles, someone screams, ''Who elected these guys?'' The answer is that the United States did, when it pressed harder than any nation to set global rules of behavior, in everything from trade to war crimes.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, as Washington chafes whenever it loses an international dispute, the rest of the world believes the system is rigged entirely to America's advantage.</p>
        <p>If for that reason only, to maintain its influence, America must be seen to be sharing power, not hoarding it.  And that will require Washington to work in a more subtle and circumspect manner than either Democrats or Republicans are going to like.</p>
