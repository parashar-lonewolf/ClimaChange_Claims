        <p>Here are President Bush's budget proposals for major domestic programs in the 1992 fiscal year:  Health</p>
        <p>The President proposes spending of $525 billion, up 8 percent from the level in the 1991 fiscal year. Adjusted for inflation, the increase would be 3 percent. (Other increases listed here are not adjusted to account for inflation.)</p>

        <p>Here are President Bush's budget proposals for major domestic programs in the 1992 fiscal year:  Health</p>
        <p>The President proposes spending of $525 billion, up 8 percent from the level in the 1991 fiscal year. Adjusted for inflation, the increase would be 3 percent. (Other increases listed here are not adjusted to account for inflation.)</p>
        <p>Health and human service programs account for more than a third of the entire Federal budget, mostly because they finance Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The proposal reflects a cut of at least $23 billion in Medicare, which pays for the health care of 33 million elderly and disabled Americans.</p>
        <p>Programs to prevent disease received the most attention in this year's proposals. Increases will be sought for breast cancer screening, immunization for measles and other childhood diseases, infant mortality prevention in the cities where it is highest, screening for lead poisoning, prevention of tuberculosis, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases other than AIDS. For AIDS, almost no extra money will be sought in 1992.  Agriculture</p>
        <p>Although the overall farm spending request is being held almost flat, around $55 billion, the Administration seeks a substantial increase for the food stamp program, the largest component of the agriculture budget.</p>
        <p>The 1992 food stamp proposal is $19.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the 1991 estimate. But with the latest increases in unemployment, even that may be too low. The Administration says it may ask for $200 million to $1.5 billion more; agriculture officials say the decision will be determined by economic circumstances later in the year. The maximum food stamp benefit for a family of four is expected to reach $370 a month, an increase of $18 over the maximum benefit in 1991.</p>
        <p>Another major change in the farm budget is a sharp increase in projected spending for export subsidies to fight those of the European Community, which is selling commodities at discounts to get rid of growing food stocks. The budget seeks $1.2 billion in the 1992 fiscal year for the Export Enhancement Program, about $300 million more than projected spending in 1991 and nearly four times what was spent in 1990.  Transportation</p>
        <p>With a proposed increase of 6 percent over its 1991 budget, to $33.6 billion, the Department of Transportation is seeking its largest increase in spending authority since 1985. Highway spending would rise 4 percent and urban mass transit spending 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The Administration wants to broaden the scope of its highway program while shifting some of the costs to the states. Under the budget plan, the Federal Government would maintain an interconnected system of "national highways," 150,000 miles of roads of the greatest significance, including the 43,000-mile Interstate system. Other national highways would be selected after consulting with the states. The idea is to bring those roads up to the standards of the Interstate system.</p>
        <p>The department's budget also includes $485 million for Amtrak. This is the first time in seven years that the department has requested an increase for the federally subsidized passenger rail service.</p>
        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration would receive $4.5 billion, a 10 percent increase. The new money would permit the hiring of 450 new air traffic controllers and 100 aviation safety inspectors, among other personnel.  Education</p>
        <p>The Administration proposes spending $29.6 billion for the Education Department, an increase of $2.5 billion, or about 9 percent, over the fiscal year 1991. Most of the new spending would be part of a coming legislative proposal that could be modified by the newly named Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, who awaits Senate confirmation.</p>
        <p>One closely watched proposal would set aside $200 million for grants to local school districts and states that provide parents with a choice of schools for their children, including private and parochial schools.</p>
        <p>The department also proposed changing the structure of the Federal education scholarships known as Pell Grants to direct them more toward students from poorer families. The maximum grant would increase to $4,200 for students whose families earn less than $20,000 a year; families making more would qualify for lower sums. Cities and States</p>
        <p>Total proposed spending by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is down slightly from the 1991 level, to $25.6 billion from $27 billion. Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp said the decrease did not signal less emphasis on public housing, but rather a cut in planned spending for programs like mortgage insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp said the budget for new housing programs would actually increase, from $15.3 billion to $17.5 billion. Much of the new money would be used to help public housing tenants buy their homes, he said, adding that H.U.D. was also asking for $918 million extra in its 1991 budget for that purpose.</p>
        <p>The Administration plans to reduce the Community Development Block Grant program by $300 million, from $3.2 billion, and to channel the grants through the states rather than giving them directly to the cities. Officials of cities have expressed dismay at that idea.  Energy</p>
        <p>The Administration requested $18.6 billion for the Department of Energy, $900 million more than this year's level.</p>
        <p>Programs to improve technical research and education would receive considerably more money. Funds for fundamental scientific research would increase more than 15 percent, to $2.67 billion from $2.31 billion. Much of the increase would go to the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator to be built in Texas. Spending on it would increase from $242.9 million to $533.7 million.</p>
        <p>Almost half the Energy Department's budget, $8.1 billion, would go toward the system of production factories, laboratories and testing sites for nuclear weapons. For the first time in decades, the budget for producing nuclear warheads would shrink, to $2.71 billion from $2.88 billion. Similar cuts are proposed in the manufacture of nuclear materials for bombs, dropping the budget in that program to $1.87 billion from $1.95 billion.  Space</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration continued its support for the space program by seeking $14.7 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, an increase of $1.2 billion that would include starting a new family of rockets to lift heavy payloads.</p>
        <p>NASA and the Air Force would be authorized to spend $175 million each to develop a new launching system by the end of the decade. The rocket system, which would take over some of the work of the space shuttle and the current generation of disposable rockets, would eventually cost about $10 billion.</p>
        <p>The Administration also proposes almost $2 billion to continue development of a space station. Congress has ordered that the station be redesigned and scaled down before its first elements are put into orbit in 1995. The budget also includes almost $1 billion, a 24 percent increase, for NASA's "Mission to Planet Earth," part of an effort by several agencies to study global environmental change.  Environment</p>
        <p>Environmental programs fared relatively well in the President's proposal, with the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget rising from $2.1 billion in the fiscal year 1991 to $2.33 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>The plan would provide extra funds for the E.P.A. to carry out the far-reaching amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress last year. The Administration also wants to spend more money to protect ecological systems like the Great Lakes and coastal areas, and to expand its scientific research, particularly into the causes and effects of global warming.</p>
        <p>The Interior Department's budget would provide more money for protection and rehabilitation of national wildlife refuges and national parks, with emphasis on preserving Civil War battlegrounds. In all, the department's proposed outlays in 1992 are $8.7 billion, up from an estimated $8.5 billion in 1991. Justice</p>
        <p>The Justice Department is seeking a budget of $10.6 billion, a 14 percent increase over 1991. A significant part would go to enforcement of laws on drug trafficking and white-collar crime, notably prosecution of fraud in connection with the savings and loan industry.</p>
        <p>Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr said part of the department's drug strategy was to place more resources in smaller cities and rural areas, which he said had not been given enough attention.</p>
        <p>The task force of Federal agencies trying to break sophisticated international trafficking organizations would receive an increase of 20 percent, from this year's level of $335 million.</p>
        <p>The department is seeking $1.74 billion to operate the nation's prisons. The Federal prison population, which was 25,000 in 1981, is now about 60,000 and is expected to rise to 100,000 by 1995.  Arts and Humanities</p>
        <p>The Administration proposes to spend $833 million for activities that contribute to "preserving America's heritage." This is an increase of $65 million, or 8.5 percent, over 1991.</p>
        <p>Proposed increases include 15.5 percent for the National Gallery of Art and 14.8 percent for the Smithsonian Institution. The only Federal agency whose proposed budget remains unchanged is the National Endowment for the Arts, at $174 million. The President proposes that the National Endowment for the Humanities receive $178 million, an increase of nearly 5 percent, with a special emphasis on the agency's educational programs.</p>
        <p>In the past the arts endowment has received more money than the humanities endowment, but the gap has narrowed in recent years. This is the first time the Administration has offered a larger budget for humanities.</p>
        <p>The budget request of $357 million for the Smithsonian includes $16.3 million for the new National Museum of the American Indian.  Labor</p>
        <p>Amid signs of a deepening recession, the Labor Department has requested a $178 million increase for the administration of the unemployment insurance program. The department is also asking Congress for $100 million more in the current fiscal year to run the unemployment benefits program nationwide. Under current budget rules, that $100 million increase would have to be offset by cuts in other domestic programs. The benefits paid to the unemployed are financed by state taxes, but the program's administrative costs are the responsibility of the Federal Government.  Research</p>
        <p>The Administration is proposing to spend $71.3 billion for research and development, an 8 percent increase, with the greatest amount, more than $42 billion, going to military research. The $71 billion is divided among the budgets of a number of departments, including Defense, Energy and Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>The National Science Foundation, which devotes 70 percent of its budget to nonmedical basic research at colleges and universities, would get a 13 percent increase, to $1.9 billion. The basic research budget of the National Institutes of Health would be increased 6 percent, to $4.6 billion.</p>
