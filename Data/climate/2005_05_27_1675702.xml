        <p>In a twist to a proposal to combat climate change, Senators John McCain and Joseph I. Lieberman introduced a proposal to create an emissions-trading system for industries that emit heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Like previous measures offered by Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, the bill intends to cut carbon emissions to their 2000 level by 2010. It also includes up to $1 billion in subsidies for the development of cleaner energy technologies. The subsidies for nuclear power caused Greenpeace U.S.A. and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group to abandon their support for the measure.</p>
