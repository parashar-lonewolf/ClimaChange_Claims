        <p>You report that insurance companies are withdrawing coverage from areas at risk from hurricanes and other weather disasters because of high payouts (Business Day, May 4). Another reason is that insurers are worried about global warming.</p>
        <p>As emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases heat up the atmosphere, Earth's climate will change significantly, giving rise to more frequent and severe windstorms and other disasters, playing havoc with coverage based on historic weather patterns. The industry is taking this threat seriously.</p>
        <p>For example, an unpublished 1992 Lloyd's of London briefing notes that from 1966 to 1987 there were no natural disasters for which insured losses topped $1 billion. But from 1987 to 1992 there were 15 disasters for which insured losses exceeded $1 billion -- 10 of which were catastrophic windstorms. Both Swiss Re and Munich Re, two of the world's largest reinsurance companies, have circulated internal reports linking global warming to rising losses.</p>
        <p>"A plausible explanation is that this is an initial consequence of climatic change," notes the Swiss Re report, written by its general manager. Swiss Re set up a greenhouse effect team to assess the impact.</p>
        <p>Homeowners in Florida and Hawaii who can no longer get coverage should blame national energy policies that promote continued use of fossil fuels that emit global-warming gases. The insurance industry can use its influence to steer other industries and governments toward a clean-energy future.
