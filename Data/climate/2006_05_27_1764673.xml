        <p>U.S. Debating Direct Talks With Iran on Nuclear Issue  The Bush administration is beginning to debate whether to set aside a longstanding policy taboo and open direct talks with Iran to help avert a crisis over its suspected nuclear weapons program, European officials and Americans close to the administration said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The Iraqi foreign minister, after meeting with his Iranian counterpart in Baghdad, endorsed Iran's right to pursue technology to create nuclear power for peaceful purposes, but shied away from the subject of uranium enrichment, which the United States says could allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon.</p>
        <p>A6</p>
        <p>Beslan Terrorist Sentenced  A Russian court sentenced a terrorist who participated in the siege of a public school in 2004 to life imprisonment, sparing him execution only because of a national moratorium on capital punishment.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>A Predator in Need of Protection  Polar bears are on the verge of replacing baby seals as the poster face of Arctic vulnerability as some scientists and environmental groups contend that global warming, and to a lesser extent hunting, is threatening the animals' habitat and survival.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Residents Flee Somali Capital  The increase in fighting between warlords and Islamist leaders in Mogadishu, Somalia, has sparked an exodus from the capital as residents describe the horrors of the violence that has killed more than 300 people since February.</p>
        <p>A3</p>
        <p>Trial Set for Chinese Journalist  Chinese authorities have fixed a trial date for Zhao Yan, left, a researcher for The New York Times, who is accused of fraud and disclosing state secrets, his lawyer said. The decision to try him followed a move by prosecutors to revive the case against him after earlier dropping the indictment.  A7</p>
        <p>Australians Patrol East Timor  In the first show of force in the recent violence in East Timor, Australian troops patrolled parts of the country's capital in armored personnel carriers but were not yet in control of the warring factions of East Timor's military, Australian officials said.</p>

Gonzales, senior officials and career prosecutors at the Justice Department told associates that they were prepared to quit if the White House directed them to relinquish evidence seized in a disputed search of a House member's office, government officials said.  A1</p>
        <p>Hurricane Anxiety Sets In  Never has a coming hurricane season generated as much anxiety in New Orleans. On top of the ever-present reminders of last year's catastrophe, the looming threat is proving to be too much for some.  A1</p>
        <p>Time Must Hand Over Drafts  The federal judge overseeing the case against I. Lewis Libby Jr. ruled that Time magazine must turn over drafts of articles so that Mr. Libby, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, can use them to defend himself.  A10</p>
        <p>False Report of Gunfire on Hill  An erroneous report of gunfire in a parking garage led the police to lock down an office building on Capitol Hill as machine-gun-toting officers went room to room, looking for intruders and escorting lawmakers, lobbyists and visitors out with their hands on their heads.  A8</p>
        <p>SCIENCE/HEALTH</p>
        <p>Shingles Vaccine Approved  Federal drug regulators have approved the first vaccine intended to reduce the risks of shingles in people 60 and older. The vaccine, called Zostavax, is a souped-up version of the chickenpox vaccine. A8</p>
