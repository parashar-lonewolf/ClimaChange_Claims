        <p>On issues from missile defense to creating a more conservative judiciary, President Bush's agenda suddenly faces rougher sledding.</p>
        <p>The shift of the Senate to Democratic control means that strong critics of some of Mr. Bush's core policy proposals will now be in charge of the committees, the legislative calendar and much of the policy debate.</p>
        <p>The change may be felt most immediately in judicial nominations, with Democrats predicting that the White House will be forced to propose more moderate nominees if it  hopes to avert a deadlock.</p>
        <p>''On judges, we're not going to have a solid right-wing slate,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Judiciary Committee. ''They're going to have to compromise.''</p>
        <p>But the new Democratic majority, no matter how slim, will be felt in countless other ways. It elevates some of the strongest skeptics of the administration's drive for a missile defense system, putting Senator Carl Levin of Michigan in line to be chairman of the Armed Services Committee and Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.  in line to be chairman of Foreign Relations.</p>
        <p>At the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the conservative Alaskan Republican and Bush ally on issues like drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is expected to be replaced as chairman by Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and calls for more emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable resources like wind and solar energy.</p>
        <p>Democratic control further reduces the prospects of a Social Security overhaul to create private investment accounts, another item on the Bush agenda. It also means that Democratic priorities, like raising the minimum wage and creating a comprehensive prescription drug benefit in Medicare, have a better chance of at least being debated, if not passed. Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, also said today that he would bring another longstanding Democratic priority, ''patients bill of rights'' legislation, to the floor of the Senate very soon.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Schumer put it, ''We may lose some of the things we put on the table, but we set the table.''</p>
        <p>The shake-up in the Senate also means more Democratic influence in the all-important conference committees, where the shape of legislation is finally hammered out.</p>
        <p>With such a narrow majority, there are, of course, limits to Democratic power. ''It gives the Democrats more power to stop things they think are bad from happening,'' one health lobbyist said. ''But it doesn't really change the dynamic of what's needed to get things through. As a practical matter, you still need bipartisan support.''</p>
        <p>But just as clearly, there are new limits on Mr. Bush. For example, Democrats now control the oversight agenda -- conducting hearings and investigations. ''Oversight is huge,'' said one environmental lobbyist, who said he had already talked to a Democratic senator about hearings on environmental policies.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Daschle concluded today, ''I think it's important that we all recognize the value of compromise, the urgency of compromise and the real practicality of compromise. We can't dictate to them, nor can they dictate to us.''</p>
        <p>Following are some Bush agenda items that now have altered prospects:</p>
        <p>Taxes and Spending</p>
        <p>The change in control should not endanger Mr. Bush's first big legislative priority, his tax cut. Mr. Jeffords made clear that his switch would not take effect until Congress had sent the $1.35 trillion tax cut to the White House for the president's signature.</p>
        <p>But it reduces the chances that Republicans will be able to enact a second tax cut this year. Republican leaders have been planning to attach a reduction in the capital gains tax to legislation raising the minimum wage. The Republicans have also been hoping to bring up other tax-cutting provisions, like increased retirement-savings incentives and deductions for college tuition. And they are under pressure from business lobbyists to consider several corporate tax breaks.</p>
        <p>Although some Democrats support more tax cuts, Mr. Daschle has consistently argued that the $1.35 trillion package is fiscally irresponsible, and he is unlikely to support further cuts, especially if their primary beneficiaries are upper-income people or corporations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush may also have more trouble holding down spending increases. The president pushed hard for Congress to limit itself to a spending increase next year of just over 4 percent, a level that nearly all Democrats and many Republicans said was unrealistic.</p>
        <p>Energy</p>
        <p>A Democratic majority is a serious setback to Mr. Bush's goal of passing an energy package that would boost domestic output of nuclear energy and fossil fuels. Democrats have lined up against the plan, arguing that it emphasizes supply at the expense of the environment and calling for more emphasis on energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>The White House's proposal to review many federal regulations to determine their effect on energy production or transmission is another point of contention.</p>
        <p>Still another clash could come over what to do about electricity prices in California. Democrats have generally been more sympathetic to California's pleas for federal price caps on electricity this summer, when prices threaten to soar even higher. But the White House and the House and Senate leadership have stood four-square against price controls.</p>
        <p>Judiciary</p>
        <p>The most contentious fights with the new Democratic majority may come on judicial nominations.</p>
        <p>Democrats clearly hope that Mr. Bush will recognize the changed political landscape. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and next in line to be Judiciary chairman, said, ''No president should engage in ideological court-packing, either from the right or the left.''</p>
        <p>The current chairman, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, said, ''It would be quite wrong to block someone for ideology, unless, of course, that person was wholly out of the mainstream of the law. If they start playing that game, it will be a real mess.''</p>
        <p>One change the Democrats will insist on, Mr. Schumer said, is that all nominees will have to await an evaluation by the American Bar Association, whose role was recently reduced by the White House.</p>
        <p>Military</p>
        <p>The Senate changeover is likely to have a significant impact on President Bush's plans to build a ballistic missile shield. Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden and Mr. Levin are all strong supporters of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty, which administration officials contend must be modified or scrapped so the United States can proceed with the kind of system that Mr. Bush advocates.</p>
        <p>All three men have urged the administration to deploy a missile shield only once it has been proved to work -- in contrast to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who has called for quick deployment,  even if a system is only partly effective.</p>
        <p>Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said of the power shift, ''It will prompt serious and fundamental questions about the technological feasibility, the cost of the system, the reliability and whether or not it contributes to increased stability throughout the world.''</p>
