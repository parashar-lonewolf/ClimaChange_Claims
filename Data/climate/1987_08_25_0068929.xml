        <p>LEAD: A NEW discovery of what appear to be crude stone tools raises the possibility that human ancestors migrated out of Africa at least one million years earlier than previously thought. If true, this would sharply revise scientific understanding about the timing and reasons for one of the pivotal events in human evolution.</p>
        <p>A NEW discovery of what appear to be crude stone tools raises the possibility that human ancestors migrated out of Africa at least one million years earlier than previously thought. If true, this would sharply revise scientific understanding about the timing and reasons for one of the pivotal events in human evolution.</p>
        <p>The new thinking is inspired by reports from British archeologists working in northern Pakistan that they have found two-million-year-old chopping tools believed to have been made by early humans.</p>
        <p>If such a significantly earlier time of migration is established, it would presumably mean that a more primitive species in the human lineage, Homo habilis, was the first to leave Africa and did so soon after learning to make stone tools. The prevailing view now is that the later Homo erectus, which had a considerably larger brain capacity, initiated the human diaspora about a million years ago.</p>
        <p>Paleoanthropologists said they could conceive of the migrations' having taken place earlier than that, but in interviews they were generally cautious and skeptical in commenting on the sketchy report about the discovery of human traces in Pakistan two million years ago. The find was reported in a recent issue of the British magazine New Scientist.</p>
        <p>According to the article, members of the British Archeological Mission in Pakistan described finding eight stone pieces, all of quartzite, that appeared to have been fashioned into chopping tools. A member of the expedition, Robin Dennell, who is a geologist from the University of Sheffield in England, was quoted as saying the multifaceted flaking made a ''very convincing'' case for a human hand in shaping the pebble tool.</p>
        <p>Helen Rendell and Ernie Hailwood, geologists from the University of Sussex and the University of Southampton, respectively, estimated the age of the specimens by their position in sedimentary rocks and the evidence of changes in the rocks' magnetism over time. The discovery was made in the Soan Valley, southeast of Rawalpindi.</p>
        <p>''We estimate that the youngest possible age for the artifact-bearing horizon is two million years,'' the British scientists concluded.</p>
        <p>But Sally McBrearty, an anthropologist at William and Mary College who has done research in Pakistan, complains that the discoverers ''have not supplied enough evidence that the specimens are that old and that they are of human manufacture.''</p>
        <p>Like many experts, Dr. McBrearty was skeptical of the two-million-year date because the discovery was made in a river plain, which is ''not a good solid stratigraphic context.'' The sediment layers there have been so mixed up by flowing water over time that geologists have a hard time determining whether artifacts are embedded in their original sediments. Anthropologists also noted that pebbles fracture easily as they roll through flowing water, resulting in shapes that can be mistaken for artifacts.</p>
        <p>Another skeptic, Milford Wolpoff, a professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan, said: ''I hate to use absence of evidence as an argument. But where's the evidence for what these people were doing for that intervening million years?''</p>
        <p>Indeed, scientists have found no fossils, artifacts or other unequivocal traces of human migration into Asia or Europe before one million years ago. ''We can't prove anything beyond a million,'' said David Pilbeam, a paleoanthropologist at Harvard University, ''but the migrations could easily have been earlier.''</p>
        <p>A combination of evidence has led scholars in the last three years to settle on the million-year date as the latest possible time that the migrations could have begun.</p>
        <p>According to current knowledge of fossils, the earliest humanlike ancestors, known as hominids, appeared in eastern and southern Africa at least 3.5 million years ago. ''I think we know about as well as we know anything in paleontology that our branch of the evolutionary tree grew in Africa,'' Stephen Jay Gould, a Harvard paleontologist and historian of science, has written. Few Traces in Asia and Europe</p>
        <p>The earliest appearance of the genus Homo, the direct human ancestral line, occurred about 2.5 million years ago with Homo habilis. This species disappeared about 1.6 million years ago, when Homo erectus emerged. Archaic forms of Homo sapiens appeared and displaced Homo erectus about 300,000 years ago. Most scientists believe Homo sapiens, like its predecessors, arose in Africa and migrated elsewhere, though some argue that variants of Homo sapiens arose in more than one place.</p>
        <p>Early human traces in Asia and Europe are few and far between. The oldest known skeletal remains of Homo erectus outside Africa are those specimens usually referred to as Peking Man and Java Man. Peking Man fossils found at the Lantian site in China are at least 600,000 years old, although some artifacts from China suggest a human presence several hundred thousand years before.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the oldest known human remains are a 500,000-year-old jaw found near Heidelberg. The earliest undisputed site of European hominid occupation is at Soleilhac, in the Massif Central of France, where 800,000-year-old tools and animal remains have been excavated. Similar discoveries have been made in southern Italy.</p>
        <p>The Americas were the last to be inhabited. Until recently it was believed that the ancestors of the Indians first arrived from Asia no later than 15,000 years ago. But new discoveries in South America indicate that human occupation occurred as early as 32,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The corridor of migration to both Europe and Asia presumably ran through the Middle East, but only recently have archeologists begun to dig up any strong evidence. Scientists from Hebrew University in Jerusalem have found many kinds of stone tools at a site called Ubeidiya on the southeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. F. Clark Howell, a professor of anthropology at the University of California at Berkeley, said, ''There's no question these specimens are more than a million years old, perhaps 1.3 million years old.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Howell plans to conduct a detailed investigation next June of a cave near Istanbul that could also be one of the oldest known sites of early humans outside Africa. Preliminary excavation of Yarimburgaz Cave turned up pebble tools and what appeared to be a hearth in sediments that Turkish geologists estimated could be one million years old. More thorough analysis will be required to set a firm date, Dr. Howell said.</p>
        <p>Scholars have yet to develop any elaborate theories to explain why early humans began to scatter from their African homelands. ''Until it's clear when they migrated, there are infinite possible reasons for the migrations,'' Dr. Pilbeam observed.</p>
        <p>If the migrations began one million years ago, the human ancestors might have been simply following the animals they hunted for subsistence. Scientists have noted a widespread exodus of animals from Africa about that time, possibly the result of climatic change. Growing Curiosity Cited</p>
        <p>If the migrations began about 1.5 million years ago, which is Dr. Howell's hunch, the reasons could be partly economic and environmental but could also include the growing intellectual curiosity and capability of the recently evolved Homo erectus.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wolpoff suggested that the early migrants had moved out of the African highlands and somehow adapted to living along the coasts, both a response to environmental conditions and a manifestation of increasingly humanlike versatility. The coasts, he said, were ''their highway to the rest of the world.'' But because of fluctuating sea levels over the last two million years, with the coming and going of ice ages, Dr. Wolpoff said most of the evidence for the migrations out of Africa might have been flooded out.</p>
        <p>If the migrations occurred more than two million years ago, as the Pakistan discovery suggests, anthropologists said more thought would have to be given to the climate then, the hunting behavior of Homo habilis and also the significance of those early experiments in tool making.</p>
