        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came to the Capitol on Monday to pitch his plan for reducing traffic congestion in Manhattan to state lawmakers and Gov. Eliot Spitzer, but there is no apparent sense of urgency in Albany to move on the mayor's complex environmental proposals.</p>
        <p>The mayor is proposing dozens of environmental projects and regulations to prepare New York City for a projected surge of one million additional residents by 2030.</p>
        <p>Under the most contentious proposal, known as congestion pricing, the city would charge $8 for cars and $21 for commercial trucks that enter Manhattan below 86th Street from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays, or $4 for drivers within Manhattan, with several exceptions.</p>
        <p>The plan, similar to a program in London, calls for the revenue to be used to finance environmental and mass transportation projects.</p>
        <p>''This is a plan about trying to solve problems of success,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>''Just listen to the radio in the morning,'' he added. ''There's an hour wait to get on the G. W. Bridge, there's a 45 minute wait to get to the Lincoln Tunnel, 55 minutes for the Holland Tunnel. Think about, No. 1, the pollution that gets put in the air, but think of the economic value of somebody that commutes.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bloomberg's visit was ostensibly about the environment, there was also considerable talk around the Statehouse on Monday about whether he might run for governor or president since term limits require him to leave office at the end of 2009.</p>
        <p>Enough interest, indeed, that Mr. Bloomberg tried to dismiss such questions before reporters could even ask them.</p>
        <p>Given the more than 900 ''days left in this job -- and I'm not running for governor and I'm not running for president -- the time to do this is now,'' he said during a news conference.</p>
        <p>The mayor made the rounds with a number of environmental and health groups, including Environmental Defense and the American Cancer Society. After meeting with the governor in the late afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''I'm optimistic that we'll find a way to get his support, but his staff wants to look at it first, obviously.''</p>
        <p>State officials were noncommittal.</p>
        <p>The governor's staff and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver reiterated that three weeks after the plan was unveiled, they were reviewing it and had yet to take a position on it. More enthusiastic was the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, who said the mayor, a fellow Republican, made an ''outstanding presentation'' to Senate Republicans.</p>
        <p>''We're going to look forward to working with the mayor on the details of the plan,'' he said. ''The general reception was very upbeat, very positive, because what benefits New York City benefits all of New York State.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno also pointed out that the mayor's proposal was not to be confused with the income-based commuter tax that expired in 1999, which Mr. Bruno had opposed.</p>
        <p>But the landscape of opposition for the plan is still considerable.</p>
        <p>''My colleagues and I feel like our folks are taxed enough and tolled enough and fee-ed enough under the present scenario,'' said Senator John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican. ''So why would we want to do anything more that's going to take more money out of their pocket?''</p>
        <p>Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat, called the plan ''a very hard sell, but I think the mayor is making a very good case and that he's put together the coalition he needs if he's going to get this done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg's visit coincided with the start of a three-day global climate conference in the city, in which he will be host with former President Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>At the conference, which is drawing international business and municipal leaders, a number of cities, including Los Angeles and Toronto, are expected to announce plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is also expected to announce an arrangement through his foundation's Climate Initiative to help cities reduce emissions. The conference focuses on cities because they are responsible for three-quarters of the world's energy consumption, organizers say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg, who welcomed delegates to Gracie Mansion on Monday night, was scheduled to address the conference on Tuesday in a speech that was to be translated simultaneously into several languages, offering him a global platform for his plan to guide the city's growth. It will also give him an opportunity to hammer a pet theme of late: that urban mayors are in the best position to enact problem-solving policies, whether fighting illegal gun trafficking or global warming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg's push for his plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030, came as Environmental Defense and the Partnership for New York City, a business group, released a television advertisement over the weekend showing belching smokestacks, an asthmatic child visiting the doctor and lines of traffic, while urging New Yorkers to ''act now'' and ''make a difference'' by supporting Mr. Bloomberg's plan.</p>
