        <p>LEAD: Saving the world from global warming may require sharp reductions in burning fuel, but there was no consensus at a two-day meeting here of 40 nuclear industry executives, government officials, energy experts and environmentalists on whether new nuclear reactors are needed.</p>
        <p>Saving the world from global warming may require sharp reductions in burning fuel, but there was no consensus at a two-day meeting here of 40 nuclear industry executives, government officials, energy experts and environmentalists on whether new nuclear reactors are needed.</p>
        <p>The highly unusual gathering was an attempt to determine the circumstances that would make a ''second age'' of reactors feasible, or whether the need for new nuclear plants would be precluded by conservation measures and the development of other energy sources.</p>
        <p>A picture emerged, however, of a future that is likely to have both conservation and more nuclear power, with the combination still not sufficient to prevent global warming. Spying an Opportunity</p>
        <p>The American nuclear industry has seized on scientists' belief that emissions from burning oil and coal are leading to catastrophic global warming, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Only a handful of reactors are still under construction, and more than 100 have been abandoned. But with refined designs and new procedures, the industry says, the time is ripe to build more.</p>
        <p>''Nuclear energy people perceive the greenhouse effect as a fresh wind blowing at their back,'' said Stewart Udall, who was the Interior Secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations and the organizer of the conference, which was sponsored by Robert Redford, the actor and environmentalist, who spoke briefly.</p>
        <p>But others who attended, like Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission, and Amory Lovins, a utility consultant and nationally recognized energy efficiency expert, said reactors were unlikely to be cost competitive.</p>
        <p>''When we ask if nuclear power is in the national interest,'' said Charles Komanoff, an energy consultant in New York, ''we need to say, 'Compared to what?' '' Better Than Blackouts</p>
        <p>''Compared to blackouts, I'd be willing to build reactors,'' Mr. Komanoff added. But conservation, he said, is far cheaper and more potent.</p>
        <p>Utility executives took a middle position. Although unenthusiastic about new reactors, they also seemed unwilling to foreclose such a choice at a time when environmental concerns might prevent construction of coal-powered plants.</p>
        <p>''I see my principal option today as gas and oil, but I spent the 70's running from two embargoes,'' said John W. Ellis, chairman and chief executive of Puget Sound Power and Light, arguing that reactors should not be eliminated as an option.</p>
        <p>Howard P. Allen, chairman and chief executive of the Southern California Edison Company, noted that his company already has geothermal, solar and co-generation plants and a conservation program. ''I don't see how we're going to do anything to help global warming without doing something with nuclear in the next 20 years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A new nuclear alternative emerged, in outline form, from representatives of Westinghouse Electric, General Electric and Combustion Engineering, which among them built almost all the reactors now in use in this country, and General Atomics, which is trying to sell a plant that has a new design. All four are talking about reactors that would be much smaller, simpler, cheaper, faster to build and more tolerant of operator error than the current generation. Full Design Comes First</p>
        <p>In addition, they would be designed in full before they were sold, in contrast to the 112 plants now licensed. These were ordered by the utilities and given construction permits when they were only about 25 percent designed. That, combined with changing regulations, made price estimates little better than guesses.</p>
        <p>Under the current system, which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, reactor manufacturers and Congress are working to change, reactor orders have dried up. ''Today, if anyone suggested a new reactor to a utility board, they would send for the guy with the net,'' said Shelby T. Brewer, president of the nuclear division of Combustion Engineering Inc. and a former Assistant Energy Secretary.</p>
        <p>But the reactor makers have high hopes for their new plants. ''If our environmental friends and our previously anti-nuclear friends look at it with us, I think they're going to like it,'' said Dr. Bertram Wolfe, vice president and general manager of General Electric Nuclear Energy.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Slember, Dr. Wolfe's counterpart at Westinghouse, suggested a program to build two or three new reactors, ''starting over, with a clean sheet of paper,'' to demonstrate what was possible. The investment would be modest compared with the knowledge to be gained, he said. ''It's like a couple of Stealth bombers.'' Blue Jeans and Plaid Shirts</p>
        <p>In an intense debate that was conducted in formal sessions and over dining tables, all parties sought allies. The participants, wearing blue jeans and plaid shirts, pulled out graphs and slides to make their points.</p>
        <p>''The major trend throughout the world is for greater and greater concern over the environment,'' said Russel W. Peterson, president emeritus of the National Audubon Society and former Governor of Delaware. ''With that kind of climate, to envision that we're going to change public opinion by changing the design and regulation of reactors is naive.''</p>
        <p>Building reactors, he said, would distract the world from the essential task, conservation.</p>
        <p>Alvin M. Weinberg, a member of the Manhattan Project team that built the first reactor ever, said, ''I'm deeply disappointed in this outcome of the conference.'' Nuclear power will not return, he said, unless a ''skeptical elite'' of environmentalists and regulators persuaded the public. ''It's up to the skeptical elite to tell us in the nuclear community what it is we have to do,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Kenneth M. Carr, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a retired admiral, noted, ''You haven't got a lot of open minds left.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It's obvious that the environmental community is never going to come around until they are convinced there is no alternative.'' Emissions Hard to Pinpoint</p>
        <p>It was also clear, however, that many participants did not think enough was known now to say if the greenhouse effect justifies a return to nuclear power. One issue, raised by Dr. Weinberg, is that scientists cannot pinpoint the level of carbon dioxide emissions that alters the climate.</p>
        <p>Another issue is what the competing technologies will be in the second or third decade of the next century. Some said nuclear power's main competition might be solar power.</p>
        <p>In the next few weeks, several reactor manufacturers will seek to have designs approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the number of operating reactors will decline steadily, with retirements outpacing completions. Another participant, Representative Phil Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, predicted little action from Washington. ''You're not going to see the Congress or the President say, 'Just say yes to nuclear power,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>But he too was looking for a blueprint from the conference. ''If you could come to an intellectual consensus, we'd implement it like that,'' he said, with a snap of his fingers.</p>
