        <p>LEAD: New Series ''AMERICAN CHRONICLES.'' This documentary series from David Lynch/Mark Frost, the makers of ''Twin Peaks,'' will take offbeat looks at such subjects as the New Orleans Mardi Gras and Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings. Saturdays at 9:30, Fox.</p>
        <p>New Series ''AMERICAN CHRONICLES.'' This documentary series from David Lynch/Mark Frost, the makers of ''Twin Peaks,'' will take offbeat looks at such subjects as the New Orleans Mardi Gras and Wayne Gretzky of the Los Angeles Kings. Saturdays at 9:30, Fox.</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN DREAMER.'' In this sitcom built on quirkiness, Robert Urich plays a network newscaster who gives up the world beat to write a column about raising his two children. With Carol Kane as his dizzy research assistant. The first series from the executive producer Gary David Goldberg since ''Family Ties.'' Saturdays at 10:30, NBC. ''BABES.'' A sitcom about three zaftig sisters sharing a small New York apartment. Hastily overhauled to keep it from relying too weightily on fat jokes. Susan Peretz, Wendy Jo Sperber and Lesley Boon are the babes. Thursdays at 8:30, Fox.</p>
        <p>''COP ROCK.'' Steven Bochco, who created ''Hill Street Blues'' and ''L.A. Law,'' adopts a novel TV form: the weekly drama-musical. ''Cop Rock'' will offer gritty police action (very like ''Hill Street Blues'' in tone) laced with songs. Wednesdays at 10, ABC.</p>

        <p>''EVENING SHADE.'' Burt Reynolds stars in a comedy, written by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason (''Designing Women''), about a pro football player who returns home to Evening Shade, Ark., to coach the high school team.

        <p>''FERRIS BUELLER.'' Charlie Schlatter (''18 Again'') stars in the title role, based on the 1986 film about a teenager trying to scheme his way through high school. One of many shows this season about kids defying authority. Mondays at 8:30, NBC.</p>
        <p>''THE FLASH.'' An action-adventure drama series based on the fleet-footed comic-book character. From Warners, the studio that made ''Batman,'' the program will use expensive special effects in trying to appeal to young viewers. But it's slotted opposite ''The Cosby Show'' and ''The Simpsons.'' Thursdays at 8, CBS.</p>
        <p>''FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR.'' The season's most anticipated new comedy, thanks to the year's best-received pilot. A young rap singer from Philadelphia (Will Smith of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince) goes to live with his rich relatives in the elegant Los Angeles neighborhood. Produced by Quincy Jones. Mondays at 8, NBC. ''GABRIEL'S FIRE.'' James Earl Jones plays a prisoner under life sentence for murder who is freed by an activist socialite lawyer.

''PARKER LEWIS CAN'T LOSE.'' A sitcom starring Corey Nemic (''I Know My First Name Is Steven'') as Parker Lewis, an ingenious charmer very akin - probably not accidentally - to the Ferris Bueller character of the NBC series. Sundays at 7:30, Fox. ''TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL'' - A drama starring Sharon Gless as a courtroom lawyer who becomes a public defender after her husband leaves her. Produced by Barney Rosenzweig, who worked with Ms. Gless on ''Cagney &amp; Lacey.'' Mondays at 10, CBS.</p>

        <p>''WIOU.'' A dramatic series set in the newsroom of a big-city TV station; with John Shea as the hard-working but cynical news director, Harris Yulin as the high-paid, low-intellect anchorman, Dick Van Patten as the clownish weatherman and Helen Shaver as the dedicated street reporter. Produced by Grant Tinker. Wednesdays at 10, CBS.</p>
        <p>''WORKING IT OUT.'' A sitcom starring Jane Curtin and Stephen Collins as romantically involved divorced adults. Five-time Emmy winner Bill Persky (''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ''Kate &amp; Allie'') is executive producer, writer and director. Saturdays at 8:30, NBC.</p>

        <p>''GARWOOD.'' Martin Sheen and Ralph Macchio star in the true story of Robert Garwood, the Vietnam P.O.W. who was court-martialed for having ''conversations'' with the enemy.
