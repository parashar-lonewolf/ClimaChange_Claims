      <abstract>
        <p>James Traub article contends Bush administration's torpid reaction to what seemed to be, in retospect, apparent warnings of terrorism within US borders prior to 9/11 should probably be forgiven; says Al Gore might have acted similarly if he were president; says history may judge other failures of foresight of Bush administration more harshly, most notably failure to predict instability in Iraq, even though there were nearly universal warnings about postwar dangers; photo (M)</p>

        <p>There used to be a column in Spy magazine, Ten Years Ago in Spy, which featured astonishing and, of course, completely fictitious acts of journalistic foresight. ''NASA's enthusiasm notwithstanding, the space shuttle is a potentially deadly hodgepodge of untested technologies,'' ran one breathless article.

        <p>I couldn't help thinking of this delicious parody of wisdom-after-the-fact as I listened to the outraged denunciations provoked by the 9/11 investigations. The advocacy group MoveOn.org recently took out a full-page ad featuring, in giant letters, the phrase, ''Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S.,'' followed by the observation: ''President Bush received this warning five weeks before Sept. 11, 2001. He did nothing.'' How could the folks in charge of our well-being have failed to foresee what was so obvious?</p>
        <p>You could make the argument -- and many Democrats do -- that the Bush administration's torpid reaction to warnings of domestic terrorism was an instance of willful blindness, driven by the a priori view that anything the Clinton administration really cared about deserved to be ignored. The problem with this claim is that the failure to foresee was really a collective one; Al Gore, for example, scarcely raised the subject during the 2000 campaign. In retrospect, we were all dancing merrily on the deck of the Titanic while an iceberg was looming up in the darkness.</p>
        <p>Why were we so blithe in the face of what we now see as warning signs? Perhaps because the national ocean liner felt so very impregnable. Richard Clarke, who played Caesar's wife in this terrible drama, made a ghoulish comment to the 9/11 commission. It was, he stated, ''not good news'' for alarmists like him that the so-called ''millennium plot'' had been foiled without bloodshed, because ''it requires body bags sometimes to make really tough decisions about money and about governmental arrangements.'' Clarke was talking about the mobilization of public opinion, but at bottom he was describing the limits of the imagination. Most of us -- not Clarke himself, to be sure -- have a hard time accepting the fact that something that has never happened will, in fact, happen. If you've never lived through a stock market crash, you're unlikely to accept the evidence that one is coming.</p>
        <p>What we need, ideally, is a prophylactic foretaste of horror. I've always thought that the perfect instance of this sensitizing effect was the near meltdown at Three Mile Island, which instantly and permanently changed the climate of nuclear safety without killing anyone. In the case of terrorism, we had our meltdown before we had a chance to be scared straight. Yes, I know we had the embassy bombings and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. But we were not, as the president puts it, on a war footing. Our borders felt inviolable until the very moment they were violated. And then suddenly everyone was saying with the most perfect assurance that it would happen again soon -- so swiftly does the unthinkable become inevitable.</p>
        <p>Of course, we hold a president to a higher standard of responsibility; he has what tort law calls ''a duty of care.'' Tort law stipulates that the responsible agent can be liable if he knew or should have known about the danger in question. President Bush has thoroughly confused the matter by saying that he would have acted had he ''any inkling whatsoever that the people were going to fly airplanes into buildings.'' Of course he would have; but the issue is not whether you know which iceberg you're going to hit, but whether you know that you're vulnerable to icebergs. This ''should have known'' question is very hard to resolve. And yet even with all we've learned from the 9/11 panel, I'm still inclined to think that if we judge with humility, rather than with the righteousness of retrospective wisdom, we will not hold the president blameworthy for the attacks. Put otherwise, I don't think a President Al Gore, with all his abundant knowledge of the world, would have acted all that differently.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, a President Gore's national security adviser and attorney general could hardly have been more nonchalant about Al Qaeda than were Condoleezza Rice or John Ashcroft, as we now know from the 9/11 panel. And history may harshly judge the Federal Aviation Administration, which is ultimately responsible for airline safety and which never distributed a full watch list of suspect passengers -- including two of the 9/11 bombers -- to the airlines. The agency did not have to foresee the specific iceberg in order to take reasonable precautions.</p>
        <p>I wonder if, in the future, the Bush administration will be blamed for failures of foresight that have nothing to do with terrorist attacks. When, for example, today's mammoth tax cuts make it impossible to fix Social Security or Medicare years from now, or when the insistence on developing tactical nuclear weapons provides other nations a pretext to flout the rules of nonproliferation and thus make the world yet more terrifying, Bush officials won't be able to seek refuge in ''We couldn't have known.'' Should Bangladesh begin to disappear under water, people will recall that the administration refused to act to stem global warming despite a virtual consensus of scientific opinion on the subject. Above all, if Iraq remains a cockpit of violence and a source of instability, the administration will rightly be blamed for ignoring almost universal warnings about the dangers of postwar settings. Afghanistan and Kosovo and Bosnia played the role of Three Mile Island -- but to no effect.</p>
        <p>If we fail to see what is over the horizon, we can blame the limits of perception. But if we choose not to see what is perfectly plain to others, we have no one to blame but ourselves.</p>
