        <p>LEAD: I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED postoperative recovery rooms to be hellish places filled with pain and moans and occasional retching.

        <p>I HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED postoperative recovery rooms to be hellish places filled with pain and moans and occasional retching. Last year, I visited a recovery room that challenged my view: the two dozen occupants - fresh wounds dressed with gauze and surgical drains in place -were sleeping, reading, sipping soda. And when I nudged my patient who had just had her left hip replaced to inquire how she felt, to my surprise, she opened her eyes and said somewhat wearily: ''Just fine.''</p>
        <p>Perplexed, I asked one of the surgeons what had changed. His reply: ''Anesthesia.'' The field has undergone a major transformation, and anesthesiologists have become the unsung heroes of the operating room. Quietly, they have developed a host of innovations - from safer general anesthesia to effective regional techniques - that are dramatically changing the surgical experience.</p>
        <p>It has always struck me as odd that patients will deify their surgeons but be unable to name their anesthesiologists. In the operating room, while the surgeon focuses on your appendix or gall bladder, the anesthesiologist is the guardian of your general well-being. When you sign a consent form for anesthesia you are trusting him to give you what could be lethal doses of narcotics and, in fact, to breathe for you. It is the anesthesiologist, sitting at the head of the operating table, beside a bank of dials, pumps and monitors, who controls your blood pressure, orders blood if you become anemic and calls off the surgery if the procedure goes awry. For minor operations, the skill of the anesthesiologist is clearly much more important to your survival than the skill of the surgeon.</p>
        <p>A New York internist's daughter recently needed an ear operation. ''I wasn't worried about the surgery,'' he said, ''but I was scared to death about the anesthesia.'' He looked into the options before his daughter was admitted to a hospital. As a doctor, he may transfer a patient from one hospital to another for better anesthesia. Most now offer patients preadmission anesthesia consultation. All should.</p>
        <p>The patient's first interaction with the anesthesiologist generally begins with a brief interview the night before surgery. There is not much time for doctor-patient bonding, but it is a critical time to tell all. Alcohol, smoking, antidepressants, even oral contraceptives affect the way the body processes anesthetics. He or she will ask whether you or any of your relatives have had problems with reactions to anesthesia. He may also look at your neck and chin; people with bull necks or receding chins frequently have difficulty with breathing devices while under general anesthesia. The decision will be made after this interview on the appropriate form of anesthesia. In 1846, a Boston dentist, William</p>
        <p>T.G. Norton, pioneered the field when he had patients inhale fumes of ether before he pulled teeth. His patients slumped cooperatively into the dentist's chair at first, but as he applied a wrench to the tooth and pulled it out, they writhed in pain. When the fumes wore off, however, the patients remembered the procedure as thoroughly pleasant - one even asked to have another tooth out. Soon thereafter, chloroform and nitrous oxide (laughing gas) were discovered to have better anesthetic properties, and modern surgery was born.</p>
        <p>Today, for general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist creates a controlled coma through the use of intravenous and inhaled medications. Selecting syringe after syringe from his work station, he first induces unconsciousness with a blend of a drug like Valium or sodium pentothal and a short-acting narcotic like fentanyl; the patient is also paralyzed with a drug that partially blocks nerve impulses. From this point forward, your protector back there in the world of the awake breathes for you with a device called a ventilator. He winds a plastic tube into the mouth and down to the windpipe and sends a mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide or other gases through the tube, along with one of the newer inhalational anesthetics - enflurane or isoflurane - to maintain the trance. How these soporific molecules work is still not really known.</p>
        <p>As the operation progresses, the anesthesiologist adjusts the controls bit by bit, deciding perhaps to lower blood pressure to reduce bleeding. Total blood loss during scoliosis surgery, for example, can be reduced from 2 liters to 300 cubic centimeters.</p>
        <p>For most patients, general anesthesia has always been statistically safe but has recently become even safer with new early-warning monitors. One is the pulse oximeter, which looks like a thimble and calculates the blood's oxygen based on the color of the skin. Doctors once relied on imperfect clues like a blue tinge to the patient's lips to guess that a patient was oxygen-starved. Brain cells die quickly, and there were occasional surprises: a patient who seemed to be sailing through surgery beautifully might fail to wake up. Another new device measures exhaled carbon dioxide and can determine whether a patient's body is overheating. (Malpractice suits against anesthesiologists are relatively rare, though settlements in cases that do occur can be huge.) Despite the improvements in general anesthesia, every physician I know who has needed surgery has opted where possible for the new ''regional'' techniques that block sensations of a region, or portion, of the body instead of inducing general unconsciousness. And they prefer local anesthesia for small procedures.</p>
        <p>In regional blocks, the patient may remain awake and only the nerves supplying the surgical site are numbed with skillfully placed deep injections of lidocaine and sometimes narcotics. These injections are placed at the base of an arm or leg, providing anesthesia for hand or foot surgery, or directly into the epidural space of the spinal column in a region surrounding the spinal cord, allowing for larger operations like hip replacements, Caesareans and prostate resections; catheters inserted into the epidural space are left in throughout surgery like an intravenous line.</p>
        <p>Still, on first viewing, it can seem a bit disconcerting. At the top of the operating table is the head of the patient, who may be chatting away. ''How is the surgery going?'' ''Can I leave the hospital tomorrow?'' A piece of sterile cloth is hung as a curtain at chest level so that the patient cannot view the surgical field. But an observer can peek over the drape, and there on the ''operative'' side of the barrier, the belly that belongs to the talking head is filleted wide open or a femur is being disarticulated from a hip socket. It is quite extraordinary. Certain regions of the body -most notably the chest and upper abdomen - are not safe for regional anesthesia: these spinal regions, for example, contain fibers that control chest pain, but they also contain nerves that cannot be even temporarily deadened because they send vital operating messages to the heart. In cases where regional anesthesia is appropriate, ''I can't think of any reason not to have it,'' says Dr. William Urmey, attending anesthesiologist at New York's Hospital for Special Surgery. The regional practice has burgeoned in the last few years, and, though comprehensive studies are not in, it does seems logically safer. At Special Surgery, one of the country's leading orthopedic hospitals, 81 percent of surgical cases are now done under regional or local anesthesia. Only two years ago, at the same hospital, 88 percent of all patients received general anesthesia.</p>
        <p>For patients with heart or lung disease who cannot tolerate general anesthesia, regional blocks can be lifesaving. For women who deliver by Caesarean, regional anesthesia gives them the opportunity to be alert at the moment of birth. And the benefits of regional anesthesia extend into the postoperative period. With an epidural catheter in place, painkillers can be delivered directly to pain centers in the spine, avoiding the narcotic's clouding effect on the brain.</p>
        <p>A RECENT STUDY IN THE British Journal of Surgery offers a glowing if preliminary report for regional anesthesia: for a number of procedures, researchers found a marked decrease in length of hospital stay, fewer pulmonary complications and a much lower rate of peri-operative heart attacks. Cost to the patient appears not to be a factor; the anesthesiologist's fee, normally about one-fifth to one-sixth that of the surgeon, is charged on a case-by-case basis, not determined by the type of anesthesia.</p>
        <p>Some patients enjoy the opportunity of taking in the sights and sounds of the hospital operating room. ''Some patients like to watch their arthroscopy on the TV screen,'' says Urmey. For others, this same atmosphere can be upsetting. In orthopedic procedures, you hear the drill and the saw cutting away at your bones. You smell the cautery burning your blood vessels. How much of the operating-room experience you wish to take in is largely your choice.</p>
        <p>The anesthesiologist can give you medication that will prevent your recalling a thing about the procedure. One New York physician recently had a knee operation under regional, during which he conversed with his orthopedists about their findings. He awoke several hours later in a panic. What had been done to his knee? He had forgotten the operation.  QUESTIONS FOR THE ANESTHESIOLOGISTS</p>
        <p>Before your operation, ask:</p>
        <p>Are they certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology?</p>
        <p>Are they trained in, and do they regularly perform, ''regional'' anesthesia?</p>
        <p>Do they use the new pulse oximeters and carbon dioxide monitors during general anesthesia?</p>
        <p>Do they do preliminary consultations?</p>
        <p>Do they use cell-saving techniques so blood can be re-used if necessary?</p>
        <p>Is the anesthesia administered by someone other than a doctor?</p>
        <p>Is the recovery room open at night, and is an anesthesiologist on call?</p>
