        <p>Re ''In Ancient Fossils, Seeds of a New Debate on Warming'' (Nov. 7): Paleoclimatology, the study of the Earth's past climate, is fueling a healthy debate about the causes of ancient climate swings. But that doesn't mean there's a similar range of explanations for today's global warming.</p>
        <p>Scientific observations show a clear picture: carbon dioxide and other gases from human activities are the major cause of global warming. What about natural factors? Satellite data shows there has been no net change in the Sun's output since the late 1970s, in cosmic rays since the 1950s. The oceans have absorbed heat from the atmosphere, not the other way around. Continental drift and Earth orbit changes affect climate far too slowly to have caused the current warming.</p>

        <p>We have much to learn about the Earth's climate. But continuing research shouldn't obscure the overwhelming evidence that global warming today is directly attributable to human activities and that prompt action is necessary to avert dangerous consequences.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was deeply dismayed by the article ''In Ancient Fossils, Seeds of a New Debate on Warming.'' What is a truly fascinating scientific question about fundamental Earth processes was reported as a spat between feuding factions.</p>
        <p>Numerous processes shape the climate of our planet, from the distribution of the continents to the composition of the atmosphere. That different mechanisms are more or less prominent at different times in the past is neither controversial nor shocking.</p>
        <p>The debate between believers in carbon dioxide as a climate control and doubters of that theory peters out to a difference of either eight degrees or two to three degrees due to human activity. It is a disservice to the public to present valid, interesting and exciting scientific debate as an irreconcilable conflict rather than the normal creaking and grinding of scientific discovery and advance.</p>
