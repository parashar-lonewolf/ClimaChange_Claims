        <p>LEAD: ALMOST as soon as I bought it 15 years ago, I wanted to get rid of my gasoline lawn mower.</p>
        <p>ALMOST as soon as I bought it 15 years ago, I wanted to get rid of my gasoline lawn mower.</p>
        <p>It has always been cranky about starting, especially in cool weather. My neighbors all seem to have mowers that start on the first pull of the cord. Mine can take 18 tries, unless I put it in a sunny spot for half an hour for the gasoline to warm up. Or the spark plug. Or something. In really chilly weather, it sometimes has to come into the kitchen to sit for a while before it is the least bit accommodating about roaring to life.</p>
        <p>It is, furthermore, made for someone who is right-handed and right-footed, which I am not. Our match was ill-made from the outset. To get my foot in its designated place before yanking the cord, I have to go through some contorted maneuvers. My wife thinks I'm speaking nonsense. Scissors may be right-handed or left-handed, she says, but not lawn mowers. (She is right-handed, of course.) I would sometimes broach the subject of replacing the mower, but she never uttered a syllable of concurrence. Our mower, she would say, is perfectly adequate. She is probably right.</p>
        <p>She also suspects, I imagine, that I would like to replace it with a far more expensive riding mower. The thought, I confess, has occasionally risen into consciousness, even if over the years I have reduced 10,000 square feet of lawn to what looks like a tiny putting green between the deck and a perennial border.</p>
        <p>A month ago, I replaced our mower, but not with a riding mower. The power mower went to our younger son, now making his first garden at the place he and his wife just bought a few miles away. He is more competent with machinery than I. His kitchen is closer to his lawn. He is right-handed and right-footed.</p>
        <p>In our shed, where the old power mower used to hog a lot of room, there is a new mower occupying much less space. It has no engine. I have to push it. It is a reel mower, the kind I grew up with. When I push it, the wheels move forward. When the wheels move forward, they turn a cylinder of five sharp blades, which cut the grass like scimitars.</p>
        <p>I can explain why I have this new mower, instead of an old one that was perfectly adequate even if I hated it with a fury for a decade and a half. To begin with, lawns are environmentally unsound. They are fertilized with chemicals derived from petroleum. The fertilizer may run off to contaminate ground water and to kill lakes in a bloom of algae.</p>
        <p>Lawns also need water and lots of it, at intervals of deep drenching, if American gardens are to call forth images of England and its turf emerald and immemorial.</p>
        <p>I did some of my part, the reasoning goes, by cutting the size of my lawn to under 500 square feet. I did more by giving up fertilizers altogether. White clover, which snatches nitrogen from the air, is planted in equal measure with fescues and other traditional grasses. This nitrogen-fixing legume makes itself and its lawn companions grow with little human assistance, without taking over the lawn itself. Since the clover would be killed if I put down broad-leafed weed killers, I cannot and do not use them.</p>
        <p>But the arguments for a hand-pushed reel mower over a gasoline-powered mower carry the previous reasoning further. No gasoline means going easy on fossil fuels. Pushing a mower, moreover, is good exercise.</p>
        <p>The arguments make sense, but they were not motivating ones, as they came after the old mower was on its way out, the new one on its way in. What happened is that I was seduced by a garden-tool catalogue, one of quite a few that appear in my mailbox. All of them are seductive, but that of Smith &amp; Hawken is such a Don Giovanni that I wonder if the company might not have a Leperello in a back room, tallying it all up: ''And in Spain, 1003.''</p>
        <p>I have a lot of affection for this company, which sells some tools for the left-handed gardener, but the temptations arising from its catalogue go beyond a lefty's gratitude. If I were very wealthy, my garden shed would be home to every lopper, every secateur and every rake it offers. This time I was an easy mark for its hand mower, described as making only a whispering sound as it cuts grass.</p>
        <p>I loved this machine as soon as I opened the box, for reasons having nothing to do with ecology. It is painted in bright and shiny enamel, a frank and unmistakable red that calls up memories of my first scooter, of a wagon I had when I was 4, and of an MG I wanted but never got when I was 21.</p>
        <p>It calls up other memories, of Saturday mornings in Texas, when all the fathers on our block hauled out their push mowers before the sweltering heat arrived. In those days, before lawns were mowed to the roar of the combustion engine, the neighborhood was filled with the soft whir of lawns being mowed. The whisper of these old-fashioned mowers was one of the quintessential sounds of summer, on the order of katydids high in cottonwood trees on a hot and still afternoon in July, or of the grinding, sloshy noise of turning the crank on an ice cream machine.</p>
        <p>I am no Luddite. I wouldn't dream of forsaking my computer and returning to a manual typewriter, much less a quill and ink, nor of getting rid of my CD player in favor of a wind-up Victrola. If my lawn were still 10,000 square feet I would still use a power mower, and if it were reckoned in acres, it would be a riding one.</p>
        <p>But a well-built hand mower is entirely proper for a small lawn. It cuts grass with almost surgical precision, not decapitating it with the ruthlessness of a sharpened propeller revolving at murderous speed a couple of inches above the ground. It spews no carbon monoxide and other toxic gases into an atmosphere. Instead of petroleum fumes, it leaves in the air the delicious sweet scent of newly mown clover blossoms and blades of grass drying in the sun.</p>
        <p>I can now say something I've never said before: thanks to this new toy, so shiny and red, I love to mow the lawn.</p>
