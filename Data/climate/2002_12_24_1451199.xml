        <p>Stones on Earth  The Rolling Stones plan a special free concert to raise awareness about global warming. The event, in collaboration with the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization, is to take place on Feb. 6 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. ''The Rolling Stones' commitment will help build unprecedented support for N.R.D.C. efforts to fight global warming,'' said the council's president, John. H. Adams. Until 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on Jan. 6, people at least 18 years old who are interested in attending the concert may enter a sweepstakes for two free tickets by completing the entry form at www.nrdcstonesconcert.org.</p>
        <p>Water Everywhere  Some of the paintings are but a rapid rendering of an impression; others are saturated with color. Some reflect a mystical empathy with nature; others evoke realism to depict a setting. Such works are among the 26 watercolors by major American artists on view through June 8 at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven. Helen A. Cooper, the Holcombe T. Green Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture, says, ''The same motif, rendered in oil, can appear robust and solid, whereas painting in transparent pigment is often nearer to spontaneity and emotional expression.'' For comparison, ''Masters of American Watercolor: Homer to Hopper'' offers Thomas Eakins's ''John Biglin in a Single Scull.'' The oil painting of the same subject is nearby. Among other artists in the show are John Singer Sargent, Charles Demuth and Georgia O'Keeffe.</p>

        <p>Love's Toll  The Metropolitan Opera premiere radio broadcast of William Bolcom's ''View From the Bridge,'' based on Arthur Miller's play, is to take place at 1:30 p.m. Saturday. The broadcast, sponsored by Chevron Texaco, will be heard on 360 stations in the United States and in 40 countries in the Americas, Europe, East Asia and the Pacific Rim (in New York on WQXR-FM, 96.3). The cast includes Catherine Malfitano and Kim Josephson as Beatrice and Eddie and, in her Met broadcast debut as Catherine, the soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian.</p>
        <p>Coming Attractions  The composer John Adams (above, right) and the librettist Alice Goodman have been commissioned by the San Francisco Opera to create an opera based on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the project that developed the atomic bomb, who later opposed the hydrogen bomb and was eventually declared a security risk. The opera, its working title ''Doctor Atomic,'' will be conducted by Donald Runnicles, the company's music director, and directed by Peter Sellars. Mr. Adams, Ms. Goodman and Mr. Sellars collaborated on ''Nixon in China'' and ''The Death of Klinghoffer.'' This work is to open in the fall of the 2005-6 season.</p>

        <p>Footlights  Correction:  December 26, 2002, Thursday  A report in the Footlights column on Tuesday about plans for a free concert by the Rolling Stones on Feb. 6 in Los Angeles to raise awareness of global warming misstated the name of the environmental group collaborating on the event. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council, not National.</p>
