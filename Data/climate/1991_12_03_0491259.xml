        <p>Japan and the United States are struggling to prevent their successful alliance from being engulfed by a rising tide of frustrations, resentments and recriminations.</p>
        <p>Solid majorities of both countries say they feel that relations between them are friendly and that the alliance between Japan and the United States is dependable, according to an opinion survey in late November by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo Broadcasting System.</p>
        <p>But reflecting the strains in their official relations, the poll shows that Americans voice a deeply pessimistic view about competing with Japan and that the Japanese increasingly see Americans as living in a nation in decline and inclined to blame Japan for its own economic problems.  [ Page A16. ]</p>
        <p>The war in the Persian Gulf and the collapse of Communism are forcing Tokyo and Washington to redefine their relationship -- especially the tradition of Washington providing security and foreign policy guidelines while Japan tended to business.</p>
        <p>It has proved difficult to rally the Japanese and Americans to new kinds of cooperation -- to defend democracy, combat poverty, help the environment and other activities consistent with President Bush's new world order -- particularly because of emotions unleashed by the gulf war.</p>
        <p>"The gulf war was a trigger to submerged feelings in Japan," said Terumasa Nakanishi, professor of international relations at Shizuoka University. "The Japanese were exposed to a typically American self-righteous justification of resorting to war. It helped convince Japanese that they are culturally different."</p>
        <p>For many Japanese and Americans, this is a time of reflection on their relationship. While the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor brings reminders of the unpleasant past, the visit of President Bush in January to meet the newly elected Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, is turning everyone's attention to current problems.</p>
        <p>The current strains are exacerbated by what Japanese see as the spectacle of a once all-powerful United States struggling with debt, deficits, weak financial institu- tions, and mounting social problems, making them wonder about America's ability to maintain its world leadership.</p>
        <p>Leaders of both the United States and Japan, which together account for 40 percent of the world's economic output and 40 percent of aid to poor countries, defend their record and say cooperation is better than is often perceived.</p>
        <p>"The basic trend is very satisfactory," said Koichiro Matsuura, director general of the North American bureau at the Foreign Ministry. "Nobody can disagree that the ties between Japan and the United States have become much better. It's the perceptions that have deteriorated."</p>
        <p>But other recent events -- particularly the American decision to withdraw 15,000 of the 135,000 troops stationed in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines -- have made Japanese leaders nervous about the future reliability of the United States.</p>
        <p>The United States' recent failure to win agreement in the Philippines for renewal of American bases there, which has accelerated the pullout from Asia, has shaken Japan. Indeed, Tokyo agreed to give the Philippines $1 billion in aid at the Americans' urging, hoping to persuade Manila to keep American troops.  Fear of Creating A Power Vacuum</p>
        <p>Now there is widespread nervousness in Japan and Asia that an American withdrawal could leave a vacuum and stimulate an arms race among Asian nations. Asians are nervous that Japan is slightly modifying its long-held pacifism and preparing to send troops abroad for the first time since World War II, as part of United Nations peacekeeping forces.</p>
        <p>"A power vacuum in Asia is something we must prevent," said Makoto Sakuma, chairman of the joint staff council of the Defense Agency. "If the American military presence in Asia is withdrawn, not only Japan but Asia as a whole will suffer instability."</p>
        <p>Because of American economic weakness, Washington has put pressure on Tokyo to increase its share of the burden of 56,000 troops in Japan. Japan now pays about half the cost, or about $3 billion a year, to support the American naval and ground forces, making it cheaper to station troops in Japan than in the United States.</p>
        <p>The problem is that after the collapse of Communism, Japan and the United States may no longer see eye to eye on security.</p>
        <p>As The Times/CBS News/Tokyo Broadcasting System poll showed, many Japanese opposed the gulf war and generally are more opposed than Americans to using American military force in the world. This contradiction could become a crisis in a future conflict requiring American troops based in Japan.</p>
        <p>"Americans would be wise to abandon the term 'burden sharing' because it both reeks of American self-righteousness and amounts to a self-advertisement of America's declining ability to carry out an independent foreign policy," Chalmers Johnson, Rohr professor of Pacific international relations at the University of California at San Diego, wrote recently.</p>
        <p>Moreover, many Japanese feel that the concentration of 29,000 marines in Okinawa cannot last. The new governor of that island has for the first time demanded an American withdrawal, a step that would eliminate a base from which the first marines traveled to the gulf last year.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the Japanese-American relationship have been efforts on myriad fronts to reduce the trade deficit, which has in fact fallen in recent years. But all the negotiations, even those that have yielded results, have taken their toll in a subtle way.</p>
        <p>"The Japanese find it hard to make concessions, only to be faced with new demands," said Michael C. Armacost, the United States Ambassador, in explaining the Japanese inflexibiity. "We find it frustrating to have to demand that Japan market access that we extend in our own country. I wish there was another way of doing these things."</p>
        <p>American leaders are nettled by the refusal of Japan to lift its ban on rice imports or take other steps to break the deadlock in the current Uruguay Round of trade talks. In Washington's view, Tokyo is not protecting and defending the world trading system from which it benefits more than any other nation.</p>
        <p>The United States trade deficit with Japan has narrowed to $41 billion last year from a peak of $56 billion in 1987, and there have been agreements on supercomputers, semiconductors, construction contracts and many other sectors. Japan's imports from the United States have doubled in five years. But both sides agree that the long-term trends are disturbing. The deficit is bound to go back up as the United States recovers from its recession and the demand for imports surges. Japan is also exporting more to the United States indirectly, from factories in other parts of Asia and is commanding a larger share of the American market through goods produced in its own American factories, too.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Japan has spent five years mobilizing its resources -- investing two and a half times as much as the United States in new plants, equipment and research -- to produce new products.</p>
        <p>While Japan has prepared in this fashion, the United States has begun lodging more fundamental criticisms of Japan's cozy business relationships, and its whole policy of submerging consumer interests to those of business, the very things that Japanese feel have been secrets to their success. An Outpouring By Critics in Japan</p>
        <p>Japan has responded with an outpouring of critical comments among scholars, businessmen and politicians, many disdainful of the United States, suggesting that the United States is blaming Japan for its problems.</p>
        <p>One economist, Seiichiro Saito, a professor at Rikkyo University, said that the United States was becoming a "vegetable nation" suffering from a kind of degenerative disease which makes it unconscious of its problems and able only to demand to borrow money from Japan and other countries.</p>
        <p>Japanese do not like to express their feelings openly, but it is almost impossible to speak with anyone in a position of responsibility and not pick up an undercurrent of criticism, friendly and not so friendly.</p>
        <p>"The whole U.S. society seems to be deteriorating," a senior Japanese diplomat said. "Americans are losing their ability to communicate among themselves. Everyone is either fighting or hiring lawyers, and America's ability to integrate different elements into a melting pot is weakening. So Americans are looking for scapegoats and blaming Japan."</p>
        <p>Many diplomats and negotiators also feel that having tried to resolve their differences on a number of trade issues, they are down to the fact that Japanese and Americans are simply different culturally, and that America should stop lecturing Japan to change.</p>
        <p>"Americans ought to learn to respect the differences among people who live outside the United States," said Kazuo Ogura, director of cultural affairs at the Foreign Ministry. "Americans simply don't want to recognize that Japan has won the economic race against the West."</p>
        <p>Japanese and Americans agree that in the environment after the cold war, where both countries no longer fear a Soviet military threat, the staggering economic interdependence of Japan and the United States is the glue that binds the two nations together.</p>
        <p>Japan now has an estimated $83 billion in direct American investments, although the rate of growth dropped sharply in the last year. But Japanese-owned factories and other interests employ many Americans and have become a crucial part of the economy.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Japan counts on American markets for a third of its global exports, and Tokyo carefully monitors every bill in Congress that would restrict the flow. Japanese officials, knowing that President Bush has opposed such measures, mask some of their disappointments with his Administration.</p>
        <p>His support will be critical as it carves out a broader role in world affairs. It is seeking upgraded status at the Interntional Monetary Fund and permanent membership in the United Nations Security Council. It also wants removal of clauses in the United Nations charter referring to Japan as a former enemy state. American support for these steps is seen in Japan as lukewarm.</p>
        <p>Japan and the United States maintain that they have achieved impressive cooperation in the areas of foreign aid, environment, narcotics, refugees and debt relief for developing nations. But the record is mixed.</p>
        <p>Japan this year doubled its contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, for example, and for the first time a Japanese, Sadako Ogata, a respected scholar on international relations, has been chosen to that agency or indeed any other international agency.</p>
        <p>But on foreign aid to poor countries, Japan has been struggling to fulfill its promises to provide help commensurate with its status as an economic superpower. In 1989, Japan achieved the position of the largest donor of foreign aid in the world, but in 1990 the United States regained the title.</p>
        <p>International organizations want Japan to do more because it spends only 1 percent of its gross national product on its military, as opposed to 6 percent by the United States. Many have asked Japan raise its foreign aid spending also to 1 percent, but it has remained at less than four-tenths of 1 percent, making it only the eighth biggest giver in terms of economic capacity. The Japanese Way Of Giving Out Aid</p>
        <p>The way Japan has given out aid has also remained controversial. Tokyo continues emphasize big industrial projects that help its own companies.</p>
        <p>After war broke out in the gulf, for instance, Japan announced a $2 billion economic package for the region, largely for projects like the Beniseuf cement factory in Egypt, being built by the Mitsubishi Corporation and Kobe Steel, and the Golden Horn Bridge in Turkey, being built by IHI, a Japanese construction company.</p>
        <p>Nor has Japan succeeded in developing a consistent philosophy for its foreign aid program. Last year, Tokyo announced that it would not give aid to countries that exported weapons, and would use its aid to promote democracy and human rights. But Japan has persisted in giving aid to China, a leading arms exporter, and has refused to cut off aid to Burma.</p>
        <p>"Japan lacks a focus on what it is actually trying to achieve with its foreign aid," said Robert M. Orr, director of the Kyoto Center for Japanese Studies, and author of the book "The Emergence of Japan's Foreign Aid Power." He added, "It doesn't fit into any coherent world vision."</p>
        <p>In the environmental area, the global partnership appears mostly to be a slogan masking continuing disagreements on matters like global warming, destruction of tropical forests by Japanese companies and protection of endangered species.</p>
        <p>All the difficulties and differences of perspective between Japan and the United States have caused some to predict much greater conflict ahead, especially who fear Japanese intentions over the long term, although they concede that the alliance is strong for now.</p>
        <p>Professor Johnson, at the University of California at San Diego, has warned that Japan's American investments amount to an attempt to colonize the United States, that Japan could move away from Washington's orbit and try to create a a yen-based regional trading bloc.</p>
        <p>"In the case of Japan," he wrote recently, "past behavior and current capabilities are so extraordinary and so formidable as to cause any other nation or people to be concerned about its future intentions."</p>
        <p>Such talk is dismissed by most Americans and Japanese. Those Japanese who argue that Japan should indeed assert its interests, even if they are antithetical to those of the United States, take the most pains to tell Americans that they should not worry that there are conflicts.</p>
        <p>"Japan has learned the lessons of war, and we are determined never to go beyond these four islands anywhere in the world," said Jun Eto, a conservative-oriented visiting professor at Keio University. "But the United States and Japan will have to learn to live with constant conflict. We are both competitive, jealous and powerful nations, after all."</p>
        <p>"Conflict doesn't mean war," he added. "The greatest lesson of World War II, is that we in Japan have to live with Americans whether we like it or not. But I don't know whether that's a lesson learned in America."</p>
