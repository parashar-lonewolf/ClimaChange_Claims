        <p>Toyota Motor Corporation, largest Japanese automobile manufacturer, says it will become first company to sell low-polluting hybrid vehicle, with both electric motor and gasoline engine, to mass market; will begin selling compact hybrid car with 1.5 liter engine in Japan in 1997, but has no immediate plans to market it in US; estimates vehicle will get 66 miles per gallon in fuel-economy tests, or twice efficiency of smaller-size Corolla (M)</p>

        <p>The Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would become the first company to sell a low-polluting hybrid vehicle, with both an electric motor and a gasoline engine, to a mass market.</p>
        <p>The company, the largest Japanese auto maker, said it would begin selling a compact hybrid car with a 1.5-liter engine in Japan this year. Executives said they had no immediate plans to sell the vehicles in the United States, though that is a possibility later. ''We are very confident about what this offers,'' said Akihiro Wada, an executive vice president of Toyota, ''but we would like to get reaction and criticism by testing it in the Japanese market first.''</p>
        <p>Hybrid vehicles significantly reduce emissions compared with gasoline-powered cars but are far more practical than fully electric cars. They cannot achieve the zero-emission level of the fully electric car, which California regulators have been seeking. But many auto engineers believe that the hybrid approach represents a reasonable compromise.</p>
        <p>Toyota estimates that its hybrid car will get 66 miles a gallon of gasoline in Japanese fuel-economy tests, twice the efficiency of a similar-size Corolla. Emissions of carbon dioxide would be cut in half, and those of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides reduced 90 percent.</p>
        <p>Many other companies are working on hybrid vehicles. Detroit's Big Three -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- are pursuing them, in an effort partly financed by the Department of Energy, to develop a high-efficiency supercar. Audi, a division of Volkswagen, is said to have a hybrid car using a diesel engine ready for sale later this year, and Renault has also announced hybrid technology.</p>
        <p>Until recently, much of the emphasis in cutting automotive air pollution had focused on fully electric vehicles, because California was requiring that 2 percent of the cars sold there beginning in the 1998 model year have zero-emission levels.</p>
        <p>But last year, with auto makers insisting that it would be a long time until it was possible to make an electric vehicle that would satisfy consumers, California dropped that deadline, though it is still aiming for 10 percent of vehicles sold in 2003 to have no emissions.</p>
        <p>Takehisa Yaegashi, chief engineer for Toyota's hybrid system, said the company hoped that California might further relax its requirements and accept hybrid vehicles instead of electric ones.</p>
        <p>General Motors in December began offering an electric vehicle in California and Arizona, but has sold only a few dozen a month. The Honda Motor Company, Toyota and possibly others are expected to begin sales of electric vehicles in California this year.</p>
        <p>The hybrid vehicles could avoid a major shortcoming of fully electric ones -- the limited range of the batteries. G.M.'s electric vehicle goes only about 90 miles before the battery must be recharged, a process that takes about three hours.</p>
        <p>But the hybrid vehicle can also travel farther because it uses gasoline. And energy from the gasoline engine can recharge the battery while the car is in motion, so that no external recharging is needed.</p>
        <p>Hybrids can achieve high efficiency and low pollution because of the way they combine dissimilar propulsion systems. Gasoline systems are good for quick refueling, but get zero miles a gallon when the car is idling; in a hybrid, that energy can be converted to current for the batteries. And if the engine runs at a constant speed, the antipollution system can operate at most efficient levels for that speed.</p>
        <p>Electric systems are clean and powerful but rely on slow recharging, which is cumbersome if the car has to stand still. And the gasoline engines used in hybrids can be small and light, because they do not have to be big enough to meet peak demand -- acceleration to highway speeds; for that, they can get help from the electric motor.</p>
        <p>Because hybrid cars can get by with smaller batteries, they also should cost significantly less than fully electric cars, Toyota executives said. They would not disclose the price of their new car, but said they aimed to keep it no more than about $4,000 more expensive than a similar-size conventional car, implying a price of less than $20,000 for a compact model. By contrast, the G.M. electric vehicle, which seats only two people, has a price of $34,000.</p>
        <p>Toyota officials suggested that they expected to sell significantly more hybrid vehicles than the several hundred a year electric cars that most makers expect to sell. But they would not announce a sales target and conceded that the hybrid car's higher price compared with conventional cars would limit sales.</p>
        <p>In Toyota's hybrid vehicle, power from the gasoline engine is split into two paths -- one directly turning the wheels and the other operating an electric generator. The generator's electricity output can be used to turn a motor that drives the wheels, or to charge the battery. The proportion of power allocated to each path is automatically adjusted to achieve maximum efficiency.</p>
        <p>When the car is started and moving slowly, only the electric motor is used because gasoline engines operate inefficiently at such low speeds. In normal driving the gasoline engine is used, perhaps assisted by the electric motor during acceleration. When the car is slowed, the gasoline engine is shut off and the momentum of revolving wheels helps recharge the nickel-metal hydride battery.</p>
        <p>Toyota is not banking solely on hybrids but is pursuing many different technologies for increasing fuel efficiency and lowering emissions, such as lean-burning gasoline engines, electric vehicles and cars that use other kinds of fuel.</p>
