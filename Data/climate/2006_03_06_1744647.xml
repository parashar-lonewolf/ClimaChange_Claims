        <p>Here is a sampling of some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the 2006 media conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, which was held here last Wednesday through Friday.</p>
        <p>HEAD COUNT -- The conference was kicked off by O. Burtch Drake, the president and chief executive of the advertising trade association, who confidently called it ''the media event of the year.'' The group has certainly hit a critical mass. In 1994, when the first conference was held in Jacksonville, Fla., 375 people and 40 exhibitors attended; this year, 1,442 people and 104 exhibitors were there.</p>
        <p>TIVO IS SO 2004 -- One conspicuous no-show at the conference was the digital video recorder. There was surprisingly little mention of TiVo or other DVR's, a shift from conferences past.</p>

        <p>Here is a sampling of some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the 2006 media conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, which was held here last Wednesday through Friday.</p>
        <p>HEAD COUNT -- The conference was kicked off by O. Burtch Drake, the president and chief executive of the advertising trade association, who confidently called it ''the media event of the year.'' The group has certainly hit a critical mass. In 1994, when the first conference was held in Jacksonville, Fla., 375 people and 40 exhibitors attended; this year, 1,442 people and 104 exhibitors were there.</p>
        <p>TIVO IS SO 2004 -- One conspicuous no-show at the conference was the digital video recorder. There was surprisingly little mention of TiVo or other DVR's, a shift from conferences past.</p>
        <p>''Two years ago this conference was completely fixated on the DVR,'' said Christopher J. Rohrs, the president of the Television Bureau of Advertising. ''It was going to swamp the advertising model.''</p>
        <p>If DVR's were mentioned at all, it was to dismiss their potential. One often-cited figure was that fewer than 10 percent of American households had one. This year, the hand-wringing seemed to center on increasingly popular video-on-demand, which lets people buy movies and TV shows from an Ã  la carte menu -- without traditional advertising.</p>
        <p>A GORE TRAVELOGUE -- According to the program schedule, Al Gore came to make a speech at the advertising association conference in his latest capacity as chairman of Current TV.</p>
        <p>But that did not stop the former vice president from using his 20 minutes to talk about a subject closer to his heart: global warming.</p>
        <p>Narrating a slideshow of pictures from space (''This is an image almost never seen, a time-lapse picture of Earth in one day. Isn't that beautiful?''), and photos of Mount Kilimanjaro and glaciers in Nepal, Mr. Gore left behind an enthusiastic, though slightly bewildered, audience.</p>
        <p>Then again, later that day, some people who heard Mr. Gore's speech were snickering about it. During a presentation titled, ''What's The Next Big Thing?'', Stacey Lynn Koerner, the director of global research integration for Initiative, a media-buying firm, was presenting a slideshow of her own to highlight how overwhelmed consumers feel by the surfeit of advertising.</p>
        <p>As she flashed a picture of Earth from space, Ms. Koerner joked, ''Now, I'm sure if Vice President Al Gore were here, he'd be able to tell us when, where and how this picture was taken.''</p>
        <p>LESS. NO, MORE. -- As one speaker after another scolded the industry for excessive advertising clutter, a few attendees promoted nontraditional venues for advertising. That plain white Chinese food takeout box could be bearing a logo sometime soon. Same goes for paper coffee cups and dry cleaning bags, many of which already do. Video ads are appearing more in elevators, particularly in hotels and office buildings.</p>
        <p>The challenge for the start-ups pitching these products is to move past mom-and-pop Chinese restaurants and persuade large companies to accept advertising.</p>
        <p>Joyce Shulman, a co-founder of Mangia Media, which sells advertising on pizza boxes, said that the largest companies were generally unwilling to give up their coveted white space.</p>
        <p>''I talked to a marketing manager from Domino's last year, and he said they consider it the most valuable real estate to promote their own brands,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Gregory Browne, the director of operations for PromoMedia Concepts, recommended placing ads on takeout boxes, paper pharmacy bags and coffee cups, but also warned that many big-name franchises would not be interested in promoting other brands.</p>
        <p>''We're never going to be in a Starbucks, and we're never going to be in a Dunkin' Donuts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>GRIN AND BEAR IT -- After a six-year joint research project, Nielsen Media Research announced Wednesday that it would not form a joint venture with Arbitron to use Arbitron's cellphone-size Personal People Meters for consumer research.</p>
        <p>In the packed exhibit hall on Thursday, the Arbitron executives in the company booth were putting on a happy face about the decision.</p>
        <p>''We knew all along that they might say no,'' said Thom Mocarsky, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>At that moment, Susan D. Whiting, chief executive of Nielsen Media Research, walked past the booth and exchanged a polite greeting with Mr. Mocarsky. ''See, I told you we aren't mad,'' Mr. Mocarsky said after she walked away.</p>
        <p>DO AS I SAY -- Attention, aspiring Barry Dillers: you may have missed your chance at a free tutorial. In a panel discussion called ''How to Be a Media Mogul,'' a group of media bosses debated the secrets to success, which usually came down to a modified version of ''the customer is always right.'' In other words, focus on the consumer.</p>
        <p>And in a nod to ''new media,'' which is not exactly new anymore, Arianna Huffington joined the panel, which also included Mark P. Mays of Clear Channel Communications, Cathleen Black of Hearst Magazines and Stephen B. Burke of Comcast. Ms. Huffington, the conservative-turned-liberal-turned-blogger, said there was one way to figure out if someone qualified as a mogul.</p>
        <p>''Did you arrive in Orlando on a private plane?'' Ms. Huffington purred, Zsa Zsa-like.</p>
        <p>(For the record, Ms. Huffington said she flew commercial to Orlando that morning.)</p>
        <p>WHAT IS THE DEMOGRAPHIC DOING? -- Despite all the talk about staying up-to-speed with consumer behavior, there are still quite a few media executives who do not know the difference between, say, MySpace and YouTube. The proof came on Friday when a speaker polled the audience with this question: ''Raise your hand if you've seen the 'Saturday Night Live' viral video 'Lazy Sunday.' ''</p>
        <p>Out of a group of many hundreds, three or four hands went up.</p>
        <p>Jason Hirschhorn, the chief digital officer for MTV Networks, was unimpressed. ''I would say that the amount of people who didn't see the 'Saturday Night Live' skit is scary, considering that you guys are responsible for media buying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>SEARCHING FOR ACCESS -- Beyond the red nylon swag bags stamped with logos and the frosted cookies that read ''Time Warner Global Marketing,'' one freebie won the popularity contest: Google sponsored six computer terminals with high-speed Internet connections. Because there was no free wireless signal in the conference center, the competition for the Google computers was fierce.</p>
        <p>Many at the conference seemed unfazed, since advertising people rarely go without BlackBerries. But for the less fortunate, the line often stretched uncomfortably long.</p>
        <p>''Couldn't they get more than a few computers?'' one woman in line grumbled. ''It's Google.''</p>
