        <p>The United States emerged from the Earth Summit last year in Rio de Janeiro, in the view of many delegates who attended, not as global leader on the environment but rather as global foot-dragger. Today, exactly a year after the meeting adjourned, Vice President Al Gore told a new United Nations commission charged with carrying on the gathering's work that those days are over.</p>
        <p>At Rio, nearly 180 nations committed themselves to policies that would enable them to develop their economies while preserving the environment and the renewable natural resources on which future prosperity depends -- "sustainable development," it was called. They also put together a broad blueprint, called Agenda 21, for arresting environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>"If there is any doubt about the support of the United States for that commitment, let me lay it to rest right here and now," Mr. Gore told representatives to the first substantive meeting of the 53-nation Commission on Sustainable Development, created by the United Nations General Assembly to translate the Rio accords into action. "This administration not only supports that commitment," Mr. Gore said, "we intend to join with all those determined to demonstrate real leadership." New Presidential Panel</p>
        <p>In one of a series of new actions and positions taken by the Clinton Administration on the international environmental front, Mr. Gore told the delegates that the United States was creating a 25-member President's Council on Sustainable Development to create new approaches for combining economic development with environmental protection at home.</p>
        <p>One of its functions will be to come up with a plan for the nation's role in fulfilling the Rio accords. President Clinton formally established the council this afternoon. Its members are to come from government, industry and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>The 12-day meeting here is "an opportunity for us to publicly resume the leadership that the world expects of us," said Timothy E. Wirth, a former Senator who is counselor to the State Department and is scheduled to become Under Secretary for Global Affairs. Recent Administration actions make it clear, Mr. Wirth said, that "we have sharply changed U.S. policy."</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Clinton announced that the United States would go beyond the Bush policy on global warming by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Bush Administration had rejected this timetable, advocated by the Europeans, and insisted that weaker provisions be included in a treaty negotiated before Rio but signed there. Treaty to Rescue Species</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton announced that the United States would sign a treaty, signed by more than 150 other countries in Rio, and also negotiated in advance, to protect the world's dwindling stock of living species. In an action that perhaps more than anything else contributed to the Bush Administration's obstructionist image, the United States had been alone among large countries in refusing to sign the accord. The biodiversity treaty, as it is called, was signed here on June 4 by Madeleine Albright, the American representative to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>In April, the United States also overturned another Bush policy by declaring itself open to a broadening of an agreement to protect tropical forests exploited in the international timber trade. Developing countries, where the tropical forests are situated, want the agreement expanded to include forests in temperate countries as well. The tropical countries have protested that the existing agreement discriminates against them by excluding temperate forests.</p>
        <p>In early May, Mr. Wirth announced here that the United States, again reversing the Bush and Reagan positions, would put control of the exploding world population high on its agenda and would increase foreign aid for population programs. At the same meeting, Mr. Wirth acknowledged that the consumption patterns of industrial countries like the United States contributed disproportionately to the degradation of the global environment, a view fervently held by developing countries but minimized by the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore today re-emphasized the industrialized countries' impact on the environment, declaring that "a child born in the United States will have, in his or her lifetime, 30 times more impact on the earth's environment than a child born in India." He asserted that "the affluent of the world have a responsibility to deal with their disproportionate impact."</p>
        <p>In late May, the Clinton Administration held out another olive branch to the developing countries in Beijing at a meeting of delegates to the Global Environmental Facility. This is a relatively new organization created by the World Bank and the United Nations to channel money from rich countries to poor ones for environmental projects.</p>
        <p>Developing countries have feared that they would have little say over the financing; that the industrialized countries would call the tune through the World Bank. At Beijing, the United States supported a move for more independence from the World Bank and more democratic governance of the global environmental fund, to the delight of both Southern countries and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration is also seeking to redirect some of its foreign aid toward sustainable development projects and is lobbying the World Bank toward the same end.</p>
        <p>The United States "is extending a friendly hand for the first time in a long time to the developing world," said Liz Barratt-Brown, a specialist in global environmental affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy organization. "Clearly," she said, "the U.S. is the key to resolving all these issues."</p>
        <p>But while "the rhetoric is great in these international forums" Ms. Barratt-Brown said, the Administration must still back up its aspirations for renewed leadership with concrete actions to fulfill its own environmental responsibilities. What is important she said, "is what's going to happen on the ground" in the United States.</p>
        <p>One of the first indications of this is to come in August, when the Administration presents its detailed plan for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels. U.S. as a Bridge</p>
        <p>The new opening to what used to be called the third world is deliberate.  "We can be the bridge" between the rest of the industrialized world and the developing countries, said a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I would hope we would see more of that" at the New York meeting.</p>
        <p>As the Earth Summit adjourned last year, delegates recognized that its goal of sustainable development and improved environmental protection would not be achieved quickly.  Still, the rich industrialized countries of the North and the poor developing countries of the South struck a bargain in which the North pledged financial and technological aid to the South in a mutual effort to achieve sustainable development. And there was a general feeling that with the cold war over, the environment had joined economics and military security at the top of the international agenda.</p>
        <p>But in the last 12 months, the global recession and the emergence of regional conflicts like that in the Balkans have eclipsed the environment as an object of international attention. In this climate, some diplomats expressed modest expectations for what the Commission on Sustainable Development might accomplish in its first meeting.</p>
        <p>The meeting is nevertheless expected to tell much about whether the fragile bargain struck at Rio between Northern countries anxious about the global environment and Southern countries jealous of their right to develop as they see fit will hold together, and whether the work of Rio will be carried forward in any tangible way.</p>
        <p>Not least of the underlying issues is a fear among developing countries that the Commission on Sustainable Development might become a watchdog that could make financial aid conditional on a country's environmental policies. At the same time, some environmentalists and industrialized countries want greater assurance that money and technology given Southern countries to promote sustainable development is actually used for that purpose. Lack of Enforcement Power</p>
        <p>The commission has no power to enforce anything. It will reach decisions by consensus and rely on publicity and international pressure to make countries keep their promises under Agenda 21. The climate and biodiversity treaties are legally binding and have their own governing organizations.</p>
        <p>Razali Ismail, the Malaysian representative to the United Nations, who is the commission's chairman, said that if the issues of finance and technology transfer could be addressed at the New York meeting without "negativism," it would be "a major accomplishment."</p>
        <p>The critical issues of financing, technology transfer and reporting of progress by individual countries will be considered by the commission at annual meetings. The question of reporting is sensitive because of some countries' fears that environmental progress will outweigh financial considerations in dispensing aid. Specific issues dealt with in Agenda 21 -- from water quality to desertification, forests and species protection, to the atmosphere and oceans to toxic chemicals -- will be taken up once every three years.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have suggested that the new commission might go far toward establishing its credibility by dealing with a hugely important but noncontroversial issue: water quality and supply throughout the world. This is an especially critical matter in developing countries, where contaminated water is the norm and millions of people die every year as a result.</p>
