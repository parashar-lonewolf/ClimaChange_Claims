        <p>LEAD: The Senate has passed legislation intended to foster use of alternative motor fuels to reduce dependency on foreign petroleum and tap vast American supplies of coal, natural gas and grain.</p>
        <p>The Senate has passed legislation intended to foster use of alternative motor fuels to reduce dependency on foreign petroleum and tap vast American supplies of coal, natural gas and grain.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by a voice vote Friday over warnings by Republicans on the Environment Committee that it could lead to increased emissions of the gases that some scientists say are overheating the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The Senate action all but insures that Congress will pass legislation on alternative fuels in 1988. A similar proposal was passed overwhelmingly by the House earlier this year. The bills' differences will have to be resolved by negotiators from both chambers.</p>
        <p>Both proposals are geared to encouraging the automobile industry to produce vehicles that can operate on fuels like methanol, ethanol and compressed natural gas.</p>
        <p>Methanol, which powers Indianapolis 500 race cars at 200 miles an hour, can be produced from coal or natural gas. Ethanol is made from grains. The legislation has broad support of lawmakers from coal and agricultural states.</p>
        <p>The proposals would break an impasse that now prevents any widespread switchover from gasoline to alternative fuels, according to Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, a principal sponsor along with Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a West Virginia Democrat. Boon to Coal Miners</p>
        <p>''Auto makers are unwilling to produce cars for which there is no current demand,'' Senator Danforth said. ''Consumers are unwilling to purchase cars for which there is no readily available fuel supply, and service stations are unwilling to provide fuel for cars that are not on the road.''</p>
        <p>Senator Rockefeller said that converting 10 percent of the motor vehicles in the United States to the use of coal-based methanol would not only reduce the need for imported oil but also make jobs for 20,000 coal miners.</p>
        <p>The sponsors said the legislation would encourage auto makers to mass-produce vehicles that use alternative fuels by making it easier for them to meet the Federal requirement that the average fuel economy of the vehicles they produce is at least 26 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>Under the bill's formula, a vehicle that gets 25 miles a gallon would be given a rating of 165 miles per gallon if it uses a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline, Senator Danforth said. The same vehicle using a 50-50 blend would be rated at 40 miles a gallon, he said.</p>
        <p>The higher credits for alternative fuels would begin with the 1993 model year.</p>
        <p>The argument by Senators Danforth and Rockefeller that methanol and ethanol would cause fewer environmental and health problems than gasoline was disputed by two members of the environment committee, Senator Robert T. Stafford, Republican of Vermont, and John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island. Warning on Emissions</p>
        <p>Senator Stafford said coal-derived methanol would double emissions of carbon dioxide and bring a tenfold increase in tailpipe emissions of formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical.</p>
        <p>He urged the Senate to proceed cautiously because many scientists warn that the production of gases like carbon dioxide is trapping the earth's heat and threatening major climatic changes.</p>
        <p>''Once we commit to a program like this, it will be too late,'' said Senator Stafford, who unsuccessfully tried to add amendments to require alternative vehicles to meet the same emissions standards as gasoline vehicles.</p>
        <p>Senator Chafee succeeded in adding language putting the Senate on record as saying that coal-based methanol would boost carbon dioxide levels, contribute to global overheating and should not be used until emissions controls are developed to control carbon dioxide.</p>
