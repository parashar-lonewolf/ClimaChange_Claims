        <p>Earthen mounds at an ancient American Indian site in Louisiana have been found to be the earliest known remnants of human construction in the New World. The discovery challenges traditional ideas about early American cultures and suggests that pre-agriculture, pre-ceramic hunting societies were more socially complex than previously thought.</p>
        <p>The mounds, begun about 5,400 years ago, predate other similar public architecture at Indian sites by nearly 2,000 years, archeologists said in a report being published today in the journal Science.</p>
        <p>The new findings could transform thinking about the progression of economic and social development in ancient societies, especially about the nature and abilities of bands of hunter-gatherers who once inhabited the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys. They show that agriculture, permanent settlements or wealth from trade were not necessary conditions for the mobilization of labor for ambitious construction projects.</p>
        <p>''It's a rare and wonderful case where one piece of research fundamentally changes our whole picture of early American life,'' said Dr. Vincas Steponaitis, an archeologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is president of the Society of American Archaeology and an authority on Indian mounds.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bruce D. Smith, an archeologist and specialist in early American agriculture at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, also praised the research. ''It's a surprising find, this early date,'' he said. ''But it makes a lot of sense.''</p>
        <p>The investigation of the mounds at a site known as Watson Brake near present-day Monroe -- a city of about 55,000 people in northern Louisiana, 100 miles east of Shreveport -- was conducted by a team of archeologists and other scientists led by Dr. Joe W. Saunders, a professor of geosciences at Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe.</p>
        <p>The existence of the mounds, whose purpose is not known, was first brought to the attention of archeologists in the 1970's by Reca Bamburg Jones, who lives on a nearby farm.</p>
        <p>In their journal report the scientists described Watson Brake, in the flood plain of the Ouachita River, as the place where hunter-gatherers apparently returned each spring and summer to feast on the fish and mussels in the river, the turkey, deer and raccoon in the woods and the edible plants, many of which would later be among the first domesticated plants in eastern North America. The site was full of animal and fish bones and the seeds of goosefoot, marsh elder and other plants, the scientists said.</p>
        <p>Even though the people did not settle permanently at the site, they left a permanent mark there: the mounds. The 11 mounds and connecting ridges form an oval-shaped earthen enclosure about 900 feet in diameter. The largest of the dome-shaped mounds is 25 feet high; the others are less than 15 feet high, and the connecting ridges are no more than 3 feet high.</p>
        <p>Charcoal and decaying vegetation in the soil were analyzed in several different dating tests, at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Washington in Seattle. From these tests it was determined that the mounds were built from 5,400 to 5,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Previously, the earliest known mounds were those at Poverty Point, also in Louisiana, which were built 3,500 years ago. Among the best known and most impressive mounds were those erected in more recent times by Indians known as the Hopewell culture, from 100 B.C. to approximately A.D. 400 or 500, and the Mississippian culture, from A.D. 1000 to 1500. Thousands of these sites are scattered through much of the Eastern United States.</p>
        <p>But nothing about the new findings explains the purpose of the mounds, one of the nagging mysteries in American archeology. Did they have religious significance or a ceremonial function?</p>
        <p>No human burials have been uncovered at Watson Brake or many other sites. People may have lived on top of the lower mounds, but not the higher ones. Perhaps, Dr. Smith of the Smithsonian said, mounds were ways for a hunting people to define their territory or celebrate themselves.</p>
        <p>In a separate article in Science, Dr. Saunders observed, ''I know it sounds awfully Zen-like, but maybe the answer is that building them was the purpose.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Saunders said in a telephone interview that he was just as surprised as others that the Watson Brake mounds were ''so large, so complex and so early,'' and added, ''We generally had believed that mobile hunting and gathering people  would not have the capability to plan and organize such construction.''</p>
        <p>For a long time, archeologists assumed that mound building was linked to agriculture, and most of the sites were, indeed, from periods after the Indians had begun to cultivate crops. The people at Poverty Point were not yet farmers, but showed signs of thriving from extensive trading networks.</p>
        <p>Such thinking stemmed from the conventional view that societies emerged from the hunter-gatherer stage by settling in permanent villages and domesticating plants and animals. And, as they thus gained wealth and surplus food, they could afford to devote time and labor to monumental architecture. Also, with agriculture and a settled life presumably came more complex social and political structures, including the leadership skills and organization to undertake such engineering projects as mound building.</p>
        <p>Or, as Dr. Steponaitis remarked: ''Mounds are, in effect, fossilized labor. They are the remains that mean that some social mechanisms were in place in a hunter-gatherer society that made it possible to mobilize labor on a large scale.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Smith said the findings at Watson Brake seemed to support an emerging concept in which climate change that occurred in the eastern part of North America 7,000 to 5,000 years ago made the river valleys richer sources of food, which mobile hunter-gatherers returned to seasonally, and thus began a gradual transition to a more sedentary life.</p>
        <p>Several archeologists said the existence of elaborate mounds at Poverty Point and Watson Brake showed that the early Indian cultures in what is now the United States were probably developing independently of societies in Mexico and Central America. Mound building appears to have been widespread in the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys long before there is evidence of it in Mexico.</p>
