        <p>DURING a heavy snowstorm in March 1990, Fred Richter, a Forest Service supervisor, sought refuge in a remote cabin on Mammoth Mountain, a popular recreational area in the Sierra Nevada range in California. He had used the cabin before as a place to eat lunch, dry out his equipment and rest before skiing on to various sites in the back country.</p>
        <p>As usual, Mr. Richter climbed a ladder to get into the cabin, which was buried in snow. He swung himself through an opening near the roof and climbed down an interior ladder.  But something was terribly wrong. "I couldn't catch my breath," he recalled in a recent interview. "My pulse was going up, to 190 or 200. I started seeing stars."</p>

        <p>DURING a heavy snowstorm in March 1990, Fred Richter, a Forest Service supervisor, sought refuge in a remote cabin on Mammoth Mountain, a popular recreational area in the Sierra Nevada range in California. He had used the cabin before as a place to eat lunch, dry out his equipment and rest before skiing on to various sites in the back country.</p>
        <p>As usual, Mr. Richter climbed a ladder to get into the cabin, which was buried in snow. He swung himself through an opening near the roof and climbed down an interior ladder.  But something was terribly wrong. "I couldn't catch my breath," he recalled in a recent interview. "My pulse was going up, to 190 or 200. I started seeing stars."</p>
        <p>Staggering back up the ladder, Mr. Richter blanked out a couple of times. "I couldn't climb out the door but managed to throw myself across the threshold," he said. "I hung there for about five minutes, my feet dangling inside, my arms  dangling outside, breathing just about as hard as I could."</p>
        <p>Four years passed before anyone could make sense of this frightening episode. And then Mr. Richter learned, to his astonishment, that he had nearly been killed by a volcano -- specifically, by carbon dioxide seeping out of a volcano  that lay hidden underground. High concentrations of the odorless gas had accumulated inside the cabin. A few more whiffs and he would have died.</p>
        <p>"It took us awhile to figure out what was happening," said Dr. David Hill, a  seismologist at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. Mammoth Mountain is a young volcano on the edge of a caldera -- the basin of a much older volcano, depressed and underground -- that stretches 18 miles to the east, he said. Called Long Valley, this rather flat-looking volcanic system  has been geologically active for four million years. Its last eruption was 250 years ago.</p>
        <p>Today Long Valley is the most active volcano in the continental United States, Dr. Hill said. Since 1980, it has produced nearly continuous swarms of earthquakes. A dome of hot magma is rising. The land in the center of the caldera has risen two feet.</p>
        <p>In 1989, the region was struck by several earthquakes of magnitude 6, Dr. Hill said, which set into motion a phenomenon that is entirely new to the world  of seismology. Somehow, in ways not yet understood, those earthquakes led to the release of cold carbon dioxide gas. Up to 1,200 tons a day are seeping out the flanks of Mammoth Mountain.</p>
        <p>Other volcanoes spew gases, including carbon dioxide, Dr. Hill said.  But the gas is always hot and is usually mixed with sulfur and other smelly compounds.</p>
        <p>The pure, cold, odorless gas coming out of Mammoth Mountain has killed more than 100 acres of trees, said Dr. Michael Sorey, a hydrologist at the Geological Survey who is measuring gas-flow rates. While tree leaves like carbon dioxide, he said, the tree roots need oxygen. Like humans, trees are asphyxiated by high  levels of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Gas levels are extremely high in the areas where trees have died, Dr. Sorey said. Most soils contain less than 1 percent carbon dioxide. On parts of Mammoth Mountain, soil gases are 25 to 90 percent carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>In the cabin where Mr. Richter nearly died, scientists estimate, the gas had  reached concentrations of 30 percent. Since carbon dioxide is heavier than air,  it settled near the floor and remained trapped by an insulation of snow.</p>
        <p>All this activity -- trees dying off, magma moving underground, swarms of quakes -- presents a dilemma for scientists and public officials, Dr. Hill said. On the one hand, there is some risk that the volcano could erupt. But on the other hand, he said, "we don't want to scare people."</p>
        <p>"It might not erupt," he said. "What words should we use in communicating this to the public?"</p>
        <p>The Geological Survey issues so-called status reports on volcanic risks. Levels C, D and E indicate increased seismic activity in a region. The levels change frequently; D's and E's are commonplace, and C's are called a few days a  year. Levels A and B, which have never been reached, are called volcano alerts or watches.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the news media routinely ignore the distinction between status reports and volcano alerts, said Glenn Thompson, the city manager of Mammoth Lakes, the area's main resort town. Low-level activity is often reported as an imminent threat to life and limb, he said.</p>
        <p>While city officials wrestle with this problem, the Forest Service has had to determine if hikers, campers, anglers or skiers are in any danger from the carbon dioxide, Mr. Richter said. Monitoring devices are routinely placed in tents, campsite lavatories and underground utility vaults, he said.</p>
        <p>Thus far, there is no cause for alarm, Mr. Richter said. The carbon dioxide,  even at high concentrations, quickly blows away from the surface of the ground.  It only collects in low-lying areas, like underground vaults or snowbound cabins.</p>
        <p>Of course, burrowing animals are probably in mortal danger, Mr. Richter said. In areas where trees are dead or dying, there is no sign of animal or insect life.</p>
        <p>Trees are continuing to die on Mammoth Mountain, Dr. Sorey said.  The fact that the gas flow has lasted this long suggests that it may be coming from a very large, deep source of magma or that a large reservoir of high-pressure gas  was set loose by the 1989 earthquakes, he said.</p>
