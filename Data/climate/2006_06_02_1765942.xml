        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day-care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ANNULLA' Eileen De Felitta is charming in Emily Mann's worthy one-woman play about a Jewish woman who passed for Aryan in Nazi Germany, but too much time is devoted to less intriguing aspects of the character's life (1:20). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>* 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!'  This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'MARATHON 2006' David Ives's haunting suspense tale ''The Other Woman'' highlights the first batch of short plays in the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual marathon of one-acts. A master of the comic short play, Mr. Ives channels his inner Rod Serling here, creating an eerie theatrical nocturne starring Ruthie Henshall and Scott Cohen, and directed with delicacy by Walter Bobbie. Two other fine two-handers, by Amy Fox and Anton Dudley, are also on the bill (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TROUT STANLEY' Claudia Dey's hysterically funny, deliciously lyrical piece of Canadian Gothic is about strange 30-year-old twin sisters and the mysterious man who arrives, D. H. Lawrence style, to upset the household's delicate balance (1:50). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30) T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)</p>
        <p>'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'HERAKLES VIA PHAEDRA' Making her annual excursion into Greek myth and history, Ellen Stewart presents the labors of Herakles and the tragedies of Theseus with an exhilarating, rough-hewn mix of flamenco, wildly beautiful puppets, acrobatic combat between men and magical beasts and a classical South Indian dance performed with a live snake (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Miriam Horn)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'I WILL COME LIKE A THIEF' The writer Trish Harnetiaux and the director Jude Domski have together created the potent outline of a parable about passive if still jittery Americans awash in government gobbledygook after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. But there is a staginess to their random characters that is hard to overcome, and ultimately the play, set in an American city being evacuated, does not live up to its promise (1:15). The 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE RACE' Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in this brisk trot through nine months of anxiety. Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. Occasionally the inventive imagery stalls, and the show seems to run out of imaginative breath, but it provides enough small-scale wizardry to please fans of physical theater (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday.

        <p>'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and essential movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in ''Cavite,'' a gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with handheld cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh employs both clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>ROBERT ALTMAN (Through Thursday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work concludes on Thursday with a screening of his newest ensemble comedy, ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' followed by a discussion with Mr. Altman. Directors Guild Theater, 110 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (718) 784-4520; $24. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>B-NOIR (Through June 15) Film Forum's six-week festival of 70 low-budget American thrillers from the 1940's and 50's continues this weekend with two double features. Today and Saturday, the features are ''Thieves' Highway'' (1949), about a truck driver avenging an attack on his father, and ''The Sleeping City'' (1950), about a shooting at Bellevue Hospital. The double feature for Sunday and Monday is ''Side Street'' (1949), the story of a struggling postal employee who steals $30,000, and ''Mystery Street'' (1950), which revolves around a skeleton on a Massachusetts beach. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through June 11) This ninth annual festival opens tonight at the Brooklyn Museum with Libero De Rienzo's ''Blood, Death Does Not Exist'' (2005), a day in the life of an aspiring ballerina and her overdependent, drug-dealing brother. Cantor Auditorium, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Washington Avenue, (718) 388-4306; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA  (Through June 9) This weekend the Film Society of Lincoln Center's tribute to contemporary Italian filmmakers includes Massimo Andrei's debut feature, ''Mater Natura'' (2005), the story of a Neapolitan transsexual in love with a car-wash owner; Giacomo Martelli's espionage thriller ''The Listening'' (2006), about eavesdropping technology; and Carlo Verdone's comedy ''My Best Enemy'' (2006), about a man who has it all and messes it up. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>TOMORROWLAND: CAL ARTS IN MOVING PICTURES (Through Aug. 13) The Museum of Modern Art is sponsoring a three-decade survey of films and videos by former students at the California Institute of the Arts. Tomorrow night's program, ''The (Post) Studio Artists'' is a collection of six 1970's shorts, including Chris Langdon and Fred Worden's ''Now, You Can Do Anything,'' set on a Malibu beach. On Wednesday night the program is student films whose creators went on to make their reputations at Pixar. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films continues at the Museum of Modern Art. This weekend's features include a Dutch silent, ''The Living Ladder'' (1913), about acrobats, a burning windmill and a damsel in distress; and Fritz Lang's German Expressionist masterpiece ''M'' (1931), starring Peter Lorre as a serial killer. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni begins on Wednesday with a weeklong run of his biggest commercial success, ''Blow-Up'' (1966). Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings star in the film, set squarely in swinging 60's London (the music! the fashions!), which tells the story of a fashion photographer who might have accidentally documented a murder. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>AVION TRAVEL (Tomorrow) The breezily romantic band Avion Travel is one of the jewels of the Italian music scene, playing a sophisticated mixture of French-Italian cabaret and Brazilian baião; the group stunned Italy six years ago by winning at Sanremo, a big pop festival not known for its sophisticated tastes. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>BARDO POND (Thursday) Bardo Pond, from Philadelphia, specializes in heavy, cyclical songs, letting big, dusty guitar riffs come round again and again. With Holy Ghost and the Winter Pageant. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh)</p>
        <p>BOUNCING SOULS (Tonight through Tuesday) The punk kings of New Jersey, Bouncing Souls have been going strong for nearly two decades, with no signs of slowing down: their new album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. They finish up a sold-out run at the Knitting Factory with lots of guests: Blanks 77 (tonight), Paint It Black (tomorrow), Sticks and Stones (Sunday), the Slackers (Monday) and the Explosion (Tuesday). At 6:30 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JAMES BROWN (Thursday) He is the godfather of much more than soul: as the chief architect of funk, James Brown is one of the most influential figures in popular music since Louis Armstrong. He's a great dancer, too. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROY CARRIER AND THE NITE ROCKERS (Tomorrow) Mr. Carrier, an old-fashioned zydeco accordionist, takes a break from his club in Lawtell, La., to lead his band for a Southern Louisiana dance party in Times Square. At 8:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 7:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597; $22. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>COCOROSIE (Tonight) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of girlish daydreams, hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. With Spleen and Nomi. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DICK DALE (Sunday) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>DAVID (HONEYBOY) EDWARDS, ROBERT LOCKWOOD JR. (Wednesday) These veteran Delta bluesmen, both born in 1915, boast close connections to the fabled Robert Johnson: Mr. Edwards played with him in the 1930's, and Mr. Lockwood learned some of his songs directly from the master. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE FABULOUS SOUL SHAKERS (Tonight) Sort of an oldies Backstreet Boys, the Fabulous Soul Shakers are five talented young men -- each has won or been a finalist at Apollo Theater showcases -- assembled to perform letter-perfect renditions of doo-wop and soul from the 1950's and 60's. At 8:30, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* THE FALL (Tonight) Nearly 30 years ago, with jagged, jabby guitars and the tuneless slur of its leader and propagandist, Mark E. Smith, this British band laid out a reductionist ''three R's'' of pop: ''Repetition, repetition, repetition.'' Umpteen albums later, the Fall is a cornerstone of postpunk, and Mr. Smith still finds ways to make repetition sound new. With the Cairo Gang. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) The annual mega-concerts presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) are always among the biggest live hip-hop events in the country, a status derived as much from the long roster of stars as from the sparks that sometimes fly among them. This year features Mary J. Blige, Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes, Sean Paul, Three 6 Mafia, Chris Brown, T. I., Ne-Yo, Jermaine Dupri and Dem Franchize Boyz. At 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $35 to $160. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MASON JENNINGS, TEDDY THOMPSON (Thursday) Heavy-lidded confessions by young men holding acoustic guitars can sometimes go the way of empty bromides, as they do in the songs of Mason Jennings (''Be here now/No other place to be''). Teddy Thompson fares better: the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks: ''This is a party,'' Mr. Thompson groans, ''no frowns allowed.'' At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOAN JETT (Monday through Thursday) Joan Jett has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive. Promoting a new album, ''Sinner'' (Blackheart Records), she makes a sweep through the clubs of New York. Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $20. Wednesday at 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; sold out. Thursday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LITTLE RICHARD (Tomorrow) He may always be most celebrated for bringing scat to rock (''A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boom!''), but Little Richard's delirious falsetto ''oooh!'' and androgynous showmanship have influenced everybody from Paul McCartney to Prince. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $47 and $57. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LONGWAVE (Tonight) This New York band ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb. With Pela and English Department. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m., the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PEARL JAM (Tomorrow) Sounding limber and energized on its new, self-titled album -- oh why did it take Pearl Jam so long to find those thunderbolt AC/DC riffs? -- the alt-rock road warriors head out once again. With My Morning Jacket, a band from Louisville, Ky., with a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PEARLS AND BRASS (Wednesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and early Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, from Nazareth, Pa., worships studiously at their altar. With Nudity and Endless Boogie. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $7. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LINDA RONSTADT (Tonight) Ms. Ronstadt's pleasurable, circuitous route through pop, having already covered everything from Queen's ''We Will Rock You'' to mariachi, next turns, on her coming album ''Adieu False Heart'' (Vanguard), to ''Walk Away Renee,'' the Left Banke's 1966 nugget of baroque psychedelia, as well as songs by Richard Thompson, Julie Miller and Bill Monroe. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $33.50 to $128.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS (Wednesday) This long-running three-piece from North Carolina knows just how much to poke fun at chicken-fried, backwoods rockabilly: a lot, but not too much to get in the way of some finger-licking twangy guitar. Don't let the band leave without playing its barnstorming ode to Santo, the vigilante Mexican wrestler. With the Demolition String Band. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE STILLS (Tonight) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its new album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Rogue Wave. At 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* SUPER FURRY ANIMALS (Tonight) The Welsh band Super Furry Animals plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys' melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country. This show, with Dead Meadow as the opening act, begins the modest but essential summer series at the South Street Seaport, as part of the River to River Festival. At 7 p.m., Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* TAPES 'N TAPES (Sunday and Tuesday) A few months ago this Minneapolis band, playing dry, indie-pop rhapsodies recalling Pavement and the early Pixies, was little known. Then came a big Internet buzz courtesy of bloggers and the tastemaking Web site Pitchfork. But the group also found success in a comfortingly old-fashioned way, by blowing everybody away at the South by Southwest festival in March; within a month the group had a deal with XL Recordings and a busy tour schedule, including these two sold-out dates. With Figurines and Cold War Kids. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Tralala, Human Television and Tiny Amps. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>WOLFMOTHER (Tomorrow) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960's garage rock (the fingernails-on-blackboard yelp at the beginning of the band's debut album will bring a smile to any fan of the Sonics, who sang ''Psycho'' and other garage classics), and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Deadboy and the Elephantmen. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

        <p>ANDREA MARCOVICCI (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Marcovicci's new show, ''Just Love  by Request'' is a kind of living room musicale that's one-half pre-set and one-half determined by audience suggestions. The singer's charm rules this unruly format. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $60 cover Tuesday through Thursday, $65 tonight and tomorrow; $60 prix fixe dinner required for 9 p.m. shows; otherwise, a $20 minimum.

        <p>RON BLAKE AND MICHAEL CAIN (Tonight) Mr. Blake, a soulful tenor and soprano saxophonist, and Mr. Cain, an adventurous yet sensitive pianist, engage in a duologue that's likely to be exploratory as well as introspective.

        <p>THEO BLECKMANN AND FUMIO YASUDA (Tonight) On the recent album ''Las Vegas Rhapsody: The Night They Invented Champagne'' (Winter &amp; Winter), Mr. Bleckmann applied his protean, otherworldly vocal style to a repertory of show tunes imaginatively arranged by Mr. Yasuda. The two artists re-enact their crushed-velvet collaboration here, with a string quartet led by the violinist Todd Reynolds. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover, $15, with a two-drink or $12 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>DOMINIQUE EADE (Tonight) Ms. Eade weighs a chanteuse's coolness against a jazz musician's exploratory instincts, unquestionably earning the right to a dialogue with players like the guitarist Brad Shepik and the bassist Tony Scherr. At 9, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DOWNTOWN MUSIC GALLERY 15TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW (Tonight) As a retail hub, community outpost and ersatz performance space, Downtown Music Gallery has long been an anchor of the experimental jazz and improvised music scene. The ensembles participating in this anniversary show are appropriate: New Ghost, consisting of Elliott Levin on reeds and vocals, and Rick Iannacone on guitar; John Zorn, in a setting of his choosing; and Tisziji Munoz, a guitarist with a rather obscure lineage in the avant-garde. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>ARI HOENIG AND CHRIS POTTER (Wednesday) Mr. Hoenig, a drummer, and Mr. Potter, a saxophonist, are two of the sharpest musicians in modern post-bop circles, and their exchange here should be a thing of intensity and poise.

        <p>JOE LOCKE-GEOFFREY KEEZER QUARTET (Tuesday through June 11) Precision, intuition and flash are all musical traits shared by Mr. Locke, a vibraphonist, and Mr. Keezer, a pianist and keyboardist.

        <p>LIONEL LOUEKE (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Loueke, a guitarist and vocalist, favors a beguiling form of modern jazz informed by the music of his West African homeland, Benin. He plays an early set unaccompanied; his second set will feature the bassist Massimo Biolcati and the drummer Ferenc Nemeth, who appear on his recent album ''Gilfema'' (Obliqsound). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SHOKO NAGAI'S EPHEMERAL (Wednesday) Playing piano, organ and sho, a bamboo pipe instrument, Ms. Nagai leads a five-piece ensemble in a new work inspired by premodern Japanese traditions, including Noh theater.

        <p>AKIKO PAVOLKA'S HOUSE OF ILLUSION (Sunday and Wednesday) As a singer and keyboardist, Ms. Pavolka specializes in a sleek and worldly aesthetic, as she demonstrates on her third album, ''Begin Again'' (Tone of a Pitch).

        <p>* GARY PEACOCK, PAUL MOTIAN, MARC COPLAND (Wednesday through June 10) Mr. Peacock, a bassist, and Mr. Motian, a drummer, have worked together in a handful of superb rhythm sections over the years, most famously with the pianist Keith Jarrett. Here they join another fine pianist, Mr. Copland, in a trio that promises to favor dark harmonic colors and rhythmic undulation. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BOBBY PREVITE'S STRIKE (Tonight) Mr. Previte, an adventurous and often effervescent drummer, teams up with musicians similarly inclined to pair aggressive experimentation with a rock-hard sense of groove: the saxophonists Briggan Krauss and David Binney and the keyboardist Marco Benevento. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel's guitar has a luminous tone that offsets the cerebral tinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. This ensemble, which also features the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Eric Harland, imbues its performances with a blend of shadowy introspection and combustible interplay. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DIANE SCHUUR AND SARA GAZAREK (Tuesday through June 11) Among jazz singers, Ms. Schuur is a survivor and a study in perseverance, if not exactly a musical role model. Ms. Gazarek, a fresh-faced newcomer, has already proven her ability to cast familiar songs in a new and well-considered light. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $40 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LOREN STILLMAN GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Stillman is a young alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz conventions, as he demonstrates on a pair of recent albums recorded at this time last year, and released on different European labels.

        <p>YELLOWJACKETS (Wednesday through June 11) This pace car of light-fusion bands recently observed its 25th anniversary with the release of a CD/DVD package that confirms the durability of its mildly funky formula, as well as of the considerable musicianship of its members: the saxophonist Bob Mintzer, the keyboardist Russell Ferrante, the bassist Jimmy Haslip and the drummer Marcus Baylor. At 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set next Friday and June 10, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $32.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>AMERICAN OPERA PROJECTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) This group's mandate is to help the development of new operas in a range of genres. Its ''First Glimpse'' series continues with readings of excerpts from works-in-progress by Tarik O'Regan, Stefania de Kenessey and Richard Wargo. At 8, South Oxford Space, 138 South Oxford Street, between Hanson Place and Atlantic Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 398-4024; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'FAUST' (Tonight through Sunday) The diminutive Amato Opera winds up its season with a brand-new production of Gounod's chestnut, with its usual rotating casts and exuberant conducting from the company's founder, Tony Amato. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'MÉDÉE' (Tomorrow) Many opera connoisseurs consider Cherubini's ''Médée'' from 1797 an elegant masterpiece, especially in its original French version. Beethoven ranked his Italian-born contemporary Cherubini as the greatest living composer of dramatic music. Still, the score awkwardly blends Cherubini's operatic sensibility with long stretches of spoken dialogue. In a concert performance tomorrow night at Carnegie Hall, Peter Tiboris, the general and artistic director of MidAmerica Productions, will try to give the opera new life by exaggerating its stylistic dichotomy. The roles will be sung in French by a roster of singers, but the spoken dialogue will be delivered in an English translation by the members of the Aquila Theater Company. Irini Tsirakidou will sing the title role. Mr. Tiboris will conduct the Manhattan Philharmonic. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $89. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'PAGLIACCI' (Wednesday and Thursday) Small opera companies are springing up at such a pace that it's getting difficult to tell them apart. The Chelsea Opera is doing its best to stand out by presenting Daniel Rodriguez, who burst onto the classical music and national-anthem scene in 2001 as ''the singing cop,'' in the title role of Leoncavallo's classic. At 8 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111; $25 at the door; $20 for students and 65+; $5 discount when purchased in advance. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This week and next at Bargemusic, the living-room-size converted coffee barge moored under the Brooklyn Bridge, the fare is drawn from the more intimate side of chamber music. Tonight, Dmitry Rachmanov, a fine pianist, plays an all-Schubert recital, with the ''Moments Musicaux'' (D. 780) and the Sonatas in A minor (D. 784) and D (D. 850). Tomorrow and Sunday Mr. Rachmanov will be joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov and the cellist Colin Carr for more Schubert, including the Sonatina for Violin and Piano (D. 384), the ''Arpeggione'' Sonata and the Piano Trio in B flat (D. 898). And on Thursday the cellist Adrian Daurov plays the first of two concerts devoted to all the Bach Cello Suites, this one including the first four of the six. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $20 for students. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* DA CAPO CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tuesday) Works written by Asian composers or influenced by Eastern philosophy are the subject of this concert. Included are ''Divergence'' by Huang Ruo, a particularly eloquent young Chinese composer, as well as Chinary Ung's ''Spiral VI''; Akemi Naito's ''Rain, Calling Autumn''; Evan Ziporyn's ''Tsmindao Ghmerto''; and Shirish Korde's ''Bandit Queen: Song Cycle on the Life of Phoolan Devi.'' The Korde work, a premiere, is the 100th score commissioned by the ensemble. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>SUMI JO (Tonight) During the early years of this Korean soprano's career, she received some helpful public support from Joan Sutherland, who knows a thing or two about what it takes to be a coloratura soprano. Since making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Gilda in ''Rigoletto,'' Ms. Jo has sung nearly 50 times with the company. But her last appearance was in 2000, and her career has drifted to Europe. A tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ms. Jo's professional debut, rather mawkishly titled ''Beautiful Challenge,'' comes to Carnegie Hall tonight, giving New Yorkers a fresh chance to assess the current state of Ms. Jo's artistry in works by Donizetti, Offenbach, Duman Cho and others. Will Crutchfield conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. At 8, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $90. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>MUSICA SACRA (Monday) The Romantic age is the focus of this well-known chorus's final concert of the season, and not all sacred, at that. Songs and romances by Brahms make up the bulk of the evening, with motets by Mendelssohn and Bruckner. At 7 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 868-4444; $15 to $75. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tomorrow) The Philharmonic and Lorin Maazel are in their adventurous mode, abetted by the French pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard. Music by Elliott Carter, Stravinsky and Berlioz. At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $28 to $94. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA OF THE AMERICAS (Thursday) Central to this showcase for Latin American music is Paul Desenne's Concerto for Double Bass, with the Berlin Philharmonic's young bassist Edicson Ruiz. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 to $45. (Holland)</p>
        <p>'REWIND' (Thursday) In its New York premiere, ''Rewind'' is less a concert than a continuous visual and sonic experience. The program spans five centuries of music, from Renaissance works to commissioned scores and spontaneously created acoustic and electronic pieces. But the selections will meld into one another, and ambient noise (conversations, crinkling paper) will be digitally sampled and folded into the sound space. The performers will be stationed in various parts of the Orensanz Center for the Arts, adding to the spatial and visual atmosphere. Some fine musicians are taking part, including the violinists Anne Akiko Meyers and Colin Jacobson, along with the Knights, a chamber orchestra, and the conductor Paul Haas, who conceived ''Rewind.'' This may be one concert where coughing not only does not matter but will also become a part of the piece. At 8 p.m., 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (516) 319-9307; $20 in advance; $25 at the door. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) New works often have a moment in the spotlight, at their premieres, and are then filed away. In its ''Second Helpings'' series, the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble takes another look at some of these. Among the pieces in the current installment are Michael Daugherty's ''High and Mighty'' and Joan Panetti's ''Instant Gathers.'' Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street. Sunday at 2 p.m., Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y.; (212) 594-6100; $15; $10 for students and members, and for 65+ on Sunday. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>SEQUITUR (Monday) A contemporary music ensemble devoted to the works of serious (and often youngish) composers, Sequitur this week presents pieces by Jorge Liderman, Ross Bauer, Steven Burke and Martin Matalon. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $15. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* WESTERN WIND (Sunday) This superb vocal ensemble offers a program by Salamone Rossi, a contemporary of Monteverdi best known for his Hebrew settings of psalms and Jewish liturgical works. At 3 p.m., Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 414-9419; $30; $20 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)</p>

        <p>CEDAR LAKE (Tonight through Sunday) This ''Dream Collaborations'' program attracted little attention when it was first performed in January.

        <p>4-ISH (Tonight through Sunday) This Dutch company presents ''4-ISH,'' a show that might be called hip-hop, but is really hip-hop-ish and involves many kinds of urban derring-do, including quarter pipes (as in skateboarding), kung fu, electrified skate wheels and a live D.J.

        <p>* TIFFANY MILLS COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Mills's new ''Godard'' tackles the familiar theme of human relationships, but the piece is set, intriguingly, to music by John Zorn inspired by the quirks of the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, and has video by Ela Troyano. The program also includes the much sparer new ''LandFall (Part 1).'' At 8 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200 or tiffanymillscompany.org; $15; $12, students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martín Santangelo, is settling into the intimate Theater 80, through July 30. At 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45 ($100 for opening night). (Rockwell)</p>

        <p>* ROD RODGERS DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Rodgers, who died in 2002, had a distinctive movement and choreographic style, and his dancers have managed to keep it alive through continuing the work of his East Village studio, which will be celebrated in the benefit that opens four-day performance series.

        <p>THREEWAY (Tonight through Sunday) Chill already. The three women choreographers who form the interestingly named group -- Colleen Dunagan, Erin Mitchell and Sue Hogan -- say the company title simply reflects their desire to form a dance project among Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City. At 8 p.m., Arts at University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (209) 602-3216; $15.(Dunning)</p>
        <p>URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tomorrow) The company brings its signature mix of powerful, sassy and decidedly female dance to a Brooklyn park for a performance jam inspired by a Yoruba proverb.

The show opens with a dance by local sixth graders. At 6 p.m., Coffey Park, Visitation Place between Dwight and Richards Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (212) 625-3505 or dancinginthestreets.org; free. (Kinetz)</p>
        <p>NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Thursday) Ms. Winthrop will present her multimedia ''That's Me -- I'm the One Lying Down Over There,'' set to music by Jon Gibson.

At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village (212)674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining.2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MET: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (See above.) (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.)(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through July 10. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Museum of the City of New York: Sherril Schell: 'Unknown Modernist,' through June 13. Though little known today, the photographer Sherril Schell (1877-1964) was critically recognized in the 1930's for his severely formalist photographs of New York architecture. This small exhibition presents 15 examples in which closely cropped views of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other monuments of Manhattan emphasize compositional order, structure, pattern, light and shadow. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. Museum of Arts &amp; Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>BASQUIAT and DUBUFFET: 'PERSONAL MEMORIES'  Nothing illuminates art like other art. And the pairing of two artists with similar appetites for drawing, collage, the grittiness of life and a bristling energy exudes a high-wattage electricity all its own. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, through June 17. (Smith)</p>
        <p>RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'The Drop' More than two dozen artists present multimedia conceptual creations about the global problem of water. In works ranging from densely informational to entertainingly visual, they address the pollution, increasing scarcity and private marketing of one of our planet's most necessary resources. Nancy Drew made 100 colorful paintings based on water bottle labels; Brandon Ballengée presents a pyramid of bottles containing preserved specimens of endangered marine life; and Christy Rupp's installation of five water coolers invites viewers to test the water of each of New York's five boroughs. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through June 10. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* Willem de Kooning: 'Paintings 1975-1978' Working with wide brushes, putty knives and other unidentifiable tools and methods, de Kooning improvised with abandon and to beautiful effect in these 13 paintings from the 70's. L &amp; M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Joe FiG With extraordinary skill and ingenuity, this young sculptor replicates in miniature the studios of well-known artists. The centerpiece of his exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik. Plus Ultra Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Rosalind Solomon: 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-9081; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the stand-outs in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' Madly enjoyable. Alan's Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME' Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day-care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where kids can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ANNULLA' Eileen De Felitta is charming in Emily Mann's worthy one-woman play about a Jewish woman who passed for Aryan in Nazi Germany, but too much time is devoted to less intriguing aspects of the character's life (1:20). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>* 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!'  This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37 Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>'COLUMBINUS' The grim ecosphere of the average American high school is analyzed with sympathy and precision in this new play by Stephen Karam and P J Paparelli, which aims to expose the cultural and personal pathologies that gave rise to the horrific events in Littleton, Colo., in 1999, when two students went on a murderous rampage at Columbine High School, killing a dozen students and a teacher before killing themselves. Well acted and stylishly directed, the play exudes earnestness, and a measure of self-importance, too (2:00). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'HAMLET' Theater by the Blind's modest, pared-down production offers an angry, sarcastic prince; an Ophelia who won't stop singing; and a Polonius who actually seems to know what he's saying (2:15). Theater Five, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'MARATHON 2006' David Ives's haunting suspense tale ''The Other Woman'' highlights the first batch of short plays in the Ensemble Studio Theater's annual marathon of one-acts. A master of the comic short play, Mr. Ives channels his inner Rod Serling here, creating an eerie theatrical nocturne starring Ruthie Henshall and Scott Cohen, and directed with delicacy by Walter Bobbie. Two other fine two-handers, by Amy Fox and Anton Dudley, are also on the bill (2:00). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TROUT STANLEY' Claudia Dey's hysterically funny, deliciously lyrical piece of Canadian Gothic is about strange 30-year-old twin sisters and the mysterious man who arrives, D. H. Lawrence style, to upset the household's delicate balance (1:50). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30) T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (Phoebe Hoban)</p>
        <p>'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'HERAKLES VIA PHAEDRA' Making her annual excursion into Greek myth and history, Ellen Stewart presents the labors of Herakles and the tragedies of Theseus with an exhilarating, rough-hewn mix of flamenco, wildly beautiful puppets, acrobatic combat between men and magical beasts and a classical South Indian dance performed with a live snake (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. (Miriam Horn)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'I WILL COME LIKE A THIEF' The writer Trish Harnetiaux and the director Jude Domski have together created the potent outline of a parable about passive if still jittery Americans awash in government gobbledygook after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. But there is a staginess to their random characters that is hard to overcome, and ultimately the play, set in an American city being evacuated, does not live up to its promise (1:15). The 78th Street Theater Lab, 236 West 78th Street, (212) 868-4444; closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE RACE' Impending fatherhood stuns a man almost speechless in this brisk trot through nine months of anxiety. Performed by the London-based troupe Gecko, ''The Race'' is a hybrid of theater and dance, and lasts just an hour. Occasionally the inventive imagery stalls, and the show seems to run out of imaginative breath, but it provides enough small-scale wizardry to please fans of physical theater (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday.

        <p>'AKEELAH AND THE BEE' (PG, 112 minutes) Eleven-year-old Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is a bright but unmotivated girl who can outspell anyone at her South Los Angeles middle school. When Akeelah gets a taste of victory by winning the school bee, she throws herself into studying for the regional one, coached by a stern English professor named Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne). But Akeelah's mother (Angela Bassett) objects to her daughter's obsession with what she considers a ''game.'' The innate suspense and charm of the spelling bee, along with a trio of crack performances, turn what is, in essence, a formulaic picture into something more satisfying: an underdog tale that manages to inspire without being sappy. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and essential movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters operating during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on -- and example of -- the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'CAVITE' (No rating, 80 minutes, in English and Tagalog) Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in ''Cavite,'' a gripping, no-budget political thriller shot on the fly with handheld cameras that scour the teeming streets and squatter shacks of Cavite, a city on the outskirts of Manila. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'CLEAN' (R, 110 minutes) This fine French movie, written and directed by Olivier Assayas, is one of the few fictional films to evoke realistically the grubby texture of existence for second- and third-tier rock celebrities crumbling under a combination of fading renown and drug addiction. Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte offer memorable portrayals as a recovering junkie and her compassionate father-in-law. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-Western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh employs both clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE PROMISE' (PG-13, 103 minutes, in Mandarin) A lavish spectacle -- somewhere between grand opera and cartoon -- from Chen Kaige, about a love triangle involving a general, a slave and a cursed princess. Sometimes breathtaking, sometimes out of breath. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the professional wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'STICK IT' (PG-13, 103 minutes) Somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention, this spry teenage comedy gets everything right. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'THREE TIMES' (No rating, 135 minutes, in Mandarin and Taiwanese dialect) For this hypnotically beautiful cinematic trilogy, the Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien, one of the modern masters of the art, brings us love and loss in three different time periods. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* '12 AND HOLDING' (R, 94 minutes) This poignant, beautifully acted film, directed by Michael Cuesta (''L.I.E.''), flashes a laser beam on the moment between childhood and adolescence, when unguarded emotions and fantasies still rule, but adult experience beckons. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>ROBERT ALTMAN (Through Thursday) The Museum of the Moving Image's 22-film retrospective of Mr. Altman's work concludes on Thursday with a screening of his newest ensemble comedy, ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' followed by a discussion with Mr. Altman.

(Gates)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through June 11) This ninth annual festival opens tonight at the Brooklyn Museum with Libero De Rienzo's ''Blood, Death Does Not Exist'' (2005), a day in the life of an aspiring ballerina and her overdependent, drug-dealing brother.

        <p>OPEN ROADS: NEW ITALIAN CINEMA  (Through June 9) This weekend the Film Society of Lincoln Center's tribute to contemporary Italian filmmakers includes Massimo Andrei's debut feature, ''Mater Natura'' (2005), the story of a Neapolitan transsexual in love with a car-wash owner; Giacomo Martelli's espionage thriller ''The Listening'' (2006), about eavesdropping technology; and Carlo Verdone's comedy ''My Best Enemy'' (2006), about a man who has it all and messes it up.

        <p>TOMORROWLAND: CAL ARTS IN MOVING PICTURES (Through Aug. 13) The Museum of Modern Art is sponsoring a three-decade survey of films and videos by former students at the California Institute of the Arts. Tomorrow night's program, ''The (Post) Studio Artists'' is a collection of six 1970's shorts, including Chris Langdon and Fred Worden's ''Now, You Can Do Anything,'' set on a Malibu beach. On Wednesday night the program is student films whose creators went on to make their reputations at Pixar. Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>TO SAVE AND PROJECT: THE FOURTH MOMA INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF FILM PRESERVATION (Through June 21) This monthlong program of preserved and restored films continues at the Museum of Modern Art.

Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>THE VISION THAT CHANGED CINEMA: MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI (Through June 29) BAMcinématek's tribute to Antonioni begins on Wednesday with a weeklong run of his biggest commercial success, ''Blow-Up'' (1966). Vanessa Redgrave and David Hemmings star in the film, set squarely in swinging 60's London (the music! the fashions!), which tells the story of a fashion photographer who might have accidentally documented a murder. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>AVION TRAVEL (Tomorrow) The breezily romantic band Avion Travel is one of the jewels of the Italian music scene, playing a sophisticated mixture of French-Italian cabaret and Brazilian baião; the group stunned Italy six years ago by winning at Sanremo, a big pop festival not known for its sophisticated tastes. At 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $15. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>BARDO POND (Thursday) Bardo Pond, from Philadelphia, specializes in heavy, cyclical songs, letting big, dusty guitar riffs come round again and again. With Holy Ghost and the Winter Pageant. At 8:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh)</p>
        <p>BOUNCING SOULS (Tonight through Tuesday) The punk kings of New Jersey, Bouncing Souls have been going strong for nearly two decades, with no signs of slowing down: their new album, ''The Gold Record'' (Epitaph), is chock-full of adrenalized ''Hey! Hey! Hey!'' shout-alongs. They finish up a sold-out run at the Knitting Factory with lots of guests: Blanks 77 (tonight), Paint It Black (tomorrow), Sticks and Stones (Sunday), the Slackers (Monday) and the Explosion (Tuesday). At 6:30 p.m., 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JAMES BROWN (Thursday) He is the godfather of much more than soul: as the chief architect of funk, James Brown is one of the most influential figures in popular music since Louis Armstrong. He's a great dancer, too. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance, $85 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ROY CARRIER AND THE NITE ROCKERS (Tomorrow) Mr. Carrier, an old-fashioned zydeco accordionist, takes a break from his club in Lawtell, La., to lead his band for a Southern Louisiana dance party in Times Square. At 8:30 p.m., with a free zydeco dance lesson at 7:30, Connolly's, 121 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-7597; $22. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>COCOROSIE (Tonight) As CocoRosie, the Casady sisters, Sierra and Bianca, make a swirling psychodrama out of girlish daydreams, hints of trip-hop, chirping crickets and cooed Billie Holiday-ish vocals. With Spleen and Nomi. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DICK DALE (Sunday) Dick Dale, king of the surf guitar, provides no polite nostalgia trip to the mid-1960's. He's out to summon elemental forces with the stomping beat of his band and his heavily reverbed, brusquely attacked guitar lines, along with the dive-bombing, tremolo glissandos that literally melt his guitar picks from the heat of their friction on the strings. At 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $20 in advance, $25 at the door. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>DAVID (HONEYBOY) EDWARDS, ROBERT LOCKWOOD JR. (Wednesday) These veteran Delta bluesmen, both born in 1915, boast close connections to the fabled Robert Johnson: Mr. Edwards played with him in the 1930's, and Mr. Lockwood learned some of his songs directly from the master. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE FABULOUS SOUL SHAKERS (Tonight) Sort of an oldies Backstreet Boys, the Fabulous Soul Shakers are five talented young men -- each has won or been a finalist at Apollo Theater showcases -- assembled to perform letter-perfect renditions of doo-wop and soul from the 1950's and 60's. At 8:30, Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, between Henry and Hicks Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 834-0069; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* THE FALL (Tonight) Nearly 30 years ago, with jagged, jabby guitars and the tuneless slur of its leader and propagandist, Mark E. Smith, this British band laid out a reductionist ''three R's'' of pop: ''Repetition, repetition, repetition.'' Umpteen albums later, the Fall is a cornerstone of postpunk, and Mr. Smith still finds ways to make repetition sound new. With the Cairo Gang. At 9 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* HOT 97 SUMMER JAM (Sunday) The annual mega-concerts presented by the radio station Hot 97 (WQHT-FM) are always among the biggest live hip-hop events in the country, a status derived as much from the long roster of stars as from the sparks that sometimes fly among them. This year features Mary J. Blige, Jamie Foxx, Busta Rhymes, Sean Paul, Three 6 Mafia, Chris Brown, T. I., Ne-Yo, Jermaine Dupri and Dem Franchize Boyz. At 7 p.m., Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $35 to $160. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MASON JENNINGS, TEDDY THOMPSON (Thursday) Heavy-lidded confessions by young men holding acoustic guitars can sometimes go the way of empty bromides, as they do in the songs of Mason Jennings (''Be here now/No other place to be''). Teddy Thompson fares better: the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks: ''This is a party,'' Mr. Thompson groans, ''no frowns allowed.'' At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOAN JETT (Monday through Thursday) Joan Jett has been expertly playing the tough-chick-with-a-guitar role longer than many of her younger imitators have been alive. Promoting a new album, ''Sinner'' (Blackheart Records), she makes a sweep through the clubs of New York. Monday at 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $20. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, near Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236; $20. Wednesday at 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; sold out. Thursday at 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LITTLE RICHARD (Tomorrow) He may always be most celebrated for bringing scat to rock (''A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boom!''), but Little Richard's delirious falsetto ''oooh!'' and androgynous showmanship have influenced everybody from Paul McCartney to Prince. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $47 and $57. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LONGWAVE (Tonight) This New York band ponders self-destruction and transcendence in brooding songs with guitar lines that coil and climb. With Pela and English Department. At 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, is playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m., the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PEARL JAM (Tomorrow) Sounding limber and energized on its new, self-titled album -- oh why did it take Pearl Jam so long to find those thunderbolt AC/DC riffs? -- the alt-rock road warriors head out once again. With My Morning Jacket, a band from Louisville, Ky., with a calm and entrancing take on Southern rock. At 7:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>PEARLS AND BRASS (Wednesday) And on a certain beer-buzzed day (whose ordinal number is forgotten), Deep Purple, the James Gang and early Black Sabbath created fuzzy, head-nodding biker metal, and it was good. Many begats later, Pearls and Brass, from Nazareth, Pa., worships studiously at their altar. With Nudity and Endless Boogie. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 609-0484; $7. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LINDA RONSTADT (Tonight) Ms. Ronstadt's pleasurable, circuitous route through pop, having already covered everything from Queen's ''We Will Rock You'' to mariachi, next turns, on her coming album ''Adieu False Heart'' (Vanguard), to ''Walk Away Renee,'' the Left Banke's 1966 nugget of baroque psychedelia, as well as songs by Richard Thompson, Julie Miller and Bill Monroe. At 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $33.50 to $128.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SOUTHERN CULTURE ON THE SKIDS (Wednesday) This long-running three-piece from North Carolina knows just how much to poke fun at chicken-fried, backwoods rockabilly: a lot, but not too much to get in the way of some finger-licking twangy guitar. Don't let the band leave without playing its barnstorming ode to Santo, the vigilante Mexican wrestler. With the Demolition String Band. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE STILLS (Tonight) On its debut album three years ago, this Montreal band took the sulking guitar minimalism of New York groups like Interpol and the Strokes and sublimated it into a shimmering, majestic gloom that recalled the glories of U2 and Echo and the Bunnymen. Its new album, ''Without Feathers'' (Vice), perplexingly slows things down to a bored crawl. With Rogue Wave. At 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* SUPER FURRY ANIMALS (Tonight) The Welsh band Super Furry Animals plays wonderfully overwrought pop, cramming together Beach Boys' melodies, zooming space-rock, noisy punk and some penitent country. This show, with Dead Meadow as the opening act, begins the modest but essential summer series at the South Street Seaport, as part of the River to River Festival. At 7 p.m., Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* TAPES 'N TAPES (Sunday and Tuesday) A few months ago this Minneapolis band, playing dry, indie-pop rhapsodies recalling Pavement and the early Pixies, was little known. Then came a big Internet buzz courtesy of bloggers and the tastemaking Web site Pitchfork. But the group also found success in a comfortingly old-fashioned way, by blowing everybody away at the South by Southwest festival in March; within a month the group had a deal with XL Recordings and a busy tour schedule, including these two sold-out dates. With Figurines and Cold War Kids. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MARY TIMONY (Tonight) Mary Timony, who led the band Helium, has kept her tightly wound guitar riffs but has gradually left behind the personality crises of indie-rock to ponder higher thoughts and cosmic forces. With Tralala, Human Television and Tiny Amps. At 8:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>WOLFMOTHER (Tomorrow) The retro-rock wayback machine makes two stops in the music of this Australian band: to the screamy abandon of mid-1960's garage rock (the fingernails-on-blackboard yelp at the beginning of the band's debut album will bring a smile to any fan of the Sonics, who sang ''Psycho'' and other garage classics), and then forward just a few years to the amp-throbbing, proto-metal bacchanals of Blue Cheer and Black Sabbath. With Deadboy and the Elephantmen. At 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>Cabaret</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* MARIA FRIEDMAN (Tonight and tomorrow night) This British theater star commands a flexible, pitch-perfect soprano as pure as spring water. In her new show of Sondheim songs her dramatic instincts match her singing in subtlety, taste and insight. At 8:45 and 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $75. (Holden)</p>
        <p>ANDREA MARCOVICCI (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Marcovicci's new show, ''Just Love  by Request'' is a kind of living room musicale that's one-half pre-set and one-half determined by audience suggestions. The singer's charm rules this unruly format. At 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $60 cover Tuesday through Thursday, $65 tonight and tomorrow; $60 prix fixe dinner required for 9 p.m. shows; otherwise, a $20 minimum. (Holden)</p>
        <p>ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>J .D.

        <p>RON BLAKE AND MICHAEL CAIN (Tonight) Mr. Blake, a soulful tenor and soprano saxophonist, and Mr. Cain, an adventurous yet sensitive pianist, engage in a duologue that's likely to be exploratory as well as introspective.

        <p>THEO BLECKMANN AND FUMIO YASUDA (Tonight) On the recent album ''Las Vegas Rhapsody: The Night They Invented Champagne'' (Winter &amp; Winter), Mr. Bleckmann applied his protean, otherworldly vocal style to a repertory of show tunes imaginatively arranged by Mr. Yasuda.

        <p>DOMINIQUE EADE (Tonight) Ms. Eade weighs a chanteuse's coolness against a jazz musician's exploratory instincts, unquestionably earning the right to a dialogue with players like the guitarist Brad Shepik and the bassist Tony Scherr. At 9, Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DOWNTOWN MUSIC GALLERY 15TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW (Tonight) As a retail hub, community outpost and ersatz performance space, Downtown Music Gallery has long been an anchor of the experimental jazz and improvised music scene. The ensembles participating in this anniversary show are appropriate: New Ghost, consisting of Elliott Levin on reeds and vocals, and Rick Iannacone on guitar; John Zorn, in a setting of his choosing; and Tisziji Munoz, a guitarist with a rather obscure lineage in the avant-garde.

        <p>ARI HOENIG AND CHRIS POTTER (Wednesday) Mr. Hoenig, a drummer, and Mr. Potter, a saxophonist, are two of the sharpest musicians in modern post-bop circles, and their exchange here should be a thing of intensity and poise.

        <p>LIONEL LOUEKE (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Loueke, a guitarist and vocalist, favors a beguiling form of modern jazz informed by the music of his West African homeland, Benin. He plays an early set unaccompanied; his second set will feature the bassist Massimo Biolcati and the drummer Ferenc Nemeth, who appear on his recent album ''Gilfema'' (Obliqsound). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>* GARY PEACOCK, PAUL MOTIAN, MARC COPLAND (Wednesday through June 10) Mr. Peacock, a bassist, and Mr. Motian, a drummer, have worked together in a handful of superb rhythm sections over the years, most famously with the pianist Keith Jarrett. Here they join another fine pianist, Mr. Copland, in a trio that promises to favor dark harmonic colors and rhythmic undulation. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BOBBY PREVITE'S STRIKE (Tonight) Mr. Previte, an adventurous and often effervescent drummer, teams up with musicians similarly inclined to pair aggressive experimentation with a rock-hard sense of groove: the saxophonists Briggan Krauss and David Binney and the keyboardist Marco Benevento.

        <p>KURT ROSENWINKEL GROUP (Through Sunday) Mr. Rosenwinkel's guitar has a luminous tone that offsets the cerebral tinge of his compositions, and his rapport with the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner borders on the telepathic. This ensemble, which also features the pianist Aaron Goldberg, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Eric Harland, imbues its performances with a blend of shadowy introspection and combustible interplay. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DIANE SCHUUR AND SARA GAZAREK (Tuesday through June 11) Among jazz singers, Ms. Schuur is a survivor and a study in perseverance, if not exactly a musical role model. Ms. Gazarek, a fresh-faced newcomer, has already proven her ability to cast familiar songs in a new and well-considered light. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $40 at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LOREN STILLMAN GROUP (Tomorrow) Mr. Stillman is a young alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz conventions, as he demonstrates on a pair of recent albums recorded at this time last year, and released on different European labels.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>AMERICAN OPERA PROJECTS (Tonight and tomorrow night) This group's mandate is to help the development of new operas in a range of genres. Its ''First Glimpse'' series continues with readings of excerpts from works-in-progress by Tarik O'Regan, Stefania de Kenessey and Richard Wargo. At 8, South Oxford Space, 138 South Oxford Street, between Hanson Place and Atlantic Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 398-4024; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'FAUST' (Tonight through Sunday) The diminutive Amato Opera winds up its season with a brand-new production of Gounod's chestnut, with its usual rotating casts and exuberant conducting from the company's founder, Tony Amato. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'MÉDÉE' (Tomorrow) Many opera connoisseurs consider Cherubini's ''Médée'' from 1797 an elegant masterpiece, especially in its original French version. Beethoven ranked his Italian-born contemporary Cherubini as the greatest living composer of dramatic music. Still, the score awkwardly blends Cherubini's operatic sensibility with long stretches of spoken dialogue. In a concert performance tomorrow night at Carnegie Hall, Peter Tiboris, the general and artistic director of MidAmerica Productions, will try to give the opera new life by exaggerating its stylistic dichotomy. The roles will be sung in French by a roster of singers, but the spoken dialogue will be delivered in an English translation by the members of the Aquila Theater Company. Irini Tsirakidou will sing the title role. Mr. Tiboris will conduct the Manhattan Philharmonic. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $89. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'PAGLIACCI' (Wednesday and Thursday) Small opera companies are springing up at such a pace that it's getting difficult to tell them apart. The Chelsea Opera is doing its best to stand out by presenting Daniel Rodriguez, who burst onto the classical music and national-anthem scene in 2001 as ''the singing cop,'' in the title role of Leoncavallo's classic. At 8 p.m., St. Peter's Episcopal Church, 346 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111; $25 at the door; $20 for students and 65+; $5 discount when purchased in advance. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) This week and next at Bargemusic, the living-room-size converted coffee barge moored under the Brooklyn Bridge, the fare is drawn from the more intimate side of chamber music. Tonight, Dmitry Rachmanov, a fine pianist, plays an all-Schubert recital, with the ''Moments Musicaux'' (D. 780) and the Sonatas in A minor (D. 784) and D (D. 850). Tomorrow and Sunday Mr. Rachmanov will be joined by the violinist Mark Peskanov and the cellist Colin Carr for more Schubert, including the Sonatina for Violin and Piano (D. 384), the ''Arpeggione'' Sonata and the Piano Trio in B flat (D. 898). And on Thursday the cellist Adrian Daurov plays the first of two concerts devoted to all the Bach Cello Suites, this one including the first four of the six. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35; $20 for students. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* DA CAPO CHAMBER PLAYERS (Tuesday) Works written by Asian composers or influenced by Eastern philosophy are the subject of this concert. Included are ''Divergence'' by Huang Ruo, a particularly eloquent young Chinese composer, as well as Chinary Ung's ''Spiral VI''; Akemi Naito's ''Rain, Calling Autumn''; Evan Ziporyn's ''Tsmindao Ghmerto''; and Shirish Korde's ''Bandit Queen: Song Cycle on the Life of Phoolan Devi.'' The Korde work, a premiere, is the 100th score commissioned by the ensemble. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>SUMI JO (Tonight) During the early years of this Korean soprano's career, she received some helpful public support from Joan Sutherland, who knows a thing or two about what it takes to be a coloratura soprano. Since making her Metropolitan Opera debut as Gilda in ''Rigoletto,'' Ms. Jo has sung nearly 50 times with the company. But her last appearance was in 2000, and her career has drifted to Europe. A tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ms. Jo's professional debut, rather mawkishly titled ''Beautiful Challenge,'' comes to Carnegie Hall tonight, giving New Yorkers a fresh chance to assess the current state of Ms. Jo's artistry in works by Donizetti, Offenbach, Duman Cho and others. Will Crutchfield conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's. At 8, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $90. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>MUSICA SACRA (Monday) The Romantic age is the focus of this well-known chorus's final concert of the season, and not all sacred, at that. Songs and romances by Brahms make up the bulk of the evening, with motets by Mendelssohn and Bruckner. At 7 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 868-4444; $15 to $75. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA OF THE AMERICAS (Thursday) Central to this showcase for Latin American music is Paul Desenne's Concerto for Double Bass, with the Berlin Philharmonic's young bassist Edicson Ruiz. At 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $15 to $45. (Holland)</p>
        <p>'REWIND' (Thursday) In its New York premiere, ''Rewind'' is less a concert than a continuous visual and sonic experience. The program spans five centuries of music, from Renaissance works to commissioned scores and spontaneously created acoustic and electronic pieces. But the selections will meld into one another, and ambient noise (conversations, crinkling paper) will be digitally sampled and folded into the sound space. The performers will be stationed in various parts of the Orensanz Center for the Arts, adding to the spatial and visual atmosphere. Some fine musicians are taking part, including the violinists Anne Akiko Meyers and Colin Jacobson, along with the Knights, a chamber orchestra, and the conductor Paul Haas, who conceived ''Rewind.'' This may be one concert where coughing not only does not matter but will also become a part of the piece. At 8 p.m., 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (516) 319-9307; $20 in advance; $25 at the door. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>ST. LUKE'S CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow and Sunday) New works often have a moment in the spotlight, at their premieres, and are then filed away. In its ''Second Helpings'' series, the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble takes another look at some of these. Among the pieces in the current installment are Michael Daugherty's ''High and Mighty'' and Joan Panetti's ''Instant Gathers.'' Tomorrow at 2 p.m., Chelsea Art Museum, 556 West 22nd Street. Sunday at 2 p.m., Dia:Beacon, Riggio Galleries, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y.; (212) 594-6100; $15; $10 for students and members, and for 65+ on Sunday. (Kozinn)</p>

At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $15. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* WESTERN WIND (Sunday) This superb vocal ensemble offers a program by Salamone Rossi, a contemporary of Monteverdi best known for his Hebrew settings of psalms and Jewish liturgical works. At 3 p.m., Church of St. Luke in the Fields, 487 Hudson Street, at Grove Street, West Village, (212) 414-9419; $30; $20 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)</p>

        <p>4-ISH (Tonight through Sunday) This Dutch company presents ''4-ISH,'' a show that might be called hip-hop, but is really hip-hop-ish and involves many kinds of urban derring-do, including quarter pipes (as in skateboarding), kung fu, electrified skate wheels and a live D.J.

        <p>* TIFFANY MILLS COMPANY (Tonight and tomorrow) Ms. Mills's new ''Godard'' tackles the familiar theme of human relationships, but the piece is set, intriguingly, to music by John Zorn inspired by the quirks of the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, and has video by Ela Troyano. The program also includes the much sparer new ''LandFall (Part 1).'' At 8 p.m., the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200 or tiffanymillscompany.org; $15; $12, students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martín Santangelo, is settling into the intimate Theater 80, through July 30. At 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45 ($100 for opening night). (Rockwell)</p>

        <p>* ROD RODGERS DANCE COMPANY (Thursday) Rodgers, who died in 2002, had a distinctive movement and choreographic style, and his dancers have managed to keep it alive through continuing the work of his East Village studio, which will be celebrated in the benefit that opens four-day performance series.

        <p>THREEWAY (Tonight through Sunday) Chill already. The three women choreographers who form the interestingly named group -- Colleen Dunagan, Erin Mitchell and Sue Hogan -- say the company title simply reflects their desire to form a dance project among Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City. At 8 p.m., Arts at University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (209) 602-3216; $15.(Dunning)</p>
        <p>URBAN BUSH WOMEN (Tomorrow) The company brings its signature mix of powerful, sassy and decidedly female dance to a Brooklyn park for a performance jam inspired by a Yoruba proverb. They weave together repertory, including excerpts from ''Give Your Hands to Struggle'' and the rousing ''Batty Moves,'' with a participatory call and response. The show opens with a dance by local sixth graders. At 6 p.m., Coffey Park, Visitation Place between Dwight and Richards Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (212) 625-3505 or dancinginthestreets.org; free.

        <p>NINA WINTHROP AND DANCERS (Thursday) Ms. Winthrop will present her multimedia ''That's Me -- I'm the One Lying Down Over There,'' set to music by Jon Gibson.

At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village (212)674-8194 or danspaceproject.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BARD GRADUATE CENTER: 'AMERICAN STREAMLINED DESIGN: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW,' through June 11. Streamlining, a particularly American design concept born of our love of speed and admiration for industrial production, peaked in the 1930's and 40's, and is now said to be undergoing a revival. This tribute to it includes more than 180 objects, from boring but useful items like a receipt printer designed by Walter Dorwin Teague in 1946 to a plastic bicycle helmet of flowing teardrop shapes designed by John Larkin in 2000. The show is perhaps too packed with repetitive examples -- do we need to see three similar electric drills? -- but don't let that stop you. There's no shortage of wonderful things to look at here. 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining.2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. (An exhibition of her drawings is on view at the Drawing Center.) 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANGLOMANIA: TRADITION AND TRANSGRESSION IN BRITISH FASHION,' through Sept. 4. Ranging from early-18th-century gowns to next season's evening wear, this show crowds 65 extravagantly clad mannequins into the Met's normally serene English period rooms, trying to connect the sartorial innovations of the English dandy, the aggressive tribal attire of punk and the deconstructive impulses of today's British fashion stars. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MET: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. History is full of shifty characters, antique visionaries, cusp figures and half-crazy oddball innovators, later overlooked because they're hard to pigeonhole. Their independent cast of mind is the truest expression of how civilization advances. (See above.) (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or themorgan.org. ( Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.)(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>Museum of Modern Art : 'AGAINST THE GRAIN: CONTEMPORARY ART FROM THE EDWARD R. BROIDA COLLECTION,' through July 10. The latest collection assembled by the Museum of Modern Art bolsters its holdings of art world mavericks like Philip Guston, Jennifer Bartlett, Ken Price and Vija Celmins and includes first-timers like Robert Grosvenor, John Lees and Susana Solano. It also illuminates parts of the untold, or forgotten, stories of the art of the 1970's and 80's: the achievements of painters and sculptors who were not at the forefront of Post-Minimalism, photo appropriation or Neo-Expressionism. Some of their efforts may disappear into storage, but quite a few will shake up the Modern's conception of the complicated course of art since 1970. The Museum of Modern Art, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Museum of the City of New York: Sherril Schell: 'Unknown Modernist,' through June 13. Though little known today, the photographer Sherril Schell (1877-1964) was critically recognized in the 1930's for his severely formalist photographs of New York architecture. This small exhibition presents 15 examples in which closely cropped views of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the Brooklyn Bridge and other monuments of Manhattan emphasize compositional order, structure, pattern, light and shadow. Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN' Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. Museum of Arts &amp; Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535, through Sept. 3. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>EVA HESSE: 'DRAWING'  This show deals in depth with Ms. Hesse's works on paper, ranging from rough sketches or notes, to test pieces made from various materials that function as drawings, to finished projects that stand on their own. A zealous researcher, Ms. Hesse made all kinds of thumbnail notations and calculations to explore the properties of her malleable materials. Many of these sheets, perhaps too many, are shown, too. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through July 15. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Willem de Kooning: 'Sketchbook' Twelve pages bearing spidery pencil drawings from a rare, intact sketchbook from the mid-1970's by this great Abstract Expressionist. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, (212) 243-0200, through June 17. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>BASQUIAT and DUBUFFET: 'PERSONAL MEMORIES'  Nothing illuminates art like other art. And the pairing of two artists with similar appetites for drawing, collage, the grittiness of life and a bristling energy exudes a high-wattage electricity all its own. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, through June 17. (Smith)</p>
        <p>RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'The Drop' More than two dozen artists present multimedia conceptual creations about the global problem of water. In works ranging from densely informational to entertainingly visual, they address the pollution, increasing scarcity and private marketing of one of our planet's most necessary resources. Nancy Drew made 100 colorful paintings based on water bottle labels; Brandon Ballengée presents a pyramid of bottles containing preserved specimens of endangered marine life; and Christy Rupp's installation of five water coolers invites viewers to test the water of each of New York's five boroughs. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through June 10. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* Willem de Kooning: 'Paintings 1975-1978' Working with wide brushes, putty knives and other unidentifiable tools and methods, de Kooning improvised with abandon and to beautiful effect in these 13 paintings from the 70's. L &amp; M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Joe FiG With extraordinary skill and ingenuity, this young sculptor replicates in miniature the studios of well-known artists. The centerpiece of his exhibition recreates the adjoining Long Island studios of the painters and spouses Eric Fischl and April Gornik. Plus Ultra Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Rosalind Solomon: 'American Pictures from Chapalingas' This excellent exhibition of works from 1974 to 2000 surveys the career of a photographer with a keen eye for human individuality and a pitch-perfect sense of composition. Her art bears a family resemblance to that of Diane Arbus, but it is gentler and kinder. Foley, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-9081; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
