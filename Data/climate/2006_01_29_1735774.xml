        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Hypoxia won't be eliminated with technological fixes reducing nitrogen at New York City sewage treatment plants (''Restoring the Sound,'' editorial, Jan. 15).</p>
        <p>Oceanographic conditions changed over the past 50 years, increasing hypoxia's potential. Summertime water column stratification separates warm, fresher, oxygenated surface waters from cold, saltier, oxygen-depleted bottom waters. Isolation of deep waters prevents mixing of photosynthetic and atmospheric oxygen to depth, establishing conditions leading to hypoxia.</p>
        <p>Stratification now develops earlier in the year and is stronger. Summertime temperature differences between surface and bottom waters of the western sound have increased 1.2degreesC. Simultaneously, bottom concentration of dissolved oxygen declined 35 percent because oxygen replenishment to bottom waters ceases earlier in spring. The oxygen reservoir established during winter must now last for a longer period.</p>
        <p>The intensified and longer stratification period results from local climatological changes. Warming of the water commences earlier and wind stress is reduced over the western sound. In part, these are associated with localized hardening and heating of land surfaces (rooftops, roads) as population expands.</p>
        <p>Upgrading sewage treatment plants will reduce one contribution to oxygen stress. But hypoxia will likely be a problem into the future, despite upgrades. Hypoxia is clearly linked to climate variability.</p>
