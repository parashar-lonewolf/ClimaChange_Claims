        <p>When Japan's industrial planners outlined their vision of the next two decades, they concluded last year that the country was more committed than ever to nuclear power. Only by building two nuclear plants a year for the next 20 years could Japan keep its auto factories humming, its electronics industry buzzing and its neon cities brightly lighted, they said.</p>
        <p>Now, despite a multimillion-dollar effort by the Government to win public acceptance, that strategy appears on the brink of collapse. An anti-nuclear movement that Japanese officials once dismissed as a radical fringe is gradually winning over the middle class, helped by disclosures about a nuclear accident four months ago here in the industrial heartland.</p>
        <p>So far, the Government investigation has uncovered dangerously sloppy construction work and a remarkable series of operational and maintenance mistakes, all casting severe doubt on its argument that nuclear power, in disciplined Japanese hands, is safer here than anywhere else in the world.</p>
        <p>The price of those mistakes may become evident in the next few months. With several of its biggest nuclear plants out of action -- the Mihama No. 2 plant was so badly damaged in the accident that it will not operate again for at least three years, and a similarly designed plant has been shut for emergency repairs -- Japan's demand for electric power in the humid, sticky summer is likely to come perilously close to its generating capacity.</p>
        <p>June has broken all electricity-demand records, and the Government has drawn up plans to do at a stroke, should things get worse, what legions of American and European trade negotiators have tried to do for years: slow the output of Japanese industry. Such a slowing took place in Tokyo last summer, and many predict this year could be worse. Pamphlets urging conservation are already being distributed to more than 20 million households.</p>
        <p>"They realize that they are beginning to run into real troubles, immediately and in the long term," Daniel Yergin, the head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said on a recent visit to Tokyo.</p>
        <p>How Japan navigates its power crisis this summer and over the next few years may be the greatest test yet of its much-admired skills at creating, conserving and bargaining for enough energy to keep a huge but resource-poor economy growing at rates that have consistently outpaced those in the West.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the rate of economic growth is Japan's biggest energy challenge. In the last few years, energy demand has increased at roughly twice the 2.5 percent annual pace that the Government projected when it laid out its plans for building nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>"The reality is that even if we built all of our new nuclear plants, it would not be enough," a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said recently. "We underestimated how quickly the demand would grow."  Projects Being Refused</p>
        <p>Hopes of finding communities willing to take new nuclear power stations are also quickly fading. Cash and big public works projects, which always attracted takers when Japan embarked on huge power projects in the 1960's, are now being refused.</p>
        <p>"Japan is rich now, and people aren't interested in getting compensation," Shinichi Nakagawa, an executive of Kansai Electric Power, Japan's second-largest utility and the operator of the crippled Mihama plant, said recently.</p>
        <p>The country's energy troubles are compounded by a series of environmental controls adopted by the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in recent months. The new rules set emission controls for carbon dioxide that will sharply limit the number of oil- and coal-fired power plants that Japan can build.  Hardly Dead</p>
        <p>The nuclear industry is hardly dead here: a huge nuclear-fuel reprocessing operation and 11 nuclear power plants are under construction, mostly on the sites of existing plants where there is no need for local approval. In comparison, there are five plants under construction in the United States. Japan spends nearly $1 billion a year on nuclear energy research, three times more than American industry, and these days it is often outpacing its teacher.</p>
        <p>But the political realities in Japan are quickly changing, and nowhere is the change more evident than in downtown Osaka.</p>
        <p>Street protests are relatively rare in Japan. Yet, since March, soon after the Mihama accident, anti-nuclear activists have lived in a tent city across the street from the headquarters of Kansai Electric. Protestors have recently bought stock in the major utilities, and at raucous shareholder meetings this week they forced clearly unhappy corporate managers to discuss nuclear questions in public.  Still Aiming for 40 New Plants</p>
        <p>"I don't think that we are having any effect on the operation of existing plants," Daisuke Sato, an official of Osaka prefecture who has joined the protestors in the tent city, said the other day. "But as far as new plants are concerned, I think they will never go ahead."</p>
        <p>Government officials, utility executives and Japan's three big nuclear power builders -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hitachi Ltd. and the Toshiba Corporation -- disagree, saying that the goal of 40 new plants, while difficult, is not impossible.</p>
        <p>But a poll of 2,500 Japanese conducted by Kansai Electric last year, before the Mihama accident, showed that while roughly two-thirds of the population thought nuclear power was necessary, only one-third thought it was safe or would consent to the construction of a plant near their house. A Government poll last fall found that 47 percent of the population thought that Japanese-made nuclear power plants were "relatively unsafe" or "not safe at all."</p>
        <p>"We are almost scared to take the poll again this year," a senior Government official said a few months ago. Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, once staunch supporters of nuclear power, are often reluctant to appear decidedly pro-nuclear in local elections.</p>
        <p>Still, until Mihama, Japanese plants had been the envy of the industry: on average they suffer far fewer unplanned shutdowns than plants in the United States or in France, and workers are generally considered better trained.</p>
        <p>Though the Mihama accident was considered relatively mild because the amount of radiactive material released into the air was small, the investigation found that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which built the reactor, made a series of major errors and then tried to cover them up.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred when a tube that carries superheated radioactive water from the nuclear core into the plant's steam generator broke, contaminating the clean steam that turns the electric generators. The resulting leak led to a dangerous reduction in the amount of water cooling the nuclear fuel, and emergency systems had to be used to prevent a meltdown.</p>
        <p>An investigation showed that the pipe broke because it -- and many pipes around it -- had never been connected to an anti-vibration bar that was intended to support it. The error was traced to workers who, frustrated that the bar would not fit correctly, simply jammed it in and cut off the ends so that inspectors would be unable to detect the short-cut. 'Intentionally Sloppy Work'</p>
        <p>"Maybe Mitsubishi did not know how important these bars were," said Mr. Nakagawa of Kansai Electric. "It was intentionally sloppy work." Investigators also found that Kansai had failed to conduct proper maintenance on emergency pressure valves, several of which failed as workers scrambled to bring the plant under control.</p>
        <p>The cost of replacing the steam generators will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Kansai Electric, realizing that its hopes of finding sites for several new nuclear power stations are doomed, is getting ready to build a new plant powered by liquefied natural gas. Other utilities are turning to similar non-nuclear options.</p>
        <p>The nuclear industry is hoping that political changes in Japan -- chiefly the diminished power of the Socialist Party, one of its biggest critics -- will allow it to pursue its plans for more nuclear power. But that hope is slim, and for now the Government appears paralyzed, unable to abandon its earlier targets or to devise an environmentally acceptable alternative.</p>
