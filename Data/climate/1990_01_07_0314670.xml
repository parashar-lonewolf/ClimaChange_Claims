        <p>MEGATRENDS 2000</p>
        <p>Ten New Directions for the 1990's.</p>
        <p>By John Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene.</p>
        <p>384 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>William Morrow &amp; Company. $21.95.</p>
        <p>Who doesn't want to know what the future holds? Practically no one. That is why there are so many people in the prediction business - fortunetellers, stock pickers, economists and even meteorologists. They all have one thing in common: to stay in business, they must be willing to peer into the future and tell what they see. They may prove to be wrong, but they are not afraid to predict.</p>
        <p>John Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene, the authors of ''Megatrends 2000,'' are marketing themselves as part of the prediction business. They aren't. They are scaredy-cats. Mr. Naisbitt's first book, just plain ''Megatrends,'' was written by just plain Mr. Naisbitt in 1982. It was an effort to pull together evidence about the directions in which the world was already moving. Indeed, in that volume Mr. Naisbitt modestly avoided engaging in what he called ''futuristic guessing games that often prove inaccurate or annoying.''</p>
        <p>Not so for ''Megatrends 2000.'' The authors promise that they are going to tell you how the world will look in the year 2000 and they make a very big deal about what they call the spiritual significance of the millennium.</p>
        <p>The book has many of the trappings of the futurist business. The megatrends themselves are revealed in breathless prose, hinting at megaconclusions to come. And the discussions of the megatrends are sandwiched between wide-eyed generalizations about how choices made in this historical moment will determine whether the future will bring an apocalypse or a golden age.</p>
        <p>There is also the requisite number of frivolous observations, like the surely unverifiable claim that more than 80 percent of all information stored in the more than 100 million computers around the world is in English. And there is even an occasional stunningly astute observation, like that for all intents and purposes California is a Pacific Rim country, not a United States state.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Naisbitt and Ms. Aburdene wimp out when it comes to predicting what the world will look like in the millennium. ''Megatrends 2000'' describes 10 trends that are already here. The trends, which take up a chapter each, are: the booming global economy of the 1990's, a renaissance in the arts, the emergence of free-market socialism, global life styles and cultural nationalism, the privatization of the welfare state, the rise of the Pacific Rim, the decade of women in leadership, the age of biology, the religious revival of the new millennium and the triumph of the individual.</p>
        <p>To anyone who has been watching television news or reading cover stories in Time magazine, there isn't much here that is new, and nothing is arranged or discussed in such a fashion as to encourage novel insights.</p>
        <p>If you have been awesomely out of touch for the past several years, this book does provide a painless way to catch up. ''Megatrends 2000'' bounces along, the facts come thick and furious and the thoughts are bite-sized. In fact, ''Megatrends 2000'' is a lot like ''Megatrends'' -a useful summary and an overview of what's been going on.</p>
        <p>But if you want a guide to what the future holds - tall, dark and handsome men, hot stocks, the coming depression, or even whether to sell your fur earmuffs because global warming will render them useless - then you will be better off consulting a fearless swami.</p>
