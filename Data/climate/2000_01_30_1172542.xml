        <p>FORGET road rage. Though it may seem like the trendy highway vice, environmentalists say millions of American vehicle buyers have committed a different sin, namely gluttony. They went shopping for a family car and came home instead with a sport utility vehicle, a van or a pickup truck.</p>
        <p>If you are in this group, and unless you haul bales of hay or entire soccer teams, or commute up and down the Grand Tetons, you may be wantonly contributing more than your share of pollution said to cause global warming. To quote Eldridge Cleaver out of his radical 1960's context, you are part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>
        <p>But suppose you recognize the error of your ways. What can you do to atone?</p>
        <p>Quite a bit, say environmentalists and energy experts who hope that buyers who picked something bigger than a car will suffer some pangs of conscience. Lately, S.U.V.'s, vans and pickups account for about half the sales of ''light duty vehicles,'' the government's term for the kinds of cars and trucks purchased for household and small-business use.</p>
        <p>It's not too late to repent. You can do so from the comfort of your own home, but you may have to face certain hardships, like getting by with only one refrigerator and junking the halogen torchier. Like a dieter compensating for a binge, you have dug yourself in deep, but with a lot of small steps you can still climb out.</p>
        <p>First, the scale of the problem. Burning a gallon of gasoline, no matter how cleanly the vehicle does it, creates a little more than 18 pounds of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the so-called greenhouse gases. In the process, carbon from the gasoline is combined with oxygen from the air in amounts that scientists can weigh, or calculate.</p>
        <p>Add in the energy use required to refine that gallon from crude oil and haul it to your neighborhood gasoline station, and each gallon is worth about 20 pounds of pollution. The number is the same whether that gallon takes you 70 miles in a Honda Insight (the new hybrid that saves gasoline by shutting off the engine at stop signs and turning  energy lost in braking into electricity for  acceleration) or the four-wheel-drive Range Rover, at about 13 miles a gallon.</p>
        <p>Put differently, for each pound of carbon dioxide, the Insight will go 3.8 miles; the Range Rover will go about 1,100 yards, or about six-tenths of a mile.</p>
        <p>Most purchase decisions, however, are not between such extremes but between more similar vehicles, like a typical car and a typical S.U.V. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the average light truck gets about 15.3 miles a gallon, compared with 22.5 for the car. The truck generates a pound and a half of carbon dioxide for every pound from the car. Or, assuming that they are each driven 14,000 miles a year, the truck generates 5,600 pounds, or nearly three tons, more carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Many steps to make up the difference are easy, according to Joseph J. Romm, a former assistant secretary of energy for efficiency and renewables and the author of ''Cool Companies'' (Island Press, 1999), a book on businesses that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions. ''Anybody can cut one to two tons,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The main form of energy used in most homes, providing the biggest opportunity for saving, is electricity. Power generated at hydroelectric and nuclear plants produces hardly any carbon dioxide, but the biggest single fuel is coal, which is rich in carbon. Nationally, the average kilowatt-hour, the energy needed to light ten 100-watt bulbs for an hour, produces about 1.5 pounds of carbon dioxide. In the Northeast, with proportionally more nuclear generation, the number is about 1.06 pounds a kilowatt hour, according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.</p>
        <p>AT the national average, earning back the 5,600 pounds means saving about 3,700 kilowatt-hours a year -- what a typical home might use in three months. A household could save almost that much by turning off eight 100-watt bulbs that burn 12 hours a day -- if it has that many big bulbs burning that long, and if the residents don't mind going to sleep at sunset.</p>
        <p>There are more practical options. ''The No. 1 thing I'd recommend is getting rid of halogen torchiers,'' Dr. Romm said. Replacing a 300-watt model that burns six hours a night with a fixture that has a 75-watt compact fluorescent bulb would provide about the same light -- but produce 750 pounds less carbon dioxide pollution.</p>
        <p>The next step is getting rid of the old refrigerator. Not the one in the kitchen, but the one that used to be in the kitchen and is now in the basement playroom or the garage. To the chagrin of efficiency advocates, it seems that nearly everybody who pulled out the avocado-colored 1970's refrigerator and replaced it with a sleek, new, energy-efficient white-on-white model kept the old one, too. If those who want a couple of cases of cold beer can make do by simply running to the store in their S.U.V.'s, they can save about 1,500 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by junking the old fridge. (If you're keeping track, you're up to 2,250 pounds in carbon dioxide savings, or 1,500 kilowatt-hours.)</p>
        <p>Further ideas come from ''CO2  Diet for a Greenhouse Planet,'' a paper by John M.  DeCicco of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and James H. Cook, Dorene Bolze and Jan Beyea of the National Audubon Society.</p>
        <p>A low-flow shower head would save 300 pounds of carbon dioxide in a house with an electric water heater -- 80 pounds with a more energy-efficient gas water heater.</p>
        <p>Washing four out of five loads of clothes in cold water instead of hot would save about  1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide with an electric water heater. (If the water was heated  with gas, the saving would be 350 pounds; with oil, 500 pounds.)</p>
        <p>Do all that in a home with an electric water heater, and your savings total 3,550  pounds of carbon dioxide, not enough to compensate for the S.U.V., but enough to make a good dent.</p>
        <p>There are ways to go further, of course -- most notably with the home heating system. But such improvements are usually undertaken only when an old system dies. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy says that replacing a 25-year-old oil-fired home heating system with a modern one saves 218 gallons of oil in a house that had used 750 gallons a season. Because heating oil produces slightly more carbon dioxide a gallon than does gasoline, the  savings from this step alone would be 5,886 pounds, enough to assuage most cases of S.U.V. guilt.</p>
        <p>And there is always the back-to-nature approach. Planting a new tree on the property would absorb 26 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. Planted to shade the house in summer and provide a windbreak in winter, the tree could save 300 pounds a year.</p>
