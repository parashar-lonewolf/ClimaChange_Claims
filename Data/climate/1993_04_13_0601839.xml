        <p>THE Clinton Administration will offer an olive branch this week to tropical countries on the bitterly divisive issue of protecting the world's forests, according to Administration and State Department officials. Environmentalists say the move might eventually open the way for negotiation of a world forest treaty.</p>
        <p>It could also be one of a series of actions this spring and summer signaling an Administration intention to reassert American leadership on international environmental issues after the Bush Administration's diplomatic floundering at the Earth Summit last year in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
        <p>The meeting often pitted developing countries jealous of their valuable natural resources against industrialized countries who see uncontrolled exploitation of those resources as dangerous to the global environment.  Nowhere was the clash more rancorous than over the issue of forests.</p>
        <p>Tropical countries led by Malaysia, a major timber exporter, charged that the main burden for protecting forests was being forced on them by temperate countries that had long since over-exploited their own forests. Malaysia and its allies torpedoed an American-led effort to negotiate a forest treaty even before the summit began, and the United States and its allies were lucky to salvage even a weak statement on forest management principles. Talks on Timber Agreement</p>
        <p>The forum for a possible start in recouping the situation is the opening of talks today in Geneva to renegotiate the 1987 International Tropical Timber Agreement. Under the agreement, countries that export tropical timber undertake voluntary efforts to exploit their forests while preserving them ecologically. Tropical forests contain a majority of the world's dwindling store of plant, animal and microbial species. But the tropical countries, charging discrimination and unfair competition, want the agreement expanded to include forests in temperate countries like the United States and subarctic climates like those of Canada and Russia.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists support this view and want the agreement to have some teeth as well. If tropical and temperate countries agree on these issues, they hope, the rancor that has surrounded the forest question will be dispelled and the main roadblock to negotiating a treaty for all types of forest exploitation will be removed.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration adamantly opposed expanding the timber agreement to include temperate forests. But officials close to the situation, who would speak only on the condition that they not be named, said that American representatives in Geneva were there with an open mind and would explore ways in which both temperate and tropical countries could pledge themselves to a policy of harvesting timber while preserving forests. This goal of sustainable cutting of trees would be achieved by the end of this decade under proposals for revising the timber agreement.</p>
        <p>"We could agree to those kinds of principles," said one Administration official, who added that the United States would acknowledge in Geneva that some complaints by tropical countries about a double standard were valid. But how any agreement on principles gets translated into specific provisions is critical, and it is far from clear that the United States can ultimately agree with tropical countries on the details.</p>
        <p>Further, it is unclear how an effective agreement applying sustainable harvesting principles to temperate countries would affect forestry practices in the United States itself. The Administration is wrestling now, for instance, with how to reconcile economic and ecological interests in the Pacific Northwest, and the outcome of that dispute is far from assured. Shift Would Be Significant</p>
        <p>No conclusions are likely to be reached in four days of meetings this week in Geneva, said a State Department official involved in the talks who characterized this first round as exploratory. A second round of talks is to take place in late June.</p>
        <p>The United States has been the spokesman for the temperate countries' caucus in preliminary meetings leading up to the timber talks, and any shift in its position would carry great weight. Its new stance is therefore "very, very encouraging," said Bill Mankin, the coordinator of the Global Forest Policy Project of the National Wildlife Federation, Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth.</p>
        <p>"It's the first opening, the first break" in the temperate-tropical impasse on forests, Mr. Mankin said.</p>
        <p>The rebuff to the Bush Administration on forests at the Earth Summit was accompanied by an outcry over its standing alone among major countries in refusing to sign the global biodiversity treaty designed to help protect the world's array of biological species. It was also widely criticized for winning weaker controls than other countries wanted on emissions of heat-trapping gases that could cause global warming.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has been engaged in a reassessment of international environmental issues.The Administration is reviewing the biodiversity treaty and is widely expected to reverse the Bush policy and sign the pact. It has also signaled to a meeting of countries that negotiated the global-warming treaty signed in Rio that the Administration was willing to consider stronger steps to control heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>On forests, Mr. Mankin had this to say: "The Bush Administration dug a deep hole for us to get out of, and the Clinton Administration is beginning to peek over the edge and say, 'H-m-m. What's outside this hole?' "</p>
