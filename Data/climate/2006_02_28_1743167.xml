        <p>Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to a higher federal gasoline tax, but a significant number would go along with an increase if it reduced global warming or made the United States less dependent on foreign oil, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.</p>
        <p>The nationwide telephone poll, conducted Wednesday through Sunday, suggested that a gasoline tax increase that brought measurable results would be acceptable to a majority of Americans.</p>
        <p>Neither the Bush administration nor Democratic Party leaders make that distinction. Both are opposed to increasing the gasoline tax as a means of discouraging consumption, although President Bush, in recent speeches, has called for the development of alternative energy to reduce dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Eighty-five percent of the 1,018 adults polled opposed an increase in the federal gasoline tax, suggesting that politicians have good reason to steer away from so unpopular a measure. But 55 percent said they would support an increase in the tax, which has been 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, if it did in fact reduce dependence on foreign oil. Fifty-nine percent were in favor if the result was less gasoline consumption and less global warming. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>''The tax would have to be earmarked for certain specific projects,'' one of the people polled, Rich Arnold, 54, a Republican who teaches criminal justice at Louisiana State University, said in a follow-up interview. He added, ''If it was a tax that would sponsor research for fuel cells or alternative fuel sources, I could buy that.''</p>
        <p>Some people were concerned that a higher gasoline tax would find its way into what they considered the wrong hands -- unless it were directed to a specific use, just as the current 18.4-cent tax is channeled into highway maintenance and construction. Lisa Fisher, a 36-year-old yoga instructor in Chicago who described herself as a Democrat, wants any additional revenue earmarked.</p>
        <p>''If the tax is increased and oil companies reap the benefit, I would be against it,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''But if the tax money went to the development of electric cars, I would favor the higher tax. It is important we are not dependent on foreign oil. We are over there fighting because we are dependent.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-four percent of those polled said they would support a higher federal gasoline tax if the new revenue was used to help fight terrorism, and 28 percent would go along with a gasoline tax increase if, as an offset, their income taxes or payroll taxes were lowered. Betty Forde, 46, an administrator for the New York City Police Department, fell into this category.</p>
        <p>''Taxes in general are very high,'' said Ms. Forde, who earns $50,000 a year and does not own a car or drive.</p>
        <p>''This may be a bit selfish on my part,'' she said, ''but I use taxis a lot, and if the gasoline tax goes up, they are going to charge me more. There must be some offset.''</p>
        <p>Many mainstream economists believe that a shift that raises the gasoline tax while lowering income-based taxes is the most efficient way to reduce consumption. It might require a $1-a-gallon increase in the tax phased in over five years, said Severin Borenstein, director of an energy institute at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Because increasing the gas tax is regressive, falling hardest on those who can least afford it, Mr. Borenstein would offset the bite by lowering income taxes in a way that would ''make most middle and lower income people better off.'' But they would end up driving less because of the rising cost of gasoline, some economists believe. By Mr. Borenstein's calculation, a 10 percent increase in the price of gasoline reduces consumption by 6 to 8 percent ''over the long run.''</p>
        <p>A higher tax might have carried some weight with Rosalee Evans of Norfolk, Va., before the price of gasoline broke above $2 a gallon last March and peaked in early September, a week after Hurricane Katrina, at $3.07. The nationwide average for regular-grade gasoline has since fallen, to $2.24 a gallon last week, the Energy Department reports. That includes the federal tax and 21.04 cents, on average, in various state and local taxes.</p>
        <p>''At least get the price down to $2 or $2.10 a gallon,'' said Ms. Evans, who works for a firm that brings entertainers to the Tidewater area and who drives a lot, recruiting talent. ''I could live with that price, and then I would consider raising the federal gasoline tax to combat global warming, but a reasonable tax increase, not a big one.''</p>
        <p>A falling gasoline price, however, would undermine the pressure on people to buy fuel-efficient cars and move closer to their work, reducing their commute.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the transition would be painful, even punitive, said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. To speed things, he would funnel some of the additional tax revenue to manufacturers ''as an incentive to offer more efficient vehicles, like hybrid cars.''</p>
        <p>Vincent Bussey, who earns $34,000 maintaining computers at a bank in Los Angeles, agreed. Like most of those polled, he opposed a higher gasoline tax unless it were used to develop ''new technologies that made the nation somewhat more self-reliant.''</p>
