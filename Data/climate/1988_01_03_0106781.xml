        <p>LEAD: PUERTO RICO'S beaches, historic fortresses, rain forest and charming old capital have long been lures for visitors. But its newest point of interest isn't new at all. It is a prehistoric network of caves with an underground river running through it, a hidden, wondrous world in the depths of the earth.</p>
        <p>PUERTO RICO'S beaches, historic fortresses, rain forest and charming old capital have long been lures for visitors. But its newest point of interest isn't new at all. It is a prehistoric network of caves with an underground river running through it, a hidden, wondrous world in the depths of the earth.</p>
        <p>The caves, opened to the public last winter, lie far beneath the surface of the 268-acre Parque de las Cavernas del Rio Camuy, a 90-minute drive from San Juan. Through the caves runs the Rio Camuy, the third largest underground river in the world, surpassed only by rivers in Yugoslavia and in Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <p>Millions of years of erosion have created this nine-mile shadowy corridor. The Taino Indians, who occupied the area long before Columbus discovered the island, must have used these caverns, because their petroglyphs appear at some cave entrances.</p>
        <p>More recently, Puerto Ricans have caught river shrimp here and, where the river comes to the surface, farmed its fertile banks. Some daring residents of the three towns above the caves, Camuy, Hatillo and Lares, have wandered through the caves on their own and even swum in the underground river.</p>
        <p>In 1958, the mainland speleologists Russell and Jeanne Gurnee, began to explore and chart the underground regions. In 1980, another speleologist, Jose A. Martinez Oquendo, proposed creating a park here for the public.</p>
        <p>The park is now established, and at its heart, set amid gardens and fountains, is a cluster of modern buildings, including a cafeteria, a souvenir counter, a breezeway and an administration building. There are also a playground, a picnic area and an 84-seat theater.</p>
        <p>After purchasing tickets, visitors enter the theater and see a 12-minute film about the caves. Then they walk down an inclined plane and take a seat in one of five open-air, rubber-tired, orange trolleys specially designed for the descent to the caves. Three trolleys each carry 30 people and two carry 45. Each also carries two bilingual guides who accompany visitors throughout their journey. The descent begins down a narrow, milelong concrete path into the 200-foot-deep ravine, actually a collapsed sinkhole. The tortuous trail took more than a year to build, because it was inaccessible to motorized building equipment and had to be constructed by workers using only hand tools and wheelbarrows.</p>
        <p>The chasm is filled with tropical ferns and trees, some of them 60 feet tall, including cedar, elm, mahogany, flame, ceiba, papaya and banana, with unripened fruit suspended from branches. The trolley riders also encounter flowers like the miramelinda (impatiens) and the tupa (the only poisonous plant in Puerto Rico) and a large variety of birds and butterflies.</p>
        <p>AS the trolleys proceed downward, taking hairpin turns in their stride, riders might feel as though they were on a slow-motion roller coaster. But the pace is moderate - the posted maximum speed is 15 miles an hour. All the way down, the guide uses a loudspeaker to tell something of the recent history of the caves and the work necessary to make them accessible.</p>
        <p>The visitors learn that Puerto Rico abounds in caves, although ''only'' 220 of them have so far been documented, and that none of the others matches this cave system in size and grandeur. All of Puerto Rico's caves were created over millions of years by carbon dioxide mixing with water to form carbonic acid, which then dissolved limestone in the ground, fashioning caves, sinkholes, stalactites and stalagmites.</p>
        <p>The young, enthusiastic guides - there are 18 of them, some of them spelunkers themselves - pay tribute to the Gurnees, who, in a decade of exploring, charted the size of the immense cave network, but they mention other pioneers with deference: Norman Veve, ''the father of Puerto Rican speleology,'' who founded the first Puerto Rico caving club; an Australian scientist, Murray Lewis, who worked at the nearby Arecibo Observatory and in the 1970's and 1980's risked falling rocks and drowning in sumps as he and associates crawled and climbed through the caves, and Mr. Veve's daughter Thalia, who is currently at work mapping the cave rooms in greater detail.</p>
        <p>Happily, a visit today will be nothing like those early dangerous explorations, which cost three lives, but it will be thrilling enough. Toward the bottom of the ravine, a visitor feels the cool air from the caverns, and finally disembarks for a 45-minute walk starting at the mouth of Clara Cave, one of 16 in the system. The entrance, resplendent with stalactites, is 25 feet wide and 70 feet high. It leads to a cavern about 700 feet long, 170 feet high and 200 feet wide. Clara takes its name from the natural light that penetrates the cave from the main entrance and from another one farther on.</p>
        <p>The guide now leads the group down a paved walk along one side of Clara Cave. The vegetation and sunlight gradually disappear, and the air grows cooler as the group moves deeper into the cavern. Past a natural spring that runs through Clara Cave lies the Sculpture Room, named for the massive shapes carved by erosion. Next comes the South Gallery, an expanse of shadowy forms, with stone draperies hanging in a vast petrified cathedral.</p>
        <p>From October until early March, from about 2:30 to 3:30 P.M. each day, the sun strikes the drops of water coming through the porous limestone and creates a curtain of mist over the entrance to Clara Cave. But at all times the view is majestic, with contrasts between light and shade created by carefully placed electric lights. Footsteps echo, voices take on a deep resonance as they rebound from afar, and those noises mix with the constant sound of flowing and dripping water and, unexpectedly, the chirping of crickets.</p>
        <p>Next on the walk is the Central Room, large enough to hold a 17-story building and still growing. Here visitors see the Giant Stalagmite, the largest in Puerto Rico, 17 feet high with a diameter of 30 feet. Farther along, at the entrance to the North Gallery, a pool mirrors the Empalme Sinkhole, rising 419 feet above it, with the roots of some of the vegetation reaching down from the top, striating the rocks. On the north face of the sinkhole apppears the entrance to the dead-end High Cave of the North, 80 feet high and 210 feet deep.</p>
        <p>The walk continues on a new trail that goes up stairs and down inclines and then enters the winding path called the Labyrinth. Peering over a protective wall, visitors can see the river 150 feet below. Also visible are the ragged jaws of a dark gallery a half-mile long, the home of thousands of bats, the only mammals native to the caves and the only creatures, except for humans, who leave it. Other cave dwellers are spiders and, in the river, shrimp, as long as 22 inches.</p>
        <p>THE path gradually winds back to the mouth of the cave, where again the group boards the trolleys for the return ride. Once more, the trolleys pass the thick vegetation and flowers in bloom, and then the brilliant sun reappears. The contrast to the underworld walk is striking, even bewildering. The guides report that these caves are small compared with others that the Puerto Rican Land Administration will open to the public over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>One of these caves, the Sumidero de Tres Pueblos, or Three Towns' Sinkhole, joined to Clara Cave through the Labyrinth, is six times as big as the Empalme Sinkhole and large enough (650 feet in diameter and 400 feet deep) to contain El Morro fortress, which is at the entrance to San Juan Harbor. As the trolleys approach the landing stage, a visitor resolves to return as soon as the new caves are opened.  GETTING DOWN TO VISITING  The Caves</p>
        <p>Tickets to the caves are $4, $2.50 for children 2 to 12. The caves are open Wednesday to Sunday, 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., with the last tour starting at 4 P.M. For information, call the park 898-3100 or, in San Juan, 756-5555.</p>
        <p>To avoid the largest crowds, it is best to go on a weekday. If you do go on a weekend, try to get there early to avoid the worst congestion; Saturday is usually less crowded than Sunday. Wear flat, sturdy shoes and comfortable clothes, preferably with long sleeves. Photography is allowed.  Getting There</p>
        <p>You can rent a car in San Juan from any of the national car agencies and several local ones, all of them listed in the telephone directory, and in Que Pasa, the free monthly tourist magazine. Allow at least 90 minutes for the journey from San Juan to the park. Take the Diego Expressway (Route 22), a toll road (50 cents), and, where it ends, about 15 miles from San Juan, follow signs to Arecibo, first for about a quarter of a mile along Route 165, then for 27 miles on Route 2, to another section of Route 22 (25 cents more), the Arecibo bypass. On the bypass, look for the exit to Lares (the second exit to Route 129) and follow the round brown and white signs for 11 miles along Route 129 to the park's entrance on the left. Don't be misled by signs directing you to the privately owned Cueva de Camuy on the right of Route 129. Parking is $1 a car.  Dining Nearby</p>
        <p>The park has a cafeteria that sells hamburgers and other sandwiches, ice cream and candy. But if you want something more substantial, a 20-minute drive will bring you to the Restaurant El Buen Cafe (898-3495) on the outskirts of Hatillo. It is a clean, air-conditioned establishment with a bar, a spacious dining room with white napery and its own bakery. Among the offerings there are asopao, a thick stew made of chicken, shrimp or lobster ($3.95 to $8.95); red snapper or broiled lobster (priced according to size), and in season, dorado fillet ($7.95). There are steaks, plain, breaded or with onions ($6.95 to $10.95), but you may want to try stuffed medallion of beef, carne mechada, in a rich brown sauce and garnished with potato and pimento. It comes with rice and beans or you may substitute mofongo, a mixture of mashed plantain and pork crackling ($4.95 if ordered separately). Desserts include local papaya or pineapple, guava with cheese, flan or pastry you can select from the patisserie.</p>
        <p>To reach the restaurant take Route 129 back to Route 22, then five miles west to the near edge of Hatillo. The restaurant, open seven days a week, is well marked by a sign on the right of the highway. M. N. C.</p>
