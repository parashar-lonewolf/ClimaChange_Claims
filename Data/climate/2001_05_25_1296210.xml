        <p>ROBERT REDFORD is disappointed with President Bush. The president's speech on energy last week ''left me yearning for a straight story,'' Mr. Redford revealed on Wednesday's Op-Ed page, in an article outlining his thoughts on America's energy problems.</p>
        <p>The actor's ideas are ambitious, but they leave me yearning for an additional conservation measure that would benefit New York. The idea for it occurred to me at Mr. Redford's Sundance ski resort in Utah, while covering a symposium in 1989 on global warming. Called Greenhouse Glasnost, the meeting brought together Soviet and American scientists, politicians and celebrities, including Senator Bill Bradley, Tom Brokaw, Carl Sagan and Jane Pauley.</p>
        <p>The event began with a group hike up the mountain to a clearing where Mr. Redford made a toast to ''healing the planet.'' Then, after explaining that ''Native Americans have a special understanding and relationship with the earth that we would all do well to learn,'' he introduced two Indian chiefs to perform a ritual. As they recited prayers and lamented ''the white people's war on living things,'' they built a fire out of wood and sprinkled tobacco in it.</p>
        <p>It seemed a bit odd for a conference on cleansing the atmosphere to open with a ritualistic fire that wasted energy and spewed greenhouse gases mixed with the world's deadliest carcinogen. But then, the chiefs' profligacy was nothing compared with the audience's. We had come from all over the world in oil-burning airplanes and driven 50 miles in rented cars that spewed exhaust into the Rocky Mountain air.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, I see that the planet would have been healthier if we had all stayed home. (There was not a single tangible result of that conference.) But if we had to meet, we could have at least minimized the environmental damage by assembling in New York City, thereby eliminating or shortening most of the airplane and car trips. Instead of staying in cabins scattered throughout forestland, we would have crowded together in high-rise buildings that conserve open space and energy.</p>
        <p>I didn't make this suggestion at the conference because Mr. Redford already looked so pained by the planet's other problems. But now that he is advising everyone else of how to save energy, perhaps it's time to reconsider his habit of dragging people into the Rockies, most notably for the Sundance Film Festival. Why hold a festival for the movie industry in Utah?</p>
        <p>It makes sense for a festival promoting independent films to be held outside Los Angeles, but why not go all the way to New York? The Sundance festival already attracts so many New York critics, actors and producers that the locals complain about an annual invasion of P.I.B.'s -- Persons in Black. Moving the festival here would spare them a trip, enrich our economy and save energy.</p>
        <p>It wouldn't solve the nation's energy woes, but it would be less problematic than Mr. Redford's energy ideas. His Op-Ed article sounds suspiciously similar to the prescriptions at his conference in 1989. The environmentalists there predicted an end to energy shortages if the rest of America would just emulate the conservation and alternative-energy measures being practiced in their favorite state: California.</p>
        <p>MR. REDFORD continues to stress conservation measures like fuel-efficiency standards for cars, which sound harmless until you look at the added cost (which can vastly exceed the savings in gasoline) and the increased risk of being killed in smaller, lighter vehicles. The fuel-efficiency standards mandated during the 1970's have been estimated to cause 2,000 to 4,000 deaths a year -- a cumulative toll higher than the number of American deaths in the Vietnam War, as noted by Jerry Ralph Curry, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
        <p>Highway safety seems less important to Mr. Redford than protecting the environment against oil companies. His article, ''Bush vs. the American Landscape,'' warns that oil exploration would ''destroy'' America's ''wild places.'' But oil production equipment takes up relatively little space for a short time. Even a catastrophic oil spill causes only temporary damage.</p>
        <p>A ski resort, though, is a permanent blight on the environment. Mr. Redford has tried to be an ecologically sensitive developer at Sundance, but it won't be a ''wild place'' until he abandons it. Giving up his home and resort in the Rockies would restore a bit of wilderness and enable him to spend more time at the home he already owns in the most ecologically correct place in America: New York City. Once he abandons his own battle against the American landscape, we can join him in another toast to healing the planet.</p>
