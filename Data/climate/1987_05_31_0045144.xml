        <p>LEAD: Industrial chemicals are eating away at the high ozone layer that shields life from the sun's harmful ultra-violet rays. To most people the solution is obvious: Cut production of those chemicals and find alternatives. Not to Donald Hodel, the Secretary of the Interior, and William Graham, the President's science adviser.</p>
        <p>Industrial chemicals are eating away at the high ozone layer that shields life from the sun's harmful ultra-violet rays. To most people the solution is obvious: Cut production of those chemicals and find alternatives. Not to Donald Hodel, the Secretary of the Interior, and William Graham, the President's science adviser. They object to the State Department's efforts to negotiate an international production freeze. If ultra-violet radiation increases, says Mr. Hodel, people could wear more sunglasses, hats and suntan lotion.</p>
        <p>Like Marie Antoinette advising breadless French peasants to eat cake, Mr. Hodel and Mr. Graham come at the facts from an odd perspective.</p>
        <p>Ultra-violet light doesn't just cause a pleasant tan. Larger amounts may induce skin cancer and melanoma. Mr. Hodel pooh-poohs that inconvenience: ''People who don't stand out in the sun - it doesn't affect them,'' he says. But the Secretary seems to have forgotten about animals. Will the cows be decked out in Vuarnets and sun hats, or be trained to graze at night?</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodel and Mr. Graham believe there's no hard evidence for the thousands of extra skin cancer cases predicted by the Environmental Protection Agency, and that E.P.A. ignores likely changes in behavior and technology. They're right, but it makes little difference. The risk of substantially increasing the planet's ultra-violet exposure, to safeguard chemicals for which easy alternatives are within reach, is not worth running. The ozone issue has been debated for 13 years, and broad agreement has now been reached that the threat is serious, even though many uncertainties remain. If the delicate ozone veil should be seriously damaged, the food chains of both land and ocean could be disrupted and all life on Earth would be at risk. The computer models that project the threat are uncertain, of course, but biologists have no doubt of the effect.</p>
        <p>The United States has led the world in identifying the danger and taking steps to avert it. The threat to the ozone layer comes from chlorofluorocarbons, the unusually long-lived chemicals used as refrigerants, in auto air-conditioning and to make plastic foam. There is no major obstacle to finding suitable alternatives. DuPont, the world's largest manufacturer of chlorofluorocarbons, says it could economically produce safe and effective substitutes within five years.</p>
        <p>After months of deft negotiation, the State Department pulled off a diplomatic triumph last month in persuading recalcitrant Europeans to reduce production by 20 percent. The next step was to secure agreement on a 50 percent reduction.</p>
        <p>That's the point at which Mr. Hodel and Mr. Graham have chosen to intervene, seeking to undermine the State Department's position. Their meddling threatens to force the United States from a widely admired position of leadership into humiliating retreat. If agreement cannot be reached even on so clear-cut a danger as the ozone threat, there is even less hope of international action against acid rain and the feared global warming of the atmosphere, known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>The Secretary of the Interior, charged with conserving the natural environment, and the President's science adviser, who is meant to understand it, should be educating their colleagues not leading the plunge into sunlit darkness.</p>
