        <p>'MACBETH' In previews; opens on June 28.

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2006) Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter putdowns clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'IN THE MATTER OF J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER'  In the title role, Thomas Jay Ryan makes morality, in its truest sense, look fashionable. This is a long but frequently gripping play of literate talk and real ideas (2:45). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE PORCH' Kari Floren, who wrote this comedy about three unwanted guests at a failing B &amp; B, takes a battering-ram approach to forcing her figures into her plot: there's a lot of noise and messiness along the way. But after establishing her four stereotypes (the abrasive and lonely career woman, the failed alcoholic writer, the gay dancer and the confused ex-dancer with commitment issues, who all declaim in loud, loud voices), she pulls off a surprise ending that manages to confer considerably more credibility on the enterprise (1:30). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, second floor, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>* 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30). T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Phoebe Hoban)</p>
        <p>* 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!'  This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'IN BETWEEN THE SHEETS' Based on three short stories by Ian McEwan, this trilogy is billed as the first-ever theatrical adaptation of the author's works. But the writer-director, Seth Duerr, doesn't provide a strong enough hand to replace the author's voice that's lost in the move from page to stage (1:30). Theater 54 in the Shetler Studios, 244 West 54th Street, 12th floor, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2006) Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Movies</p>
        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'CROSSING THE BRIDGE: THE SOUND OF ISTANBUL' (No rating, 91 minutes, in German, Turkish and English) If life were fair and film exhibition better, you could watch Fatih Akin's infectiously enjoyable survey of contemporary Turkish music while standing up, or, more ideally, while swaying, spinning and shimmying. But whether you sit or spin, remember to tell the projectionist to crank up the volume. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER' (No rating, 96 minutes) An engrossing if intellectually thin made-for-British-television documentary that purports to explain how suicide bombing -- which its narrator, Robert Baer, likens to a ''pathological virus'' -- evolved from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror and finally, in Iraq, a ''weapon of chaos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE HEART OF THE GAME' (PG-13, 98 minutes) A documentary look from the newcomer Ward Serrill at the hoop dreams of both a girls' high school basketball team and of the tough-talking, softhearted coach who guides them to their championship season. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'bombon-EL PERRO' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Spanish) A lonely, unemployed, middle-aged man finds a glimmer of hope when he acquires a purebred show dog in this sweet, gritty neo-realist fable from Argentina. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) This weekend's features in this annual festival, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, include ''Amu'' (2005), about a young Indian-American and the 1984 Sikh massacre in Delhi; ''Winter in Baghdad'' (2005), a Spanish documentary about the effects of the United States invasion of Iraq; and ''Rosita'' (2005), the true story of a pregnant 9-year-old rape victim in Nicaragua.

The weekend's films, all from 2005, include ''Gangster,'' a particularly bloody crime flick from Malaysia; ''The Great Yokai War,'' which has been described as Takashi Miike's ''Lord of the Rings''; and ''Cromartie High School,'' a Japanese spoof of juvenile delinquent movies, with robots, demons and space monkeys. 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181; $9. (Gates)</p>

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>AFI (Thursday) This band, whose name stands for A Fire Inside, gives its funereal emo songs a jolt of energy by reaching back to the anthemic hard-core punk of 1980's groups like Agnostic Front and Naked Raygun. The recipe works: this week, on the strength of its catchy single ''Miss Murder,'' the band's new album, ''Decemberunderground'' (Interscope), went to No. 1. Also on the bill are Dillinger Escape Plan, which plays an impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz, and Nightmare of You. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>LAURIE ANDERSON (Tomorrow) Her entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and witty, reflective monologues with a seamless dream logic. At this outdoor concert, part of the Celebrate Brooklyn series, she will play new, old and improvised pieces, and will be joined by the Tuvan throat singers of Chirgilchin, who also open the show. At 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BABY GRAMPS (Tomorrow through Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is in his hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776. Sunday at 9 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500; free. Monday at 9:30 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 529-8463; free. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Zebulon Cafe, 258 Wythe Avenue, near North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BEIRUT (Tuesday) Zach Condon, a 19-year-old from Albuquerque, has already made albums inspired by the Magnetic Fields and classic doo-wop. For his latest, ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), released under the name Beirut, he turned to the somber and ecstatic marches of Balkan Gypsy music. On the album Mr. Condon plays most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself, but for this tour he is joined by a full band. With A Hawk and a Hacksaw. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CHUCK BERRY (Tonight) Half a century ago, in songs like ''Maybellene'' and ''Johnny B. Goode,'' Chuck Berry hit on a formula that gives him as much a claim as anybody to being the inventor of rock 'n' roll: a taut, fast boogie derived from R &amp; B, matched to lyrics that celebrate the carefree, mythical teenage lifestyle. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $90. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BLUE CHEER (Sunday and Tuesday) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960's and early 70's, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the members sound like cavemen discovering fire. Sunday at 9 p.m., with Dead Meadow, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $15. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with the Black Hollies, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>'BROADWAY BY THE YEAR: THE MUSICALS OF 1978' (Monday) In the last program this season of Town Hall's Broadway by the Year series, ''Ain't Misbehavin','' ''Eubie!,'' ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' ''On the Twentieth Century'' and other shows from 1978 get the oh-what-a-time treatment from Carolee Carmelo, Mary Bond Davis, Chuck Cooper, Felicia Finley, Julie Garnye, Nancy Opel, Noah Racey, Christine Pedi, Lennie Watts and Lari White. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $40 and $45. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO, MARAH (Thursday) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. The band Marah's articulate songs are doused in greasy, sweaty, exuberant rock. At 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960's and 70's -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE FIGGS (Tonight) Joining the pop-punk lineage that stretches back to the early, rowdy Beatles and any number of 1960's garage bands, the Figgs make their guitars blare through the neat constructions of their songs. They sing about rejects and romantic also-rans, with a streak of resentment that's as strong as their melodic skills. With Tommy Keene and Seth Tiven. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* ARETHA FRANKLIN (Tuesday and Wednesday) Aretha Franklin has said she intends to stop extensive touring, but she keeps coming back, to grateful crowds. She gives her first concerts at the Apollo Theater in more than 20 years. At 8 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $77 to $177. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>'FROM B TO Z' (Tomorrow) The avant-garde band the Z's, whose songs sputter forth in Morse-code dots of percussion and saxophone, kicks off a tour at this ''episode'' in a series of casual artistic gatherings. The night also features music by Electroputas, Lake, Vizusa and Legend, projections by Meredith Arena and dance by Skint. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GOMEZ (Wednesday) This British band emerged in the mid-1990's, the heyday of Britpop, with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its new album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), it has veered into folkier realms, though it still plays with unusual precision and focus. Also on the bill is Martha Wainwright, whose passionate songs swirl from her acoustic guitar into grand arrangements but never lose their intimacy. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ETTA JAMES, SUSAN TEDESCHI (Tuesday) In 1954 a teenage Etta James made her first record, ''The Wallflower (Dance With Me, Henry),'' a flirty response to Hank Ballard's hit ''Work With Me, Annie,'' and she has been singing sexy, assertive blues and R &amp; B ever since. She comes to Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, with Susan Tedeschi, a singer and guitarist who blends some soul and funk into her blues. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LEGENDARY PINK DOTS (Monday and Tuesday) Since 1980, Edward Ka-Spel has led the Legendary Pink Dots through songs that hold on to the psychedelia of 1967-68; they set his surreal imagery and hints of gothic legend to music that can be amiable, chaotic or eerie. With One Bit Music on Monday and Beat the Devil on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>LOS LONELY BOYS (Tuesday and Thursday) These three West Texan brothers reached No. 1 on the adult contemporary charts a couple of years ago with the breezy Tex-Mex blues of ''Heaven.'' A new album, ''Sacred'' (Or/Epic), is due next month. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with the singer-songwriter Justin King, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., with the soul singer James Hunter, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>McDONALD'S GOSPELFEST (Tonight through Sunday) This competition and performance series puts amateurs and gospel's biggest stars on the same stage. This year those stars include Donnie McClurkin, the Rev. Hezekiah Walker and the Love Fellowship Tabernacle Choir, Vickie Winans, Cissy Houston and Tye Tribbett. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4:30, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; $35 to $100. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, has been playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub; this weekend's show is her last. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing opens on Tuesday with the 14-piece Jonathan Stout Orchestra, featuring the singer Hilary Alexander, in big-band favorites by Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and others. Wednesday is a Gay Pride salute, with Martha Wash and friends, and Thursday features QuinTango, said to be the only tango music group to give a command performance at the White House.

        <p>RHETT MILLER, TEDDY THOMPSON, OLLABELLE (Tomorrow) Country and folk will get three varied readings at Central Park SummerStage tomorrow. Rhett Miller, whether with his country-flavored bar band Old 97's or in solo heartthrob mode, is an unrepentant honky-tonker with a gift for melody. Teddy Thompson is the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, and he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks. Ollabelle worships country, bluegrass and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) Led by Chantal Claret -- who, when not whipping her hair into a brunet cloud, struts the stage in a hypersexualized trance -- Morningwood plays quick, jumpy, New Wave vamps about one of two things: sex and rock. With Rock Kills Kid and Big City Rock. At 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NINE INCH NAILS, BAUHAUS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Trent Reznor waited six years to make another Nine Inch Nails album, but ''With Teeth,'' released last year, showed that Mr. Reznor's talents for disorienting electronica, self-flagellating lyrics and, most of all, cathartic tantrums of noise, have remained intact. This summer Nine Inch Nails is touring with Bauhaus, whose bleak and shadowy songs helped create goth-rock in the late 1970's and early 80's. Also on the bill is Peaches, whose bawdy electro-punk burlesque provides its own kind of catharsis. Tonight at 7, PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; $29.50 to $49.50. Tomorrow night at 7, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; $29.50 to $49.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ODETTA (Thursday) Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and spirituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. At noon, BAM Rhythm &amp; Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; free. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS (Tuesday) Tom Petty is going all out for his current tour, celebrating 30 years with the Heartbreakers. Peter Bogdanovich is working on a documentary, and the roster of guests for dates later in the summer includes Pearl Jam and the Allman Brothers. At Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, the opening act will be Trey Anastasio from Phish, and Stevie Nicks is to join the band for, among others, ''Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,'' her duet with Mr. Petty that still sounds as achy and soulful as it did in 1981. At 8 p.m., (212) 465-6741; $45 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SMOKEY ROBINSON (Thursday) As part of the JVC Jazz Festival, the Motown prince makes his first appearance at Carnegie Hall in 31 years. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SLAYER, LAMB OF GOD, MASTODON, CHILDREN OF BODOM (Tonight) Here is a quick primer on the meaner side of heavy metal over the last couple of decades. Slayer emerged in the early 1980's with a hellish, claustrophobic sound -- all foreboding skies and tormented vocals -- and has stuck steadfastly to it. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Mastodon reaches into avant-garde noise and progressive rock, and Children of Bodom, from Finland, is an exemplar of the operatically dismal black-metal school. At 5:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $39. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY AND THE ASBURY JUKES (Tomorrow and Sunday) While his friend Bruce Springsteen left the Jersey Shore behind and went on to write all-American anthems and parables, Southside Johnny Lyon stuck to the old bar-band basics: rolling R &amp; B vamps and raspy-voiced, good-natured soul plaints, complete with horn section. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH THE SEEGER SESSIONS BAND (Thursday) A hootenanny of musicians, playing banjos, accordions, fiddles and guitars, accompanies Bruce Springsteen in folk songs of work, hardscrabble survival and political anger -- the Depression-era ''How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live'' gets a Hurricane Katrina rewrite -- from his latest album, ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' (Columbia). At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $59.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>TAKFARINAS (Sunday) The Algerian singer Hassen Zermani, who performs as Takfarinas and plays a double-necked lute, blends Berber music with reggae and electronic pop. With Chris Berry and Panjea. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* LEE ANN WOMACK (Tonight) Ms. Womack drew the respect of Nashville and lots of new fans with last year's ''There's More Where That Came From,'' whose heartfelt reflections, conservative arrangements and outstanding songwriting represented an ideal of country music. At 8, St. George Theater, 35 Hyatt Street, Staten Island, (718) 442-2900 or (212) 307-7171; $50 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YELLOWCARD (Wednesday) Yellowcard's mopey lyrics and nursery-rhyme pop-punk might sound like generic emo-rock until you hear the violin. And even then  At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $26 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>Cabaret</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden)</p>

At 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BEN ALLISON'S COWBOY JUSTICE (Tuesday) The bassist Ben Allison has a knack for assembling hardy and sophisticated ensembles like this one, with Ron Horton on trumpet, Steve Cardenas on guitar and Gerald Cleaver on drums. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>BISHOP-CLEAVER-FLOOD (Tomorrow) As on his new album, ''Time and Imaginary Time'' (Envoi), the saxophonist Andrew Bishop engages in an equal exchange with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood, expanding compositional frames and exploring open space. At 9 p.m., Night and Day, 230 Fifth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, (718) 399-2161, www.nightanddayrestaurant.com; cover, $5 to $10, with a $7 drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHRIS BOTTI/LIZZ WRIGHT (Tomorrow) The world of contemporary jazz, as it's now called, has few stylists as consistently winsome as Mr. Botti, a trumpeter whose melodic understatement (along with a few celebrity endorsements) has translated into popular appeal. Ms. Wright is a young and self-assured singer whose soulful alto has emerged as one of jazz's most welcome new timbres. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BRAZIL NIGHTS (Wednesday through June 24) As part of the JVC Jazz Festival, the Jazz Standard offers four consecutive nights of Brazilian jazz, beginning with Choro Ensemble, a quintet that devotes itself to the choro, a traditional strain of cafe music (Wednesday), and Antropo-Fagia, a new quintet led by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and featuring the guitarist Romero Lubambo (Thursday). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set on Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVE BRUBECK'S BIRTHDAY PARTY: TAKE 5 PLUS 80 (Wednesday) At 85, Mr. Brubeck plays the piano with undiminished vigor and still maintains a punishing schedule. This concert features not only his well-traveled quartet but also a new big band, in its first New York performance. For good measure, Bill Cosby will also be there. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CLARINET MARMALADE (Tuesday) The clarinet, once a dominant instrument in jazz, has become something of a connoisseur's choice. This concert gathers a handful of its leading contemporary practitioners, with styles ranging from New Orleans traditional (Evan Christopher) to mainstream swing (Ken Peplowski, Kenny Davern) to ultramodern (Don Byron). At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CLARION CALL: A NEW ORLEANS TRUMPET CELEBRATION (Thursday) Four accomplished trumpeters from New Orleans -- Marlon Jordan, Kermit Ruffins, James Andrews and Christian Scott -- join a rhythm section with similar pedigree: David Torkanowsky on piano, Roland Guerin on bass and Herlin Riley on drums.

        <p>* ORNETTE COLEMAN QUINTET (Tonight) With an expanded version of the superb quartet first heard at a JVC Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall in 2003, the alto saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman pursues a holistic ideal of improvised group communication that's easier to recognize than define. His fellow adventurers are Tony Falanga and Greg Cohen on double basses, Al MacDowell on electric bass, and Denardo Coleman, his son, on drums. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tuesday through June 24) Mr. Coltrane, the tenor and soprano saxophonist, has developed one of the strongest working bands in jazz over the past few years. For this engagement the group's ranks -- with Luis Perdomo on piano, Drew Gress on bass and E. J. Strickland on drums -- are augmented by a guest guitarist, David Gilmore. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30; $35 on Fridays and Saturdays, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RICHARD GALLIANO'S NEW YORK TRIO (Monday through Thursday) Mr. Galliano is a technically dazzling accordion player with a flair for romanticism. For this engagement he enlists the polished rhythm team of George Mraz on bass, and Al Foster on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through June 25) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ -- like the saxophonists James Moody, Frank Wess and Jimmy Heath -- as well as Roy Hargrove, the trumpeter enlisted to fill his shoes here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Sunday) In the late 1960's, Mr. Hutcherson defined a commanding, harmonically exploratory post-bop vibraphone style. He has lost none of his prowess, as he has demonstrated in recent years with the SFJAZZ Collective, and as he further proves here, with a rhythm section composed of Renee Rosnes on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Willie Jones III on drums. At 3 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, 515 Lenox Avenue, at West 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200; $20; members, $17. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LEE KONITZ (Through Sunday; Tuesday and Wednesday) This weekend Mr. Konitz lends his august reputation and dry-martini alto saxophone tone to a nine-piece band, featuring arrangements by the tenor saxophonist Ohad Talmor. Next week he pares down to a trio, with the bassist John Hebert and the drummer George Schuller. Through Sunday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an additional 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20.

        <p>BRAD MEHLDAU (Tuesday) In his solo piano recitals Mr. Mehldau blends judicious pop offerings, archaic songbook standards and intricate originals, employing a touch that runs from sprightly to somber. His recent solo album ''Live in Tokyo'' (Nonesuch) was a noteworthy achievement, and time has only deepened his ambidextrous grace. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARCUS MILLER BAND/ROY HARGROVE AND RH FACTOR (Tonight) There may not be a funkier electric bassist than Mr. Miller, who is still best known for his work with the late, synthesizer-strewn bands of Miles Davis. Mr. Miller's own ensemble includes a Milesian trumpeter, Patches Stewart, as well as the drummer Poogie Bell, the saxophonist Keith Anderson, the keyboardist Bobby Sparks and the harmonica virtuoso Grégoire Maret. Some of those musicians also have ties to RH Factor, a neo-soul outfit led by Mr. Hargrove, a sharp and ever-poised trumpeter. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $30. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>NU JAZZ TODAY! (Tonight) This concert, which inaugurates the Central Park SummerStage season, assembles four acts that spike their grooves with avant-garde experimentation. In ascending order of abstraction, they are Nils Petter Molvaer, a Norwegian trumpeter specializing in electronic textures; Groundtruther, composed of the guitarists Charlie Hunter and Elliott Sharp and the drummer Bobby Previte; Sex Mob, a quartet equally enamored of Billy Preston and Albert Ayler; and Matthew Shipp, a pianist and composer drawn to thorny pointillism. At 7, Central Park SummerStage, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; www.summerstage.org; free. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BUCKY PIZZARELLI 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Monday) Warmth and wit are assured in this party for Mr. Pizzarelli, the venerable swing guitarist. Among the many musicians on hand are the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen, the clarinetist Ken Peplowski and several fine guitarists (Howard Alden, Gene Bertoncini) and guitarist-singers (like Kenny Rankin and John Pizzarelli, Mr. Pizzarelli's son). At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that is intellectual and athletic in equal measure. His funk-fusion band Underground, originally formed at the 55 Bar, returns there tonight. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROB REDDY QUINTET (Tuesday) Mr. Reddy is a soprano and alto saxophonist with a taste for ragged polyphony; he features his own compositions in this group with the guitarist Jef Lee Johnson, the pianist Michael Cain, the bassist Dom Richards and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JASON RIGBY QUARTET (Monday) ''Translucent Space'' (Fresh Sound-New Talent), the new album by the saxophonist and bass clarinetist Jason Rigby, doesn't come by its name casually; it's an album of airy, often diaphanous music, with faint echoes of early fusion and Third Stream. Mr. Rigby plays here with the album's rhythm section of Mike Holober on piano, Cameron Brown on bass and Mark Ferber on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>NED ROTHENBERG, GERRY HEMINGWAY, ALEX WATERMAN (Tonight) Extended techniques and broad textural range are both assured in this ensemble, which consists of Mr. Rothenberg on saxophones, clarinets and shakuhachi; Mr. Waterman on cello; and Mr. Hemingway on drums and percussion. At 8, Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* SANGAM: CHARLES LLOYD, ZAKIR HUSSAIN, ERIC HARLAND (Thursday) This collaborative trio recently released a gripping self-titled album documenting its first performance, in 2004. The group has toured since then, and its exploratory rapport has sharpened; what remains the same is the quality of its components, from the saxophones and flutes of Mr. Lloyd to the percussive virtuosity of Mr. Hussain (on tablas) and Mr. Harland (on drum kit). At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SWEET LORRAINE: A JAZZ CELEBRATION FOR THE VILLAGE VANGUARD (Monday) Lorraine Gordon, the owner and proprietor of the Village Vanguard, receives a fitting tribute from some of the top-shelf bands that have been regulars at the club: the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, with the saxophonist Joe Lovano as a guest; the Roy Hargrove Quintet, with the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson; a group led by the drummer Paul Motian, featuring the saxophonist Chris Potter; Dr. Michael White's Original Liberty Jazz Band, from New Orleans; and the Bad Plus. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RALPH TOWNER (Wednesday) Mr. Towner has perfected a solo guitar style of exceptional fullness, as he recently demonstrated on a gem of an album called ''Time Line'' (ECM). In all likelihood, he'll perform an equally entrancing program here. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TRIO BRAAMDEJOODEVATCHER (Tonight) The unwieldy name of this Dutch piano trio is merely a combination of surnames: Michiel Braam, pianist; Wilbert de Joode, bassist; and Michael Vatcher, drummer. As heard on an appealing new live album, ''Change This Song'' (Bik Bent Braam), the group practices a strain of modern jazz that's pliable, playful and rhythmically capricious. At 7:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* VISION FESTIVAL XI (Through Sunday) Avant-garde jazz culture has no better colloquy in this country than the Vision Festival, which encompasses experimental dance and visual arts as well as improvised music. Its final few days include promising panel discussions and afternoon performances, but the focus remains on the evening concerts, featuring luminaries like the violinist Billy Bang (tonight) and the saxophonist and composer Roscoe Mitchell (tomorrow). Sunday's closing act, scheduled for 9 p.m., is being billed as the final United States performance of the saxophonist David S. Ware's celebrated quartet. Times vary, with activities running from the afternoon past midnight at Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, visionfestival.org; $25 per night. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MATT WILSON AND TED NASH (Monday) Mr. Wilson, a drummer, and Mr. Nash, a saxophonist and flutist, have played together in each other's groups (and other settings) for years, so they should have no problem connecting in a duo setting. Among the traits they have in common: rhythmic flexibility, melodic directness and an aversion to pretension and cliché. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Chinen)</p>

(Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS  (Tonight) There are contemporary chamber music ensembles, and then there are the Locrian Chamber Players, a vehemently contemporary chamber music ensemble. The group's operating principle is to perform only works written within the last 10 years. If this policy seems unduly restrictive, looked at another way, it's fresh and exciting, and represents the group's conviction that there are enough worthy works being written right now to assure varied and engaging programs. Tonight the ensemble plays works by the major German composer Wolfgang Rihm, as well as by John Adams, Tom Johnson, David MacDonald and Jonathan Faiman (a pianist with the ensemble). The free concerts are held in the intimate and acoustically vibrant performance space on the 10th floor of Riverside Church, which even boasts an open-air balcony accessible during intermission. At 8, 91 Claremont Avenue, at 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (718) 458-4864. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>MANNES INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL FOR CONTEMPORARY PERFORMANCE (Thursday) The format resembles that at the Marlboro festival in Vermont, but the content is strictly modern. Starting this week and running through June 30, this year's institute focuses on violin, piano and percussion, offering young participants a chance to work with the likes of Frederic Rzewski and Curtis Macomber in master classes, open rehearsals and symposiums. The definition of contemporary seems to extend back to the early 20th century; at the first public concert on Thursday, Rolf Schulte, a violinist, and Marc Ponthus, a pianist and the institute's director, will play works by Krenek, Stockhausen, Mario Davidovsky and Richard Wilson. Events begin at 10:30 a.m.; the concert is at 8 p.m., Mannes College, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, Ext. 4884; free. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>TANNERY POND CONCERTS (Tomorrow) Christian Steiner is well known for his photography; less well known, perhaps, as a musician; and least known as the artistic director of this lovely little concert series, for which he lures leading musicians up to the Berkshires to perform in an enchanting little wooden hall. This weekend's offering is an all-Milhaud program, with the pianist Gilbert Kalish, the violinist Carmit Zori and other musicians. At 8 p.m., Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, New Lebanon, N.Y., (888) 820-9441; $25 and $30. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>ISH (Tonight through Sunday) This Dutch company presents ''4-ISH,'' a show that might be called hip-hop but is really hip-hoppish and involves many kinds of urban derring-do, including quarter pipes (as in skateboarding), kung fu, electrified skate wheels and a live D.J.

The opening attraction is CND2, whose name is short for the second company of Nacho Duato's Compañía Nacional de Danza from Spain.

        <p>Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery, and the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 1950's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demi-monde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range, and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1114 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* METropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710.(Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) Cotter)</p>
        <p>Museum of Arts &amp; Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>National Academy: '181st Annual: an Invitational Exhibition of Contemporary Art' This year's sprawling hodgepodge of an invitational presents works by 124 artists ranging from tightly focused realist painting to politically charged video installation. National Academy, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through June 18. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>Peter Dayton: 'Surfboards by Clement Greenberg' For a witty spin on commodity-critique art, Mr. Dayton creates panel paintings combining the glossy surfaces, colorful banding and logos of surfboard design and the striped patterns of paintings by Kenneth Noland and Barnett Newman that were favored by the powerful formalist critic Clement Greenberg. Winston Wächter, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of this artist's paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 7. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>'Coup de Foudre' Four works loosely related by the metaphor of lightning. Emilie Halpern offers a white plastic lightning bolt and walls papered by heat-sensitive film. Small cutouts by Tim Noble &amp; Sue Webster cast pornographic shadows; stick-on letters applied to the floor, walls and ceiling by Tamara Sussman spell out an erotic fantasy written in Web-based ''slash fiction'' style; and a surprisingly affecting, grainy, rambling video created by Enid Baxter Blader with a homemade camera explores stormy natural and emotional weather. Tina Kim, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 716-1100, through June 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>* 'Artists Against the State: Perestroika Revisited' Satiric and subversive Pop and Conceptualist works by more than 50 artists working in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the end of Communism. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by a young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly off-hand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through July 1. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles, related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* 'The Rest is Silence: James Lee Byars' New York only really started to wake up to James Lee Byars (1932-1997) when he died. Although born in the United States, he spent his formative years in Japan, where he developed a performance-based aesthetic of evanescance; and his main career was in Europe, where he adapted reductiveness to an art of material luxe. This three-gallery survey has some early work but focuses on the large-scale sculptures of his later years. It is tempting to fit him into existing slots: performance art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, whatever. But his extravagance and his privacy combine to keep him outside the fold, as do his his philosophical concerns: Big Ideas, or rather Big Questions, about perfection, death and eternity. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 526 West 24th Street, (212) 627-8000; 534 West 24th Street and 527 West 23rd Street; Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street and 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929); Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623. All through June 24. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Reto Boller A Swiss artist who has exhibited widely in Europe, Mr. Boller creates minimalist works in two and three dimensions that focus on color and texture. For his first exhibition in the United States, he has covered the walls and floor of a large section of this gallery with bright red adhesive material, to perceptually intense effect. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Loretta Lux By means of subtle digital manipulations, Ms. Lux turns color photographs of children in empty rooms into hallucinatory portraits of angelic beings with slightly oversized heads; big, soulful eyes; and beautiful clothes. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, through June 30. (Smith)</p>
        <p>RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* Mamma Andersson: 'Rooms Under the Influence' In haunting paintings of rooms and landscapes, this Swedish painter combines the sensuousness of Edouard Vuillard and the moody angst of Edvard Munch. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070; closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* MARCO BOGGIO SELLA: DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES OF THE AFRICAN ASTRONAUTS Combining a salon hanging with ethnographic displays, and works made by the artist in various collaborations with artisans of an impoverished village in Bukina Faso, this show opens a Pandora's box of artistic and ethical issues, and gives the viewer plenty to look at. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9523; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* JENNY HOLZER: ARCHIVE and NIGHT FEED Two exhibitions of new work present color photographs of poems projected on public buildings and silk-screen paintings that enlarge declassified, often heavily censored military and intelligence documents. The plight of the individual in an unforgiving (and in the second case, post-9/11) world is starkly evoked, but might be equally if not more effective in book form. Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, and Yvon Lambert New York, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* WANGECHI MUTU: AN ALIEN EYE AND OTHER KILLAH ANTHEMS This gallery debut includes opulent collage and ink paintings on Mylar of exotic creatures, sculpture and fierce little collages combining ethnographic postcards with pornographic images. It indicates extravagant artistic gifts, passion and pressing subjects but also suggests that too many options are under consideration. Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Company, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>REGENERATION: 50 PHOTOGRAPHERS OF TOMORROW A show of emerging and student photographers gives a surprisingly energetic view of the medium as unavoidably surreal, frequently digitalized and extremely ambiguous, in which the divisions among real, manipulated and set-up are concerned. Current trends are confirmed. Relatively straight photojournalism tends to carry the day. Aperture Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 505-5555; closing on Thursday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* THOMAS ZIPP: URANLICHT  An impressive solo debut pairs dark, nearly abstract landscapes and cursory botanical imagery with appropriated images of authoritarian bearded men, evoking a bygone avant-garde and the reaction against it. A room-filling hand-built organ that Père Ubu might have loved completes the presentation. HarrisLieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>

        <p>'KING LEAR' Previews start today. Opens Monday. He's played the Fool opposite Orson Welles's Lear, and Gloucester opposite F. Murray Abraham's. Finally Alvin Epstein, who is in his 80's, takes the lead in a production that received great word of mouth after a run in Boston last year (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C. Annex, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710.</p>
        <p>'MACBETH' In previews; opens on June 28. First at the Public in the park this year will be Moisés Kaufman's production of ''the Scottish play,'' starring Liev Schreiber, who went unto the breach at the Delacorte Theater in 2003 in ''Henry V'' (2:15). Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750.</p>
        <p>'PIG FARM' In previews; opens on June 27. The Roundabout Theater reunites part of the artistic team from ''Urinetown'' -- the playwright Greg Kotis and the director John Rando -- for this play about a couple struggling to hold onto their herd of pigs. Denis O'Hare stars (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300.</p>
        <p>'SATELLITES' In previews; opens on Sunday. This new play by Diana Son is about an interracial couple moving into a gentrifying neighborhood in Brooklyn. Sandra Oh stars; Michael Greif directs (1:45). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>'SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS' Previews start on Tuesday. Opens on July 6.

John Ortiz and Patricia Velasquez star. (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' In previews; opens on Tuesday. The Hourglass Group presents a stage adaptation of the 1932 film about two con artists who conspire to hoodwink an heir to a perfume empire (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' (Tony Award, Best Play Revival 2006) Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter putdowns clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' (Tony Award, Special Theatrical Event 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, Best Play and Best Direction of a Play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, Best Musical 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, Best Direction of a Musical 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Presented as a long, pansexual orgy, Scott Elliot's numbing revival of the Brecht-Weill classic feels like a party where the hangover begins almost as soon as the evening does. The starry cast includes Alan Cumming (as Mac the Knife) and a Dietrich-like Cyndi Lauper, though only Jim Dale and Nellie McKay appear to have a clue as to what the show is about (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'ASSISTED LOVING' This warm and witty monologue by Bob Morris, who contributes the Age of Dissonance column to the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times, is performed by the author, who chronicles his widowed father's and his own search for love in and around New York. Engaging, subtle and winning (1:10). Daryl Roth Theater, D-Lounge, 103 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'BURLEIGH GRIME$' A feeble-witted comedy by Roger Kirby about dirty dealings on Wall Street, featuring a pair of skilled actors known for recent television work -- Wendie Malick of ''Just Shoot Me'' and Mark Moses of ''Desperate Housewives'' -- and incidental music by David Yazbek, who wrote the score for Broadway's ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'' These putative assets are painfully ill served by Mr. Kirby's play, which is long on ludicrous plot and short on fresh humor. (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'CAGE LOVE' The new thriller by Christopher Denham -- star of ''Red Light Winter'' -- is a compulsively watchable, sometimes ridiculous drama about a man who becomes increasingly suspicious of his wife-to-be (1:30). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'CIRQUE DU SOLEIL -- CORTEO'  The Cirque du Soleil's latest extravaganza, which upholds the ubiquitous Cirque standard, is a fantasy of a dead (though cheerful) clown imagining his own funeral. Unsurprisingly, his cortege is full of circus acts (2:30). Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island, (800) 678-5440. (John Rockwell)</p>
        <p>'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE GOLD STANDARD' A successful alumnus, his trophy girlfriend and an eccentric Korean professor form a romantic triangle at a campus bar in Daniel Roberts's drama, which is occasionally original but often downright odd (2:30). The Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'IN THE MATTER OF J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER'  In the title role, Thomas Jay Ryan makes morality, in its truest sense, look fashionable. This is a long but frequently gripping play of literate talk and real ideas (2:45). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'NOTHING' A morsel of catnip for Anglophiles, flavorfully adapted by Andrea Hart from the novel by Henry Green. Simon Dutton and Sophie Ward play onetime lovers contemplating the possible marriage of their children in this comedy of manners about the string of upheavals that a romance in one generation causes in another (1:40). The 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE PORCH' Kari Floren, who wrote this comedy about three unwanted guests at a failing B &amp; B, takes a battering-ram approach to forcing her figures into her plot: there's a lot of noise and messiness along the way. But after establishing her four stereotypes (the abrasive and lonely career woman, the failed alcoholic writer, the gay dancer and the confused ex-dancer with commitment issues, who all declaim in loud, loud voices), she pulls off a surprise ending that manages to confer considerably more credibility on the enterprise (1:30). Altered Stages, 212 West 29th Street, Chelsea, second floor, (212) 279-4200. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will and Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'STOPPING TRAFFIC' The actress Mary Pat Gleason's endearing one-woman show about making movies (and just getting through life) while bipolar is a play with both a message and some hearty laughs (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BACK OF THE THROAT' An Arab-American playwright, Yussef El Guindi, addressing the harassment of Arab-Americans after Sept. 11? Interesting. But the play would have been even more interesting if the harassers were something other than cardboard characters out of the J. Edgar Hoover closet (1:15). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'HAM LAKE' A gregarious 20-something man reveals more than he intends to in this 80-minute seriocomic barroom monologue by Sam Rosen and Nat Bennett. Mr. Rosen is a wry and skilled earbender. Huron Club at the SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>* 'WAITING FOR GODOT' Vladimir (Wendell Pierce) and Estragon (J. Kyle Manzay) wait and wait, but in this version they're soaking wet, their desolate plot being surrounded by water. A familiar play is injected with surprises (2:00). Harlem School for the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 864-4444. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'AIN'T SUPPOSED TO DIE A NATURAL DEATH' Melvin Van Peebles's 1971 Tony-nominated musical, ''Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death,'' isn't so much performed at the club T New York, as erupted, like some sort of streetwise lava flow. This early precursor to hip-hop, rap and poetry slams is a get-down, roiling depiction of ghetto life, and we're not talking urbane bling (1:30). T New York, 240 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing tomorrow. (Phoebe Hoban)</p>
        <p>* 'BILLY CONNOLLY LIVE!'  This popular comedian will remind you of a Scottish George Carlin, with a bit of Eddie Izzard mixed in (2:00). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'DARK YELLOW' Elias Koteas and Tina Benko star in this compelling one-act psychological thriller about a one-night stand that involves one shocking revelation after another (1:35). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'IN BETWEEN THE SHEETS' Based on three short stories by Ian McEwan, this trilogy is billed as the first-ever theatrical adaptation of the author's works. But the writer-director, Seth Duerr, doesn't provide a strong enough hand to replace the author's voice that's lost in the move from page to stage (1:30). Theater 54 in the Shetler Studios, 244 West 54th Street, 12th floor, Clinton, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  (Tony Award, Best Musical Revival 2006) Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>

        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ART SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL' (R, 102 minutes) A lump of misanthropy from Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes, who made the sublime ''Ghost World.'' This time they plod through a grouchy attack on the pretense and hypocrisy of self-declared artists. John Malkovich's performance as a drawing instructor is sly and insightful, a glimpse at what the movie might have been. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'CROSSING THE BRIDGE: THE SOUND OF ISTANBUL' (No rating, 91 minutes, in German, Turkish and English) If life were fair and film exhibition better, you could watch Fatih Akin's infectiously enjoyable survey of contemporary Turkish music while standing up, or, more ideally, while swaying, spinning and shimmying. But whether you sit or spin, remember to tell the projectionist to crank up the volume. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE CULT OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER' (No rating, 96 minutes) An engrossing if intellectually thin made-for-British-television documentary that purports to explain how suicide bombing -- which its narrator, Robert Baer, likens to a ''pathological virus'' -- evolved from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror and finally, in Iraq, a ''weapon of chaos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE HEART OF THE GAME' (PG-13, 98 minutes) A documentary look from the newcomer Ward Serrill at the hoop dreams of both a girls' high school basketball team and of the tough-talking, softhearted coach who guides them to their championship season. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE KING' (R, 105 minutes) James Marsh uses clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere for his fitfully engaging, exasperating film about a young Mexican-American (Gael García Bernal) whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family (headed by a very fine William Hurt). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'bombon-EL PERRO' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Spanish) A lonely, unemployed, middle-aged man finds a glimmer of hope when he acquires a purebred show dog in this sweet, gritty neo-realist fable from Argentina. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'POSEIDON' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Wolfgang Petersen's ''Poseidon'' is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, ''Beyond the Poseidon Adventure''). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SEE NO EVIL' (R, 84 minutes) In ''See No Evil'' the wrestler Glen Jacobs (a k a Kane) plays a lumbering psychopath intent on butchering the juvenile delinquents on cleanup duty at the hotel where he's holed up. Propelled by an inebriated camera that careers off walls and, at one point, roots around in an empty eye socket, the movie soon devolves into a bloodily creative string of mutilations and impalings. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WATER' (PG-13, 114 minutes, in Hindi) Set in India in 1938, ''Water'' focuses on a group of widows condemned by Hindu law to live in an institution on the banks of the River Ganges. The arrival of a high-spirited 8-year-old girl encourages one widow to question her faith and another to begin a love affair with a Gandhian idealist. Bobbing back and forth between romantic melodrama and spiritual inquiry, ''Water'' is an exquisitely beautiful film about the institutionalized oppression of an entire class of women. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL (Through Thursday) This weekend's features in this annual festival, sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, include ''Amu'' (2005), about a young Indian-American and the 1984 Sikh massacre in Delhi; ''Winter in Baghdad'' (2005), a Spanish documentary about the effects of the United States invasion of Iraq; and ''Rosita'' (2005), the true story of a pregnant 9-year-old rape victim in Nicaragua.

BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>AFI (Thursday) This band, whose name stands for A Fire Inside, gives its funereal emo songs a jolt of energy by reaching back to the anthemic hard-core punk of 1980's groups like Agnostic Front and Naked Raygun. The recipe works: this week, on the strength of its catchy single ''Miss Murder,'' the band's new album, ''Decemberunderground'' (Interscope), went to No. 1. Also on the bill are Dillinger Escape Plan, which plays an impossibly complex kind of punk-jazz, and Nightmare of You. At 7:30 p.m., Roseland, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; sold out. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>LAURIE ANDERSON (Tomorrow) Her entrancing performances weave coolly surrealistic songs and witty, reflective monologues with a seamless dream logic. At this outdoor concert, part of the Celebrate Brooklyn series, she will play new, old and improvised pieces, and will be joined by the Tuvan throat singers of Chirgilchin, who also open the show. At 7:30 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BABY GRAMPS (Tomorrow through Tuesday) With a gray beard the size of small shrubbery, a raspy Popeye voice and manic skills on the steel guitar, Baby Gramps offers a cartoonish variation on the role of hobo troubadour in old-timey songs like ''Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' But where he really shines is in his hilarious and ingenious wordplay, as in his palindrome song (''Go hang a salami -- I'm a lasagna hog''). Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Terra Blues, 149 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7776. Sunday at 9 p.m., Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500; free. Monday at 9:30 p.m., Lakeside Lounge, 162 Avenue B, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 529-8463; free. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Zebulon Cafe, 258 Wythe Avenue, near North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BEIRUT (Tuesday) Zach Condon, a 19-year-old from Albuquerque, has already made albums inspired by the Magnetic Fields and classic doo-wop. For his latest, ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), released under the name Beirut, he turned to the somber and ecstatic marches of Balkan Gypsy music. On the album Mr. Condon plays most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself, but for this tour he is joined by a full band. With A Hawk and a Hacksaw. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CHUCK BERRY (Tonight) Half a century ago, in songs like ''Maybellene'' and ''Johnny B. Goode,'' Chuck Berry hit on a formula that gives him as much a claim as anybody to being the inventor of rock 'n' roll: a taut, fast boogie derived from R &amp; B, matched to lyrics that celebrate the carefree, mythical teenage lifestyle. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $90. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BLUE CHEER (Sunday and Tuesday) On a few gloriously untidy albums in the late 1960's and early 70's, Blue Cheer followed the blunter edges of Jimi Hendrix's sound into a bludgeoning kind of primordial heavy metal, and played it with an un-self-conscious glee that made the members sound like cavemen discovering fire. Sunday at 9 p.m., with Dead Meadow, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $15. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with the Black Hollies, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>'BROADWAY BY THE YEAR: THE MUSICALS OF 1978' (Monday) In the last program this season of Town Hall's Broadway by the Year series, ''Ain't Misbehavin','' ''Eubie!,'' ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' ''On the Twentieth Century'' and other shows from 1978 get the oh-what-a-time treatment from Carolee Carmelo, Mary Bond Davis, Chuck Cooper, Felicia Finley, Julie Garnye, Nancy Opel, Noah Racey, Christine Pedi, Lennie Watts and Lari White. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $40 and $45. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO, MARAH (Thursday) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. The band Marah's articulate songs are doused in greasy, sweaty, exuberant rock. At 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>FAIRPORT CONVENTION (Sunday) One original member and two later recruits of this groundbreaking British progressive-folk group from the 1960's and 70's -- the guitarist Simon Nicol, who was in it from the beginning, along with the violinist and mandolin player Chris Leslie and the violinist Ric Sanders -- play an acoustic set of Fairport Convention songs, jazz and swing standards and traditional folk. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THE FIGGS (Tonight) Joining the pop-punk lineage that stretches back to the early, rowdy Beatles and any number of 1960's garage bands, the Figgs make their guitars blare through the neat constructions of their songs. They sing about rejects and romantic also-rans, with a streak of resentment that's as strong as their melodic skills. With Tommy Keene and Seth Tiven. At 9:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* ARETHA FRANKLIN (Tuesday and Wednesday) Aretha Franklin has said she intends to stop extensive touring, but she keeps coming back, to grateful crowds. She gives her first concerts at the Apollo Theater in more than 20 years. At 8 p.m., 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305 or (212) 307-7171; $77 to $177. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>'FROM B TO Z' (Tomorrow) The avant-garde band the Z's, whose songs sputter forth in Morse-code dots of percussion and saxophone, kicks off a tour at this ''episode'' in a series of casual artistic gatherings. The night also features music by Electroputas, Lake, Vizusa and Legend, projections by Meredith Arena and dance by Skint. At 8 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 253-0036; $7. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>GOMEZ (Wednesday) This British band emerged in the mid-1990's, the heyday of Britpop, with an against-the-grain obsession with tight, sharp blues-rock. On its new album, ''How We Operate'' (ATO), it has veered into folkier realms, though it still plays with unusual precision and focus. Also on the bill is Martha Wainwright, whose passionate songs swirl from her acoustic guitar into grand arrangements but never lose their intimacy. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ETTA JAMES, SUSAN TEDESCHI (Tuesday) In 1954 a teenage Etta James made her first record, ''The Wallflower (Dance With Me, Henry),'' a flirty response to Hank Ballard's hit ''Work With Me, Annie,'' and she has been singing sexy, assertive blues and R &amp; B ever since. She comes to Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz Festival, with Susan Tedeschi, a singer and guitarist who blends some soul and funk into her blues. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LEGENDARY PINK DOTS (Monday and Tuesday) Since 1980, Edward Ka-Spel has led the Legendary Pink Dots through songs that hold on to the psychedelia of 1967-68; they set his surreal imagery and hints of gothic legend to music that can be amiable, chaotic or eerie. With One Bit Music on Monday and Beat the Devil on Tuesday. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15 in advance, $18 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>LOS LONELY BOYS (Tuesday and Thursday) These three West Texan brothers reached No. 1 on the adult contemporary charts a couple of years ago with the breezy Tex-Mex blues of ''Heaven.'' A new album, ''Sacred'' (Or/Epic), is due next month. Tuesday at 8 p.m., with the singer-songwriter Justin King, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; sold out. Thursday at 7:30 p.m., with the soul singer James Hunter, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>McDONALD'S GOSPELFEST (Tonight through Sunday) This competition and performance series puts amateurs and gospel's biggest stars on the same stage. This year those stars include Donnie McClurkin, the Rev. Hezekiah Walker and the Love Fellowship Tabernacle Choir, Vickie Winans, Cissy Houston and Tye Tribbett. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 4:30, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212; $35 to $100. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* NELLIE McKAY (Sunday) On nights off from ''The Threepenny Opera'' on Broadway, Ms. McKay, a songwriting sprite whom it is impossible to get tired of, has been playing a series of late-night shows at Joe's Pub; this weekend's show is her last. These are rare chances to hear the songs from her excellent second album, ''Pretty Little Head,'' which has been in music purgatory since Ms. McKay was dropped by Columbia late last year. At 11:30 p.m.; Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MIDSUMMER NIGHT SWING (Tuesday through Thursday) Lincoln Center's annual outdoor series of low-dipping, high-kicking music and dancing opens on Tuesday with the 14-piece Jonathan Stout Orchestra, featuring the singer Hilary Alexander, in big-band favorites by Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and others. Wednesday is a Gay Pride salute, with Martha Wash and friends, and Thursday features QuinTango, said to be the only tango music group to give a command performance at the White House. At 7:30 p.m., with dance lessons at 6:30 p.m., Josie Robertson Plaza, Columbus Avenue at 63rd Street, (212) 875-5460; $15 each night. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>RHETT MILLER, TEDDY THOMPSON, OLLABELLE (Tomorrow) Country and folk will get three varied readings at Central Park SummerStage tomorrow. Rhett Miller, whether with his country-flavored bar band Old 97's or in solo heartthrob mode, is an unrepentant honky-tonker with a gift for melody. Teddy Thompson is the son of the great British folk-pop singers Richard and Linda Thompson, and he absorbed some of his parents' pithy melancholy, an attitude that leaves room for some smirks. Ollabelle worships country, bluegrass and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes. At 3 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) Led by Chantal Claret -- who, when not whipping her hair into a brunet cloud, struts the stage in a hypersexualized trance -- Morningwood plays quick, jumpy, New Wave vamps about one of two things: sex and rock. With Rock Kills Kid and Big City Rock. At 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>NINE INCH NAILS, BAUHAUS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Trent Reznor waited six years to make another Nine Inch Nails album, but ''With Teeth,'' released last year, showed that Mr. Reznor's talents for disorienting electronica, self-flagellating lyrics and, most of all, cathartic tantrums of noise, have remained intact. This summer Nine Inch Nails is touring with Bauhaus, whose bleak and shadowy songs helped create goth-rock in the late 1970's and early 80's. Also on the bill is Peaches, whose bawdy electro-punk burlesque provides its own kind of catharsis. Tonight at 7, PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; $29.50 to $49.50. Tomorrow night at 7, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; $29.50 to $49.50. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ODETTA (Thursday) Odetta has been a blues powerhouse since the 1950's, strumming hard and singing with a deep, leathery voice that harks back to field hollers and spirituals. She gives her songs the authority of archetypes. At noon, BAM Rhythm &amp; Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; free. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS (Tuesday) Tom Petty is going all out for his current tour, celebrating 30 years with the Heartbreakers. Peter Bogdanovich is working on a documentary, and the roster of guests for dates later in the summer includes Pearl Jam and the Allman Brothers. At Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, the opening act will be Trey Anastasio from Phish, and Stevie Nicks is to join the band for, among others, ''Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,'' her duet with Mr. Petty that still sounds as achy and soulful as it did in 1981. At 8 p.m., (212) 465-6741; $45 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SMOKEY ROBINSON (Thursday) As part of the JVC Jazz Festival, the Motown prince makes his first appearance at Carnegie Hall in 31 years. At 8 p.m., (212) 247-7800; $35 to $85. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SLAYER, LAMB OF GOD, MASTODON, CHILDREN OF BODOM (Tonight) Here is a quick primer on the meaner side of heavy metal over the last couple of decades. Slayer emerged in the early 1980's with a hellish, claustrophobic sound -- all foreboding skies and tormented vocals -- and has stuck steadfastly to it. Lamb of God, from Richmond, Va., derives some of its grinding, jackhammer-fast churn from Slayer and Pantera, and, without any irony or sarcasm, calls its style ''pure American metal.'' Mastodon reaches into avant-garde noise and progressive rock, and Children of Bodom, from Finland, is an exemplar of the operatically dismal black-metal school. At 5:30 p.m., Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (201) 935-3900; $39. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY AND THE ASBURY JUKES (Tomorrow and Sunday) While his friend Bruce Springsteen left the Jersey Shore behind and went on to write all-American anthems and parables, Southside Johnny Lyon stuck to the old bar-band basics: rolling R &amp; B vamps and raspy-voiced, good-natured soul plaints, complete with horn section. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN WITH THE SEEGER SESSIONS BAND (Thursday) A hootenanny of musicians, playing banjos, accordions, fiddles and guitars, accompanies Bruce Springsteen in folk songs of work, hardscrabble survival and political anger -- the Depression-era ''How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live'' gets a Hurricane Katrina rewrite -- from his latest album, ''We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions'' (Columbia). At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $59.50 to $89.50. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>* LEE ANN WOMACK (Tonight) Ms. Womack drew the respect of Nashville and lots of new fans with last year's ''There's More Where That Came From,'' whose heartfelt reflections, conservative arrangements and outstanding songwriting represented an ideal of country music.

        <p>YELLOWCARD (Wednesday) Yellowcard's mopey lyrics and nursery-rhyme pop-punk might sound like generic emo-rock until you hear the violin. And even then  At 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $26 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario)</p>

At 2 p.m., the Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $58, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* Eartha Kitt (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday nights) The latest edition of an act Ms. Kitt has been performing for decades is the lightest, swiftest and funniest one to date, and that's all to the good. More than ever, the singer, now a glamorous 79, pauses to poke fun at her status as the greatest and wittiest of all singing tigresses. At 8:45, with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $100. (Holden)</p>

        <p>BEN ALLISON'S COWBOY JUSTICE (Tuesday) The bassist Ben Allison has a knack for assembling hardy and sophisticated ensembles like this one, with Ron Horton on trumpet, Steve Cardenas on guitar and Gerald Cleaver on drums.

        <p>BISHOP-CLEAVER-FLOOD (Tomorrow) As on his new album, ''Time and Imaginary Time'' (Envoi), the saxophonist Andrew Bishop engages in an equal exchange with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood, expanding compositional frames and exploring open space.

        <p>CHRIS BOTTI/LIZZ WRIGHT (Tomorrow) The world of contemporary jazz, as it's now called, has few stylists as consistently winsome as Mr. Botti, a trumpeter whose melodic understatement (along with a few celebrity endorsements) has translated into popular appeal. Ms. Wright is a young and self-assured singer whose soulful alto has emerged as one of jazz's most welcome new timbres. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BRAZIL NIGHTS (Wednesday through June 24) As part of the JVC Jazz Festival, the Jazz Standard offers four consecutive nights of Brazilian jazz, beginning with Choro Ensemble, a quintet that devotes itself to the choro, a traditional strain of cafe music (Wednesday), and Antropo-Fagia, a new quintet led by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and featuring the guitarist Romero Lubambo (Thursday).

        <p>DAVE BRUBECK'S BIRTHDAY PARTY: TAKE 5 PLUS 80 (Wednesday) At 85, Mr. Brubeck plays the piano with undiminished vigor and still maintains a punishing schedule. This concert features not only his well-traveled quartet but also a new big band, in its first New York performance. For good measure, Bill Cosby will also be there. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CLARINET MARMALADE (Tuesday) The clarinet, once a dominant instrument in jazz, has become something of a connoisseur's choice. This concert gathers a handful of its leading contemporary practitioners, with styles ranging from New Orleans traditional (Evan Christopher) to mainstream swing (Ken Peplowski, Kenny Davern) to ultramodern (Don Byron). At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>* ORNETTE COLEMAN QUINTET (Tonight) With an expanded version of the superb quartet first heard at a JVC Jazz Festival concert at Carnegie Hall in 2003, the alto saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman pursues a holistic ideal of improvised group communication that's easier to recognize than define. His fellow adventurers are Tony Falanga and Greg Cohen on double basses, Al MacDowell on electric bass, and Denardo Coleman, his son, on drums. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET (Tuesday through June 24) Mr. Coltrane, the tenor and soprano saxophonist, has developed one of the strongest working bands in jazz over the past few years.

At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30; $35 on Fridays and Saturdays, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RICHARD GALLIANO'S NEW YORK TRIO (Monday through Thursday) Mr. Galliano is a technically dazzling accordion player with a flair for romanticism. For this engagement he enlists the polished rhythm team of George Mraz on bass, and Al Foster on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DIZZY GILLESPIE ALL-STAR BIG BAND (Tuesday through June 25) Bebop's goateed ambassador did some of his best work with big bands, a fact that this repertory ensemble, led by his former trombonist and arranger Slide Hampton, happily exploits. The band includes other veterans of Gillespie's employ -- like the saxophonists James Moody, Frank Wess and Jimmy Heath -- as well as Roy Hargrove, the trumpeter enlisted to fill his shoes here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Sunday) In the late 1960's, Mr. Hutcherson defined a commanding, harmonically exploratory post-bop vibraphone style. He has lost none of his prowess, as he has demonstrated in recent years with the SFJAZZ Collective, and as he further proves here, with a rhythm section composed of Renee Rosnes on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Willie Jones III on drums. At 3 p.m., Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, 515 Lenox Avenue, at West 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200; $20; members, $17. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LEE KONITZ (Through Sunday; Tuesday and Wednesday) This weekend Mr. Konitz lends his august reputation and dry-martini alto saxophone tone to a nine-piece band, featuring arrangements by the tenor saxophonist Ohad Talmor.

        <p>BRAD MEHLDAU (Tuesday) In his solo piano recitals Mr. Mehldau blends judicious pop offerings, archaic songbook standards and intricate originals, employing a touch that runs from sprightly to somber. His recent solo album ''Live in Tokyo'' (Nonesuch) was a noteworthy achievement, and time has only deepened his ambidextrous grace. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARCUS MILLER BAND/ROY HARGROVE AND RH FACTOR (Tonight) There may not be a funkier electric bassist than Mr. Miller, who is still best known for his work with the late, synthesizer-strewn bands of Miles Davis. Mr. Miller's own ensemble includes a Milesian trumpeter, Patches Stewart, as well as the drummer Poogie Bell, the saxophonist Keith Anderson, the keyboardist Bobby Sparks and the harmonica virtuoso Grégoire Maret. Some of those musicians also have ties to RH Factor, a neo-soul outfit led by Mr. Hargrove, a sharp and ever-poised trumpeter. At 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171; $30. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>NU JAZZ TODAY! (Tonight) This concert, which inaugurates the Central Park SummerStage season, assembles four acts that spike their grooves with avant-garde experimentation. In ascending order of abstraction, they are Nils Petter Molvaer, a Norwegian trumpeter specializing in electronic textures; Groundtruther, composed of the guitarists Charlie Hunter and Elliott Sharp and the drummer Bobby Previte; Sex Mob, a quartet equally enamored of Billy Preston and Albert Ayler; and Matthew Shipp, a pianist and composer drawn to thorny pointillism. At 7, Central Park SummerStage, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; www.summerstage.org; free. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BUCKY PIZZARELLI 80TH-BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION (Monday) Warmth and wit are assured in this party for Mr. Pizzarelli, the venerable swing guitarist. Among the many musicians on hand are the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen, the clarinetist Ken Peplowski and several fine guitarists (Howard Alden, Gene Bertoncini) and guitarist-singers (like Kenny Rankin and John Pizzarelli, Mr. Pizzarelli's son). At 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $45. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHRIS POTTER'S UNDERGROUND (Tonight) The tenor saxophonist Chris Potter has an improvisational approach that is intellectual and athletic in equal measure. His funk-fusion band Underground, originally formed at the 55 Bar, returns there tonight. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROB REDDY QUINTET (Tuesday) Mr. Reddy is a soprano and alto saxophonist with a taste for ragged polyphony; he features his own compositions in this group with the guitarist Jef Lee Johnson, the pianist Michael Cain, the bassist Dom Richards and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $12. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JASON RIGBY QUARTET (Monday) ''Translucent Space'' (Fresh Sound-New Talent), the new album by the saxophonist and bass clarinetist Jason Rigby, doesn't come by its name casually; it's an album of airy, often diaphanous music, with faint echoes of early fusion and Third Stream. Mr. Rigby plays here with the album's rhythm section of Mike Holober on piano, Cameron Brown on bass and Mark Ferber on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>* SANGAM: CHARLES LLOYD, ZAKIR HUSSAIN, ERIC HARLAND (Thursday) This collaborative trio recently released a gripping self-titled album documenting its first performance, in 2004. The group has toured since then, and its exploratory rapport has sharpened; what remains the same is the quality of its components, from the saxophones and flutes of Mr. Lloyd to the percussive virtuosity of Mr. Hussain (on tablas) and Mr. Harland (on drum kit). At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SWEET LORRAINE: A JAZZ CELEBRATION FOR THE VILLAGE VANGUARD (Monday) Lorraine Gordon, the owner and proprietor of the Village Vanguard, receives a fitting tribute from some of the top-shelf bands that have been regulars at the club: the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, with the saxophonist Joe Lovano as a guest; the Roy Hargrove Quintet, with the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson; a group led by the drummer Paul Motian, featuring the saxophonist Chris Potter; Dr. Michael White's Original Liberty Jazz Band, from New Orleans; and the Bad Plus. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $75. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RALPH TOWNER (Wednesday) Mr. Towner has perfected a solo guitar style of exceptional fullness, as he recently demonstrated on a gem of an album called ''Time Line'' (ECM). In all likelihood, he'll perform an equally entrancing program here. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $50. JVC Jazz Festival. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TRIO BRAAMDEJOODEVATCHER (Tonight) The unwieldy name of this Dutch piano trio is merely a combination of surnames: Michiel Braam, pianist; Wilbert de Joode, bassist; and Michael Vatcher, drummer. As heard on an appealing new live album, ''Change This Song'' (Bik Bent Braam), the group practices a strain of modern jazz that's pliable, playful and rhythmically capricious. At 7:30 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* VISION FESTIVAL XI (Through Sunday) Avant-garde jazz culture has no better colloquy in this country than the Vision Festival, which encompasses experimental dance and visual arts as well as improvised music. Its final few days include promising panel discussions and afternoon performances, but the focus remains on the evening concerts, featuring luminaries like the violinist Billy Bang (tonight) and the saxophonist and composer Roscoe Mitchell (tomorrow). Sunday's closing act, scheduled for 9 p.m., is being billed as the final United States performance of the saxophonist David S. Ware's celebrated quartet. Times vary, with activities running from the afternoon past midnight at Angel Orensanz Foundation for the Arts, 172 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, visionfestival.org; $25 per night. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MATT WILSON AND TED NASH (Monday) Mr. Wilson, a drummer, and Mr. Nash, a saxophonist and flutist, have played together in each other's groups (and other settings) for years, so they should have no problem connecting in a duo setting. Among the traits they have in common: rhythmic flexibility, melodic directness and an aversion to pretension and cliché. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330; $25. (Chinen)</p>

(Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS  (Tonight) There are contemporary chamber music ensembles, and then there are the Locrian Chamber Players, a vehemently contemporary chamber music ensemble. The group's operating principle is to perform only works written within the last 10 years. If this policy seems unduly restrictive, looked at another way, it's fresh and exciting, and represents the group's conviction that there are enough worthy works being written right now to assure varied and engaging programs. Tonight the ensemble plays works by the major German composer Wolfgang Rihm, as well as by John Adams, Tom Johnson, David MacDonald and Jonathan Faiman (a pianist with the ensemble). The free concerts are held in the intimate and acoustically vibrant performance space on the 10th floor of Riverside Church, which even boasts an open-air balcony accessible during intermission. At 8, 91 Claremont Avenue, at 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (718) 458-4864. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>MANNES INSTITUTE AND FESTIVAL FOR CONTEMPORARY PERFORMANCE (Thursday) The format resembles that at the Marlboro festival in Vermont, but the content is strictly modern. Starting this week and running through June 30, this year's institute focuses on violin, piano and percussion, offering young participants a chance to work with the likes of Frederic Rzewski and Curtis Macomber in master classes, open rehearsals and symposiums. The definition of contemporary seems to extend back to the early 20th century; at the first public concert on Thursday, Rolf Schulte, a violinist, and Marc Ponthus, a pianist and the institute's director, will play works by Krenek, Stockhausen, Mario Davidovsky and Richard Wilson. Events begin at 10:30 a.m.; the concert is at 8 p.m., Mannes College, 150 West 85th Street, Manhattan, (212) 580-0210, Ext. 4884; free. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>TANNERY POND CONCERTS (Tomorrow) Christian Steiner is well known for his photography; less well known, perhaps, as a musician; and least known as the artistic director of this lovely little concert series, for which he lures leading musicians up to the Berkshires to perform in an enchanting little wooden hall. This weekend's offering is an all-Milhaud program, with the pianist Gilbert Kalish, the violinist Carmit Zori and other musicians. At 8 p.m., Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, New Lebanon, N.Y., (888) 820-9441; $25 and $30. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>ISH (Tonight through Sunday) This Dutch company presents ''4-ISH,'' a show that might be called hip-hop but is really hip-hoppish and involves many kinds of urban derring-do, including quarter pipes (as in skateboarding), kung fu, electrified skate wheels and a live D.J. Tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m., Sunday at noon and 5 p.m., New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, newvictory.org; $10 to $30. (Erika Kinetz)</p>

        <p>* JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Wednesday and Thursday) After an opening gala tomorrow night, this bucolic, tradition-laden, artistically lively Berkshires dance festival -- the premiere event of its kind in the Northeast and (along with the American Dance Festival in North Carolina) the country -- gets under way on Wednesday. The opening attraction is CND2, whose name is short for the second company of Nacho Duato's Compañía Nacional de Danza from Spain. This is the younger, smaller ensemble attached to the big company, and it devotes itself to Mr. Duato's quirky, inventive choreography. Ted Shawn Theater at 8 p.m. $50; $45 for students, 65+ and children. Details of the week's free performances and exhibitions can be found at www.jacobspillow.org.

        <p>* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tonight through Sunday; Wednesday and Thursday) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center.

        <p>Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, at Fifth Avenue, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'VERONESE'S ALLEGORIES: VIRTUE, LOVE AND EXPLORATION IN RENAISSANCE VENICE,' through July 16. Paolo Veronese (1528-88), a superb colorist and one of the most suavely sensuous of Renaissance Venetian painters, used the age-old device of allegory to make abstract concepts visual, often by means of human or mythological figures. In this five-painting show, the first to include all of his large-scale allegories from American collections, high ideals mingle with earthy and sometimes erotic physicality, as in the painting ''Venus and Mars United by Love.'' 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery, and the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 1950's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demi-monde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range, and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1114 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000.(Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* METropolitan museum of art: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early 19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710.(Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontes to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) Cotter)</p>
        <p>Museum of Arts &amp; Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Museum of Modern Art: Douglas Gordon: 'Timeline,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. Museum of Modern Art. (212) 708-9400. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>National Academy: '181st Annual: an Invitational Exhibition of Contemporary Art' This year's sprawling hodgepodge of an invitational presents works by 124 artists ranging from tightly focused realist painting to politically charged video installation. National Academy, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through June 18. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>New York Public Library: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 18. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years, the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art: abstraction. This show is stylishly installed; (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>Peter Dayton: 'Surfboards by Clement Greenberg' For a witty spin on commodity-critique art, Mr. Dayton creates panel paintings combining the glossy surfaces, colorful banding and logos of surfboard design and the striped patterns of paintings by Kenneth Noland and Barnett Newman that were favored by the powerful formalist critic Clement Greenberg. Winston Wächter, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of this artist's paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 7. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>'Coup de Foudre' Four works loosely related by the metaphor of lightning. Emilie Halpern offers a white plastic lightning bolt and walls papered by heat-sensitive film. Small cutouts by Tim Noble &amp; Sue Webster cast pornographic shadows; stick-on letters applied to the floor, walls and ceiling by Tamara Sussman spell out an erotic fantasy written in Web-based ''slash fiction'' style; and a surprisingly affecting, grainy, rambling video created by Enid Baxter Blader with a homemade camera explores stormy natural and emotional weather. Tina Kim, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 716-1100, through June 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>* 'Artists Against the State: Perestroika Revisited' Satiric and subversive Pop and Conceptualist works by more than 50 artists working in the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the end of Communism. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by a young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Jackie Gendel: 'Portraits' With seemingly off-hand painterly verve, smudgy colors and a sweet sense of humor, Ms. Gendel creates smart and sensuous, semi-abstract riffs on Modernist portraiture. Jeff Bailey, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-0156, through July 1. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* 'An Ongoing Low-Grade Mystery' Organized by the curator Bob Nickas, this excellent group show includes works in many different mediums and styles, related in that they are all predominantly red. Donald Judd, Sherrie Levine, Jim Drain, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dan Walsh are among more than 30 artists included. Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, through June 23. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* 'The Rest is Silence: James Lee Byars' New York only really started to wake up to James Lee Byars (1932-1997) when he died. Although born in the United States, he spent his formative years in Japan, where he developed a performance-based aesthetic of evanescance; and his main career was in Europe, where he adapted reductiveness to an art of material luxe. This three-gallery survey has some early work but focuses on the large-scale sculptures of his later years. It is tempting to fit him into existing slots: performance art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, whatever. But his extravagance and his privacy combine to keep him outside the fold, as do his his philosophical concerns: Big Ideas, or rather Big Questions, about perfection, death and eternity. Perry Rubenstein Gallery, 526 West 24th Street, (212) 627-8000; 534 West 24th Street and 527 West 23rd Street; Mary Boone Gallery, 541 West 24th Street and 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929); Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623. All through June 24. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Reto Boller A Swiss artist who has exhibited widely in Europe, Mr. Boller creates minimalist works in two and three dimensions that focus on color and texture. For his first exhibition in the United States, he has covered the walls and floor of a large section of this gallery with bright red adhesive material, to perceptually intense effect. James Nicholson, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 967-5700, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Loretta Lux By means of subtle digital manipulations, Ms. Lux turns color photographs of children in empty rooms into hallucinatory portraits of angelic beings with slightly oversized heads; big, soulful eyes; and beautiful clothes. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through June 24. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* NEW VIDEO, NEW EUROPE A selection of 49 tapes by 40 artists from 16 Eastern European countries, several of which did not exist before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, presents bits and pieces of another world. Revolution, landmines, economic hardship and disappearing ways of life alternate with wit and artistic originality. The whole forms an inadvertent documentary, but many of the parts are well worth attention. The Kitchen, 512 East 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, through June 30. (Smith)</p>
        <p>RICHARD SERRA: 'ROLLED AND FORGED' The centerpiece of the latest Serra spectacular, which favors mass, compression and rectangles over stretched-thin curves and spirals, is a low-lying maze in which the shifting heights and staggered placement of 16 thick, hedgelike plates create one of the most spatially complex yet straightforward works of his career. Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111, through Aug. 11. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* Mamma Andersson: 'Rooms Under the Influence' In haunting paintings of rooms and landscapes, this Swedish painter combines the sensuousness of Edouard Vuillard and the moody angst of Edvard Munch. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070; closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* MARCO BOGGIO SELLA: DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES OF THE AFRICAN ASTRONAUTS Combining a salon hanging with ethnographic displays, and works made by the artist in various collaborations with artisans of an impoverished village in Bukina Faso, this show opens a Pandora's box of artistic and ethical issues, and gives the viewer plenty to look at. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 337-9523; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* JENNY HOLZER: ARCHIVE and NIGHT FEED Two exhibitions of new work present color photographs of poems projected on public buildings and silk-screen paintings that enlarge declassified, often heavily censored military and intelligence documents. The plight of the individual in an unforgiving (and in the second case, post-9/11) world is starkly evoked, but might be equally if not more effective in book form. Cheim &amp; Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727, and Yvon Lambert New York, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-3611; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* WANGECHI MUTU: AN ALIEN EYE AND OTHER KILLAH ANTHEMS This gallery debut includes opulent collage and ink paintings on Mylar of exotic creatures, sculpture and fierce little collages combining ethnographic postcards with pornographic images. It indicates extravagant artistic gifts, passion and pressing subjects but also suggests that too many options are under consideration. Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Company, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>REGENERATION: 50 PHOTOGRAPHERS OF TOMORROW A show of emerging and student photographers gives a surprisingly energetic view of the medium as unavoidably surreal, frequently digitalized and extremely ambiguous, in which the divisions among real, manipulated and set-up are concerned. Current trends are confirmed. Relatively straight photojournalism tends to carry the day. Aperture Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 505-5555; closing on Thursday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* THOMAS ZIPP: URANLICHT  An impressive solo debut pairs dark, nearly abstract landscapes and cursory botanical imagery with appropriated images of authoritarian bearded men, evoking a bygone avant-garde and the reaction against it. A room-filling hand-built organ that Père Ubu might have loved completes the presentation. HarrisLieberman, 89 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 206-1290; closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
