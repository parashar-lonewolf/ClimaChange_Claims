        <p>LEAD: By drilling to the bottom of the ice sheet in the heart of Antarctica, Soviet and French scientists are determined to solve the riddle of the ice ages by acquiring a year-to-year record of climate for the last half-million years.</p>
        <p>By drilling to the bottom of the ice sheet in the heart of Antarctica, Soviet and French scientists are determined to solve the riddle of the ice ages by acquiring a year-to-year record of climate for the last half-million years.</p>
        <p>The record would cover several ice ages and warm interglacial periods, and the researchers hope it will provide enough evidence to explain what has emerged as a major mystery. That is the sudden warming and large increase in carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere at the end of the two most recent ice ages.</p>
        <p>The effort faces monumental logistic and technical difficulties. So far 12 drilling attempts at the Soviet inland station, Vostok, have been halted by some form of blockage or malfunction. New Hole Under Way</p>
        <p>Now, Soviet reseachers are drilling a new hole with a cable that, for the first time, is long enough to reach 12,210 feet to the bottom. At last report they had passed the 3,300-foot mark.</p>
        <p>The most recent samples come from a probe that penetrated 7,267 feet, or more than half the way to the bottom of the ice, providing samples of snow that fell 180,000 years ago. They are under analysis at a laboratory of the French Atomic Energy Commission here, and at another in Grenoble.</p>
        <p>Highly automated measurements are being made around the clock on thousands of samples derived from the extracted ice. The analyses determine the relative amounts of heavy and light forms of hydrogen and oxygen. The less there is of the heavier forms, the colder the climate was when the snow fell.</p>
        <p>The new data document extraordinarily abrupt rises in world temperature as each of the last two ice ages ended. No Explanation for Rise</p>
        <p>Measurements at a Grenoble laboratory on still-frozen samples have shown the surprisingly large and rapid rises in atmospheric carbon dioxide that accompanied those temperature rises. It climbed from 190 to 280 parts per million, presumably within no more than a few centuries.</p>
        <p>Because carbon dioxide traps solar heat, a sudden rise in the amount of that gas in the air would be expected to warm the climate. There is no generally accepted explanation for such a rise.</p>
        <p>Cooling at the start of the ice ages was more gradual, a fact that has led the Soviet and French scientists to suspect separate processes were responsible for the cooling and the warming.</p>
        <p>Their findings demonstrate dramatically that radical warming can occur along with large rises in carbon dioxide. With the use of modern fuels constantly adding to the atmosphere's carbon dioxide, scientists are eager to learn what caused those earlier sudden changes.</p>
        <p>Last month, in the journal Nature, participants in the Soviet-French effort reported their record of atmospheric changes over the last 160,000 years, based on ice extracted from a hole drilled to 6,874 feet. They drilled another 393 feet and ice from this hole is now being analyzed. Dr. Jean Jouzel, who is conducting the analyses here, believes researchers are dealing with snow that fell 180,000 years ago, close to the time when the next-to-last ice age began. Offers Unbroken Record</p>
        <p>The ice cover in the interior of Antarctica, two to three miles thick, provides an unbroken record of atmospheric temperature and composition that probably reaches back more than a half million years. Evidence from sea floor sediment reaches farther into the past, but is subject to bottom currents, landslides and other alterations.</p>
        <p>The Vostok drill site is 11,510 feet above sea level and the average temperature is 68 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit. In the continuous winter darkness it becomes far colder.</p>
        <p>The drilling, which has continued almost unbroken, summer and winter, since 1980, has encountered a succession of impediments. Twelve times drilling has been blocked. Each time it was necessary either to drill an entirely new hole, with a new drill tower, or to plug the bottom of the hole and use a new drill to by-pass the blockage. An Electrically Heated Ring</p>
        <p>The drill, like the one used by the Russians to penetrate Antarctica's floating Ross Ice Shelf in an American collaboration, uses an electrically heated ring to melt its way down, leaving a central cylinder of ice that can be hauled to the surface.</p>
        <p>According to Jean R. Petit of the glaciological laboratory in Grenoble, who has participated in the effort at Vostok, rarely is more than a single six-foot sample recovered each day.</p>
        <p>The evidence so far also confirms estimates from sea floor sediments that the timetable of successive ice ages has conformed closely to the 110,000-year cycles of changes in shape of the earth's orbit and in tilt and aim of its spin axis. A weaker, 21,000-year cycle is also apparent.</p>
        <p>Even the stronger cycle, which primarily alters solar heating at high latitudes, should influence temperature only slightly. Yet such modest variations over the past two million years seem to have acted to turn ice ages on and off.</p>
        <p>Earlier drilling efforts at Byrd Station in Antarctica and Dye 3, a radar station on the Greenland ice cap, reached the bottom of the ice and were almost as deep as the deepest of the recent Soviet holes. But because snowfall at those sites is much greater, the annual layers are thicker and the record did not reach as far into the past. #4 Degrees Warmer Than Today Because Vostok is 400 miles inland, at the South Geomagnetic Pole, snowfall is meager. Annual precipitation equals only qbout one inch of water.</p>
        <p>Among the findings has been confirmation that between the last two ice ages the climate became four degrees Fahrenheit warmer than today. This had been suspected in part because of evidence that sufficient polar ice melted to raise global sea levels 30 feet higher than now. It appears that this hot spell lasted about 5,000 years. Its repetiton would flood many cities and food-producing areas.</p>
        <p>The age of each ice sample is estimated on the basis of assumed annual accumulation and subsequent thinning of the layers as the ice sheet spreads and flows seaward.</p>
        <p>Climate specialists are not certain whether or not the sharp rise in carbon dioxide at the end of each ice age came first and was largely responsible for the sudden warming. A slight warming, perhaps through its effect on biological activity, might increase carbon dioxide moderately, which would lead to further warming and yet more carbon dioxide.</p>
