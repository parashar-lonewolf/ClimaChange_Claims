        <p>LEAD: The Houston summit conference was a successful holding operation.

        <p>The Houston summit conference was a successful holding operation. In the face of conflicts over aid to the Soviet Union, the elimination of agricultural subsidies and actions to deal with environmental pollution and global warming, the leaders of the seven major industrial countries preserved their civility and produced a set of compromises that will enable them to go on working together a while longer.</p>
        <p>On Soviet aid, they papered over their differences by adopting a laissez-faire position. If the Germans and French and Italians want to give substantial financial aid to the Soviets, so be it; and if the Americans and British do not, so be that, too.</p>
        <p>That outcome was inevitable. The United States could no longer prevent the Germans from doing what they had already decided to do. Their $3.1 billion in bilateral aid is just a first installment in what will be a continuing flow of loans and investment to the Soviet Union. The Germans see Soviet aid as crucial to the politics of incorporating East Germany into the new Germany and into NATO.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the United States, hard pressed for funds by the budget deficit and its external deficit, was not in a position to commit large amounts of money to the Soviets. And it would have forced President Bush to confront his party's right wing with help for the country they still regard as the now and future leading Communist threat, the Government that is still giving aid to Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam and other foes of the United States.</p>
        <p>In this bind, Mr. Bush made an adroit move in proposing American technical assistance to the Soviets. There is truth as well as diplomatic finesse in his position that, unless President Mikhail S. Gorbachev moves faster and more decisively to turn the Soviet Union into a market economy and cut its still enormous military expenditures, Western aid is likely to be money down the drain.</p>
        <p>But there is also truth in the position that all the summit participants share, including the United States: Foreign aid can play a crucial role in helping Mr. Gorbachev make internal reforms and keep moving toward a more democratic, more open society. The spirit of the Houston summit meeting was to stress the potential for a new economic and political relationship between the Soviets and the industrial West, and Mr. Gorbachev and his supporters appear to have accepted it in that spirit.</p>
        <p>The proof of the pudding is still to come. Much will depend on the thoroughness and realism of the study of Soviet needs, to be conducted with the help of International Monetary Fund and World Bank experts. If the Soviets do their part, this can bring them, in the words of the summit's communique, ''meaningful and sustained economic assistance.'' The Western leaders see the opportunity for long-term peace and prosperity presented by the Soviet Union's movement toward economic and political freedom. But the question is whether they can seize it in time.</p>
        <p>The accord on cutting agricultural subsidies looks less meaningful. The Europeans did not interpret the agreement as committing them to any specific goals or timetable. And, given continuing strong support for farm subsidies as part of the five-year farm bill before Congress, Mr. Bush will have trouble delivering on his part of the bargain.</p>
        <p>Yet the deal, however vague, provides a means of holding open the possibility of a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, with the stress on intellectual property and services just as important to this country as to any other, perhaps more so. Keeping the alliance from splitting into rival trading blocs depends crucially on this negotiation under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which needs to hit pay dirt by the end of this year.</p>
        <p>The patched-up agreement on the environment resolved nothing. As the Europeans had argued that eliminating farm subsidies would cost them millions of jobs, so Mr. Bush, accepting the position of his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, argued that meeting the anti-pollution standards urged by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and others would wipe out millions of American jobs. This argument left out the jobs that would be created by cleaning the environment and protecting the global climate, as well as the very real costs of poor health and death if one does not.</p>
        <p>Although the national leaders avoided an irreparable split on any of the key issues, the talks demonstrated the depth of the conflicts among them. Self-interest and the more equally distributed economic power are pulling them apart, without fear of the common enemy, the Soviet Union, to hold them together. But the good will and intelligence shown by the seven leaders in Houston held forth the hope that enlightened self-interest may triumph over myopic self-interest and the centrifugal forces that threatened at their first post-cold war summit meeting.</p>
