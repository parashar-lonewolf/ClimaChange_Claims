        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was distressed by "Get the Candidates" (editorial, March 31). You do not seem to grasp that your frequently tabloidized treatment of the campaign is helping throw the election to George Bush.</p>
        <p>In focusing almost exclusively on the Democratic candidates, you ignored what should have been major articles about the Bush campaign. In the last two weeks George Bush, the "environmental President," who promised to use the "White House effect" against the "greenhouse effect," has said he will not accept a global warming treaty and may not attend the Rio de Janeiro "Earth summit."</p>
        <p>You have also done as much as any news outlet to keep the spotlight on muddy, and ultimately trivial, stories about Gov. Bill Clinton: real-estate "scandals" that go nowhere, underresearched charges about his handling of the Arkansas ethics law.</p>
        <p>Finally, by adopting the view that the President's record is a known quantity that requires only limited scrutiny, you give Mr. Bush an enormous, undeserved gift. You cannot expect voters to have the memories of elephants. If the front pages of 1992 are devoted solely to 10-year-old rumors about Bill Clinton, Bill Clinton will lose.</p>
        <p>But if even a third of those front pages were devoted to careful reassessment of the Bush record -- coddling the butchers of Tiananmen Square; pre-Kuwait support for Saddam Hussein; flip-flopping on abortion; betrayal on the environment, and a mindless dedication to low taxes for the rich -- it is difficult to see how he could win. STEVEN NOVICK Washington, April 1, 1992</p>
