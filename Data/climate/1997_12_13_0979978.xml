        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, Dec. 11) that for the United States to meet the promises agreed to at the global warming conference in Japan, Americans would have to make significant cuts in their use of fossil fuels. However, it will hardly be a sacrifice for this country to shift away from fossil fuels and embrace energy efficiency, fuel cells, photovoltaics and wind power. These technologies will improve the way we live, not with shocking sacrifice but with good old-fashioned American ingenuity.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (news article, Dec. 11) that for the United States to meet the promises agreed to at the global warming conference in Japan, Americans would have to make significant cuts in their use of fossil fuels. However, it will hardly be a sacrifice for this country to shift away from fossil fuels and embrace energy efficiency, fuel cells, photovoltaics and wind power. These technologies will improve the way we live, not with shocking sacrifice but with good old-fashioned American ingenuity.</p>
        <p>We can reduce carbon dioxide emissions dramatically with energy efficiency and low-emission technologies at no net cost. This is because energy efficiency frequently costs less than energy generation. Most efficiency investments pay for themselves in just a few years.</p>
        <p>While the Energy Department has indeed determined that our appetite for fossil fuels is growing, it has also concluded that a shift toward efficiency would not hurt the economy.</p>
        <p>You note that politics -- not technology -- is the barrier and that restructuring of the utility industry provides a crucial opportunity to  reduce greenhouse emissions. If done properly, restructuring will bring energy-efficient products and services to consumers and remove the indirect subsidies that have allowed coal-fired generating plants to avoid compliance with the environmental standards that other power generators in the country must meet.</p>
