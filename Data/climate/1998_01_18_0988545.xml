        <p>A DESSERT to chase winter doldrums is one that calls on sunny tropical flavors. Coconut, mango, orange  and the like not only brighten a dinner party but, when combined to make baked alaska, also give delightful panache to the meal.</p>
        <p>Baked alaska is made by combining ice cream or sorbet on a layer of cake, then icing it with meringue and putting it in a hot oven to toast the meringue. The cake and meringue insulate the ice cream during the baking.</p>
        <p>Is it global warming? El Nino? With this combination of tropical flavors, perhaps a better name for the dessert would be baked florida.</p>
        <p>Tropical Baked Alaska  Total time: 5 hours, including freezing</p>
        <p>1/2pint orange sorbet, softened</p>
        <p>1pint coconut sorbet, softened</p>
        <p>1/2pint mango sorbet, softened</p>
        <p>Yellow cake layer (recipe follows), cooled to room temperature</p>
        <p>4egg whites at room temperature</p>
        <p>1/2cup sugar</p>
        <p>2tablespoons sweetened shredded coconut</p>
        <p>Tropical fruit sauce (recipe follows).</p>
        <p>1. Line a round metal bowl -- 10 inches in diameter -- with plastic wrap. Spread the orange sorbet in the bottom. Spread half the coconut sorbet in a layer on top of the orange sorbet. Next, spread on the mango sorbet and finish with the remaining coconut sorbet. Put the cake layer into the bowl on top of the sorbet. Cover with foil or plastic wrap and put in the freezer until hard, three to four hours.</p>
        <p>2. Just before serving, preheat oven to 500 degrees. Cover a round baking sheet with foil.</p>
        <p>3. Whip the egg whites until softly peaked. Continue beating, gradually adding the sugar, until they are stiff.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the bowl with the cake and sorbet from the freezer. Invert onto the baking sheet and lift off the bowl. Peel off the plastic wrap.</p>
        <p>5. Thickly frost the dome of sorbet and cake with the egg whites. Be sure that the egg whites have lots of little peaks. Sprinkle with the coconut. Put in the oven and bake until the meringue is browning and the coconut is toasted, six to eight minutes. Watch it carefully so it does not become too brown. While the cake is browning, gently warm the sauce on top of the stove.</p>
        <p>6. Serve the cake at once, with the warm sauce on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Yellow Cake Layer  Total time: 45 minutes, plus cooling</p>
        <p>4ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus butter for cake pan</p>
        <p>1 1/2cups sifted cake flour plus flour for cake pan</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <p>Pinch of salt</p>
        <p>1cup sugar</p>
        <p>2eggs</p>
        <p>3/4cup milk</p>
        <p>1teaspoon vanilla extract.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a nine-inch round cake pan.</p>
        <p>2. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Beat the remaining butter and the sugar together until creamy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.</p>
        <p>4. Mix the milk and vanilla together and add it alternately in thirds, with the flour mixture, mixing just enough to blend the ingredients without overbeating.</p>
        <p>5. Pour into the prepared pan. Put in the oven and bake about 25 minutes, until the cake is lightly browned and a cake tester comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>6. Remove the cake from the pan and allow to cool completely before using.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 layer.</p>
        <p>Tropical Fruit Sauce  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1ripe mango, peeled, pitted and finely diced</p>
        <p>3ripe kiwis, peeled and finely diced</p>
        <p>4clementines, peeled and divided in segments</p>
        <p>2star fruit (carambolas), diced</p>
        <p>1/2cup dark rum</p>
        <p>3/4cup fresh orange juice</p>
        <p>3tablespoons sugar</p>
        <p>Juice of 1 lime.</p>
        <p>1. Force half the mango through a sieve into a saucepan. Put the rest in a bowl. Add the remaining fruit to the bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Mix the rum, orange juice, sugar and lime juice with the mango puree in the saucepan. Bring to a simmer.</p>
        <p>3. Add the fruit to the saucepan, remove from heat and set aside until just before serving.</p>
        <p>4. Gently reheat the sauce, transfer to a serving dish and serve with the baked alaska.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 2 cups.</p>
