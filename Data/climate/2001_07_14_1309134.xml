        <p>President Bush today promoted a number of studies and other measures intended to address the impact of greenhouse gases, including a $120 million NASA research project to examine more thoroughly the relationship between them and climate changes.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Bush called the initiatives ''important steps'' that were ''designed to increase our scientific understanding of climate change, to tap the enormous promise of technology in addressing greenhouse gas emissions and to promote further cooperation on climate change with our partners in the Western Hemisphere and beyond.''</p>
        <p>The statement came less than a week before Mr. Bush's second presidential trip to Europe, where some of the nation's leading allies remain bitterly disappointed over his decision to abandon a treaty on global warming.</p>
        <p>That decision also infuriated many environmental groups and contributed to a public perception of the Bush administration's energy plan as an approach that favored energy production and business over conservation and the environment. Ever since, the administration has taken pains to portray the president as environmentally sensitive.</p>
        <p>The latest such effort, the announcement today, reflected the work of a cabinet-level advisory panel that Mr. Bush had convened.</p>
        <p>In addition to the three-year NASA study, Mr. Bush said, the Treasury Department has reached an agreement to spend $14 million to help El Salvador conserve its forests, and the Energy Department will work with the Nature Conservancy to look into forestry practices in Brazil and Belize, which have expansive rain forests. The preservation of rain forests is one way to fight a buildup of  greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Bush announced that the Energy Department had obtained a promise of cooperation from energy companies in developing new technologies that would help prevent  carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists said the measures were paltry contributions to the fight against global warming. Some of the measures were already planned under the Clinton administration or were fulfillments of campaign promises that Mr. Bush's initial federal budget did not reflect.</p>
