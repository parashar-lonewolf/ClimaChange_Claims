        <p>Three members of a Bronx family, one of them a 2-month-old girl, were found dead in their home last night, a day after their electricity was cut off for lack of payment, the authorities said. The police are investigating the possibility that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator in use at the house.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Consolidated Edison said the family's electricity had been turned off on Thursday, because payments were ''deeply in arrears.''</p>
        <p>A cousin of the family, Sharleen Williams, 26, identified the victims as Patrick Williams, 26; Erna Dennis, 54; and Patricia Williams, 2 months. Firefighter Sean Johnson said that a 19-year-old woman had been taken to St. Barnabas Hospital in serious condition. She is believed to be the baby's mother, Jody Richards.</p>
        <p>The family, originally from Jamaica, moved to the house, which they rented from Levy Dennis, Erna's brother, during the summer from elsewhere in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Detective Noel Waters said the deaths appeared to be accidental.</p>
        <p>Crews from Consolidated Edison were investigating, said Chris Olert, a Con Ed spokesman. According to Con Ed workers at the scene, a gasoline generator in use in the house had no ventilation. The generator, a Coleman Powermate, was inside the front door.</p>
        <p>About 8:15 p.m., the Fire Department reported, a call came in from the police and emergency medical workers about unconscious people at the house, a 30-foot-by-50-foot wood frame building, Firefighter Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The beginning of heating season is a time when carbon monoxide poses a threat. Nine people in the region -- four family members in a home in Colonia, N.J.; a 76-year old woman in Carteret, N.J.; a couple in Queens; and an 80-year old woman and her daughter in a Brooklyn apartment building -- died of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning within a month of one another last fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olert said that Con Edison had recently tried, unsuccessfully, to contact the Bronx family by telephone and in person. If the utility had known there was a child under 2 living in the house, he said, arrangements could have been made to extend the service and to refer the family to social services.</p>
        <p>Several dozen neighbors gathered outside the house at 1708 Popham Avenue, where grieving relatives hugged one another. Beverly Smith, the chairwoman of Community Board 5, complained about the family's power being cut off.</p>
        <p>''I think that Con Ed should have some social worker interview the people, so they can see what other solution there is, besides cutting off their electricity, so they don't have to resort to candles and generators and plugging electricity off of the street, so they can live civilly,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Olert said that the utility contacts social services when someone about to lose power requires life-sustaining equipment, like a ventilator, and that customers behind in their bills are given many opportunities to restructure payments.</p>
        <p>''If we found that there was somebody under 2 years over 62 or chronically ill, then we would've notified H.R.A.,'' he said, referring to the city's Human Resources Administration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams, the cousin, said Ms. Dennis was outgoing, always happy, and had been a frequent churchgoer. She said the family kept current on their rent, and that Mr. Williams had called Con Ed on Thursday to complain that his baby was cold and that they needed the electricity to be turned back on. She said the utility left a note for the family but never had direct contact with them.</p>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at least 1,000 people in the United States are killed or sickened every year by carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas emitted from heating systems or water heaters with cracked flues or blocked chimneys. The gas is produced from incomplete combustion; if there is enough oxygen for the fuel to burn completely, nontoxic carbon dioxide is produced.</p>
        <p>When carbon monoxide enters the lungs, it latches on to hemoglobin, which is supposed to shuttle oxygen to the cells. With an oxygen deficit, the human body can suffer drowsiness, headache and nausea, followed, at increasing levels of poisoning, by respiratory failure, convulsions and death.</p>
        <p>Carbon monoxide detectors are required in New York State, but New York City is exempt from that law, said Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the buildings department, which recommends use of the detectors.</p>
