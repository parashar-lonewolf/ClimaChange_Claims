        <p>LEAD: The pressures of population growth and economic expansion are starting to exceed the ability of the earth's natural systems to sustain such activity, a new report by the Worldwatch Institute warned today.</p>
        <p>The pressures of population growth and economic expansion are starting to exceed the ability of the earth's natural systems to sustain such activity, a new report by the Worldwatch Institute warned today.</p>
        <p>In its report, ''State of the World 1987,'' the Washington-based research group said human use of the air, water, land, forests and other systems that support life on earth were pushing those systems over ''thresholds'' beyond which they cannot absorb such use without permanent change and damage.</p>
        <p>The result has been declining food and fuel production in many parts of the world and, for the world as a whole, contamination of the atmosphere, climatic change, a mass extinction of plant and animal species and the long-term prospect of a decline in the quality of life, the report said.</p>
        <p>''Many of these threshold crossings, which are making the earth less habitable for future generations, are taking society by surprise,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and director of the study. Three Critical Areas</p>
        <p>''The most threatening globally are the depletion of the ozone layer, climate change and the loss of biological diversity,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The report said that ''so many natural systems becoming unstable within such a short period of time'' could result in economic and political pressures that ''could overwhelm the capacity of governments and individuals to adjust adequately.''</p>
        <p>The report cited Central America as an area where high population growth, deforestation, soil erosion and high energy costs have led to political instability and social disintegration.</p>
        <p>It said ''a frustrating paradox is emerging'' from global efforts to achieve economic growth. ''Efforts to improve living standards,'' the report asserted, ''are themselves beginning to threaten the health of the global economy. The very notion of progress begs for redefinition in light of the intolerable consequences as a result of its pursuit.''</p>
        <p>''A sustainable society satisfies its needs without diminishing the prospects of the next generation,'' the report said, adding, ''By many measures, contemporary society fails to meet this criterion.'' Damage From Fossil Fuels</p>
        <p>The report noted that much of the world's economic growth over the last century has been based on the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil. But that activity, it asserted, was changing the atmosphere to the point where the global climate was expected to shift drastically in the next century, requiring vast adjustments in agriculture and other activities that will cost billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The report also said that although overall world agricultural production has been growing, it has been declining in many countries, particularly in Africa, because of soil erosion and the spread of deserts. Even in the United States, fully a sixth of the grain harvest comes from eroding lands or draws on diminishing sources of ground water for irrigation, and so cannot be sustained over the long run, according to the report.</p>
        <p>The destruction of forests, in addition to accelerating the extinction of species, is having a heavy impact on underdeveloped countries such as India that depend on firewood for fuel, the report went on.</p>
        <p>The report also addresses the future of nuclear energy in the wake of the explosion and fire last year at the Chernobyl power plant in the Soviet Union. The report concluded that the accident was pushing many countries to gradually phase out plans to rely heavily on nuclear power for future energy needs - a path some nations had embarked on even before the Chernobyl disaster.</p>
        <p>It also said that the world was becoming divided along demographic lines, with the developed countries having stabilized population growth and most of the underdeveloped nations moving toward explosive expansion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said that the instability caused by many of these trends in areas such as Central America and Africa was of major political significance to the United States.</p>
        <p>The report said the time has come for political leaders at the highest levels to address these problems. ''The course corrections needed to restore a worldwide improvement in the human condition have no precedent,'' it said.</p>
        <p>It added: ''No generation has ever faced such a complex set of issues requiring immediate attention. Preceding generations have always been concerned about the future, but we are the first to be faced with decisions that will determine whether the earth our children inherit will be inhabitable.''</p>
