        <p>Republicans in California are poised to have their most victorious Election Day in statewide offices in over a decade, led by a popular incumbent governor whom Democrats had written off six months ago.</p>
        <p>Of the seven statewide offices up for grabs, two are all but certain to go to Republicans, and three are in a statistical tie, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. Gov.

        <p>Republicans in California are poised to have their most victorious Election Day in statewide offices in over a decade, led by a popular incumbent governor whom Democrats had written off six months ago.</p>
        <p>Of the seven statewide offices up for grabs, two are all but certain to go to Republicans, and three are in a statistical tie, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger leads his Democratic challenger by roughly 16 points, and the Republican candidate for state insurance commissioner has nearly a 10-point lead.</p>
        <p>The race for lieutenant governor is a dead heat, and Democrats are barely ahead in the races for state controller and secretary of state, with a huge percentage of voters undecided in those races.</p>
        <p>The party seems assured of victory only in the contest for attorney general -- where Jerry Brown, the mayor of Oakland and a former governor, is far ahead -- and in the race for state treasurer.</p>
        <p>The idea that the rest of the country may see a blue wave on Tuesday, while one of the most solidly Democratic states in the country may see but a dab of foam, is especially remarkable since just four years ago not a single Republican held a state office here.</p>
        <p>But while the conventional wisdom is that the popular Mr. Schwarzenegger has coattails on which his fellow Republicans are enjoying a breezy ride, the governor has run a re-election campaign heavy with liberal themes, hardly the stuff that drives partisan Republicans to the polls.</p>
        <p>The party's fortunes appear to be more connected to the remnants of the 2003 recall election, which brought Mr. Schwarzenegger into office; efforts of national Republicans to build a base here; and the specific dynamics of each race.</p>
        <p>For instance, in the insurance commissioner race, Steven Poizner, a Republican, leads the Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, by a wide margin, perhaps because Mr. Bustamante was widely discredited in his campaign to become governor in the recall election. Mr. Bustamante was the only prominent Democrat to run as a successor to Gov. Gray Davis, but performed so poorly on the campaign trail that he lost to Mr. Schwarzenegger.</p>
        <p>''When a candidate loses, who starts out ahead, they have a negative stain attached to them,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, Tom McClintock, a state legislator running for lieutenant governor, ran as a conservative Republican foil to Mr. Schwarzenegger during the recall, refusing to get out of his way until Republican voters made their choice. As a state legislator, he is widely credited with cutting the state's car tax.</p>
        <p>So while Mr. McClintock is out of step with many California voters -- he opposes stem cell research and once denounced global warming as more or less a fiction -- he is well poised to be elected, Mr. DiCamillo said.</p>
        <p>''Among Republicans, there was a positively received performance of McClintock in that campaign,'' Mr. DiCamillo said. ''Their hearts really were with him, but they used their heads and went to Schwarzenegger because they thought he had the best chance of winning. Fast-forward three years and McClintock is still viewed very positively.''</p>
        <p>In the case of secretary of state and of state controller, Democrats maintain narrow leads over their Republican opponents, but in each race a large number of voters remain undecided.</p>
        <p>The Republican incumbent in the secretary of state race, Bruce McPherson, was appointed by the governor to replace the Democratic secretary of state, Kevin Shelley, who resigned amid claims that he had directed public election money into Democratic Party activities.</p>
        <p>The recall election and the secretary of state scandal were low points for California Democrats. But after Mr. Schwarzenegger fell on his face last year with a slate of failed ballot initiatives, and given that national Republican candidates are fairing so poorly, they assumed 2006 was going to be their year.</p>
        <p>But the party has not been helped by its candidate for governor, Phil Angelides, the state treasurer, who may have depressed fund-raising and turnout.</p>
        <p>''I think turnout is a big concern,'' said Sandra Lloyd-Jones, the campaign manager for Debra Bowen, the Democratic candidate for secretary of state. ''In the primary we saw only 33 percent turnout. So that will be a key.''</p>
        <p>Turnout has been a major focus of the operatives -- culled largely from the 2004 Republican presidential campaign -- running Mr. Schwarzenegger's re-election campaign. Months ago when Mr. Schwarzenegger's poll numbers were sagging, the party spent $20 million, unprecedented in the state, putting together an effort to reach out to Republican voters and get them to the polls.</p>
        <p>"The turnout program, which has never been done here before, is working,'' said Steve Schmidt, the governor's campaign manager. ''In California, people always hoped that TV drives turnout, and that is demonstrably untrue."</p>
        <p>In a state where 43 percent of the voting public is registered Democratic, 34 percent Republican and 19 percent unaffiliated (the rest are registered with alternative parties), a large Republican victory will certainly cause teeth to gnash.</p>
