        <p>LEAD: While the photography world was busy congratulating itself last year on the 150th anniversary of the medium, and while photojournalism was being recognized as an art in several touring museum exhibitions, the public territory of still photography was quietly eroding. World events, which still photography has long memorialized, rushed by so rapidly at decade's end that cameras seemed for once unable to keep up.</p>
        <p>While the photography world was busy congratulating itself last year on the 150th anniversary of the medium, and while photojournalism was being recognized as an art in several touring museum exhibitions, the public territory of still photography was quietly eroding. World events, which still photography has long memorialized, rushed by so rapidly at decade's end that cameras seemed for once unable to keep up.</p>
        <p>At least this was true of cameras that use film, the traditional bearer of the news images that become etched in the public mind. But another kind of camera, one capable of sending its electronic signals around the world in what has come to be called ''real time,'' relished the rush of events. It was television that captured most of the memorable images of 1989.</p>
        <p>The influence of television images raises the question of whether still photography can still render memorable images, and, if not, whether the world is the better or poorer for it. It is a question that seems especially germane at the moment, when history seems to have suddenly increased its speed exponentially, but it has been lingering in the margins of journalism at least since 1963. It was in that year that much of the nation saw, on live television on a Saturday morning, the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, President Kennedy's assassin. Robert H. Jackson's photograph of the killing appeared in newspapers the next day - and later earned the photographer a Pulitzer Prize - but to those who had witnessed it on television, the still picture was only an artifact of the emotional experience of the day before.</p>
        <p>More recent examples of television's power to capture our attention are not hard to find. Think of the aborted democracy movement in China, and the nearly incomprehensible massacre in Tiananmen Square that brought it to an end. Yes, there are photographs of the incredible moment when a lone protester stopped a column of tanks out of sheer desperation and grief; you can see one on the cover of Life's current ''Year in Pictures'' issue. But the television pictures of the incident, shown on the network news the same day it occurred, had an emotional immediacy that still burns in the mind. So what if they were blurred and shaky; the feverish quality of video images can give them an added clout.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Tiananmen Square tragedy conditioned some of us to maintain a vigil around the television set whenever news was breaking. Or perhaps it was coincidence, as when all of America's baseball fans tuned in to watch a World Series game and were greeted with live coverage of the San Francisco earthquake instead. Once again television's video images had the advantage, thanks in part to the circling presence of a camera-equipped blimp.</p>
        <p>Conventional photographers managed some vivid shots of the scene, and all of America could see them in newspapers over the course of the next several days. But none conveyed the scope of the disaster as well as the live video images from the blimp, which surveyed from on high the crippled Bay Bridge, the collapsed Nimitz Freeway and the burning houses of the Marina district. Television cameras were able to do what still cameras cannot: to sweep from place to place, taking in the enormity of the event without needing to condense or abridge its magnitude.</p>
        <p>In terms of history, nothing seemed more unforgettable last year than the sight of the Berlin Wall being breached while Tom Brokaw stood in front of it, delivering the NBC evening news. The idea that history can happen in front of one's eyes is one of television's most radical contributions to 20th-century consciousness, and no doubt it has helped fuel popular dissent of the kind that spread through Eastern Europe this fall like spilled gasoline.</p>
        <p>Because of its immediacy and pervasiveness, television is now widely perceived to have been an instrumental agent in the toppling of the authoritarian Communist regimes in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania. The East Germans, in particular, were tuned in not to their state-run television but to West German stations that fed them consumerist messages and shows like ''Dallas'' and ''Miami Vice.'' Who can blame them for wanting to join the ranks of capitalism? And who would have thought that Don Johnson's speedboat would become a political instrument?</p>
        <p>The view that television is powerful in political terms is held not only by media analysts but also by despots and revolutionaries. In Rumania, the center of the intense fighting between the army and Nicolae Ceausescu's holdout loyalists was the Bucharest television station. For a time the new government was actually in residence there. No wonder, then, that photojournalists today feel like an embattled breed, and that photographs sometimes seem more like museum pieces than a part of contemporary life.</p>
        <p>Photography keeps slipping further from its erstwhile role of giving events their primary emotional contours. Today, still images function largely to confirm what we have already seen, to serve as mnemonic triggers of visual experience that has already been filtered through the omnipresent lens of the video camera. As images twice removed - at least in terms of our memory of events - they take on the quality of snapshots in a family album, with the distinction that the memories they call up are of things seen, not lived.</p>
        <p>News photographs have also begun to take on esthetic qualities, borrowing freely from the formal innovations of artists in an attempt not only to seize the eye but also to hold it. What used to be called ''stoppers'' - pictures that made page-turners pause - have been replaced by more complex and self-conscious images intended to be ''keepers.'' Color, which not too long ago was thought to get in the way of bringing home the news, is now nearly universal. Photojournalists like James Nachtwey use colors like nails to hold their pictures in our minds; the color red reads as blood red before it registers as blood.</p>
        <p>As a result, some still photographs achieve a kind of emotional parity with television images. The photograph of the wrecked space shuttle Challenger falling to earth in a sad blossom of twisted contrails sticks in the mind with all the vividness of the footage seen on the network news. Photographs may even have a built-in advantage in some cases; because they are still, they are easier to remember. (This no doubt explains why we see more and more use of ''freeze frames'' on television, in commercials and also on the news.) But memory is weighted by more than visual stimuli, and television usually cues more of those other associations. I remember where I was when I saw the Challenger disaster on television, but I do not recall where or when I first saw a photograph of it.</p>
        <p>What are the gains and losses of having television usurp photography's role in preserving events and making them history? To a degree, there is little difference. The kinds of stories that make for sensational still pictures also make for sensational (and sometimes sensationalized) television. The kinds of stories that seem to elude the 35-millimeter camera - the AIDS epidemic, acid rain, the ozone layer, drug smuggling - are also resistant to videotape. As the coverage of the San Francisco earthquake reminded us, television images need to be supplemented with verbal commentary just as much as still images need captions.</p>
        <p>Television does have one unmatched advantage, though: it is on all the time. For those with cable television, news is now a 24-hour-a-day proposition, not a morning read. Coupled with the television camera's ability to sweep across a scene and its new-found mobility, this unceasing presence gives us a view of events that is less edited and less premeditated than photographs published in magazines and newspapers. But it is also less organized and usually less coherent. Only news events of a certain magnitude are guaranteed to get the attention that would make them stick in our minds.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, television also tends to lower the threshold that distinguishes real events from entertainment. On one hand we get a TV movie of the murder of Jennifer Levin, and on the other we are treated to ''dramatizations'' on the news - purporting, among other things, to show a spy-style briefcase-passing that is only alleged to have taken place. Certainly still pictures can be manipulated and made to look almost real, but they seem more resistant than television to the conventions of prime-time entertainment.</p>
        <p>Television imagery is also inherently commercial, whether it has commercials or not. If it is not selling the products of the Western world, it is selling itself. To those who credit television with creating unrest in the Communist world, this may seem all to the good, but even as an instrument of liberation television remains essentially consumerist. As viewers, we consume not just the products we see advertised on the screen but also Hollywood's idea of the good life. In addition, news, entertainment and advertising mix and mingle with an abandon that may inspire East Germans but that ultimately diminishes all hierarchies of visual experience. Everything comes to seem equally interesting and equally a part of history.</p>
        <p>If this seems a bit far-fetched, consider a commercial that aired over the holidays. What looked to be a real-life East German soldier, putting a flower in a buttonhole in his uniform, appeared to be celebrating the new liberalization of his country. Then, superimposed on the screen, came the words ''Peace on Earth'' and, next to them, ''Pepsi.'' For the world, and especially for Western culture, this may prove the ultimate historic visual image of 1989.</p>
