        <p>MARC MILLER'S ocean view from the dining room of his  modest Cape  just footsteps from the beach -- is a painter's dream. On summer days, beachgoers make their way across the several hundred yards of sand that separate the Atlantic Ocean from his floor-to-ceiling windows. The scene is often frenetic, not serene, but that's the way Mr. Miller likes it.</p>
        <p>''This beach is for everyone,'' said Mr. Miller one recent day. ''I love it. Visitors love it. It is there day after day and year after year. And it should stay that way, untouched.''</p>
        <p>But that could change under a plan being drawn up by the Army Corps of Engineers to safeguard Mr. Miller's dining room -- though perhaps not his picture-window view. The project, referred to by the corps as the Absecon Island Shore Protection Project, would add 100 more feet of beach through Ventnor and the neighboring island towns. Moreover, the widened beach would be reinforced with a 10-foot-high dune.</p>
        <p>After the work is done, what Mr. Miller -- and all his beachfront neighbors, for that matter -- would see would not be frolicking children or greased-up sunbathers but, as he puts it, ''just a large, unneeded mountain of sand.''</p>
        <p>And the project, which could ultimately cost as much as $600 million over the next 50 years, doesn't stop at this swath of shoreline.</p>
        <p>The Corps has essentially decided that constructing dunes and rebuilding beaches in front of them is the most sensible way to protect development along the state's barrier islands as well as other stretches of the 127-mile-long coastline.</p>
        <p>But the 71-year-old Mr. Miller, a retired insurance salesman, and the group to which he belongs -- Don't Upset the Natural Environment, or DUNE -- have drawn their own line in the sand, insisting that this kind of government spending is wasteful. ''We have one of the most beautiful beaches in the world,'' he said. ''When you build one continuous dune you destroy the beach.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller and his members of his organization have not come up with an alternative plan, but at the least would like to have other options to consider.</p>
        <p>As the Corps views it, Congress has given it a mandate to protect the infrastructure that is the lifeblood of tourist and beach economies,  though it is not the Corps' job to make better beaches for recreation. In addition to the projects on the boards for this state, the corps has similar plans for much of the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
        <p>''While you can debate whether we should have built up these islands and beach areas, the fact is that there are now streets and buildings and boardwalks worth billions of dollars there,'' said Susan Scott-Lucas, chief of the Army Corps Coastal Planning Section in Philadelphia, which oversees the state's coastline from Manasquan Inlet to Cape May. ''The main reason for this whole beach replenishment project is to protect those investments. It is only the secondary purpose that are the recreation benefits.''</p>
        <p>But what DUNE and other opponents of beach replenishment see is one long dune casting a shadow over their little slice of heaven -- a ridgeline running the length of the state blocking ocean views, making it a bit more difficult to get to the beach, blowing sand into nearby streets and houses and serving no particular purpose other than to make work for the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>So far, opponents of the replenishment project have delayed the first leg of the journey: the 8.1-mile, $60 million Absecon Island project, which would run through Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate and Longport. The federal government is to bear 65 percent of the cost, while the state will take on most of the other 35 percent with the towns assuming the rest. Work is now scheduled to begin in Atlantic City in the spring and to progress down the island, finishing in Longport late next year.</p>
        <p>Along Absecon Island alone, the project would dredge 6.2 million cubic yards of sand from the ocean floor near the Absecon Inlet on the north end of the island and construct a 200-foot-wide extension to the beach in Atlantic City and a 100-foot-wide beach in the other three towns.</p>
        <p>In addition, the dunes -- four feet above boardwalk level in Atlantic City to a foot above in Ventnor -- would be built and reinforced with dune grass.</p>
        <p>And the widening of the beach and building of the dune would only be the beginning. Over the next 50 years -- at a cost of $540 million -- the corps plans to pour as much as 1.67 million cubic yards of sand along those same beaches every three years to keep them stable, with the possibility of emergency reinforcements after particularly devastating storms.</p>
        <p>Glenn Klotz is unmoved by the corps' arguments that his beloved Margate beach needs any help. Mr. Klotz, a 51-year-old computer engineer, lives several blocks from the beach -- and has for much of his life -- so it is not the ocean view he is afraid of losing. He simply regards the project as futile and wasteful.</p>
        <p>''The sand is moving, not staying anywhere,'' said Mr. Klotz. ''If there is a river of sand moving down the beach and you dump sand into it, it won't work. You are throwing the taxpayers' money into the ocean. And someone is making a lot of money pushing that sand around.''</p>
        <p>But Stewart Farrell, a professor of marine science and geology and director of the Coastal Research Center at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey, like most experts on the subject, disagrees with opponents of the replenishment project.</p>
        <p>''If the argument is that we are messing with Mother Nature, well, we messed with her long ago when we built there,'' Professor Farrell said. ''If nothing is done now, those houses will wash away and they will certainly wash away sooner without the project than with it. That is guaranteed in stone. We could make the choice to let that happen, but the politicians and the banks certainly won't like it. The fact is that beach nourishment on a large scale is the only way to keep the wolf from the door as long as sea level is rising.''</p>
        <p>SCIENTIFIC disagreement notwithstanding, Mr. Klotz, a leader of DUNE, says he and other opponents of the project feel beach replenishment is a political football, noting that although the Clinton Administration has been against the project, the Republican-controlled Congress has continued to finance the corps' proposals.</p>
        <p>President Clinton vetoed the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2001, which included funds for future beach replenishment projects, saying that the legislation passed by Congress included too much federal money for all Army Corps projects. Indeed, officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency testified that the projects were too expensive and, if undertaken at all, should be done by individual communities.</p>
        <p>''You can imagine the pressure on local politicians to go along,'' he said. ''They must think, 'What if a storm comes and I don't build this dune? Will I ever be elected again?' Fortunately, some of the political people are showing some courage.''</p>
        <p>After about 750 people -- most of them opposed to the project -- attended three informational meetings held by the Corps of Engineers over the past several months, elected officials in Ventnor, Margate and Longport said they wanted to wait until they had more information before they signed onto the project.</p>
        <p>''That will probably, at the very least, delay work,'' said Ms. Scott-Lucas. ''And the project will not happen unless every town along the beach wants in.''</p>
        <p>This is dismaying to Mayor James Whelan of Atlantic City, which is by far the largest city on Absecon Island.</p>
        <p>''It's a very frustrating issue for us,'' said Mayor Whelan. ''We have done anything the feds and the state have asked us to do, and our neighbors on the island have not. If you live on barrier islands, you need to pump sand. That's the fact. We can pump them now or we can do it 10 or 20 years from now after we've had a devastating storm. You can't wait for unanimous support on every issue. We need to do this before a disaster happens.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Scott-Lucas explained the need to have every town on the island on board this way: You can't have a dune for several miles, then have no dune and expect the dunes to be stable. It would be a waste of time to do that kind of partial project.</p>
        <p>In general, the scientific community favors the construction of dunes to save the beaches as an environmentally benign approach to beach preservation.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Professor Farrell said that the arguments against building the dunes were flawed. ''People say it is a big pile of dirt,'' Professor Farrell said, ''but they go on that other side of the dune and that dirt is what they love to call a beach.</p>
        <p>''They say dunes collect trash, but they don't,'' he continued. ''People do that and municipalities are forced to clean it up, which they generally do. Then they talk about bugs, rats and muggers. Muggers can find better hideouts. Rats can't find food there. And, bugs, all right, they have bugs, but there are probably bugs in everyone's house at the beach.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Klotz dismissed Mr. Farrell's advocacy of beach replenishment, saying he was a mouthpiece for the corps. On the other hand, he said that people who own beach property should not not be reimbursed -- either through insurance or legislation -- should their homes be washed away.</p>
        <p>''The land moves,'' he said. ''Back in the beginning of the 1900's, part of Longport detached and ended up as the north part of Ocean City. That's only natural, and we who live here on the island understand that. We are prepared to live with that and, certainly, we don't think people in Cherry Hill, or Ohio for that matter, should be paying for filling our beaches.''</p>
        <p>Interestingly, that is the objection an otherwise sympathetic scientist, Norbert P. Psuty, a professor of marine and coastal sciences at Cook College, Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>''I have always been in favor of dunes, whether artificially or naturally made,'' said Professor Psuty. ''They are there not to prevent the shore from eroding, but to prevent the storm surge inland. From a natural kind of process perspective, it more closely duplicates the natural system.</p>
        <p>''My attitude on beach fill is that I am antagonistic on the way it is paid for,'' he added. ''Locals should pay a larger share. I am philosophically opposed to state and federal taxpayers paying for local costs. Those who go to the beach are paying a fee going into the town coffers. I don't see why that can't be used to pay for beach fill.</p>
        <p>Beach fill and dune reconstruction is a relatively new way of preserving beaches. In the early 20th century, towns often constructed groins -- long, rocky piers into the ocean -- to divert sand to their beaches or to keep sand from washing away. Eventually some towns, like Sea Girt in northern Monmouth County, ended up with virtually no beach, and a sea wall was built there to stop the ocean from washing onto the adjacent buildings and roads.</p>
        <p>Or there are places like Wildwood, where the beach has filled in from both the north and the south -- largely because of jetties that the corps erected years ago at Cape May Inlet -- to such an extent that it can actually fit another city block or two on some stretches and still have a substantial surf. Because of that, Five Mile Island in Wildwood is the only barrier island in the state where no dunes or beach replenishment projects are planned.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome of the proposed project on Absecon Island and other beaches along the state's coastline through 2005, real estate firms are unconcerned about the potential effect on the market for beachfront property.</p>
        <p>''The public may right now have difficulty with the federal government trying to push this through,'' said Michael Zitomer, vice president of Zitomer Real Estate, which has offices in Margate and Longport. ''But I think you have to sacrifice for the 'what if.' What if that big storm really hits? People just need to receive the right information and then, I think, they will realize that everyone will benefit. And, let's face it, people will build second-floor decks and they'll have their views and property values won't be affected.''</p>
        <p>Farther south, Seven Mile Island stands to be next in line for the dune project, or perhaps the first late next year if the towns on Absecon Island balk. And the more upscale and less densely populated towns of Avalon and Stone Harbor that make up Seven Mile Island appear to welcome the beach fill.</p>
        <p>Both towns have financed their own smaller projects over the last few years -- Avalon on the north end of the island and in Stone Harbor between 98th and 110th Streets. Since each individual project undertaken by the Corps of Engineers requires Congressional approval, the financing for Seven Mile Island has not yet been authorized, though it seems to be taken as a matter of course there.</p>
        <p>''When they built the dunes from 98th Street, maybe you could no longer see the ocean from the sidewalk, but I didn't hear anyone complain,'' said Bob Sellers of Diller-Fisher Real Estate in Stone Harbor. ''Maybe it will actually enhance property values, even if it is only the appearance of safety. Besides, now people seem to build with, say, guest rooms and storage downstairs and the master bedroom and kitchen with big windows on the second floor, higher than the dunes.''</p>
        <p>JUST how the beach replenishment projects will affect flood insurance rates is an open question, at least according to Sam Wierman, who owns the Ide Insurance Agency in Stone Harbor.</p>
        <p>''It's a complicated formula that the federal agencies that underwrite the insurance use, but having dunes will factor into it and certainly can't hurt, Mr. Wierman said. ''Still, in 20 years, I can count on two hands the claims I have gotten from flooding on the beach. Ironically enough, it may be the bay that is the problem.''</p>
        <p>For all the controversy about the dunes and the beach widening, said Professor Psuty of Rutgers, it is indeed the bay side of all these islands that probably needs some more attention.</p>
        <p>''Sea level in New Jersey has come up a foot over the last century, and it is estimated that it could come up two more feet this century,'' he said. ''At the same time, development has leveled some of the islands by two, or as many as six feet.</p>
        <p>''So what has happened,'' he added, ''is that on the bay side of the island, some of the buildings are now only a foot above sea level. The streets flood regularly. And with global warming and continued development, it only projects to be worse. You can put up 20-foot dunes and it's not going to help the bay side. People may well be fighting the wrong fight.''</p>
        <p>Such talk only inflames Mr. Miller of DUNE.</p>
        <p>''What we really need is more and more information, not just putting up a dune because the Army Corps say it's the way to go,'' he said. ''Mother Nature is going to govern in the end, though. I'm willing to leave it to her and take my chances.''</p>
