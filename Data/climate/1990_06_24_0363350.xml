        <p>LEAD:</p>
        <p>THE ECONOMY</p>
        <p>Profiting From the Bailout</p>
        <p>How to profit from the savings and loan bailout: First, default on a real estate project. Then, go back into business under a new name. Finally, turn around and buy the property from the Government at a fraction of its initial cost. Such are the shenanigans already afflicting Federal sales of property seized from failed savings and loans.</p>
        <p>THE ECONOMY</p>
        <p>Profiting From the Bailout</p>
        <p>How to profit from the savings and loan bailout: First, default on a real estate project. Then, go back into business under a new name. Finally, turn around and buy the property from the Government at a fraction of its initial cost. Such are the shenanigans already afflicting Federal sales of property seized from failed savings and loans. There's more: consultants and former savings executives drawing six-figure payments to manage failed institutions; country-club expenses billed to the Government; a deposit on the sale of one building made with a suitcase of cash. Should the Government screen buyers, managers and brokers to make sure none were involved in the savings and loan collapse? Do that in Texas, some say, and almost nobody would be left to broker or buy. But with a single state accounting for more than half the 35,908 properties (book value $14.9 billion) up for sale, the bailout is likely to result in a flood of funds from the rest of the nation into Texas.</p>
        <p>Pointing Fingers in Washington</p>
        <p>It was tough enough for Democrats and Republicans to observe a tacit nonaggression pact when the savings and loan bailout amounted to some piddling tens of billions. But now that it is a certified, half-trillion-dollar disaster, politicians from the President on down are hunting for someone - someone else - to blame. Democrats accuse the Administration of causing a second savings and loan crisis by bungling the bailout that Congress approved last year. ''The minute the bill was signed, there was an abdication of responsibility,'' Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, said at a recent hearing. Marlin Fitzwater, speaking for the President, responded sharply last week. He cited the roles several Democratic senators and House members played in the mess, and said, ''There are a lot of battles that can be fought on this turf, and we're ready.''</p>
        <p>Accusations Against Neil Bush</p>
        <p>Mr. Fitzwater's attack on the Democrats took place the same day it was revealed that Federal regulators had considered banning the President's son, Neil, from the banking business. A draft document released by the House Banking Committee said Mr. Bush had violated rules on conflicts of interest three times as a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. For lack of evidence, the Office of Thrift Supervision has instead has sought only to prohibit Mr. Bush from violating the rules again. Mr. Bush has said he did nothing wrong.</p>
        <p>Bargains, but for Whom?</p>
        <p>Last week brought a sobering example of the losses the Government can expect for real estate taken from failed savings institutions. The Gibraltar Savings Association invested $330 milion in the Stonebridge Ranch, a dazzling spread of golf courses, man-made ponds and million-dollar homes north of Dallas. Richard C. Strauss, son of the former Democratic Party chairman, Robert S. Strauss, was the project's manager. The Government agreed on Thursday to sell it for $61 million to Yukio Kitano, a Japanese industrialist.</p>
        <p>Credit Crunch Is Relative</p>
        <p>Alan Greenspan isn't keeping Fed-guessers guessing. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman said on Capitol Hill that the economy will keep chugging along without risk of recession. And, implicitly, without easier money from the Fed. And what about those complaints of a credit crunch? Credit seems tight only when compared with the lax standards that bankers and regulators have allowed, he said.</p>
        <p>No Free Ride for LTV</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court ruled last week that the Government can limit its Aid to Corporations with Dependent Pensioners. Only the truly needy companies will qualify, not those in search of a handout. In the case at issue, the LTV Corporation filed for bankruptcy four years ago and turned its responsibilities over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which paid reduced benefits. Then LTV agreed in talks with the United Steelworkers of America to make up much of the difference between the Federal payouts and its former pension plan. The agency saw that its safety net was becoming more of a trampoline. It ordered LTV to resume paying for its pension plan without Government support, and the case went to court. The ruling will keep corporations from dumping more of their pension costs on the agency, which is already in financial trouble</p>
        <p>Economy Winds Down</p>
        <p>The latest gross national product economy is gasping but growing. A 1.9 percent annual growth rate for the first quarter, after a 1.1 percent rise in the fourth quarter last year, continued the weakest pace of expansion since 1986. The first-quarter number was revised last week from an earlier estimate of 1.3 percent, but economists paid more attention to a lowered figure for consumption. ''It points to slower growth ahead,'' said Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank.</p>
        <p>Stocks Stumble</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78.71 points last week to 2,857.18. Traders blamed familiar culprits: computerized trading programs, a weakening bond market and fears of lower corporate profits.</p>
        <p>COMPANIES</p>
        <p>The Patent Wars</p>
        <p>Between Japan and America, the patent battles can be as punishing as the trade wars. A Federal District Court judge banned Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. from selling some chips last week; a higher court soon issued a stay. Analysts say Motorola faces the greater threat. The patent squabble pits Motorola's popular 68030 chip, used in Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems computers, against a Hitachi chip not yet sold in this country. ''If both chips had to stop shipping, Motorola would be hurt more,'' said John M. Geraghty, an analyst at First Boston. He added that Motorola is accused of far fewer patent violations than Hitachi. The broader issue might be the balance of power in patents, he said, with Japanese companies finding it much easier to enforce patent rights in the United States than American companies do in Japan. Hitachi led all companies in American patents last year, with 1,053.</p>
        <p>Ben's Advice for Mr. Trump</p>
        <p>Donald J. Trump went to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he presumably studied the art of leverage. He might have done better to study the teachings of the university's father, Benjamin Franklin. ''He who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing,'' Franklin said. If Mr. Trump can claim that his methods rescued Central Park's Wollman Rink, Franklin even made the colonial postal system profitable. Mr. Trump has insisted he is no gambler: ''I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines.'' But Franklin would have kept him from exaggerating his casinos' expected performance. ''Ah, think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty,'' Franklin said. ''The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt. 'Tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright.'' Even outside of work, Mr. Trump has failed to follow some of Franklin's best-known advice: ''In all your amours, you should prefer old women to young ones.''</p>
        <p>In Brief</p>
        <p>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company plans to build four plants to produce refrigerants that, unlike chlorofluorocarbons, would not deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>*</p>
        <p>The House Judiciary Committee voted last week to repeal most of the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust law, the first time such a measure has gone so far. It is still more likely to become a ''cash cow'' - provoking insurance companies to raise their campaign contributions - than a law.</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>Bustin' the Charts</p>
        <p>Rapper turned recording mogul? M. C. Hammer said last week that he was starting his own label, Bustin' Records. Mr. Hammer's first venture in the industry came three years ago, when he was an assistant to Charles Finley, owner of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. He borrowed enough from a couple players to press his own record, then sold thousands from his basement and the back of his car. A contract with Capital Records followed. Now Mr. Hammer's second album, ''Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em,'' has the top spot on Billboard's chart, and his own label has plans to release albums by 10 new groups.</p>
        <p>'Junk' Casualty</p>
        <p>The Coniston Partners will be among Wall Street's most feared corporate raiders no more. They plan to return the proceeds from their main, $700 million investment fund to backers. With the stock market high and the ''junk bond'' market low, Coniston has all but run out of financing and promising deals. The firm was founded on the familiar 1980's premise that forcing companies to cough up huge payoffs for noisy, impatient investors would somehow improve corporate performance. That notion at least did wonders for Coniston's performance, with 40 percent annual returns common until the firm lagged the stock market last year. The partners plan to keep their stakes in TW Services Inc. and the UAL Corporation, which after repeated raids and restructuring has gone from being the nation's largest airline to No. 2.</p>
        <p>An Even Bigger Philip Morris</p>
        <p>The Philip Morris Companies agreed on Friday to buy most of the operations of Jacobs Suchard A.G., the Swiss coffee and chocolate company, for $3.8 billion. The deal will vastly expand Philip Morris's presence in Europe, where its Kraft General Foods subsidiary already has revenues of more than $3 billion. Suchard's products include the familiar triangular Toblerone chocolate bars. Suchard will further Philip Morris's diversification away from tobacco.</p>
        <p>A First Bout of Unemployment</p>
        <p>East German unemployment is already surging. The official rate rose from 100,000 to 130,000 in the first two weeks of June. East German leaders have said they expect at least 20 percent of their nation's businesses to shut down after the two German economies become one on July 2. Economists say that more than 2 million of East Germany's 9 million workers will lose their jobs over the next year. Under its Communist rulers, the country had no unemployment - but plenty of inefficient factories spewing out second-rate goods.</p>
        <p>The Real Taj</p>
        <p>The ''Trumped-up Taj,'' one Indian newspaper called it. Indian publications just can't see how a wealthy American could transform a classic Mogul memorial into a mish-mash of onion domes, minarets and zillion-watt neon signs. ''It demonstrates that Hollywood does not have a monopoly on bad taste,'' said The Saturday Statesman. The original Taj was built in the 17th century by Shah Jehan as a tomb for his beloved consort, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike Donald J. Trump, The Sunday Observer said, Shah Jehan needed no bank loans. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, continued negotiating with his bankers.</p>
