        <p>IT is not easy to think of Spain as Poland. Stroll around this southern city at dusk, beneath the palms, beside the handsome bridges on the Guadalquivir River, past the chic boutiques and the Häagen-Dazs outlet, the Gothic cathedral and the Moorish palace, and it is scarcely Warsaw that comes to mind.</p>
        <p>But, insisted Adam Michnik, the Polish writer, ''Poland is the new Spain, absolutely.'' He continued: ''Spain was a poor country when it joined the European Union 21 years ago. It no longer is. We will see the same results in Poland.''</p>
        <p>If history is prologue, Mr. Michnik is likely to be right. The European Union, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of its founding treaty this weekend, is more often associated with Brussels bureaucrats setting the maximum curvature of cucumbers than with transformational power. But step by step, stipulation by stipulation, Europe has been remade.</p>
        <p>What began in limited fashion in 1957 as a drive to remove tariff barriers and promote commercial exchange has ended by banishing war from Europe, enriching it beyond measure, and producing what Mr. Michnik called ''the first revolution that has been absolutely positive.''</p>
        <p>Asia, still beset by nationalisms and open World War II wounds, can only envy Europe's conjuring away agonizing history, a process that involved a voluntary dilution of national sovereignty unthinkable in the United States.</p>
        <p>This achievement will be symbolized as leaders from the 27 member states gather in Berlin -- the city that stood at the crux of violent 20th-century European division. They will sign a ''Berlin Declaration'' celebrating the peace, freedom, wealth and democracy that the Treaty of Rome has now helped spread among almost half a billion Europeans.</p>
        <p>But it is a celebration in uncertainty. A bigger union, expanded to include the ex-Communist states of Central Europe, has proved largely ungovernable. A constitution designed to streamline its governance was rejected in 2005. Integration has been a European triumph, but not always of those who are part of large-scale Muslim immigration. ''The E.U. is on autopilot, in stalemate, in deep crisis,'' said Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister who seven years ago called for a European federation run by a true European government. The founding treaty, signed by the six founding members on March 25, 1957, rested on creative ambiguity. It called for an ''ever closer union among the European peoples''; behind it lay dreams of a United States of Europe. The bold politics nestled inside basic economics -- a common market -- and was thus rendered unthreatening. A common currency, the euro, emerged in 2002.</p>
        <p>Still, the ambiguity persisted; it has proved divisive. Economic power has been built more effectively than political or strategic unity. Military power has lagged. Recent disputes -- from Iraq to current American plans to install missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic -- have shown how hard it is for Europe to speak with one voice or, as Fischer put it, ''define what strategic interests it has in common.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, ''autopilot'' in the union still amounts to a lot.</p>
        <p>It will ensure, for example, that over $100 billion is sent to Poland from now to 2013 to upgrade its infrastructure and agriculture, a sum that dwarfs American aid. Similarly, more than $190 billion has been devoted to Spain since it joined the union in 1986, 11 years after the end of Franco's dictatorship.</p>
        <p>The result has been Spain's extraordinary transition from a country whose per capita output was 71 percent of the European average in 1985, 90 percent in 2004, and now 100.7 percent of the median of the 27 members. Spain has moved into the club of the well off. Dictatorship seems utterly remote.</p>
        <p>Poland under the Kaczynski brothers is far from overcoming the painful legacy of Communist tyranny, but by 2025 -- its own 21-year membership anniversary -- safe to say that healing will be advanced.</p>
        <p>''The E.U. slashes political risk,'' said Chris Huhne, a Liberal Democrat member of the British Parliament. ''It also exercises a soft power on its periphery that has far more transformational impact than the American neocon agenda in the Middle East. Countries in the Balkans wanting to come into the European democratic family have to adapt.''</p>
        <p>That adaptation is economic as well as political. The creation of something approximating an American single market has been powerful in ending cartels and monopolies, introducing competition, pushing privatization and generally promoting the market over heavily managed capitalism.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say, of course, that European capitalism is American capitalism. It is less fluid; it creates fewer jobs. It is also less harsh.</p>
        <p>Indeed, defense of what is called the European social model, with universal health care and extensive unemployment benefits, has become a tenet of European identity. How far that identity, as opposed to national identities, exists today is a matter of dispute. Only 2 percent of European Union inhabitants of working age live in member states other than their own.</p>
        <p>But a survey in the French daily Le Figaro showed that 71 percent of French people now feel some pride in a European identity. The Erasmus program has helped about 1.5 million young Europeans spend a year studying in European universities outside their own countries.</p>
        <p>The movie ''L'Auberge Espagnole,'' or ''The Spanish Inn,'' captured the Erasmus experience: jumbled cultures, linguistic and amorous discovery, and the births of new identities from this mingling. Countless Eurocouples have not been the least of the union's achievements.</p>
        <p>How this generation will deal with what is often called the question of Europe's final destination remains unclear. The union is open geographically: It could end at the Iranian and Iraqi borders if Turkey joins. It is also open politically: How much of a federation should Europe be?</p>
        <p>The union has been upended by Communism's unexpected demise. The European Economic Community, as formed in 1957, did not try to liberate the continent; it tried to ensure that half of it cohered in freedom. ''Europe was initially built on accepting -- with more or less equanimity -- to forget about half of it, including historic centers of European civilization like Prague or Budapest,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British analyst. ''And the irony is that it is precisely the return of these centers that has thrown the E.U. into existential crisis today.''</p>
        <p>That crisis is partly procedural: It is not clear how you get things done in a Europe of 27. It is partly of identity: The rapidly cohering Europe with a Franco-German core is gone, and nobody quite knows what to put in its place. And it is partly political: The conception of Europe in post-Communist countries is simply different.</p>
        <p>These differences are apparent in recent tensions between Germany and Poland, whose reconciliation has been one of the European Union's conspicuous miracles.</p>
        <p>Germany has been utterly remade by an integrating Europe to the point that more people worry today about German pacifism than expansionism. But Poland is just entering that transformational process; under Lech Kaczynski's conservative presidency its wariness of the pooling of sovereignty inherent in the union has been clear.</p>
        <p>Poland today, said Karl Kaiser, a German political analyst, ''looks out and tends to see the old Germany and the old expansionist Russia; it has not taken part mentallyin the long process of integration.''</p>
        <p>So Warsaw sees Moscow-Berlin plots of sinister memory when Russia and Germany agree to build a gas pipeline directly between each other, under the Baltic Sea rather than over Poland.</p>
        <p>It pushes hard, but unsuccessfully, for references to Europe's Christian roots in the Berlin declaration. It contemplates, as does the Czech Republic, installing part of a new American missile defense system against Iran, and does so despite German unease, Russian fury and the absence of any European or NATO consensus.</p>
        <p>Of course, what Poles and Czechs see beyond Germany or Russia is the America that defeated the Soviet Union and freed them: Poles, as Mr. Michnik noted, ''tend to be more pro-American than Americans.''</p>
        <p>Whatever tempering of this sentiment Iraq has brought, Poland and the rest of Central and Eastern Europe remain more pro-American than the Europe of the Treaty of Rome. With Britain they now form a club within the club that sees Europe more as loose alignment than strategic union.</p>
        <p>''For Britain, Europe is a convenience rather than a concept,'' said Karsten Voigt, a German Foreign Ministry official.</p>
        <p>This is an intractable division, and the Bush administration has accentuated the split with its ad hoc approach to European alliances. That stance was evident at the time of the Iraq invasion and again today over missile defenses. Coalitions of the willing tend to leave the unwilling bristling.</p>
        <p>At a deeper level, Homo europeus, formed over 50 years, now lies at some distance from Homo americanus. Post-heroic Europeans tend to favor procedure, talk, international institutions and incremental measures to resolve issues, where Americans tend to favor resolve backed by force.</p>
        <p>Peace is much more of an absolute value today in Europe than in the United States, as are opposition to the death penalty and commitment to reversing global warming. So what? The ties that bind the Atlantic family remain strong. But, unglued by the cold war's end, they are not as strong as they were. Europe sees the United States today more through the prism of Baghdad than Berlin.</p>
        <p>Generations pass; memories fade; perceptions change. That is inevitable. The great achievement of the European Union has been to absorb those changes and zigzags within the broader push for unity.</p>
        <p>That push, that journey, is incomplete. But Europeans have learned, as Mr. Eyal said, that ''traveling can be just as good as arriving.'' Perpetual difficulty has been the union's perpetual stimulus. A United States of Europe remains a distant, probably unreachable dream. At the same time, continent-wide war has become an unthinkable nightmare.</p>
        <p>''The E.U. is an unfinished project, but so what?'' Mr. Voigt said. ''Why be nervous? We have time.''</p>
        <p>Time enough even, the 50-year history of the union suggests, for Turkey to become the new Poland.</p>
