        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Just because certain environmental alarms have not played out in the predicted time frame does not mean that the dire warnings of environmentalists should be dismissed.</p>
        <p>The majority of those with expertise in the field believe that man-made global warming is a serious, impending threat.</p>
        <p>There is little dispute that we are in a period of mass species extinction caused by human activity. And catastrophic emergent diseases like AIDS may have their origins in cavalier human exploitation of fragile resources. Each of these problems is dire enough to deserve many times the political attention it receives.</p>
        <p>Nor is public skepticism a good reason to dismiss the concerns of environmental ''alarmists.'' The general public does not have the time, training or inclination to consider the complex data available about the most serious environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Just as we defer to experts in fields like medicine and global finance, so we should with grave environmental threats.</p>
