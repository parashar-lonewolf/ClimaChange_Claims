        <p>WHAT New Yorkers and other Northerners consider a heat wave often feels like a routine summer day to residents of Dallas or Phoenix or Jacksonville. Now scientists say that such feelings are not just a matter of discomfort, but also of life and death. Heat, they have found, generally begins killing people at lower temperatures in New York and other Northern cities than in the South and Southwest, where people are more acclimated to hot weather.</p>
        <p>And in an attempt to create an early warning system for killer heat waves, scientists have lately identified a special set of climatic conditions that appear to send summer death rates soaring and that also have much to do with the regional variations in mortality thresholds.</p>
        <p>Not just any stretch of extremely hot weather, they have found, trips the temperature threshold switch that causes mortality to soar. Rather, the switch is tripped by one special, sharply defined sort of extremely hot, humid, oppressive air mass that only infrequently develops over a given area, overwhelming people's ability to adapt. If its arrival and duration can be reliably forecast, the scientists believe, cautionary warnings can be issued and lives can be saved.</p>
        <p>Case Study: St. Louis</p>
        <p>The extraordinarily oppressive weather system responsible for most heat-related deaths is described in a paper to be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. It can afflict any number of cities, including New York, and is essentially the same kind of system in each city.But so far it has been studied most thoroughly in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>There it brings temperatures that reach at least 96 degrees, the recently established threshold for a surge in mortality in that city. It also displays a number of other features that distinguish it from nine other kinds of summer air masses, some of them also quite hot, and it combines humid air from the tropics with dry, torrid air borne on winds from southwestern deserts. These huge systems originate in one part of the United States but retain their coherence as they move from region to region. They bring clear skies and high nighttime temperatures that in St. Louis staynear 80 degrees.</p>
        <p>This air mass dominates St. Louis's summer weather only 7 percent of the time on the average. It appears several times in some years and not at all in others. When it does arrive it generally stays in place for several days. The longer it stays, the more people die, as many as 10 to 20 a day in a big city.</p>
        <p>''By the time the fifth day rolls around, you are killing a lot of people,'' said Dr. Laurence S. Kalkstein of the University of Delaware's Center for Climatic Research, who has come up with the findings. A specialist in the field of medical climatology, he is now a visiting scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, where he coordinates a major research project on the health implications of global warming.</p>
        <p>According to a preliminary analysis of a selected sample of 10 cities by Dr. Kalkstein, three besides New York and St. Louis are apt to be visited by a killing air mass: Boston, Philadelphia and Memphis.</p>
        <p>Chicago and San Francisco are susceptible to a lesser degree.</p>
        <p>Dangerously Out of the Norm</p>
        <p>What makes these air masses so deadly, said Dr. Kalkstein, is that their particular combination of features suddenly pushes the level of heat stress far above the summer norm to which people have become adapted. In Northeastern cities, he said, ''a hot, oppressive air mass doesn't occur that often, so it has tremendous impact.''</p>
        <p>In the South and Southwest, he said, the summer norm may itself bring extremely high temperatures, but in the absence of a sudden jump to another level of heat stress, there is no spurt in deaths. Since Southerners are acclimated to the higher temperatures they normally experience, those normal temperatures cause no more deaths, per capita, than the lower temperatures Northerners normally experience.</p>
        <p>The researchers have ruled out the possibility that the most susceptible people have already succumbed in the South.</p>
        <p>The paper in Environmental Health Perspectives is the latest in a series by Dr. Kalkstein and colleagues that in the last 14 months have dealt with regional variations in weather-related deaths.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, Dr. Kalkstein devised a new index of weather discomfort, the weather stress index. It assumed that the discomfort caused by any given set of weather conditions varies depending on the normal weather people are used to in their area. Developed under a contract with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the measure is incorporated in the discomfort indexes of today's routine weather reports.</p>
        <p>Now Dr. Kalkstein and colleagues in both government and academia have extended their research on regional differences from discomfort to mortality and the role of large weather systems in boosting it.</p>
        <p>Among the findings common to all areas of the country is that heat, not air pollution, is the primary short-term killer associated with summer weather systems. ''Over the long run,'' Dr. Kalkstein said, ''air pollution is very damaging to human health.'' But on a day-to-day level, he said, it appears that heat rather than the more concentrated pollution that often accompanies it is more important in pushing susceptible people over the edge.</p>
        <p>Mortality data are not yet available for this year's hot spells in Phoenix, Los Angeles, New York, Washington and other cities, but Dr. Kalkstein said he had ''no doubt'' that they have caused a lot of damage. The mid-July hot spell in New York, with its temperatures in the 90's, was ''a candidate'' for the most-damaging category, he said, but its impact may have been less than it would have been, say, in June because heat waves become less damaging later in the season. This is because people become more acclimated as the season progresses, Dr. Kalkstein believes.</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Kalkstein and a colleague, Robert E. Davis of the University of Virginia, reported on a study of mortality data and temperature records that revealed the regional differences in susceptibility to heat. For a number of cities, they established threshold temperatures at which deaths begin to rise.</p>
        <p>Fatal Temperatures Vary</p>
        <p>In New York, for instance, the threshold is 92 degrees; in St. Louis, 96; in Dallas, 103; and in Los Angeles, 81. (The Los Angeles figure is low because the weather station where it was taken is at the airport, which is cooled by the nearby ocean; temperatures downtown and in the valleys are higher.) In many southern and southwestern cities that are normally hot and whose residents have become acclimated, no threshold can be detected and excess deaths generally do not occur. Phoenix has been one such city. The big question now, Dr. Kalkstein said, is whether the 120-degree-plus temperatures recorded in Phoenix earlier this year - by far the highest ever - were such a big departure from the norm that heat-related deaths soared for the first time.</p>
        <p>Changes in the local environment, especially development and construction, are probably responsible for whatever change may be taking place in Phoenix's climate, he said, although global warming could have similar effects over a broader area in the future.</p>
