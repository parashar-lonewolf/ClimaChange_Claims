        <p>Testing New Jersey schoolchildren for curvature of the spine sounded like a good idea when it was proposed in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Today, however, the program is considered by some the epitome of what is wrong with local governments being ordered by the state to adopt programs without receiving the money to operate them.</p>
        <p>New Jersey voters will be asked on Tuesday to approve a constitutional amendment to prohibit the state from imposing programs on schools, counties or municipalities without providing money, unless the programs are approved by three-fourths of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Three other public questions appear on the ballot. Voters will be asked, among other things, to authorize a $340 million bond issue to allow the state to acquire additional land for conservation and recreational use.</p>
        <p>As for the mandated programs, critics say that they waste millions of dollars in administrative costs every year, that they survive long after they have outlived their usefulness and that they eat up money better spent on services that communities really want.</p>
        <p>The requirement that schools test for curvature of the spine offers a case in point, these critics say. It was useful to identify affected children in the initial survey, they point out, but the law as written requires annual testing of all public schoolchildren 10 or older, even if they are routinely examined by family physicians or have never exhibited any signs of the ailment.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the amendment say voters should not throw the baby out with the  bath water. Every effort should be made to weed out unnecessary or outdated programs, they maintain, but the mandates remain a useful tool to establish uniform economic and social policies that local governing bodies might otherwise neglect.</p>
        <p>"We feel the Legislature already has the power not to pass irresponsible mandates," said Barbara Bohi, vice president for advocacy of the New Jersey League of Women Voters, a group that opposes the amendment.</p>
        <p>Another opponent is the New Jersey Environmental Federation. "When efforts are made to shape policy based on budgets rather than the public good," said Amy Goldsmith, the federation's executive director, "then the needs of the public will not be met."</p>
        <p>But the measure has the backing of powerful forces, including Gov. Christine  Todd Whitman and the Republican leadership of the Legislature, as well as the League of Municipalities, the Association of Counties and the School Boards Association.</p>
        <p>"Passage of the amendment will change the way business is done in Trenton," said William G. Dressel Jr., the league's executive director. "From now on legislators will need to analyze the costs of a bill in a public forum and who is going to pay for it."</p>
        <p>The amendment would apply only to future or expanded state programs, not existing ones. Nor would it affect Federal requirements like welfare and environmental spending. It would provide for the creation of an independent, bipartisan council to determine whether new state laws or regulations imposed mandates on local governments without providing money.</p>
        <p>The land-conservation-bond issue is being put before voters for the eighth time. A total of $1.1 billion has been approved to acquire 250,000 acres of woodlands, parks and farms. This year's bond issue asks for $30 million to be used to buy coastal property endangered by a rising sea and property subject to  flooding along the Passaic River.</p>
        <p>Also on the ballot are these items: a measure creating a state redistricting  commission to redraw Congressional districts after every Federal census, and a resolution dedicating an increased portion of state gasoline taxes to the transportation fund, which is used for state roads.</p>
