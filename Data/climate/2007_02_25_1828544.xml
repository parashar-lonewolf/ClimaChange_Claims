        <p>BOULDER, Colo., used to be a tough place to eat good food. For all its outdoorsy charm, health-conscious Boulderites had to settle for restaurants that served mush like overcooked lentils and brown rice. The food may have been healthy, but it was also monochromatic and unappetizing.</p>
        <p>''You could ski or mountain bike, but you had to cook at home,'' said Matthew Jansen, the chef and owner of Mateo, a Mediterranean-influenced restaurant (1837 Pearl Street; 303-443-7766; www.mateorestaurant.com).</p>

        <p>BOULDER, Colo., used to be a tough place to eat good food. For all its outdoorsy charm, health-conscious Boulderites had to settle for restaurants that served mush like overcooked lentils and brown rice. The food may have been healthy, but it was also monochromatic and unappetizing.</p>
        <p>''You could ski or mountain bike, but you had to cook at home,'' said Matthew Jansen, the chef and owner of Mateo, a Mediterranean-influenced restaurant (1837 Pearl Street; 303-443-7766; www.mateorestaurant.com).</p>
        <p>But thanks partly to a recent influx of urbanites, especially from New York and California, several high-end restaurants have opened in Boulder. The new kitchens are refining the town's hippie past, with an almost obsessive focus on organic ingredients, brand-name boutique farms and eco-friendly practices, like composting, recycling and renewable energy.</p>
        <p>''Boulder's restaurant scene is night and day different from 10 years ago,'' Mr. Jansen said. Reflecting this culinary awakening, the menu at Mateo features local ingredients; recent items have included entrecôte of Colorado beef with a béarnaise sauce ($18) and frisée salad in a creamy dressing made with Haystack Mountain goat cheese ($9). Vegetarians could order the roasted squash and fresh gnocchi ($15).</p>
        <p>Down the street is Frasca Food and Wine (1738 Pearl Street; 303-442-6966; www.frascafoodandwine.com), an Italian restaurant run by Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, a chef who trained at the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif., and Bobby Stuckey, the master sommelier. The seasonal menu, a tribute to the Northern Italian cuisine of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, recently included a risotto made with Indonesian lemon vinegar and musque de Provence from Red Wagon Farm, a local grower ($19). Another popular dish is rambasici -- pork-, duck- and rice-filled cabbage rolls with winter vegetables and San Marzano tomato broth ($25).</p>
        <p>''We not only filled a niche in Boulder, but have created a new culture,'' said Mr. Mackinnon-Patterson, who with Mr. Stuckey travels frequently to Italy to survey the food and wine. ''Think about the frico caldo'' -- a potato cake -- ''we serve. Is that health food? But it's made with artisanal cheese, organic potatoes and the best onions. Who wouldn't eat health food like that?''</p>
        <p>If Frasca is creating a new culture, then the Kitchen (1039 Pearl Street; 303-544-5973; www.thekitchencafe.com) is creating a culinary community. The water at this neighborhood bistro is artesian spring, the food organic and free-range, and the space serene, with crisp white interiors, chalkboard menus and rustic tables.</p>
        <p>''Some people eat here as many as five times a week,'' said Hugo Matheson, the chef and co-owner. They come for high-concept comfort foods like pork chops braised in fennel sofrito ($26), and burgers made from hormone-free lamb, shipped from Niman Ranch in Northern California ($12).</p>
        <p>The restaurant caters to both the gourmand and the tree hugger. In addition to recycling and composting food scraps, the Kitchen buys renewable wind energy and diverts its used cooking oils to biodiesel cars.</p>
        <p>''This is an emerging trend at the moment, but I really hope it evolves and filters into the mainstream,'' Mr. Matheson said. ''It's not about being organic, or perfectly green. It's about living in some kind of balance.''</p>
