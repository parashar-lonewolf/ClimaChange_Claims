        <p>WINDMILLS, solar panels, steam energy from deep in the earth. Many Americans have yearned to produce energy without polluting the air and water or burning irreplaceable fuels like coal, oil and natural gas.</p>
        <p>But renewable sources of power have proved to be less than reliable in recent years. They have failed to supply large amounts of energy and, perhaps most important, cannot compete with the cheap power derived from fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>For a time in the late 1980's and early 1990's, the promise of unlimited renewable energy seemed close to realization. Consumers, scientists and entrepreneurs were fascinated. And the companies involved in alternative power sources multiplied, while researchers made breakthroughs that lowered costs. Wind energy produced power for about 5 cents a kilowatt hour, nearing the levels produced at huge coal-burning and nuclear plants. Companies like Kenetech Corporation in Livermore, Calif., developed propeller-churning turbines designed to make wind a mainstream source of energy.</p>
        <p>Strong Public Support</p>
        <p>But in the past five years, the promise of renewable power has become a distant hope. Incentives provided by state regulators and utilities have disappeared. Federal research funds have been cut by a budget-conscious Congress. The industry itself has stumbled. Kenetech's newest turbines were flawed, according to a stockholder lawsuit and some industry analysts, and the company's wind subsidiary was forced to seek bankruptcy protection.</p>
        <p>But while green power itself is in retreat, the grass-roots support for it is still widespread. Central and South West Corporation, an electric and natural gas utility in the Southwest, recently held town meetings with some of its 1.7 million customers and found strong support for alternative energy sources. Most residents said they were willing to pay from $5 to $7 more a month to have solar or other alternatives supply part of their energy.</p>
        <p>''There is a market out there for renewables,'' said E. R. Brooks, chairman of the utility corporation. ''Many people want the option.''</p>
        <p>Consumers want the option of using more green power, but it has become harder to get. ''America gets less electricity from solar, wind and geothermal today than it did five years ago,'' said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Even at its peak in 1987, the industry represented about four-tenths of a percent of the total energy production in this country; today it is about two-tenths of a percent.</p>
        <p>California's Commitment</p>
        <p>A major reason for the decline involves the deregulation of the utilities industry. Many states are opening their utilities to producers and marketers of low-cost electricity, giving customers a choice and perhaps lower rates.  California, which passed its deregulation law last fall, will enable corporations, universities and other big customers to choose their energy provider in 1998. It will also guarantee small customers a rate reduction of 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Facing competition, many utility companies have become preoccupied with cutting costs, merging with other energy companies, and expanding overseas. Houston's NGC Corporation, a natural gas seller, recently bought Destec Energy, a local power plant operator. Some utilities are restructuring so they can distribute only electricity.</p>
        <p>California, which is home, if not a beacon, to many renewable energy companies, provided vital support for green power by prodding utilities to enter into long-range contracts to buy alternative power at high prices. But in 1994 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled that states cannot force utilities to use renewable energy instead of cheaper sources. Since renewable energy now costs more than that generated by coal, natural gas and nuclear plants, the ruling effectively undermined the industry.  Some companies and projects collapsed.</p>
        <p>The renewable energy industry is fighting to keep a foothold in the United States; some companies manage by selling wind turbines and solar panels to underdeveloped countries. A flourishing international market has enabled some companies to survive the downturn in this country. Wind and solar power is popular in countries like India and Pakistan where large rural areas are without power plants and extensive transmission systems. Some European countries are also satisfied customers.</p>
        <p>There is a bright side to the American quest for alternative energy. With its deregulation law, California is dedicating a little less than 1 percent of every electric bill to supporting research as well as programs for green power; the fund is expected to total about $540 million by 2002. In its fiscal 1997 budget the Clinton Administration has also proposed a sizable increase in funds for research into green sources of power, but the proposal may not survive Congress.</p>
        <p>As various states begin pilot programs to investigate electricity deregulation, marketers of power are finding that offering some form of green power is a selling point. While green energy has often turned out to be hydroelectric, which is generated through huge dams that inundate land for miles, its environmental appeal has drawn in utilities and other energy companies. Enron Corporation, a major gas distributor and wholesaler of gas and electricity based in Houston, is trying to turn itself into a national marketer of gas and electricity. It recently added renewable energy to its portfolio by acquiring the Zond Corporation, a California-based developer of wind power.</p>
        <p>In the meantime technological improvements in the field are continuing.</p>
        <p>The cost of making semiconductor systems has sharply dropped with the use of photovoltaic cells, which convert the energy in light to electricity. Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of the Department of Energy, have produced a bacterium that cuts the cost of converting waste from agriculture and forestry to ethanol. ''Big strides in technology are bringing the cost of power down,'' Dr. Charles Gay, director of the laboratory, said.</p>
