        <p>LEAD: The House has voted to spend $350 million for intensified research to control acid rain, far short of the $2.35 billion President Reagan requested to support his pledge to Canada for greater United States efforts in this area.</p>
        <p>The House has voted to spend $350 million for intensified research to control acid rain, far short of the $2.35 billion President Reagan requested to support his pledge to Canada for greater United States efforts in this area.</p>
        <p>The provision was part of a $9.44 billion appropriation bill to finance a variety of programs on natural resources, recreation, energy, forestry and Indians in the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Office of Management and Budget warned that if the measure cleared Congress without major changes, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto.</p>
        <p>The bill passed the House by a vote of 295 to 115 Thursday and went to the Senate. To override a veto, a two-thirds vote is needed, or 290 votes if all 435 House members participate.</p>
        <p>The Office of Management and Budget said the overall legislation was $1.8 billion more than Mr. Reagan requested and that many of the House increases ''are for items that can be easily delayed or are of a purely local rather than national interest.''</p>
        <p>The office had urged full financing for technology that would allow coal to be burned without emitting pollution ''in order to fulfill the United States' commitment to Canada.''</p>
        <p>The legislation would channel the $350 million over the next three years into research aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions from existing coal-burning power plants and factories. Sulfur dioxide is a major source of acid precipitation, as it is transformed chemically in the atmosphere and falls to the earth as rain, snow or solid particles. The emissions from United States plants are killing fresh-water life and damaging forests and crops in Canada as well as in the American Northeast, studies have shown.</p>
