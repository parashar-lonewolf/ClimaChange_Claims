        <p>FOR almost two decades, it has been conventional wisdom that America's migratory songbirds are seriously declining in numbers and headed for trouble. Now a new analysis of 30 years of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey has found that on the whole, continent-wide numbers of the birds have remained surprisingly stable.</p>
        <p>Behind that generalization, however, lies a complex situation with many exceptions, some of them major.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest, according to the new report, is that grassland birds are indeed in serious decline.  So are many forest-dwelling songbirds in a few areas, like the Adirondacks and the Great Smoky Mountains, where forest destruction caused by acid rain is suspected as a cause. So are some individual forest species, like the wood thrush and the cerulean warbler, that live in places where other songbirds generally are thriving.</p>
        <p>But the numbers of many forest songsters are either stable or growing, according to the analysis.  This includes, for instance, the ovenbird, red-eyed vireo, scarlet tanager, great crested flycatcher, hooded warbler and ruby-throated hummingbird. Many birds that live in brushlands are also reported to be thriving, including the Northern oriole, house wren and indigo bunting.</p>
        <p>While some species are decreasing, others are increasing. And while some species are declining in one region, they are expanding in another. The bottom line, according to the author of the study, Dr. Scott K. Robinson, is this: ''When viewed as a whole, and when averaged over large geographical areas, neotropical migrant populations have remained generally stable.''</p>
        <p>This is especially true in the western half of the country, he reported. Neotropical migrants are birds that breed in North America and winter in the tropics.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robinson is an ornithologist and well-known songbird expert at the Illinois Natural History Survey in Champaign and the University of Illinois. His report appears in the latest issue of Consequences, a federally supported, peer-reviewed journal of environmental science.</p>
        <p>It was based on information gathered annually by volunteers who count songbirds along some 3,000 survey routes in the United States and Canada. This continent-wide census began in 1966, and its results are maintained by the Biological Resource Division of the United States Geological Survey. Established in 1993, the division was formerly the National Biological Service.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Askins of Connecticut College in New London, another expert on songbirds who formally reviewed the study, said he agreed with its basic conclusion. ''The best evidence is that most species have remained relatively stable across North America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Why has the opposite impression been so widespread? Largely because people have been looking locally. Catastrophic local and regional declines have indeed been reported in the past, and Dr. Askins said the impression created by these revelations would therefore cause much surprise at the big-picture findings.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot more information now than we had a few years ago,'' Dr. Robinson said. And while many people have studied and reported on parts of the picture, he said he was unaware of any other review article ''that brings the whole thing together.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Frank Gill, an ornithologist who is the National Audubon Society's science director, praised the study and said it provided a ''first-phase blueprint'' for a new and more sophisticated conservation effort that would zero in on high-priority problem areas and species.</p>
        <p>The study also shows that ''it's not an emergency situation,'' Dr. Gill said. ''There are problems out there, but there is time to solve them; it's time for preventive medicine rather than emergency surgery.''</p>
        <p>One of the report's main findings is that populations of forest songbirds are for the most part being well sustained because large chunks of North American forest still provide sufficient breeding habitat. The evidence for this is strongest in the Midwest, said Dr. Robinson, with the Missouri Ozarks, the Hoosier National Forest in Indiana and the vast forests of northern Wisconsin and Minnesota providing large breeding sanctuaries. Dr. Askins said there was also evidence that this was true in the Northeast, where forests have greatly expanded in this century.</p>
        <p>These larger forests, said Dr. Askins, are so abundantly stocked with birds that they act as overflowing ''reservoirs'' that ''export'' young birds to smaller forests, farm and suburban wood lots, and parks.</p>
        <p>There the birds settle in and try to reproduce. But predators like raccoons, crows, bluejays and grackles, which patrol only woodland edges and cannot get at nests in the interior of a large forest, have free access. So do cowbirds that lay their eggs in songbird nests, driving out the young.</p>
        <p>As a result of the predation and the parasitic cowbirds, not enough hatchlings survive; without the colonists from the big forests, songbirds would quickly disappear from the smaller patches.</p>
        <p>A major conservation priority now, Dr. Gill said, is to make sure there are enough big-tract sources of birds to offset small-tract losses.</p>
        <p>Another high-priority concern, said Dr. Robinson, is ''stopover habitat'' used by songbirds to rest and feed during their twice-yearly migrations between North America and the tropics. Most conservation concern has focused on habitat at each end of the journey. ''But the loss of stopover habitat is potentially very critical,'' Dr. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Stopover habitat typically occurs in shoreline areas, especially along the Gulf Coast. ''There can be little doubt that the rapid development of property along the beaches of Texas, Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle has resulted in a systematic loss of migratory habitat, in this most important of migratory stopover areas,'' the Robinson report said.</p>
        <p>If there were no places for the birds to land and fuel up for their long trip, Dr. Robinson said in an interview, ''you'd have scarlet tanagers, desperate for food, feeding in the middle of rice fields.''</p>
        <p>Another threat is bird collisions with towers and buildings. ''Estimates are wildly variable,'' Dr. Robinson said, ''but it looks like hundreds of millions are killed this way.'' Even cats probably kill tens or even hundreds of millions, he said.</p>
        <p>Destruction of tropical forests has often been cited as a threat to neotropical migrants. While scientific opinion on the question is ''pretty divided,'' Dr. Robinson said, ''it's clear that some migrants are going to be severely affected by tropical deforestation and some won't be.''</p>
        <p>The data make it ''clear that grassland birds are in worse shape than forest birds,'' Dr. Robinson said. One familiar grassland species, the bobolink, has suffered a ''catastrophic'' decline of 90 percent in the Midwest, he said. Other examples of declining grassland species include the meadowlark, Henslow's sparrow and the upland sandpiper.</p>
        <p>Many grassland birds once thrived in pastures and hayfields, Dr. Robinson reported. But more recently, he said, many pastures and hayfields have been converted to croplands, and faster-growing grass seeds have led to earlier harvesting of hayfields, destroying many eggs and young of grassland birds in nests.</p>
        <p>The Federal Conservation Reserve Program, under which farmers are paid to preserve fallow land, has helped, Dr. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>But the program is subject to Federal appropriations, the will of Congress and farmers' cooperation, and Dr. Robinson said that over the long term, ''we don't know how reliable that's going to be.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 11, 1997, Wednesday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times yesterday about songbird populations, and a listing of species, gave an outdated name for a bird that is reported to be thriving. The American Ornithologists' Union has changed the name Northern oriole back to Baltimore oriole.</p>
