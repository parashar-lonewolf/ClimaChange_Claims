        <p>The nation's largest manufacturing union, the United Steelworkers, and largest environmental group, the Sierra Club, are forming an alliance to promote energy independence and fight global warming and toxic pollutants. The union has long been a leader within labor in cooperating with environmentalists. The two groups said a central goal of their partnership, the Blue/Green Alliance, would be to reassure workers that measures to improve the environment need not jeopardize jobs. The union, with 850,000 members, and the Sierra Club, which has 750,000, said their partnership should help bolster the influence of unions and environmentalists.</p>
