        <p>AS the world moves toward a ban on ozone-destroying chemicals to head off an epidemic of skin cancer, experts searching for substitute chemicals predict that the technical and economic cost of the change will be high.</p>
        <p>Potential replacements for the chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemicals now extensively used as refrigerants, propellants, bubbles in plastic and cleaning fluids have already been identified. But engineers say the replacements are generally more expensive and less effective than the original chemicals. Equipment using some of the replacements, moreover, is expected to consume more power and wear out sooner.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, chemical manufacturers and many governments are in broad agreement on the need to phase out certain CFC's. Released into the air from the bubbles in plastic foam, from leaks in defective or abandoned refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, from solvents used to clean computer circuits and other sources, these compounds rise over a period of years into the stratosphere, where intense sunlight breaks them down. The chemical products of these reactions go on to destroy ozone, a minor but important component of the upper atmosphere, which shields the earth from much of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>
        <p>But spokesmen for major chemical companies say that $135 billion of equipment in the United States operates using the soon-to-be-prohibited chemicals, and much of this equipment will eventually have to be replaced to accommodate substitute chemicals.</p>
        <p>The likely substitutes for the three main ozone-destroying CFC's may, in many cases, be less effective.</p>
        <p>The main ozone-destroying refrigerent, CFC-12, could be replaced by a fluorocarbon called HFC-134a. CFC-12 consists of a single atom of carbon with two atoms each of fluorine and chlorine, and is easy to manufacture from two common chemicals. But HFC-134a contains two carbon atoms, four fluorine atoms and two hydrogen atoms, and is much more difficult to manufacture. Chemical engineers say that the replacement chemical is likely to cost three times as much as CFC-12, and it may not last as long. The substance cannot be used in refrigeration equipment previously operated on CFC-12, partly because major corrosion problems would result.</p>
        <p>The proposed replacement for CFC-11, a chlorofluorocarbon used to make plastic foam and in central air-conditioning systems, is a compound called HCFC-22. This is a chlorofluorocarbon already in use in home air-conditioners, but it is more expensive than CFC-11 and its potential applications are limited by its inferior characteristics. HCFC-22 is not as good a heat insulator as CFC-11, and it is therefore unsuitable as a foaming agent for insulating plastic foams. Moreover, its boiling point is too low for it to be useful as a refrigerant in automobile air-conditioners, unless the latter undergo major modifications.</p>
        <p>Yesterday E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company announced that it had developed two potential substitutes for CFC-113, the third important member of the ozone-destroying group. This chemical is used in foaming plastics and in other applications, but DuPont's substitutes are suitable only for cleaning electronic components. The most promising of the two products, KCD-9438, a proprietary blend of organic solvents containing no CFC's, will be available for testing later this year, the company said, and ''may be acceptable'' for some customers. A second product, which contains some chlorofluorocarbons but in only small amounts, would not be available commercially until the mid-1990s. Both products are expected to cost about three times as much as the present cost of CFC-113.</p>
        <p>The 12 nations of the European Community vowed last week to eliminate production of the most harmful CFC's by the end of the century, and President Bush has proposed an international agreement to do the same.</p>
        <p>Du Pont, which manufactures about one quarter of the world's annual production of two billion pounds of chlorofluorocarbons, announced last March that it would phase out production of these compounds. Representatives of 124 governments are now meeting in London to discuss ways to hasten the phasing-out of the chemical throughout the world.</p>
        <p>But the cost of eliminating chlorofluorocarbons will be high. According to Charles A. McCain, Du Pont's manager for the development of alternative products, the more rapidly the chemicals are removed from industrial applications, the higher will be the cost.</p>
        <p>''America and the world need time to replace the equipment that now uses CFC's, and time to develop adequate substitutes for the chemicals,'' he said in an interview. In this country alone, he said, 100 million home refrigerators, the air-conditioners in 90 million cars and the central air-conditioning plants in 100,000 large buildings use the chemicals.</p>
        <p>Home refrigerators may operate for many years without replenishment of their supplies of the chemicals and are often junked before they need replenishment. The ban would therefore have little effect on the average household refrigerator. But central air-conditioning plants in large buildings periodically need fresh supplies of chlorofluorocarbons, and in these cases, replacement of equipment would be needed sooner. Home air-conditioners do not use the ozone-destroying chemicals.</p>
        <p>Although the family of chlorofluorocarbons includes many hundreds of compounds, only the five considered most damaging to the ozone layer are being banned: CFC-11 and CFC-12, which are used as refrigerants; CFC-113, used mainly as a cleaning agent, and CFC-114 and CFC-115, which have a variety of uses. The first three of these compounds constitute more than 90 percent of chlorofluorocarbons manufactured in this country.</p>
        <p>The chemicals have special properties that make them extraordinarily useful. Very little energy is required to convert them from gases to liquids or vice versa, owing to their low boiling points and high vapor pressures. This makes them ideal for refrigeration applications and as propellants in canned aerosol products. (Although they have been banned as propellants in this country, except for dispensing drugs, they are still used in aerosols in other parts of the world.) Desirable Qualities CFC's are so chemically unreactive that they do not cause corrosion and are completely non-toxic. When converted under pressure into liquids, they have an extraordinary ability to wet any solid material they touch; they are much wetter than water. This perfectly suits them for cleaning the microscopic pores, scratches and irregularities in computer circuit boards, especially since they evaporate rapidly, leaving no residue.</p>
        <p>The substitutes in all these applications, manufacturers say, are a step backward in product quality, except for the fact that they will be less damaging to the ozone layer. They are expected to be less durable, to require redesign of much equipment, and to pose potential questions about their toxicity. Many of the substitutes are actually other CFC's whose chemical structure has been designed to break down quickly in the lower atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Leo Manzer, manager of research at Du Pont, said the search for acceptable substitutes has already cost his company $100 million. The quest has focused on compounds that have one, two or three carbon atoms, along with varying combinations of hydrogen, chlorine and fluorine atoms. ''Mathematically,'' he said, ''that gives us 601 chemical possibilities, and testing them all for flamability, toxicity, stability and engineering qualities is no simple matter.''</p>
        <p>A contrasting view was offered by Dr. Mario J. Molina, a chemist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who is a leading authority on atmospheric chemistry. ''There's no doubt that eliminating CFC's will be expensive,'' he said, ''but I doubt that it will be as expensive as many industry spokesmen contend.'' Economic Consequences</p>
        <p>Dr. Molina disputes claims that the ban might have dangerous economic consequences. ''In 1978, when the United States prohibited the use of CFC's as propellants in spray cans, lots of experts said the ban would put a lot of people out of work,'' he said. ''It didn't. In any case, the world cannot afford the consequences of continuing to release CFC's into the atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>The special merits of the chlorofluorocarbons stem from the exceptionally strong chemical bonds that hold their molecules together. The strength of the moleculer bonds in CFC-11 and CFC-12 makes them extremely resistant to chemical attack; their chemical cousins include Teflon, the non-reactive polymer used as a non-stick lining in kitchen pots.</p>
        <p>When released into the atmosphere they resist breaking down almost indefinitely, until they reach the stratosphere where they are exposed to fierce solar ultraviolet radiation. This radiation is so strong that even the strong bonds holding CFC molecules together finally break apart, and the resulting fragments start the chain of chemical events that leads to ozone destruction. Ozone depletion has already been observed in both Antarctica and the Arctic.</p>
        <p>When CFC refrigerants were invented in 1930, they were seen by engineers as an answer to a prayer. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the gases used in refrigerators had included ether vapor, ammonia and sulfur dioxide, all of which are chemically reactive, poisonous and dangerous to handle. By contrast, CFC's were completely inert and non-toxic, caused no damage to the machines in which they were used, and saved electrical power.</p>
        <p>Most refrigerators, air-conditioners and heat pumps are based on gases that can be easily liquefied under pressure. In a typical refrigeration cycle, an electric motor drives a piston to compress the working gas. The pressure heats the gas, which is then pumped into a radiator cooled by moving air or flowing water.</p>
        <p>The cooled, compressed gas liquefies in the radiator, and the liquid is pumped into the cooling section of a freezer, refrigerator or air-conditioner, where the pressure is suddenly released. This allows the liquid to rapidly evaporate and cool, chilling the metal coils with which it is in contact. The resulting vapor is returned to the compressor to begin a new cycle. Lasting for 30 Years</p>
        <p>If a refrigeration system contains CFC-12, the compressor can usually operate for up to 30 years without a need to replenish or replace the gas, experts say. But it remains to be seen whether a substitute gas not based on chlorofluorocarbons will hold up for nearly as long.</p>
        <p>A likely substitute for many applications of CFC-11, which consists of one carbon atom, three chlorine atoms and one fluorine atom, will be a compound called HCFC-22, consisting of one carbon, one chlorine, two fluorines and one hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Technically speaking, HCFC-22 is a chlorofluorocarbon, but since it contains a hydrogen atom and only a partial complement of chlorine and fluorine atoms, it is regarded as environmentally safer than CFC-11. The hydrogen makes it more vulnerable to attack, and scientists believe that most of the HCFC-22 released into the air will be destroyed by sunlight before ever reaching the stratospheric ozone layer. The compound would still destroy some ozone, but only a negligible amount, it is believed.</p>
        <p>The fact that HCFC-22 is already the refrigerant used in virtually all home air-conditioners means that these machines will not be made obsolete by the phasing-out of chlorofluorocarbons. The compound is not among the five CFC's singled out for elimination by the signers of the 1987 Montreal agreement to curb destruction of the ozone layer. 'It Would Be a Catastrophe'</p>
        <p>''If HCFC-22 were banned it would be a catastrophe,'' Mr. McCain said. ''Everyone is counting on it as a substitute.'' In response to a Du Pont initiative, he said, the entire American foam-polystyrene packaging industry switched this year from CFC-12 as a foaming gas to HCFC-22. Questions remain about the stability and long-term safety of HCFC-22, however, and testing will continue.</p>
        <p>''We all want to save the ozone layer,'' a Federal environmental official said. ''But let's hope we don't inadvertently end up creating substitutes that damage the environment in some new and unforeseen way.''</p>
