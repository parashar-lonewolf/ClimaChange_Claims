        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki woke up yesterday morning with an impressive victory behind him, but as he looks ahead he faces a governmental and political landscape very different from the one in which he has flourished during his first two terms.</p>
        <p>For most of the last six years, Mr. Pataki had the wind at his back. The economy was booming and revenues poured in from Wall Street at record levels, allowing him to cut taxes while expanding spending on popular government programs like health care, education and the environment. In an increasingly Democratic state, this fit nicely with his political ambitions, helping the Republican governor build a powerful winning coalition with support from reliably Democratic constituencies like unions, environmentalists and Hispanics.</p>
        <p>Even as the economy slumped during this election year, Mr. Pataki managed to avoid deep cuts or tax increases that might have offended some of these supporters by using clever fiscal legerdemain and spending most of the savings the state had built up during the late 1990's.</p>
        <p>Now, however, Mr. Pataki must close a budget gap for the next fiscal year that most experts say will be at least $6 billion. The resulting pressure to cut spending will make it much harder for him to keep his new friends happy, especially if he keeps his promise not to raise taxes.</p>
        <p>Even old allies in Albany are already signaling their distaste for cuts in the education and health care programs he promoted as successes during his campaign.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe the governor is going to be looking backwards and going backwards,'' said the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno. ''I don't see him cratering a quality of life that New Yorkers have been brought to enjoy.''</p>
        <p>But just as Mr. Pataki's political and governmental ambitions reinforced each other during his first two terms, they may do so again if the governor decides to seek national office during his third. Just as his spending initiatives helped build political relationships with New York liberals, shrinking the government could become an important credential for building bridges to conservative national Republicans if he tries to position himself for higher office or a job in the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>The governor studiously avoids acknowledging national aspirations, but he is just as careful to avoid promising to serve out his term. ''I'm very excited by my political future, serving as the governor of this great state,'' Mr. Pataki said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But his advisers are not as reluctant to speculate about the next step for a politician who has risen to the pinnacle of state politics. If the vice presidency were to become available in the next election cycle, they say, President Bush might find it expedient to put a moderate Northeastern Republican who favors abortion rights on the ticket.</p>
        <p>Much of that is out of Mr. Pataki's control and depends on what the national mood is in 2004.</p>
        <p>Should the most important issues in most Americans' minds shift from terrorism and war back to domestic matters like health care, then Mr. Pataki, a fiscal conservative who is viewed as a moderate on social issues, might become a more attractive candidate for vice president, these strategists said.</p>
        <p>''If you are looking for a model of a Republican that can go into any Democratic constituency and get votes, George Pataki is at the top of the short list,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political consultant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's victory on Tuesday was impressive by many standards. In New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans five to one, he received 39 percent of the vote, the best showing for any Republican since Nelson A. Rockefeller ran in 1970. Hispanics gave him about 38 percent of their vote, according to a study of election districts conducted yesterday by John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. That is also a record for a Republican.</p>
        <p>He defeated the Democratic challenger, H. Carl McCall, by 704,000 votes, or 16 percentage points. The only worse defeat for a Democrat in a governor's race came in 1998, when Mr. Pataki trounced Peter Vallone by one million votes, a margin of 21 percentage points.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, back-to-back landslides in a five-to-three Democratic state has got to catch people's eyes,'' said Michael McKeon, the governor's campaign spokesman.</p>
        <p>Representative John Sweeney, an upstate Republican who is close to the governor, said the party leaders ''have to look at George Pataki at a national level for the lessons of how to survive in a tough environment.''</p>
        <p>The environment in Albany, however, is likely to get tougher. Democrats in the State Assembly increased their majority on Tuesday to 103 members, from 99. The Republicans who control the Senate also picked up a seat, giving them a 37-member majority.</p>
        <p>The Senate and Assembly leaders both indicate that they will resist severe cutbacks, as will the unions. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said yesterday that he would urge Mr. Pataki to go to his Republican colleagues in Washington and request more federal aid before considering cutting popular programs. He also suggested that Mr. Pataki's pledges not to raise taxes, lay off workers or increase tuitions and fares would be impossible to keep.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Pataki is confident about his ability to solve the state's fiscal problems, though he has not provided details.</p>
        <p>''We will have our budget proposal when we have our budget proposal,'' he said yesterday. ''We don't want to raise tuitions or taxes or fares.''</p>
        <p>Denis M. Hughes, the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O, said that labor leaders would probably have greater access to the governor than ever before, thanks to the endorsements of many of the largest unions, but that it was unclear whether that will translate into fewer budget cuts.</p>
        <p>''I've been doing politics for a long time, over 20 years, and I can't imagine a worse situation for working men and women than the situation we face, in terms of budget problems,'' said Mr. Hughes, whose organization did not endorse a candidate for governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki rarely talks politics in public, so it is hard to know how he views the shifts in the political winds. He said that in his third term he would focus on the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan, a project that doubtless will be one of his legacies, good or bad. So far, he has played a low-key role in the plans for the site where the World Trade Center stood, partly out of political caution, but there is a general consensus within the administration and Legislature that the pace of redevelopment will pick up now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki also says one of his major goals will be to make upstate New York into a haven for emerging high-technology industries. He has sown the seeds, in the form of state grants and tax incentives, for research and development centers in all of the rusting cities along the old Erie Canal.</p>
        <p>He often talks about wanting to replace the old manufacturing industries that were born and thrived in the last century with a new wave of industries, like nanoelectronics, bioinformatics, genetic engineering and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>
        <p>The governor wants to leave his mark on environmental policy, too. He has promised to make New York a leader in cutting greenhouse gases and promoting renewable energy sources like fuel cells, windmills and geothermal technology.</p>
        <p>These goals may have to wait until the budget gap is dealt with, legislative leaders said. The true test of Mr. Pataki's new coalition with traditional Democrats may come when he introduces his budget proposal in January.</p>
        <p>''In a real way, the budget will be a test of these new relationships,'' said one legislative aide.</p>
