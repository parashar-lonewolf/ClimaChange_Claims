        <p>After a faulty start in January, Bill Clinton's second launch of his ex-presidency fared much better yesterday in central Harlem. A crowd that included the actress Cicely Tyson and Representative Charles Rangel -- who kept referring to Harlem's most prominent new tenant as ''our president'' -- welcomed Mr. Clinton so warmly that he looked almost giddy about the end of his post-presidential exile. ''You were always there for me,'' he crooned, noting that his audience mirrored the diversity of the entire world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's move into new offices on 125th Street is more than a real estate transaction. It provides an excellent match of a place and a retired president, far more appropriate than his first choice, a gilded tower on 57th Street that would have given him a fine view of the city but only limited access to its diverse citizenry. Now, with his sense of entitlement chastened, Mr. Clinton has returned to his political roots, to a place and constituency where he is at home and at his best.</p>

        <p>After a faulty start in January, Bill Clinton's second launch of his ex-presidency fared much better yesterday in central Harlem. A crowd that included the actress Cicely Tyson and Representative Charles Rangel -- who kept referring to Harlem's most prominent new tenant as ''our president'' -- welcomed Mr. Clinton so warmly that he looked almost giddy about the end of his post-presidential exile. ''You were always there for me,'' he crooned, noting that his audience mirrored the diversity of the entire world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's move into new offices on 125th Street is more than a real estate transaction. It provides an excellent match of a place and a retired president, far more appropriate than his first choice, a gilded tower on 57th Street that would have given him a fine view of the city but only limited access to its diverse citizenry. Now, with his sense of entitlement chastened, Mr. Clinton has returned to his political roots, to a place and constituency where he is at home and at his best.</p>
        <p>There is certainly plenty of room these days for a skillful drummer of vigorous centrist politics who can speak to new solutions for national and global problems. And whatever happens with the historical verdict on his presidency, Mr. Clinton can now begin to make a name for himself in the annals of the nation's ex-presidents. While some former presidents faded into civilian life, especially those who were well beyond retirement age, Mr. Clinton is young and still has time for a new chapter. Even Richard Nixon wrote a new epilogue for himself by offering a seasoned perspective on foreign policy in his later years. Jimmy Carter, meanwhile, continues to make his imprint, working on rural housing through Habitat for Humanity and pursuing human rights and health care abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's advisers have suggested that he has no plans to become a point man for President Bush's critics -- a wise move, given the need to encourage new political voices in the Democratic Party. Still, there are times when an ex-president can speak with special authority about his successor, much as Mr. Carter has been doing in his critique of President Bush's views on the global warming and antiballistic missile treaties.</p>
        <p>In recent months, mostly in his overseas trips, Mr. Clinton has talked passionately about the need to combat AIDS, as the disease devastates Africa and spreads through Russia and the Caribbean. He has offered to help manage the peace process in Northern Ireland, an offer his successor should consider since Mr. Clinton knows this bitter terrain well. He has promised to fight against poverty in American Indian reservations and to speak out against the crushing problems of the nation's rural poor.</p>
        <p>With his Harlem move he has also raised hopes that one of his chief activities will be to serve as an advocate for the nation's cities. Mr. Clinton, who spoke with great feeling during his presidency about the needs of the underclass, noted during his Harlem speech that Harlem's ''empowerment zone,'' created during his presidency, had attracted  $600 million in private investment. On many long-neglected urban issues Mr. Clinton's persuasive voice could make a difference -- especially if he picks big targets, the difficult economic, housing, education and health problems that those facing election or re-election often fail to address.</p>
