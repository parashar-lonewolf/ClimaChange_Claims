        <p>IMAGINE a technical fix that would conserve two billion barrels of oil, eliminate the need to build 14 Shoreham-sized power plants, slow the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere - and still save consumers tens of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Actually, there is no need to imagine it: According to a Department of Energy analysis, such savings can be had over the next two decades if refrigerator manufacturers meet tough efficiency standards by 1993. But appliance makers, unhappy with the prospect of plunging into unproved technologies and fearing they will have to foot the bill for the zeal of environmentalists, are digging in their heels. The Energy Department, which fought efficiency standards through the Reagan years, is leaning toward a compromise unlikely to satisfy anyone.</p>
        <p>The question now is whether the Bush administration can fashion a deal that forces a best effort at technological change, yet assures business that it will not be left holding the bag.</p>
        <p>Official Washington has been squabbling over energy standards for household appliances since the late 1970's. Free marketeers argued for free choice: Only consumers could sensibly decide the trade-offs between convenience features, purchase price and operating costs.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists - and many economists -aren't convinced. Hardly anyone, they say, has the time or expertise to comparison-shop for $500 refrigerators the way airlines evaluate $50 million jet planes. And in any case, competitive markets aren't likely to lead to a socially desirable level of energy efficiency because the utility bills of consumers don't reflect the damage to national security and the environment associated with higher energy consumption.</p>
        <p>President Reagan fought regulation in Congress and then in the courts. But he lost the war when California set its own efficiency standards. Faced with the prospect of designing appliances to state specifications, manufacturers capitulated. This year, and every few years thereafter, the Energy Department is legally bound to set the highest efficiency standards that are ''technologically feasible'' and ''economically justified.''</p>
        <p>The first big test of the standards comes this year with refrigerators. The Energy Department's analysis, released last month, offers one technical option that would roughly double the efficiency of a refrigerator and pay back the up-front cost in 5.4 years of its estimated 19-year operating life. Net savings to buyers: about $400.</p>
        <p>This tough standard could probably only be achieved with a new type of insulation that works like a vacuum thermos. The new insulator is not some high-tech fantasy. On the other hand, it has yet to be marketed in quantity, and there is a risk of hitting potholes along the road to reliable, low-cost mass production.</p>
        <p>The other risk for manufacturers is environmental. The most efficient refrigerant gases and insulation materials in current use are made from cheap, non-toxic chemicals known as CFC's. Unfortunately, they are also the primary culprits in the depletion of the ozone layer, which may prove as great a threat to life and property as atmospheric warming from the combustion of fossil fuels. America is committed to halving its use of CFC's within a decade, and may need to go further should ozone depletion accelerate. If substitutes now in the testing stage prove unsatisfactory, makers of refrigerators will have to scramble to justify the use of diminishing (and increasingly expensive) supplies of the offending chemicals.</p>
        <p>These risks seem reason enough for major manufacturers (General Electric, Whirlpool, White Consolidated, Maytag) to resist any additional regulation of efficiency. Energy Department policy makers reportedly sympathize, but aren't eager to defend the position in court. They lean toward a modest middle standard that the department says ''would likely be met with existing technology'' and would have ''little economic impact on manufacturers.''</p>
        <p>Compromise is usually good politics and often good policy. But this compromise, says David Goldstein, a physicist with the National Resources Defense Council, could waste a lot of energy without mitigating the risks to appliance makers.</p>
        <p>It's true that vacuum insulation technology has yet to be mass-produced. But it's also true that neither the future availability of CFC's nor the adequacy of their replacements is assured. Thus unless the industry opts for technology that entirely frees it from dependence on CFC's, Mr. Goldstein argues, manufacturers could be caught without any acceptable means of producing refrigerators.</p>
        <p>What might serve everyone's interest would be a deal in which manufacturers agreed to take their best shot at meeting a tough standard. In return environmentalists would agree in advance to support a legislated modification of the standard, perhaps even priority access to scarce CFC's, if the manufacturers failed.</p>
        <p>Is such an agreement possible? Certainly the environmental lobbies are becoming increasingly sophisticated about both economics and the political need to give business room to maneuver. But leadership will have to come from Bush appointees, who will have to work quickly to distance themselves from the previous Administration's what-me-worry image on environmental issues.</p>
