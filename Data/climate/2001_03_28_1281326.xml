        <p>When George W. Bush was elected governor of Texas in his first try at a statewide office, a close friend marveled at his rather glitch-free campaign. The friend recalled that Mr. Bush told him, ''Never underestimate what you can learn from a failed presidency.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush does not consider his father to have been a failure as president, people who know him say he does view his father's tenure as a supreme disappointment, simply because the elder Mr. Bush could not persuade voters to re-elect him. They say the former governor blames the people around his father, as well as himself, for not working hard enough to ensure that re-election in 1992.</p>

        <p>When George W. Bush was elected governor of Texas in his first try at a statewide office, a close friend marveled at his rather glitch-free campaign. The friend recalled that Mr. Bush told him, ''Never underestimate what you can learn from a failed presidency.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush does not consider his father to have been a failure as president, people who know him say he does view his father's tenure as a supreme disappointment, simply because the elder Mr. Bush could not persuade voters to re-elect him. They say the former governor blames the people around his father, as well as himself, for not working hard enough to ensure that re-election in 1992.</p>
        <p>Now that George W. Bush has reached the White House, no one should underestimate how his approach to the presidency has been molded by the experiences of the elder President Bush, and his desire to avoid the mistakes that he believes cost his father a second term.</p>
        <p>That is why, his friends and associates say, the 43rd president has been far more inclined than the 41st to mix politics with governing, to show deference (some even say reverence) to conservatives, to demand loyalty from aides and to pursue an ambitious but more narrowly focused agenda.</p>
        <p>''When you've got a functional family, doesn't everybody learn from their father and mother?'' asked Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, who is close to the president and his father.</p>
        <p>The contrasts between father and son have much to do with personality. George W. Bush has been far more hospitable to Congress than his father, who actually served in Congress, perhaps because the younger Mr. Bush is, by nature, a more gregarious politician.</p>
        <p>But the times and circumstances are different, too. As president, Mr. Bush's father had to contend with the fiercely partisan George J. Mitchell, the Senate leader, and a Democratic-led Congress in no mood to be courted.</p>
        <p>''It's not Bush 41st's fault that there was a George Mitchell reign of terror in those days,'' said Richard N. Bond, whom the first President Bush installed as Republican Party chairman. ''They wanted to destroy Bush's presidency.''</p>
        <p>The times may have changed, but here are some lessons that Bush II has gleaned from Bush I:</p>
        <p>Politics Is Not a Dirty Word</p>
        <p>Campaign-style trips, like the two-day, three-state tour Mr. Bush began on Monday, were not so common in the elder Mr. Bush's administration. Once he was in the White House, Bush No. 41 cringed at the thought of blatantly political activity; he seemed to view it as an ugly chore. He was slow, even, to start his re-election drive. The younger Mr. Bush has since expressed his concern that his father never made the most, politically, of his soaring popularity after the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>In reaction -- and in a nod to the political success enjoyed by President Bill Clinton -- the current president has not hesitated to venture onto the road to pitch his tax cut.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes my words in Washington don't exactly translate directly to the people,'' Mr. Bush said today in Kalamazoo, Mich., ''so I found it's best to travel the country.''</p>
        <p>Thus far, Mr. Bush has been on the road nearly a third of his time in office, far more than his father, Mr. Clinton, Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Carter in their first two months in office. In all, the president has traveled to 25 states and spent nearly 30 days away from the White House. (His father had spent about 17 days on the road by now; Mr. Clinton, roughly a dozen.)</p>
        <p>''He talks about using his political capital wisely,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's counselor. ''I've heard him say his father had a great deal of political capital from Desert Storm that could have been spent more wisely.''</p>
        <p>Attention to politics has permeated the administration. Mr. Bush's address to Congress last month was one example of the way he has packaged his proposals in a disciplined and systematic way, focusing on a handful of big themes. His father's addresses to Congress reflected a much more scattershot approach.</p>
        <p>Mark McKinnon, who was Mr. Bush's campaign media adviser, said that by watching his father early on, ''he learned that the crisis of the moment should be seen in the context of a much longer picture.''</p>
        <p>Don't Tolerate a Sununu</p>
        <p>When President Bush's friends are asked about lessons learned from the father, they invariably cite former Gov. John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, the elder Mr. Bush's first chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu had no Washington seasoning and was widely viewed as a divisive figure in the White House, but the elder Mr. Bush felt indebted to him because Mr. Sununu had helped him win the New Hampshire primary. Mr. Sununu was pushed out of his job only after the younger Mr. Bush, in an unbridled conversation, let him know of the dissatisfaction.</p>
        <p>And for years the elder Mr. Bush stood by Nicholas F. Brady, his old friend and Treasury secretary, even as conservatives repeatedly called for his resignation.</p>
        <p>''Loyal to a fault'' was how one friend described the ex-president.</p>
        <p>The son, on the other hand, expects loyalty from below and appears less tolerant of people who are not team players. Mr. Bush has had a closer and longer relationship with his top orbit of aides than his father did with Mr. Sununu.</p>
        <p>His aides also say Mr. Bush knows not to let them linger on when they are not succeeding. It was no accident that Mr. Bush quickly dispatched Linda Chavez when her nomination for labor secretary ran into trouble.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush is intent on keeping backstabbing to a minimum.</p>
        <p>''He was the one who gave Sununu his marching orders,'' said Gregory Slayton, president of an e-mail marketing company who is a friend of Bush the father and son. ''Loyalty is a big deal. He talked about that all the time. He felt that in the re-election campaign for his dad, some of the professional staff didn't fight it out at the end. They were more concerned about their next job than getting his dad re-elected.''</p>
        <p>Be Nice to Alan Greenspan</p>
        <p>From the start, the first President Bush had a strained relationship with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. In fact, he blamed Mr. Greenspan for costing him the election by not moving fast enough to speed the recovery from the recession of the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>''I reappointed him and he disappointed me,'' the elder Mr. Bush once said.</p>
        <p>Mindful, perhaps, that it did not help his father to be on Mr. Greenspan's bad side, the younger Mr. Bush has tried to seduce his father's foe. He sought him out for a meeting even before taking office, clapped a hand on his shoulder and said, ''I talked with a good man right here.''</p>
        <p>The entreaties may reflect the determination of Mr. Bush not to let the economy tarnish his presidency, as happened with his father.</p>
        <p>While the elder Mr. Bush suffered because the economy did not improve in time to help him get re-elected, his son may be paying the price for an economic picture that he inherited. Successful or not, the son seems more aggressive in promoting his economic policies.</p>
        <p>''The lesson learned from the economic side of former President Bush's administration is you have to market the policy well,'' said Ron Kaufman, an adviser to the elder Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Protect Your Right</p>
        <p>A most obvious lesson Mr. Bush has learned from his father is to stroke conservatives. While conservatives never trusted the elder Mr. Bush, his son has gone out of his way to win them over. He is filling jobs at all levels of his administration with conservatives, from Attorney General John Ashcroft to the White House staff. And he has embraced conservative positions on matters including abortion and the environment, with his opposition to regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and to stricter standards on arsenic in drinking water.</p>
        <p>''This fellow saw the right wing crush his father,'' said Robert S. Strauss, the former Democratic chairman who is an old Texas friend of the elder President Bush. ''He's not going to let anyone get too far to the right of him. In fact, he's overreacting a bit right now, and it's going to come home to haunt him.''</p>
        <p>Rahm Emanuel, a senior aide to Mr. Clinton, argues that the public is not as tilted to the right as the new president. ''He's done everything to assure that the base of the party is happy going into the midterms,'' Mr. Emanuel said, ''but he's done nothing to expand the 49 percent of the vote he got. Name me a suburban district that supports more arsenic in water.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Does Matter</p>
        <p>An obvious lesson is that Mr. Bush picked a vice president who has been tested. People close to Mr. Bush said he heeded his father's counsel in settling on Dick Cheney -- and was determined not to tarnish his presidency with a vice president like Dan Quayle, who was continually criticized as not being ready for the job.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, Dick Cheney is no Dan Quayle,'' Mr. Slayton said.</p>
