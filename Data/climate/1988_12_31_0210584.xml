        <p>LEAD: It was the year of Geraldo Rivera pleading with America not to let the children watch this next segment.</p>
        <p>It was the year of Geraldo Rivera pleading with America not to let the children watch this next segment.</p>
        <p>Dan Quayle, who was no Jack Kennedy, won a nation's heart by making himself available for public browbeating by news purveyors and recalling his Granny's homespun advice which, he said, would probably bring sneers from slick, sophisticated Easterners.</p>
        <p>The National Geographic became 100 years old, proving that, no matter what the pessimists say, it is still possible for an American publication to endure longer than two generations without being devoured by General Electric.</p>
        <p>It finally dawned on Americans that there was something odd about the recent proliferation of gigantic men built like comic-book heroes: to wit, high steroid content.</p>
        <p>Ron and Nancy strolled in the erstwhile evil empire's Red Square, lacking only a strolling balalaika strummer to make it a scene fit for an M-G-M - well, Warner Brothers, then - musical.</p>
        <p>''The Phantom of the Opera'' became the Broadway equivalent of the Yogi Berra restaurant that nobody goes to anymore because it's too crowded. ''Phantom'' was so successful that nobody could get in to see it.</p>
        <p>Such successes, however, were rare. More typical of 1988 were the Baltimore Orioles, who opened the baseball season with the longest losing streak in history. At about the same time Mayor Koch, professing support for Senator Albert Gore, gave millions the impression he was running for President against Jesse Jackson, thereby nearly destroying poor Gore, not to mention himself.</p>
        <p>General Noriega, the dictator of Panama, made a monkey of the United States Government.</p>
        <p>Congress came to grips with the drug problem by enthusing about the death penalty, which drug dealers now freely inflict on themselves. Then, true to a growing American theory that democracy just won't work, it voted to create a ''czar'' and let him figure out something that will work.</p>
        <p>Discovery of a mean streak in Senator Robert Dole made it easy for George Bush, champion of kinder, gentler national behavior, to win the Republican nomination and belabor the hapless Dukakis as negligent in loving Old Glory and hypersensitive to the well-being of murderous rapists.</p>
        <p>Panhandlers appeared all over New York City. Drought dried up much of the country's farming area. Extraordinary summer heat opened new careers for media science writers who discovered that the dreaded greenhouse effect either is or is not about to melt the North Pole, turn Pennsylvania into a Sahara and leave Martha's Vineyard under six feet of tropical water.</p>
        <p>Work was begun on writing a sequel to ''Gone With the Wind.'' Dan Rather went one-on-one against Vice President Bush, who afterward described the experience as ''tension city.''</p>
        <p>The ignorance of persons recently educated in the American school system was discovered to be so profound that many people with college diplomas were uncertain whether Pearl Harbor was a famous seafood restaurant in Tahiti or a waitress in a soap opera.</p>
        <p>Vice President Bush knew that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, was the event that thrust the United States into World War II, but thought the ''day which will live in infamy'' had occurred on Sept. 7.</p>
        <p>Having produced the new B-1 bomber, which sent only a quarter-billion dollars down the tube every time one crashed, the Air Force produced the new B-2 bomber, which will cost us more than half a billion dollars per crash. The Secretary of the Air Force said the new bomber was worth it, whatever the cost. To ease the pain, at least on taxpayers fortunate enough to own radar, the new bomber is designed to be invisible to radar watchers. 1988's Most Famous Man You Never Heard Of Until After 1987: Willie Horton.</p>
        <p>President Reagan disclosed that the media were major powers in creating history's biggest budget deficit and revealed that he himself actually had nothing to do with it.</p>
        <p>It being a Presidential election year, the quadrennial procedure was conducted according to law, and approximately half the eligible citizenry took the trouble to vote on the prescribed November date, despite the fact that the results had been ascertained and announced nearly two months earlier by the opinion-polling industry.</p>
        <p>Americans with vital economic and psychological stakes in the cold war were furious and terrified by ominous signs that the cold war might be over. Behind their panic was the gravest question facing the country at year's end: Can America survive with no enemy but itself?</p>
