        <p>Earth Day celebrates its 25th birthday today, a bit frayed around the edges.</p>
        <p>The energy of the youthful volunteers who protested the degradation of America's environment in 1970 has been replaced by an increasingly bureaucratic and sclerotic environmental establishment. The Congress of Senators Edmund Muskie and Gaylord Nelson, which established the Environmental Protection Agency, protected endangered species and demanded cleaner air and water, is now in the hands of bean-counters and ideologues who would destroy those legislative achievements or make their enforcement impossible.</p>
        <p>Washington's attitude seems to be: "Let's give environmental issues a rest." Ironically, that attitude is reinforced by optimists whose glowing inventory of the achievements of the last 25 years unwittingly suggests that all is well.</p>
        <p>All is not well. It is too soon for anyone to declare victory, too soon for complacency, too soon for Congress to abdicate its responsibility for national stewardship.</p>
        <p>Of course there have been gains. In the last decade, the number of Americans living in areas that failed Federal air-quality standards has been cut in half. In 1970, only one-third of American rivers and lakes were safe for fishing and swimming; two-thirds are safe now. Ocean dumping of sludge is illegal. Landfills are safer. Certain endangered species have made spectacular comebacks.</p>
        <p>But these gains have not come about through acts of spontaneous virtue. Industry did not voluntarily decide to stop producing toxic wastes. City governments did not voluntarily decide to stop force-feeding lakes, rivers and streams with garbage. These gains came about because the nation as a whole, through the landmark legislation of the 1970's, told polluters to clean up their act. Thus instructed, industrial engineers did amazing things. They took the lead out of gasoline, developed cleaner fuels, generated power more efficiently, constructed new forms of primary and secondary treatment of effluents.</p>
        <p>So why does this 25th Earth Day feel like a downer? One reason is that there is so much left to do. One-third of our waters, after all, are still unswimmable and unfishable. Our old-growth forests and our wetlands are still in danger. But the main reason for alarm is a Congress that seems determined to abandon the instruments of leverage that have worked so well.</p>
        <p>Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole say they want to make those instruments simpler and fairer. Sounds good, but what they really have in mind is not reform but abandonment. Last year, when a coalition of businessmen, government officials and environmentalists offered a sensible overhaul of the costly and unworkable Superfund program to clean up toxic dumps, Congress turned a deaf ear. This year, asked to make choices between good and bad environmental regulations, the House chose to suspend all of them.</p>
        <p>Worse, Gingrich, Dole &amp; Co. are in no mood to compromise, even though the environmentalists are prepared to meet them halfway. Congressional Republicans refuse even to entertain useful data. When Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt proposed a national biological survey to determine which areas should be preserved and which could be exploited for commercial gain, Congress denied funding for the program. With similar shortsightedness, it has also targeted for extinction a useful interagency study of global warming -- a potentially costly threat about which this Congress apparently wants no further enlightenment.</p>
        <p>It is true that many voters are tired of government and the micromanagement it brings to their lives. But do they wish to dismantle the entire edifice of environmental regulation? This Congress seems to think so. It is flat wrong.</p>
