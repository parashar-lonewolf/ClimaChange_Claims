        <p>Previews and Openings</p>
        <p>LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. This always buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge, and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Previews start tomorrow. Opens July 16. The chameleonic Nilaja Sun returns with her acclaimed solo show about the New York public school system (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law &amp; Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'GODOT HAS LEFT THE BUILDING' John Griffin's homage to Samuel Beckett's classic play nails the master's comedy but falls short of his lyricism, though it features fine performances from Scott David Nogi and Edward Griffin (2:00). 45 Below Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'MACBETH' As Mr. and Mrs. MacB, Liev Schreiber and Jennifer Ehle inscribe thoughtful studies in the excesses of ambition and the ultimately annihilating prickings of conscience. But in Moisés Kaufman's elegantly wrought production set in the tumultuous 1930's, the Macbeths' murderous rampage unfolds at an oddly stately pace. Blood flows regularly, but as if it's being dispensed from silver taps. Despite the intelligence and craft of their performances, neither Mr. Schreiber nor Ms. Ehle seems to inhabit fully the darkness of their characters. (2:25). Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will &amp; Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Movies</p>
        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT YOKAI WAR' (No rating, 124 minutes, in Japanese) From the prolific Japanese cult director Takashi Miike comes this extravagantly imagined fable about a boy who joins a band of cute magical creatures locked in an apocalyptic struggle against some who are much less cute. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánomo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>

        <p>AMADOU AND MARIAM (Thursday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche à Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. At noon, BAM Rhythm &amp; Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; free. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>'AMERICAN IDOL LIVE' (Sunday and Thursday) The 10 finalists from Season 5 of ''American Idol'' logged about a million yeah-yeah's and baby-baby's on television, and here they come on tour with who knows how many more: Taylor Hicks (the winner), Katharine McPhee (the runner-up), Ace Young, Bucky Covington, Chris Daughtry, Elliott Yamin, Kellie Pickler, Lisa Tucker, Mandisa and Paris Bennett.

        <p>BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tuesday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place long. At 7 p.m., Fort Greene Park, DeKalb Avenue and Washington Park, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (212) 360-8290; free. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>GORAN BREGOVIC WEDDING AND FUNERAL ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Goran Bregovic, a Yugoslav composer whose moody and stylized take on Balkan Gypsy music is featured in many films by Emir Kusturica, makes his New York debut as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. He brings a 40-piece group to perform his cycle ''Tales and Songs From Weddings and Funerals.'' At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 and $40. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* CAMERA OBSCURA (Tonight) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the lovably plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960's folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse. With Georgie James and the Metronomes. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>KELLY CLARKSON (Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The first ''American Idol'' champion, who won two Grammysand had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea. With Rooney. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; sold out. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; sold out on Wednesday, $29.50 to $75 on Thursday. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ELVIS COSTELLO AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Monday and Tuesday) After Hurricane Katrina, Elvis Costello made a fruitful reconnection with Allen Toussaint, the veteran New Orleans songwriter and pianist with whom Mr. Costello had worked in the 1980's. They recorded ''The River in Reverse'' (Verve Forecast), an album of bittersweet parables about loss and perseverance, and are now touring together, with a 10-piece band that seamlessly commingles Mr. Costello's Imposters and Mr. Toussaint's Crescent City Horns. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $53.50 to $95. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FRUIT BATS (Thursday) The Fruit Bats, from Chicago, play weightless little nuggets of psych-folk that are deceptively wistful. Behind their apparent melancholy is a playful wit and a modest awe: ''It takes leviathans down in the abyss,'' sings Eric Johnson, the band's leader. ''The hidden messages of the things that you missed.'' With Higgins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>HAKIM (Tomorrow) Hakim is a superstar in his native Egypt, singing a high-energy dance update of shaabi, an irreverent and streetwise pop style. (Its name means ''of the people.'') He borrows Western beats, and some big Western voices too -- the stars with whom he has sung include James Brown and Olga Tañón. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>COLIN HAY (Thursday) Not all former pop stars age as gracefully as Mr. Hay, who in the 1980's was the voice and face of the Australian new-wave oddballs Men at Work. Recently he has been attracting new fans with gentle, ruminative acoustic songs; one, ''I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You,'' was a heart-stopper in the film ''Garden State.'' With Bigger Thomas. At 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOLIE HOLLAND (Tuesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming and deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), is a wry, greet-the-morning scene that finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. At 8 p.m., Canal Room. (See above.) $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* LES SAVY FAV, BEANS, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Sunday) The most exciting news about the summer concert season is the unexpected arrival of the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The first concert features the arch postpunk band Les Savy Fav, the alternative rapper Beans and Dragons of Zynth, a talked-about new band whose sound is called ''Afrotek.'' If you have ever been curious about how amplified music will sound bouncing off the walls of a 50,000-square-foot concrete pool, here is your chance. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BARRINGTON LEVY (Tonight) Mr. Levy pioneered dancehall reggae a quarter-century ago, and his distinctive wail remains one of the genre's most stirring sounds. With Patrick Junior. At 7:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Kelefa Sanneh)</p>
        <p>LIFETIME, THE BRONX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Lifetime was a standard-issue hardcore punk band from New Jersey in the mid-1990's -- lots of slashing, melodic guitars and accusatory lyrics -- that has been enjoying a small renaissance since reuniting recently, after almost a decade. The Bronx -- which hails from Los Angeles, not New York -- plays a violently propulsive and proudly obnoxious kind of strut-punk that comes down from Black Flag and the MC5. With the Loved Ones. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MAIN SQUEEZE ACCORDION FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The lineup of this all-day squeezebox affair gives an indication of the surprising diversity of accordion music and its players. The Main Squeeze Orchestra, a 15-member, all-female group, begins the festival, followed by the inventive contemporary composer Guy Klucevsek, the norteño group Proyeccion Nortena, the traditional Irish playing of the John Nolan Trio, the artsy Phoebe Legere Experience, the Balkan Brothers, the Dominican merenge group Ernestidio y Su Conjunto, and the Cajun style of the Jesse Lege Bayou Brew. From 2 to 9 p.m., Riverside Park South at Pier I, 70th Street at the Hudson River, (212) 408-1219; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JUANA MOLINA (Tonight) A whispery Argentine singer-songwriter, Ms. Molina never rushes her lullabies, letting them swirl and melt, seductively drawing a listener in. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MOUTHUS, COUGHS (Tonight) An evening of grungy, discordant and exhilarating noise-rock. Mouthus, a fearsomely unpredictable duo from Brooklyn, delves into guttural depths of guitar and vocals, and Coughs, a six-piece band from Chicago, offers tortured singing above a malevolent rumble of percussion. Also on the bill are members of the clamorous Sightings and the gloomy but strangely not very noisy Bret Gand Is Dead. At 8, Goodbye Blue Monday, 1087 Broadway, at DeKalb Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 453-6343; $8. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ONEIDA (Thursday) Things are best in Oneida songs when the various patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's new album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic drone. With Dirty Faces, Company and Knyfe Hytes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BETH ORTON (Wednesday) Ms. Orton got her start a decade ago, contributing clear, siren vocals over electronic music. On her own she has headed away from electronica and toward intimate, confessional folk, a journey completed on her most recent album, ''Comfort of Strangers'' (Astralwerks). At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>OZOMATLI (Thursday) Ozomatli makes what might be called political party music. It's a Los Angeles band that's determined to annex every pan-American party groove from funk to samba to Mexican cumbia in its consciousness-raising songs. With Radio Mundial. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* DAN PENN (Thursday) An essential behind-the-scenes figure in the development of Southern soul in the 1960's, Mr. Penn was a writer or producer on some of the defining songs of the genre, like ''Do Right Woman, Do Right Man,'' ''Dark End of the Street'' and ''Cry Like a Baby.'' He is also an eloquent singer and makes a rare live appearance at the intimate Joe's Pub. His opening act is the Hacienda Brothers, a band he has produced. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DAVID LEE ROTH (Thursday) The latest project by the former lead singer of Van Halen, ''Strummin' With the Devil'' (CMH), is an album of bluegrass versions of the band's songs, on which Mr. Roth sings a few. It is slightly less unlistenable than his morning radio show. (There is less talk, for one thing.) At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $45. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SOILENT GREEN (Sunday) Soilent Green, from Louisiana, seems hell-bent on reinventing Southern rock in its own gloomy image. The band's lyrics document an unending catalog of pain and suffering, but the music is expansive and often exciting: heavy without being predictable. At 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $10. (Sanneh)</p>
        <p>ANGIE STONE (Tonight) This neo-soul singer performs her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>UNCLE MONK (Monday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 9 p.m., Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, between Clinton and Attorney Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-6270; $5. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YO LA TENGO (Thursday) This enduring indie-rock band, with its lean guitar riffs and feedback excursions, takes a detour into soundtrack territory. It accompanies the silent films of Jean Painlevé, one of the first to take cameras underwater, who became a favorite of the Surrealists with his scientific documentaries about seahorses, starfish and a solar eclipse. At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>YURA YURA TEIKOKU (Tomorrow and Sunday) Long a major player in Japan's garage-punk-revival scene -- which is bigger, and better, than you might think -- this three-piece band made a splash at its first New York concerts last year, and returns for two more. With dry, bluesy guitars and strutting rhythms, it has perfected a stylish synthesis of the sounds of ''Beggars Banquet''-era Rolling Stones and scraggy 1960's psychedelic groups like the 13th Floor Elevators. Tomorrow night at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. Sunday night at 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package.(Stephen Holden)</p>

        <p>REZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) Mr. Abbasi's most recent album, ''Snake Charmer'' (Arabesque), infuses traditional North Indian motifs with rock bombast, jazz flexibility and a Hammond B-3 organ; in some ways this guitarist and his band offer a postmillennial update of the 1970's fusion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Nate Chinen)</p>

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tonight) As the name implies, this 18-piece big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound that suggests Steve Reich minimalism as well as orchestral jazz in the lineage of Bob Brookmeyer. The band includes hale improvisers like the trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, the tenor saxophonist Jeremy Udden and the trombonist Alan Ferber. At 8, Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BALLIN' THE JACK (Wednesday) The clarinetist and saxophonist Matt Darriau heads this midsize ensemble, which spikes its swing-era repertory with madcap irreverence. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JAMIE BAUM SEPTET (Thursday) Ms. Baum, a flutist, features her own meticulous yet pliable compositions with this ensemble, sharing a frontline with Shane Endsley on trumpet, Doug Yates on reeds and Vincent Chancey on French horn.

        <p>PAUL BOLLENBACK QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) As on his recent album, ''Brightness of Being'' (Elefant Dreams), Mr. Bollenback, a guitarist, brings a sleek post-bop ethos to material ranging from Ray Charles to Puccini. His strong ensemble includes Gary Thomas on tenor and soprano saxophones, Chris McNulty on vocals, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Terri Lyne Carrington on drums. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHAEL CAIN AND RON BLAKE (Tonight) Mr. Cain, an adventurous yet sensitive pianist, and Mr. Blake, a soulful tenor and soprano saxophonist, engage in a duologue that's likely to be exploratory as well as introspective. At 8, Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, near Third Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, www.schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>NEAL CAINE QUARTET (Wednesday) On his recent album, ''Backstabber's Ball'' (Smalls), Mr. Caine, a bassist, assigned his appealingly laid-back melodies to two tenor saxophonists. Here those parts are played by J. D. Allen and Ned Goold; rounding out the group is Jason Marsalis on drums. At 10 p.m., Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARC CARY TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Cary approaches the piano trio tradition from a predominantly rhythmic standpoint, but with traces of harmonic sophistication. As he does on his new release, ''Focus'' (Motema), he performs here with David Ewell on bass and Sameer Gupta on drums.

        <p>BOBBI HUMPHREY (Through Sunday) Ms. Humphrey, a flutist, helped precipitate the 1970's boom in Afro-centric jazz-funk, a sound that D.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at New York City Opera, and lots of people drive to Cooperstown to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly better place to see and hear these productions than City Opera's cavernous New York State Theater. The company opens its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. Alternating with ''Pirates,'' through Monday, is Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 1:30; ''Barbiere'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Monday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112 tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; sold out on Monday.

        <p>'GRENDEL' (Tuesday and Thursday) The soap opera -- delayed opening, restaging problems -- attached to the Los Angeles production of Elliot Goldenthal's new opera ''Grendel'' has evidently been resolved, and Julie Taymor's elaborate staging arrives at the New York State Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $40 to $200. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY OPERA THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the state's pre-eminent opera company. In addition to performances, it offers master classes and educational outreach programs. Its summer season begins tonight with Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' directed by Albert Sherman and conducted by Steven Mosteller. Tomorrow night, Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' takes the stage in a production directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn. From all reports the casts are young, eager and gifted. Both Mozart's and Donizetti's stories of confused young lovers can gain extra poignancy when performed by emerging artists. ''Così Fan Tutte'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49.

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>MARTINA ARROYO YOUNG ARTISTS IN CONCERT (Tomorrow) The New York-born soprano Martina Arroyo, who had a long career at the Metropolitan Opera, has in recent years been immersed in the work of the Martina Arroyo Foundation, which recruits, coaches and presents young singers in concert performances of operas. Tomorrow the young artists take on Verdi's delightful and quite challenging final opera, ''Falstaff,'' in a concert performance. The conductor will be Willie Anthony Waters, the general and artistic director of the Connecticut Opera Association. At 3 p.m., the Liederkranz Foundation, 6 East 87th Street, Manhattan, (347) 677-3854; free. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Tonight Alexander Fiterstein, a highly regarded clarinetist, and Steven Beck, a fine pianist, play a freewheeling program that ranges from Weber's Grand Duo Concertante and Lutoslawski's ''Dance Preludes'' to Schumann's ''Fantasiestücke'' and Giampieri's ''Carnival of Venice'' Variations. Tomorrow and Sunday Dvorak's exquisite and rarely heard Terzetto figures into a program that also includes string quartets by Haydn and Beethoven, and Gyorgy Ligeti's Sonata for Solo Cello, to be played by Nicholas Canellakis. And on Thursday Mr. Beck returns on his own, to play Stravinsky, Brahms, Haydn and Schubert. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, (718) 624-2083; $35 tonight and Thursday, $40 tomorrow and Sunday.

        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series -- conceived as a way for the orchestra to get its money's worth from the players during the off weeks of late June -- is back. The idea is to present programs of mostly lighter and familiar fare at reduced ticket prices. Still, last summer Bramwell Tovey proved not only a lively conductor but also an avuncular host whose comments to the audience were witty and informative. The series ends this weekend with Mr. Tovey conducting Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' Overture, Saint-Saëns's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and Ravel's ''Boléro.'' Are there four more familiar and popular pieces in the repertory? At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $19 to $49. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC'S CONCERTS IN THE PARKS (Tuesday through Thursday) After the Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series ends tomorrow, the orchestra leaves the air-conditioned confines of Avery Fisher Hall for its annual series of free concerts in the parks. The Philharmonic's dynamic associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Festival Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8. Expect these concerts to draw tens of thousands of people for picnics in the parks and music under (if nature cooperates) the stars. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Prospect Park ball fields, Ninth Street and Prospect Park West, Park Slope, Brooklyn; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Great Lawn, Central Park; Thursday at 8 p.m., Cunningham Park, Francis Lewis Boulevard and Union Turnpike, Fresh Meadows, Queens; (212) 875-5709.

        <p>SUMMERGARDEN (Sunday) The Museum of Modern Art begins its annual summer series of free concerts in the Sculpture Garden with music from Sweden, Bolivia, France and the United States.

Enter through the garden gate on 54th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. The music will move inside in case of rain. At 8 p.m., (212) 708-9491. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) When James Levine injured his shoulder early this year, forcing him to cancel his conducting commitments for the rest of the season, his doctors said he would most likely be ready to conduct when Tanglewood opened. Some doubt remained until recent weeks, but Mr. Levine said he would be up for the opening program, tonight, in which he is to lead the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. His soloists are Sondra Radvanovsky, Wendy White, Clifton Forbis and John Relyea. Bernard Haitink then takes over the rest of the weekend, for programs of Ravel, Mozart, Debussy and Roussel tomorrow evening, and Sibelius and Mahler on Sunday afternoon. His soloists are the pianist Emanuel Ax tomorrow and the violinist Joshua Bell on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200; $17 to $98. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON SQUARE MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tuesday) The music is by or about Mozart. The performers are Eriko Sato and the festival's chamber orchestra. The concert is free. At 8 p.m., Washington Square Park South, Greenwich Village, (212) 252-3621. (Holland)</p>

        <p>Chunky Move (Tuesday through Thursday) Apparently, Australian men have dancing difficulties too. Perhaps not these particular men, though; employing video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.'' Through July 15. At 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco)</p>

        <p>* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 until the end of the month, although this week there will be only two performances. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)</p>

        <p>* ROXANE BUTTERFLY (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Djellaba Groove'' ain't your grandmother's tap. This performer mixes in flamenco, multilingual spoken word and North African rhythms to give this New World art form some Old World flair. And it gets better: her show is paired with the terrific Noche Flamenca at the SummerStage performance. Tonight, 8 to 10:30, summerstage.org Free. Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $15 (La Rocco)</p>
        <p>* TAP CITY (Sunday through July 22) Six years ago the irrepressible Tony Waag, fed up with the lack of performing opportunities for tap dancers in New York, started this festival. Who says you can't please all of the people all of the time? From rarely seen films to master classes with and performances by today's brightest American and international hoofers, Mr. Waag's boisterous creation promises something for everyone. From 8 to 11 p.m., the festival opens with a free tap jam at Pier 63 Maritime, West 23rd Street at the Hudson River, Chelsea. For a complete festival schedule, visit atdf.org. (La Rocco)</p>
        <p>DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER  (Thursday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College.

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.'  This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandström's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black &amp; White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, closing today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' . Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Met, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of its department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710, closing Sunday. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-3363, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>HALSEY RODMAN: 'THE NAVIGATOR'S QUARTERS MUST NOT BE DISTURBED' A solo debut introduces a multi-talented sculptor who lets his work bog down in an obscure narrative, but still cuts loose with a sufficiently engaging array of techniques, materials and colors. Guild &amp; Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, closing today. (Johnson)</p>

        <p>LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL Starts Wednesday. Through July 30. This always buzzed-about summer showcase includes ''DruidSynge,'' the complete works of John Millington Synge, and ''Grendel,'' an opera directed by Julie Taymor. Sites in and around Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500.</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD' Previews start tomorrow. Opens July 16. The chameleonic Nilaja Sun returns with her acclaimed solo show about the New York public school system (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village; (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200.(Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HOT FEET' A dancing encyclopedia of clichés set to the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. Numbing (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>*'SHINING CITY' Quiet, haunting and absolutely glorious. Conor McPherson's impeccably assembled ghost story about being alone in the crowded city of Dublin has been brought to American shores with a first-rate cast (Brian F. O'Byrne, Oliver Platt, Martha Plimpton and Peter Scanavino), directed by Robert Falls (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' (Tony Award, special theatrical event, 2006) This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants. Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE FIELD'  John B. Keane's portrait of rural life in Ireland in the mid-20th century, both sorrowful and censorious. This sturdy new production, directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, features Marty Maguire as Bull McCabe, a tough farmer who will stop at nothing to preserve his right to raise his cattle on a field about to be auctioned. A little moralistic, but powerful nonetheless (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE HOUSE IN TOWN'  A wan new drama by Richard Greenberg about an American marriage slowly imploding in the days before the country's economy did the same, more suddenly and spectacularly, back in 1929. A miscast Jessica Hecht stars as Amy Hammer, a well-to-do housewife sliding into despair as her remote husband looks on in frustration. Doug Hughes's production is pretty but desultory, as is Mr. Greenberg's typically eloquent but atypically empty writing (1:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NOT A GENUINE BLACK MAN' Brian Copeland's solo memoir about his African-American family moving into a white suburb in the early 1970's is an engaging, if stiltedly performed, show (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SHAKESPEARE IS DEAD' Orran Farmer's two-character drama about a struggling playwright and a drug-addicted actress-stripper is well-meaning but tedious and often trite (1:00). Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>* 'SPRING AWAKENING' German schoolboys of the 19th-century frolic like rockers in this adventurous new musical adapted from the 1891 play by Frank Wedekind about sex, death and adolescence. Staged with élan by Michael Mayer, and featuring alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik, this is a flawed but vibrant show that stretches the stage musical in new directions (2:10). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SUSAN AND GOD' The Mint Theater Company's fine revival of Rachel Crothers's 1937 comedy about religion, career and family features Leslie Hendrix of ''Law &amp; Order,'' excellent in the role of Susan. Jonathan Bank directs (2:20). The Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, third floor, Clinton, (212) 315-0231.(George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'TREASON' The poet Ezra Pound was a repellent fellow, judging from this play by Sallie Bingham: racist, anti-Semitic, eager to exploit the affections of the women who loved him. Just why women were drawn to him is never clear, but the play is thoughtful, and the acting, especially by Philip Pleasants as Pound, is superb (2:10). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'TROUBLE IN PARADISE' Ernst Lubitsch's 1932 film comedy about a con man, the con woman he loves and a wealthy Parisian widow lives again as a giddy, good-looking, quietly amusing play (1:30). Hudson Guild Theater, 441 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-3101. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30).Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'THE BUSY WORLD IS HUSHED' With the Episcopal church in a tizzy about homosexuality and that intriguing new gospel of Judas the subject of much speculation, Keith Bunin's play about conflicts of family and of faith arrives at a propitious moment. Jill Clayburgh stars as an Episcopal minister with a troublesome son and what may be an undiscovered Gospel. Engaging, if a little too tidy (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'GODOT HAS LEFT THE BUILDING' John Griffin's homage to Samuel Beckett's classic play nails the master's comedy but falls short of his lyricism, though it features fine performances from Scott David Nogi and Edward Griffin (2:00). 45 Below Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'MACBETH' As Mr. and Mrs. MacB, Liev Schreiber and Jennifer Ehle inscribe thoughtful studies in the excesses of ambition and the ultimately annihilating prickings of conscience. But in Moisés Kaufman's elegantly wrought production set in the tumultuous 1930's, the Macbeths' murderous rampage unfolds at an oddly stately pace. Blood flows regularly, but as if it's being dispensed from silver taps. Despite the intelligence and craft of their performances, neither Mr. Schreiber nor Ms. Ehle seems to inhabit fully the darkness of their characters. (2:25). Delacorte Theater, Central Park West and 81st Street, (212) 539-8750; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SOME GIRL(S)' A slight and sour comedy from Neil LaBute that once again puts a morally bankrupt man under the microscope and watches him squirm. The central specimen is here played by Eric McCormack, who as a thoughtless heterosexual gives much the same performance he did as a thoughtful homosexual on ''Will &amp; Grace.'' Jo Bonney directs a cast that also includes Fran Drescher, Judy Reyes, Brooke Smith and Maura Tierney as women done wrong by the same man (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE WATER'S EDGE' In a bold surgical endeavor that recalls the experiments of the mad Dr. Frankenstein, Theresa Rebeck has tried to transplant the big, blood-engorged heart of a Greek tragedy into the slender body of a modest American comic drama. The resulting hybrid runs amok in a stylishly acted production, directed by Will Frears and starring Kate Burton and Tony Goldwyn (2:00). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>

        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ARMY OF SHADOWS' (No rating, 140 minutes, in French) Dark as pitch and without compromise, Jean-Pierre Melville's 1969 masterpiece centers on the feats of a small band of Resistance fighters during the occupation. Brilliant, harrowing, essential viewing.(Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE BLOOD OF MY BROTHER' (No rating, 84 minutes, in English and Arabic) Another documentary about the occupation of Iraq; another heartbreak; another protest; another dead brother; another necessity. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'THE BREAK-UP' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn split up and share custody of a Chicago condominium. Dull and cheerless, notwithstanding a handful of funny supporting turns, notably from Judy Davis and Jason Bateman. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LEONARD COHEN: I'M YOUR MAN' (PG-13, 104 minutes) This enthralling documentary combines pieces of an extended interview with Mr. Cohen, the Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and author, now 71, with a tribute concert at the Sydney Opera House in January 2005. Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Martha Wainwright, and Antony are among the featured performers. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'DOWN IN THE VALLEY' (R, 114 minutes) This allegorical neo-western set in the San Fernando Valley has dreams as big as the fantasies that consume its protagonist, a Stetson-wearing suburban cowboy (Edward Norton) who is not what he appears to be. How much you like it will depend on your appetite for the kind of cultural metaphors that David Jacobson flings onto the screen with a reckless abandon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS: TOKYO DRIFT' (PG-13, 98 minutes) The ''Fast and Furious'' formula (dudes + cars + babes = $) is recycled in Tokyo, where the cars are smaller, and the clothes are kookier, but the boys are still boys. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'GARFIELD: A TAIL OF TWO KITTIES'  (PG, 80 minutes) It was the worst of times. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT NEW WONDERFUL' (R, 88 minutes) The post-9/11 self-absorption of a handful of New Yorkers. Occasionally well observed, but mostly irritating and contrived. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE GREAT YOKAI WAR' (No rating, 124 minutes, in Japanese) From the prolific Japanese cult director Takashi Miike comes this extravagantly imagined fable about a boy who joins a band of cute magical creatures locked in an apocalyptic struggle against some who are much less cute. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE HIDDEN BLADE' (R, 132 minutes, in Japanese) Set in 1861 at the tail end of Japanese feudalism, ''The Hidden Blade'' focuses on a gentle samurai balancing his love for a low-caste servant girl and his mission to kill a traitorous friend. By taking samurai-movie conventions and placing them in the harsh light of daily survival, the director, Yoji Yamada, is illuminating the twilight of an entire way of life. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'KEEPING UP WITH THE STEINS' (PG-13, 84 minutes) A rollicking bar mitzvah comedy begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the fangs are retracted, and the movie morphs turns into a feel-good family comedy oozing good vibes. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE LAKE HOUSE' (PG, 108 minutes) Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, reunited 12 years after ''Speed,'' play would-be lovers separated by time and yet somehow able to communicate. The absolute preposterousness of this teary romance is inseparable from its charm, which is greater than you might expect. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'LOVERBOY' (R, 86 minutes) This cautionary mother-child drama, directed by Kevin Bacon, is a star vehicle for his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, who plays a pathologically possessive single mother. After starting out warm and fuzzy, this tonally uncertain film stealthily pulls out the rug until you suddenly find yourself standing on a cold stone floor, barefoot and shivering. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III' (PG-13, 126 minutes) Er, this time it's personal, as Tom Cruise plays a dashing operative for a clandestine organization who sweeps a simpering brunette off her feet. Directed, without much flair, by J. J. Abrams, the small-screen auteur behind ''Lost'' and ''Alias.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'LA MOUSTACHE' (No rating, 86 minutes, in French) Emmanuel Carrière's psychological mystery prepares you to bask in one of those sexy, bittersweet marital comedies that are a hallmark of sophisticated French cinema. Then, by degrees, it subverts those expectations to spiral down a rabbit hole of ambiguity and doubt. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'NACHO LIBRE' (PG, 91 minutes) A sweet bliss-out from the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, that finds a glorious Jack Black as a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE OMEN' (R, 110 minutes) The supremely unnecessary remake of ''The Omen,'' the 1976 horror show that, along with ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''The Exorcist,'' plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream, wants to capitalize on the tabloid theology in the air. Except for a few contemporary touches (the World Trade Center in flames as a portent of Armageddon) it slavishly recycles the original. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ONLY HUMAN' (No rating, 85 minutes, in Spanish) When a Jewish girl takes her Palestinian fiancé home to meet the parents, the encounter sets off a series of zany, romantic and potentially tragic misadventures during one eventful night in Madrid. (Laura Kern)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's powerful, slippery new film mixes documentary and fictional techniques to tell the true story of three British Muslims imprisoned by the United States government in Guantánomo Bay, Cuba. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'ROOM' (No rating, 75 minutes) Engulfed by nightmares, blackouts and the anxieties of the age, a Texas woman flees homeland insecurity for a New York vision quest in this acute, resourceful and bracingly ambitious debut film. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'RUSSIAN DOLLS' (No rating, 129 minutes, in English, Russian, French and Spanish) The sequel to the international hit ''L'Auberge Espagnole'' belongs to a long line of airy French films that induce a pleasant buzz of Euro-envy. Like its forerunner, it is a generational group portrait of young, smart, sexy, well-educated Europeans at work and play filmed in a style that might be called Truffaut Lite. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'TWO DRIFTERS' (No rating, 98 minutes, in Portuguese) From the dexterous mind of João Pedro Rodrigues comes a bizarre love triangle like no other. Two gay boys (one of whom is dead) are reunited with the help of an enigmatic girl on roller skates in a metaphysical melodrama about grief, love, hysterical pregnancy and the transmigration of souls. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'UNITED 93' (R, 115 minutes) A scrupulously tasteful Hollywood re-creation of the downing of the fourth plane hijacked by Muslim terrorists on Sept. 11 and easily the feel-bad American movie of the year. Written and directed by Paul Greengrass, whose earlier films include ''Bloody Sunday.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'WAIST DEEP' (R, 97 minutes) Tyrese Gibson plays an ex-convict trying to rescue his son from ruthless criminal kidnappers in this far-from-terrible B movie, directed with style and heart by Vondie Curtis Hall. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'WASSUP ROCKERS' (R, 105 minutes) The latest provocation from the director and photographer Larry Clark follows a group of teenage Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles on a 24-hour adventure that takes them from one hell (the inner city) to another (decadent Beverly Hills) and back. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. ( Dargis)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>ESSENTIAL WILDER (Through July 20) Film Forum's three-week retrospective of the work of the great Polish-born director and screenwriter Billy Wilder (1906-2002) continues today and tomorrow with ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), his classic Hollywood drama about a young screenwriter (William Holden) and an aging silent-screen star (Gloria Swanson). Sunday's screening is a romantic-comedy double feature: ''The Seven Year Itch'' (1955), in which Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell cope with a New York heat wave, and the lesser-known ''Kiss Me Stupid'' (1964), starring Dean Martin and Kim Novak as a second-rate singer and a small-town beauty. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-9110; $10.

        <p>HEROIC GRACE: THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS FILM, PART II (Through July 20) The U.C.L.A. Film &amp; Television Archive and the Film Society of Lincoln Center's sequel to a 2003 festival focuses on movies from the 1970's and early 80's. It begins on Wednesday with Chung Chang-wha's ''King Boxer'' (1972), about a champion fighter whose fingers are shattered, and Zhang Che's ''Five Venoms'' (1978), the story of a dying master seeking revenge on his former disciples. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 875-5600; $10. (Gates)</p>

Mark Dornford-May's ''U-Carmen eKhayelitsha'' (2005), an award-winning Xhosa version of Bizet's opera ''Carmen,'' will be shown on Wednesday night.

        <p>AMADOU AND MARIAM (Thursday) Known throughout West Africa as the Blind Couple From Mali, Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have reached American listeners with a smooth eclecticism that on their album ''Dimanche à Bamako,'' last year, folded in reggae and some loose-limbed rock. At noon, BAM Rhythm &amp; Blues Festival, MetroTech Commons Plaza, Flatbush Avenue and Myrtle Street, Downtown Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; free. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>'AMERICAN IDOL LIVE' (Sunday and Thursday) The 10 finalists from Season 5 of ''American Idol'' logged about a million yeah-yeah's and baby-baby's on television, and here they come on tour with who knows how many more: Taylor Hicks (the winner), Katharine McPhee (the runner-up), Ace Young, Bucky Covington, Chris Daughtry, Elliott Yamin, Kellie Pickler, Lisa Tucker, Mandisa and Paris Bennett.

        <p>BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tuesday) Electronica, a live rhythm section and a wildly cosmopolitan spirit meet a charismatic and unpredictable singer, Sabina Sciubba, in the Brazilian Girls. The music dips into reggae, samba, funk and house, never staying in one place long. At 7 p.m., Fort Greene Park, DeKalb Avenue and Washington Park, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (212) 360-8290; free. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>GORAN BREGOVIC WEDDING AND FUNERAL ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Goran Bregovic, a Yugoslav composer whose moody and stylized take on Balkan Gypsy music is featured in many films by Emir Kusturica, makes his New York debut as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. He brings a 40-piece group to perform his cycle ''Tales and Songs From Weddings and Funerals.'' At 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $30 and $40. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* CAMERA OBSCURA (Tonight) Like their fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian, Camera Obscura, led by the lovably plain-voiced Tracyanne Campbell, is in love with wistful 1960's folk-pop and plays a country-leaning variation on it with taste and finesse. With Georgie James and the Metronomes. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>KELLY CLARKSON (Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The first ''American Idol'' champion, who won two Grammysand had the third-best-selling album of 2005, Ms. Clarkson is the best proof yet that reality television might not be a bad idea. With Rooney. Sunday at 7:30 p.m., PNC Bank Arts Center, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-8698; sold out. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8, Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; sold out on Wednesday, $29.50 to $75 on Thursday. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ELVIS COSTELLO AND ALLEN TOUSSAINT (Monday and Tuesday) After Hurricane Katrina, Elvis Costello made a fruitful reconnection with Allen Toussaint, the veteran New Orleans songwriter and pianist with whom Mr. Costello had worked in the 1980's. They recorded ''The River in Reverse'' (Verve Forecast), an album of bittersweet parables about loss and perseverance, and are now touring together, with a 10-piece band that seamlessly commingles Mr. Costello's Imposters and Mr. Toussaint's Crescent City Horns. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $53.50 to $95. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FRUIT BATS (Thursday) The Fruit Bats, from Chicago, play weightless little nuggets of psych-folk that are deceptively wistful. Behind their apparent melancholy is a playful wit and a modest awe: ''It takes leviathans down in the abyss,'' sings Eric Johnson, the band's leader. ''The hidden messages of the things that you missed.'' With Higgins. At 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>HAKIM (Tomorrow) Hakim is a superstar in his native Egypt, singing a high-energy dance update of shaabi, an irreverent and streetwise pop style. (Its name means ''of the people.'') He borrows Western beats, and some big Western voices too -- the stars with whom he has sung include James Brown and Olga Tañón. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777; free, but a donation is suggested. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>COLIN HAY (Thursday) Not all former pop stars age as gracefully as Mr. Hay, who in the 1980's was the voice and face of the Australian new-wave oddballs Men at Work. Recently he has been attracting new fans with gentle, ruminative acoustic songs; one, ''I Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You,'' was a heart-stopper in the film ''Garden State.'' With Bigger Thomas. At 8 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, at Canal Street, TriBeCa, (212) 941-8100; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JOLIE HOLLAND (Tuesday) With a playful quiver of a voice that can make her resemble a countryfied Billie Holliday, and a junk-shop aesthetic that mingles brassy swing with Appalachian folk, Ms. Holland sings charming and deceptively childlike songs: ''Crush in the Ghetto,'' on her new album, ''Springtime Can Kill You'' (Anti-), is a wry, greet-the-morning scene that finds her overdressed on a bus ride home from a one-night stand. At 8 p.m., Canal Room. (See above.) $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* LES SAVY FAV, BEANS, DRAGONS OF ZYNTH (Sunday) The most exciting news about the summer concert season is the unexpected arrival of the McCarren Park Pool in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The first concert features the arch postpunk band Les Savy Fav, the alternative rapper Beans and Dragons of Zynth, a talked-about new band whose sound is called ''Afrotek.'' If you have ever been curious about how amplified music will sound bouncing off the walls of a 50,000-square-foot concrete pool, here is your chance. At 3 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, thepoolparties.com; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BARRINGTON LEVY (Tonight) Mr. Levy pioneered dancehall reggae a quarter-century ago, and his distinctive wail remains one of the genre's most stirring sounds. With Patrick Junior. At 7:30, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Kelefa Sanneh)</p>
        <p>LIFETIME, THE BRONX (Tomorrow and Sunday) Lifetime was a standard-issue hardcore punk band from New Jersey in the mid-1990's -- lots of slashing, melodic guitars and accusatory lyrics -- that has been enjoying a small renaissance since reuniting recently, after almost a decade. The Bronx -- which hails from Los Angeles, not New York -- plays a violently propulsive and proudly obnoxious kind of strut-punk that comes down from Black Flag and the MC5. With the Loved Ones.

        <p>MAIN SQUEEZE ACCORDION FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The lineup of this all-day squeezebox affair gives an indication of the surprising diversity of accordion music and its players. The Main Squeeze Orchestra, a 15-member, all-female group, begins the festival, followed by the inventive contemporary composer Guy Klucevsek, the norteño group Proyeccion Nortena, the traditional Irish playing of the John Nolan Trio, the artsy Phoebe Legere Experience, the Balkan Brothers, the Dominican merenge group Ernestidio y Su Conjunto, and the Cajun style of the Jesse Lege Bayou Brew. From 2 to 9 p.m., Riverside Park South at Pier I, 70th Street at the Hudson River, (212) 408-1219; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JUANA MOLINA (Tonight) A whispery Argentine singer-songwriter, Ms. Molina never rushes her lullabies, letting them swirl and melt, seductively drawing a listener in. At 7, South Street Seaport, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 835-2789; free. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>MOUTHUS, COUGHS (Tonight) An evening of grungy, discordant and exhilarating noise-rock. Mouthus, a fearsomely unpredictable duo from Brooklyn, delves into guttural depths of guitar and vocals, and Coughs, a six-piece band from Chicago, offers tortured singing above a malevolent rumble of percussion. Also on the bill are members of the clamorous Sightings and the gloomy but strangely not very noisy Bret Gand Is Dead. At 8, Goodbye Blue Monday, 1087 Broadway, at DeKalb Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 453-6343; $8. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* ONEIDA (Thursday) Things are best in Oneida songs when the various patterns of drums, keyboards and guitar converge into powerful, pulsating drones that seem to summon some primordial rock energy. And though this veteran Brooklyn band's new album, ''Happy New Year'' (Jagjaguwar), also toys with some medieval-ish folk, there is plenty of that eerie, cathartic drone. With Dirty Faces, Company and Knyfe Hytes. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>BETH ORTON (Wednesday) Ms. Orton got her start a decade ago, contributing clear, siren vocals over electronic music.

At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111; $25. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>OZOMATLI (Thursday) Ozomatli makes what might be called political party music. It's a Los Angeles band that's determined to annex every pan-American party groove from funk to samba to Mexican cumbia in its consciousness-raising songs. With Radio Mundial. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>* DAN PENN (Thursday) An essential behind-the-scenes figure in the development of Southern soul in the 1960's, Mr. Penn was a writer or producer on some of the defining songs of the genre, like ''Do Right Woman, Do Right Man,'' ''Dark End of the Street'' and ''Cry Like a Baby.'' He is also an eloquent singer and makes a rare live appearance at the intimate Joe's Pub. His opening act is the Hacienda Brothers, a band he has produced. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $30. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DAVID LEE ROTH (Thursday) The latest project by the former lead singer of Van Halen, ''Strummin' With the Devil'' (CMH), is an album of bluegrass versions of the band's songs, on which Mr. Roth sings a few. It is slightly less unlistenable than his morning radio show. (There is less talk, for one thing.) At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171; $45. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>SOILENT GREEN (Sunday) Soilent Green, from Louisiana, seems hell-bent on reinventing Southern rock in its own gloomy image. The band's lyrics document an unending catalog of pain and suffering, but the music is expansive and often exciting: heavy without being predictable. At 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052; $10. (Sanneh)</p>
        <p>ANGIE STONE (Tonight) This neo-soul singer performs her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. At 8, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>UNCLE MONK (Monday) There is life after the Ramones, but who knew that its sound would be bluegrass? Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the band's first drummer (and only surviving original member), plays a mean mandolin in this new acoustic duo, singing tautly written songs -- much like Ramones songs, but with tenderness -- about the comforts and subtle politics of home life. At 9 p.m., Parkside Lounge, 317 East Houston Street, between Clinton and Attorney Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 673-6270; $5. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>YO LA TENGO (Thursday) This enduring indie-rock band, with its lean guitar riffs and feedback excursions, takes a detour into soundtrack territory. It accompanies the silent films of Jean Painlevé, one of the first to take cameras underwater, who became a favorite of the Surrealists with his scientific documentaries about seahorses, starfish and a solar eclipse. At 7:30 p.m., Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882; $3 suggested donation. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>YURA YURA TEIKOKU (Tomorrow and Sunday) Long a major player in Japan's garage-punk-revival scene -- which is bigger, and better, than you might think -- this three-piece band made a splash at its first New York concerts last year, and returns for two more. With dry, bluesy guitars and strutting rhythms, it has perfected a stylish synthesis of the sounds of ''Beggars Banquet''-era Rolling Stones and scraggy 1960's psychedelic groups like the 13th Floor Elevators. Tomorrow night at 9, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $10. Sunday night at 8, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs.

        <p>REZ ABBASI AND SNAKE CHARMER (Tuesday) Mr. Abbasi's most recent album, ''Snake Charmer'' (Arabesque), infuses traditional North Indian motifs with rock bombast, jazz flexibility and a Hammond B-3 organ; in some ways this guitarist and his band offer a postmillennial update of the 1970's fusion of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.

        <p>DARCY JAMES ARGUE'S SECRET SOCIETY (Tonight) As the name implies, this 18-piece big band is calibrated for maximum intrigue, with a sound that suggests Steve Reich minimalism as well as orchestral jazz in the lineage of Bob Brookmeyer.

At 8, Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 614-0505; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Monday) This company's productions almost invariably end up at New York City Opera, and lots of people drive to Cooperstown to get an early glimpse of what's on the way. But Glimmerglass, with its intimate, comfortable and up-to-date house, is a vastly better place to see and hear these productions than City Opera's cavernous New York State Theater. The company opens its season with a light work, the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in a production by Lillian Groag. Alternating with ''Pirates,'' through Monday, is Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' in a production by Leon Major. ''Pirates'': tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 1:30; ''Barbiere'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Monday at 1:30 p.m., Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-2255; $64 to $112 tonight, tomorrow and Sunday; sold out on Monday.

        <p>'GRENDEL' (Tuesday and Thursday) The soap opera -- delayed opening, restaging problems -- attached to the Los Angeles production of Elliot Goldenthal's new opera ''Grendel'' has evidently been resolved, and Julie Taymor's elaborate staging arrives at the New York State Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. At 7:30 p.m., (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $40 to $200. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY OPERA THEATER (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Founded in 2002, the New Jersey Opera Theater is striving to become the state's pre-eminent opera company. In addition to performances, it offers master classes and educational outreach programs. Its summer season begins tonight with Mozart's ''Così Fan Tutte,'' directed by Albert Sherman and conducted by Steven Mosteller. Tomorrow night, Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' takes the stage in a production directed by David Grabarkewitz and conducted by Brent McMunn. From all reports the casts are young, eager and gifted. Both Mozart's and Donizetti's stories of confused young lovers can gain extra poignancy when performed by emerging artists. ''Così Fan Tutte'': tonight at 8, Sunday at 2 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; ''L'Elisir d'Amore'': tomorrow at 8 p.m. Berlind Theater at the McCarter Theater Center, 91 University Place, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787; $42 to $49.

        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Thursday) There are few cozier places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall (a former coffee barge) on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Tonight Alexander Fiterstein, a highly regarded clarinetist, and Steven Beck, a fine pianist, play a freewheeling program that ranges from Weber's Grand Duo Concertante and Lutoslawski's ''Dance Preludes'' to Schumann's ''Fantasiestücke'' and Giampieri's ''Carnival of Venice'' Variations. Tomorrow and Sunday Dvorak's exquisite and rarely heard Terzetto figures into a program that also includes string quartets by Haydn and Beethoven, and Gyorgy Ligeti's Sonata for Solo Cello, to be played by Nicholas Canellakis.

        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow night) The Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series -- conceived as a way for the orchestra to get its money's worth from the players during the off weeks of late June -- is back. The idea is to present programs of mostly lighter and familiar fare at reduced ticket prices. Still, last summer Bramwell Tovey proved not only a lively conductor but also an avuncular host whose comments to the audience were witty and informative. The series ends this weekend with Mr. Tovey conducting Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' Overture, Saint-Saëns's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Capriccio Espagnol'' and Ravel's ''Boléro.'' Are there four more familiar and popular pieces in the repertory? At 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $19 to $49. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC'S CONCERTS IN THE PARKS (Tuesday through Thursday) After the Philharmonic's Summertime Classics series ends tomorrow, the orchestra leaves the air-conditioned confines of Avery Fisher Hall for its annual series of free concerts in the parks. The Philharmonic's dynamic associate conductor, Xian Zhang, offers two Tchaikovsky works, the ''Festival Coronation March'' and the Violin Concerto (with the charismatic violinist Jennifer Koh as soloist), and Dvorak's exuberant Symphony No. 8.

        <p>* TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Sunday) When James Levine injured his shoulder early this year, forcing him to cancel his conducting commitments for the rest of the season, his doctors said he would most likely be ready to conduct when Tanglewood opened. Some doubt remained until recent weeks, but Mr. Levine said he would be up for the opening program, tonight, in which he is to lead the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No. 1 and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. His soloists are Sondra Radvanovsky, Wendy White, Clifton Forbis and John Relyea. Bernard Haitink then takes over the rest of the weekend, for programs of Ravel, Mozart, Debussy and Roussel tomorrow evening, and Sibelius and Mahler on Sunday afternoon. His soloists are the pianist Emanuel Ax tomorrow and the violinist Joshua Bell on Sunday. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200; $17 to $98.

        <p>Chunky Move (Tuesday through Thursday) Apparently, Australian men have dancing difficulties too. Perhaps not these particular men, though; employing video montages and interviews, the members of the physical Australian troupe Chunky Move channel their inner wallflowers in ''I Want to Dance Better at Parties.'' Through July 15. At 8 p.m., the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800; $36. (Claudia La Rocco)</p>
        <p>PAULA HUNTER (Monday through Thursday) Ms. Hunter will perform ''I Am Karen Finley,'' an absurdist performance solo, as a free dance installation in a window in the theater district. Through July 22. Monday through Thursday at 5 and 7:30 p.m., Chashama, 112 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 391-8151 or www.chashama.org. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday) The Suzanne Farrell Ballet from Washington will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend in an all-Balanchine program, followed there on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by Tania Pérez-Salas's company from Mexico.

        <p>* LA MAMA MOVES! (Tonight through Sunday) Six choreographers from around the world, including Bill Irwin, will perform in ''Border Jumping'' in the closing weekend of this festival, whose curators were Nicky Paraiso and Mia Yoo. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30. ''Mavericks in Motion,'' featuring nine choreographers who include Justin Montalvo, Christopher Morgan and Kate Weare, will also be performed. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710; $10 (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* NOCHE FLAMENCA WITH SOLEDAD BARRIO (Tomorrow) Ms. Barrio is a remarkable dancer, serious and impassioned, and the hit of this winter's Flamenco Gala at City Center. Her Spanish company, founded with her husband, Martin Santangelo, has settled into the intimate Theater 80 until the end of the month, although this week there will be only two performances. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 352-3101 or theatermania.com; $45. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>PAUFVE DANCE (Tonight through Sunday night) From San Francisco, Randee Paufve and her dancers, who range in age from 22 to 72, will present ''The Big Squeeze,'' a program of dances about love, home, space and place. At 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479 or www.paufvedance.org; $15; $13 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* ROXANE BUTTERFLY (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Djellaba Groove'' ain't your grandmother's tap. This performer mixes in flamenco, multilingual spoken word and North African rhythms to give this New World art form some Old World flair. And it gets better: her show is paired with the terrific Noche Flamenca at the SummerStage performance. Tonight, 8 to 10:30, summerstage.org Free. Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200 or telecharge.com; $15 (La Rocco)</p>
        <p>* TAP CITY (Sunday through July 22) Six years ago the irrepressible Tony Waag, fed up with the lack of performing opportunities for tap dancers in New York, started this festival. Who says you can't please all of the people all of the time? From rarely seen films to master classes with and performances by today's brightest American and international hoofers, Mr. Waag's boisterous creation promises something for everyone. From 8 to 11 p.m., the festival opens with a free tap jam at Pier 63 Maritime, West 23rd Street at the Hudson River, Chelsea. For a complete festival schedule, visit atdf.org. (La Rocco)</p>
        <p>DUSAN TYNEK DANCE THEATER  (Thursday) Dusan Tynek, from Czechoslovakia, trained with Aileen Passloff at Bard College. He will present two premieres, one inspired by sinister 19th-century Czech ballads and set to string music by classical and contemporary composers, and the other set to music by Michael Galasso. Through July 16. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org; $20; $12 for students, artists and 65+. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>VON USSAR DANCEWORKS (Thursday) Astrid von Ussar, a Slovenian modern-dance choreographer now based in New York City, will present four new and recent pieces, including her new ''23 hours,'' set to music by Graeme Ravell. The program features a dance by Mojca Ussar, her sister. Through July 16. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479; $25 for opening night performance and reception. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>Art</p>
        <p>Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>Brooklyn Museum: 'Graffiti,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FREDERIC CHURCH, WINSLOW HOMER AND THOMAS MORAN: TOURISM AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE,'  through Oct. 22. It turns out that the Cooper-Hewitt owns thousands of rarely seen paintings, prints and sketches by Church, Homer and Moran. Studies of the countryside, mostly, they revere unspoiled nature and record tourism, a booming industry in 19th-century America. Here they're combined with antique postcards, old Baedekers, stereoscopic photographs, playing cards with pictures of Yellowstone on them and souvenir platters, all to trace the nation's transformation from primeval wilderness to Catskills resort. The show is extremely entertaining. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Dahesh Museum of Art: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Sept. 3. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* Frick Collection : 'Jean-Étienne Liotard (1702-1789): Swiss MasteR,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including the young Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestos and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'UNKNOWN WEEGEE,' through Aug. 27. From the 1930's through the 50's, Weegee -- real name, Arthur Fellig (1899-1968) -- was one of the best known news photographers in the country. He specialized in capturing the sensational side of urban life: crime, disaster, demimonde nightlife. Tirelessly invasive, he lived by night. For him, the city was a 24-hour emergency room, an amphetamine drip. This show of 95 pictures gives a good sense of his range and calls particular attention to his awareness of social problems related to class and race. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>JEWISH MUSEUM: 'EVA HESSE: SCULPTURE,' through Sept. 17. Assembled by Elizabeth Sussman, curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Fred Wasserman, a curator at the Jewish Museum, this show focuses on a pivotal Hesse exhibition, ''Chain Polymers,'' at the Fischbach Gallery -- known for promoting Minimalist painters -- in 1968. Arguably a compilation of her best work, it was her first and only solo show of sculpture during her lifetime, and most of the objects in it -- along with some earlier and later pieces -- are here. One of the earliest is ''Compart'' (1966), a four-panel vertical that starts at the top with a fully formed, round, breastlike image of neatly wound cord that mysteriously breaks up into part of the same image on each of the three panels beneath. The last, most startling and most impressive work is ''Untitled (Rope Piece),'' of 1970, made as Ms. Hesse was dying, finished with the help of friends. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Metropolitan museum of art: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 3 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. Further sharpness comes from the placement of all parts of the altarpiece at eye level, creating a viewing intensity that more than compensates for the fact that they have not been reassembled. (212) 535-7710. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Met: 'Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings,' through Sept. 10. ''Treasures of Sacred Maya Kings'' gets a huge gold A for truth in advertising. The treasures are plentiful, rare and splendid. A carved wood figure of kneeling shaman, arms extended, time-raked face entranced, is simply one of the greatest sculptures in the museum. And wait till you see the painted ceramic vessel known as the ''Dazzler Vase,'' with its red and green patterns like jade on fire, you'll understand its name. Much of the work has never traveled before; many objects have only recently come to light in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. They add up to an exhibition as a think-piece essay on how a culture saw itself in the world. (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* Morgan Library and Museum: 'Masterworks from the Morgan,'  through Sept. 10. Almost three years after closing to build an expansion, the Morgan is back and brilliant. What's new: Renzo Piano's splendid four-story glass-and-steel court, a sort of giant solarium with see-through elevators; two good-size second-floor galleries; and a neat little strongbox of an enclosure, called the Cube, for reliquaries and altar vessels, medieval objects made with so much silver and gold that they seem to give off heat. What's not new: almost everything in this exhibition, which fills every gallery with mini-exhibitions of master drawings and musical manuscripts, as well as illuminated gospels, devotional sculptures and historical and literary autograph manuscripts from the Brontës to Bob Dylan. 225 Madison Avenue, at East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 or www.themorgan.org. (Individual show closings can be checked by telephone or through the Web site.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Museum of Arts AND Design: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable. 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* MUseum of modern art: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: Herzog &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* New-York Historical Society: Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society. 170 Central Park West, (212) 873-3400. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Whitney Museum of American Art : 'Full House: Views of the Whitney's Collection at 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. If ''Full House'' is about one thing, it is about discord, about how harmonious America never was. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* WANGECHI MUTU: EXHUMING GLUTTONY: A LOVER'S REQUIEM In tandem with this artist's Chelsea debut, an over-the-top installation made with the British architect David Adjaye includes fur-trimmed wine bottles dripping wine, animal skins and an enormous raw wood table. Conflating morgue, tannery and banquet hall, it brings the excess and color of paintings on Mylar into real space, but its main message seems to be: I built this because I can. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646) 672-9212, through July 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Sarah Sze: 'Corner Plot' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>* HANS BELLMER: ' PETITES ANATOMIES, PETITES IMAGES.'  This extraordinary show of more than 70 images takes you beyond the surface obsessions of Bellmer's girl-crazed art to unveil some of his working processes as a sculptor, installation artist, photographer, editor and hand-colorist whose preference for small scale intensifies the voyeuristic nature of his art. Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through July 28. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* Rudy Burckhardt: 'New York Paintings' Known as a photographer and filmmaker, Burckhardt (1914-1999) also painted all through his career. His Manhattan cityscapes, mostly rooftop views of other buildings, have a fresh, almost naïve immediacy and a sophisticated way with relations between surface and depth and complexity and simplicity. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, through July 28. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>Philippe Decrauzat: 'Plate 28' A conceptually perplexing but visually striking installation by this young Swiss artist includes a black and white grid painted on the walls; a sculpture based on a Russian Constructivist design; and a grainy, flickering black-and-white film showing glimpses of ominous landscapes from ''The Twilight Zone.'' Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, at Broome Street, (212) 925-2035, through July 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>'Air' This appealing, understated show organized by the painter Amy Sillman includes Benjamin Butler's lush, Mondrian-style painting of trees; Pat Palermo's semi-abstract drawings of wrecked cars and other curious subjects; John White Cerasulo's watercolor of a bare-chested wilderness giant; Pamela Wilson-Ryckman's flickering picture of a scattering crowd of people; and abstractions in various styles by Robert Bordo, Jenny Monick, Howard Smith, Laura Newman and Patricia Treib. Monya Rowe, 526 West 26th Street, (646) 234-8645, through July 28. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Everywhichway' This lively show of artists working inventively between abstraction and representation includes Katherine Bradford's whimsical images of ships and the sea; Chris Martin's updated Tantric art; Sigrid Sandström's Arctic icescapes; suave, retro-Modernist pattern paintings by Jennifer Riley and Colin Thomson; Harvey Tulcensky's finely textured ballpoint-pen fields; and compact, sensuous ceramic slabs by Joyce Robins. Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, at 24th Street, (212) 691-6565, through July 28. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'The Sanctuary and the Scrum' A diverting, pluralistic show inaugurates a new Northwest Chelsea exhibition space. It includes good abstract and semi-abstract paintings by Jessica Dickinson and Andrew Guenther; a stuffed swan shorn of its feathers from the head down by Jane Benson; a gleaming crutch covered by tiny mirror facets by Kristian Kozul; and a funny photo-conceptual project about grocery store shopping carts by Julian Montague. Black &amp; White, 636 West 28th Street, (212) 244-3007, through July 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Martin Schoeller: 'Close Up' Extraordinarily large and detailed mug-shot-like portraits of celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Angelina Jolie and Bill Clinton. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, through Sept. 1. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Vivan Sundaram: 'Re-Take of Amrita' The photographs in this beautiful, time-haunted show are all of past generations of the Indian artist Vivan Sundaram's family, and include images of his aunt, the famed modernist painter Amrita Sher-Gil (1913-1941). Thanks to digital technology, those generations mix in logically impossible combinations. The resulting pictures embody the past the way it survives in the mind: edited, layered, compressed, as if in a dream. Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, (212) 645-9444, through July 28. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>Christine Osinski: 'Notes From West Brighton' Ms. Osinski took the visually and sociologically gripping photographs in this exhibition on Staten Island, where she lives, in the early 1980's and the early 90's. These exceptionally lucid black-and-white pictures of nondescript neighborhoods, grocery store customers, small-town parades, self-consciously posing teenagers and abandoned wrecked cars were made with an affectionately cool, clear eye for the beauty and weirdness of ordinary people and places. Silo, 1 Freeman Alley, East Village, (212) 505-9156, through July 30. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>Eva Lundsager: 'Wherever' Improvising with infectiously playful freedom on medium-large canvases, Ms. Lundsager creates hedonistic and trippy abstract landscapes composed of dots, squiggles, woozy stripes, smudgy areas, luminous open spaces, and colors ranging from neon bright to muddy brown. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, closing today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>MET: 'HATSHEPSUT,' . Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Met, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of its department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710, closing Sunday. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>'Nightmares of Summer' This entertaining selection of dark, weird and nasty visions includes Marilyn Minter's big photograph of dirty feet with toenails painted fashionably green; Barnaby Furnas's explosive, cartoonish painting of a woman at the beach spilling blood-red wine; an otherworldly coppery seascape by Stuart Elster; photographs by Anders Petersen, Hans Bellmer and Diane Arbus; drawings by Carroll Dunham and Steve DiBenedetto; and more. Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-3363, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>HALSEY RODMAN: 'THE NAVIGATOR'S QUARTERS MUST NOT BE DISTURBED' A solo debut introduces a multi-talented sculptor who lets his work bog down in an obscure narrative, but still cuts loose with a sufficiently engaging array of techniques, materials and colors. Guild &amp; Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closing tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'Scarecrow' The work in this show is supposed to be menacing and abrasive, but it is mostly interesting and amusing. Highlights include David Herbert's giant, handmade replica of a ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' videocassette; Rashid Johnson's life-size, photographic nude self-portrait; David Kennedy Cutler's model of the White House made of chewing gum and imbedded in dirt; and a short Matthew Barney-like film by Chris Larson. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-3323, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Stephen Shore The postcard-size color pictures of diners, restaurant meals, hotel rooms, roadside signs, ordinary people and other nondescript subjects taken by this eminent photographer on cross-country road trips in the early 1970's are enthralling, beautiful, nostalgic and romantic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, closing today. (Johnson)</p>
