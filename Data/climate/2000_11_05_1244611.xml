        <p>Voters have many questions about issues,and Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have many answers. Here aresummaries of the Bush and Gore positions onpolicy issues that have recieved considerable attention in the presidential campaign, with a comparison to show how the candidates differand agree, and assesments of their position fromexperts and political analysts-some partisan, some not.</p>
        <p>Both candidates have focused their energy policies on reducing the country's dependence on imported fuel. But Mr. Bush tends to emphasize increasing energy production by reducing government regulation and opening new areas of the United States to drilling. Mr. Gore tends to highlight conservation measures that would hold down consumption. In a year when gasoline prices and tight supplies of electricity have been in the headlines, neither candidate has focused much on the price of fuel -- a factor largely beyond American control. Neither candidate proposes changes in the tax on gasoline.</p>
        <p>When oil prices spiked upward this fall, however, Mr. Gore urged the Clinton administration to head off a heating oil shortage by temporarily releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; when Mr. Clinton did so, Mr. Bush denounced the move as a misguided political ploy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's budget proposal calls for spending $171 billion on energy and the environment over 10 years, including $51 billion in tax cuts to encourage energy conservation and the development of renewable technologies. Mr. Bush's proposal is for a more modest $14.5 billion in spending over five years, including tax credits for land conservation and other purposes, plus about $1.2 billion to be spent on energy from renewable sources, which would be paid for with federal revenue from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Mr. Gore would keep the refuge off limits.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush's platform is less sweeping, but includes calls for improving refineries, pipelines and electric transmission grids. Mr. Gore wants government-aided innovation in technology.</p>
        <p>Matthew L. Wald</p>
        <p>CHECKLIST</p>
        <p>Would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  Bush -- Yes  Gore -- No</p>
        <p>Would ratify the Kyoto protocol on limiting global-warming gases  Bush -- No  Gore -- Yes</p>
        <p>Supports breaching dams in the Pacific Northwest to preserve salmon  Bush -- No  Gore -- Possibly</p>
        <p>Would end the moratoriums on oil and gas drilling off the coasts of California and Florida  Bush -- No  Gore -- No</p>
        <p>Supports tax incentives for conservation and new energy technologies  Bush -- Yes  Gore -- Yes</p>
        <p>Would raise gas mileage standards for cars and light trucks  Bush -- No  Gore -- Yes</p>
        <p>TWO ASSESSMENTS</p>
        <p>''Bush seems to be attacking at the supply side, with more drilling for oil and natural gas. Gore is putting his eggs in the basket of reducing demand, with incentives for alternative fuels and energy efficiency measures. I'm a little leery of Gore's plan; it sounds like a lot of things that have not been terribly successful over the last 25 years. Wishing doesn't make it so for moving away from fossil fuels.''</p>
        <p>Ben C. Lieberman, policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative-minded research group that does not endorse candidates</p>
        <p>''Are you going to tell people when the air is dirty, and are you going to set standards based solely on the basis on what is necessary to protect public health? Gore was a strong advocate for setting tough standards for smog and soot. But there's a letter to Carol Browner from Governor Bush opposing the standards and questioning the underlying science. That's about as clear-cut on air issues as you can come.''</p>
