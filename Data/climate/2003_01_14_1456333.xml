        <p>The space shuttle Columbia, protected by layers of tight security, is poised to take off this week on a scientifically challenging mission that is also one of the most politically delicate in the space program's history.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Columbia is to lift off on a 16-day research flight crammed with more than 90 experiments and investigations that will mean round-the-clock duties for its seven-member crew, which includes the first Israeli astronaut.</p>
        <p>Heightened security has surrounded shuttle flights from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida since Sept. 11, 2001. Officials have limited public and news media access to the base, delayed announcements of launching times, expanded restricted zones around the base, patrolled the skies with military aircraft, installed new fencing around launching pads and deployed highly visible military personnel, some with heavy weapons.</p>
        <p>But David Saleeba, NASA's assistant administrator for security management, acknowledged that there were even more concerns this time because Col. Ilan Ramon, a combat pilot in the Israeli Air Force, is part of the crew.</p>
        <p>''Because of the fact that he is Israeli and what is going on in the world today, it is natural to consider this a high-profile flight,'' Mr. Saleeba said. ''Our antennas are up more than usual.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saleeba said that the agency had not received any direct threats against Colonel Ramon or the shuttle, but that it had plans to increase security rapidly if danger arose.</p>
        <p>In the past, NASA space shuttles have flown with astronauts from many countries, including Russia, France, Canada, Mexico and Ukraine. A member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia, Sultan Salman Abdulaziz al-Saud, flew on the shuttle Discovery in June 1985 to help deploy an Arab communications satellite.</p>
        <p>In 1995, President Bill Clinton announced that NASA would fly an Israeli astronaut. Colonel Ramon, 48, an electronics and computer engineer and weapons specialist, was selected and began training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston in 1998 as a payload specialist, NASA's term for a noncareer astronaut who is instructed for a specific mission.</p>
        <p>Columbia's mission differs from most recent shuttle flights in that it is devoted strictly to science and not to building or resupplying the International Space Station, the focus of most of NASA's human space flight efforts. Columbia's flight, which will include several experiments and instruments that may eventually be put on the space station, is the last dedicated science mission for the shuttle program, said Dr. John Charles, NASA's lead scientist for the venture.</p>
        <p>Congress directed NASA to conduct the research flight because of concerns that space scientists and their work would stagnate during the long assembly period for the station, when little research could be done aboard the orbiting outpost, Dr. Charles said. As it turned out, the rotating crews of three astronauts that have continuously staffed the station for more than two years have had to devote more than 90 percent of their time to construction and maintenance, leaving comparatively little time for research.</p>
        <p>''This flight will again showcase the versatility of the space shuttle as an orbiting research platform, returning the orbiter to a role it knows well, but has not played in some time,'' said Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager.</p>
        <p>The mission, originally scheduled for early 2000, has been delayed because of shuttle fleet maintenance problems and higher-priority flights, including the need to use Columbia for work on the Hubble Space Telescope. It looked as if the mission was finally going to get off the ground in July, but cracks were found in metal liners of the fuel pipes of all of the shuttles, and the fleet was grounded for repairs. Then NASA shuffled the launching schedule to mount two more pressing flights to the space station by the end of the year, again bumping Columbia's mission.</p>
        <p>''We are definitely ready to go,'' said Air Force Col. Rick D. Husband, commander of the five-man, two-woman crew. ''We've used the downtime for extra training and to get a better understanding of what we're going to do. But we are ready to fly.''</p>
        <p>The crew will be divided into two teams that will take turns conducting experiments 24 hours a day. Much of the work will be done with 7,500 pounds of research payloads housed in a large pressurized laboratory called the Research Double Module carried in Columbia's cargo bay.</p>
        <p>The laboratory, 20 feet long and 14 feet wide, owned by Spacehab Inc., is being leased to NASA; in return, the company will be allowed to sell some of its space to commercial customers. At the rear of the open cargo bay is a rack of equipment that can be operated by astronauts inside the shuttle.</p>
        <p>Colonel Husband, who flew on one earlier shuttle mission, is a member of the Red Team, which includes Colonel Ramon; Dr. Laurel Salton Clark, a Navy commander and physician on her first space flight; and Dr. Kalpana Chawla, an aerospace engineer who was part of a 1997 shuttle crew.</p>
        <p>The Blue Team is composed of Air Force Lt. Col. Michael P. Anderson, who flew on a 1998 mission to the Russian Mir space station, and two space rookies from the Navy, Capt. David M. Brown and Cmdr. William C. McCool, who also helps Colonel Husband fly the shuttle as the mission's pilot.</p>
        <p>Research scheduled during the mission is extremely broad, covering the biological, medical, physical, earth and space sciences, as well as technology development. Fifteen studies focus on space flight's effects on the human body, including bone and muscle loss sustained during weightlessness. The payload also includes a large combustion chamber that will be used to study fire and soot formation, as well as different methods of fire suppression in space, like using water mists with different sizes of droplets.</p>
        <p>To help understand the dynamics of sand and soil under pressure -- work that could apply to structural collapses and to soil's tendency to liquefy in earthquakes -- water-saturated sand in special cylinders will be highly compressed. This will allow study of changes in soil structure without the gravity-induced stresses that complicate similar analysis on Earth.</p>
        <p>The principal focus of Colonel Ramon's work will be an experiment designed by Israeli scientists to study the role of desert dust in climate change. Colonel Ramon is to remotely operate a twin-camera instrument aimed out of Columbia's cargo bay called Meidex, for Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment, that will examine desert aerosol particles whipped into the atmosphere by storms.</p>
        <p>Dust particles, carried by the winds, have global impact because they affect the rain production of clouds, supply minerals for ocean life and absorb or scatter sunlight to affect climate warming.</p>
        <p>Colonel Ramon said that as he photographed dust storms from space with the multispectral Meidex camera, ground stations and airplanes would collect dust samples from the same occurrences for comparison. The experiment was originally to have concentrated on deposits of dust from the Sahara on the Mediterranean region, but the flight delays now have Columbia overhead during a less active dust storm period in the Sahara. To compensate, Colonel Ramon said, the sampling area has been broadened to include more of West Africa and the Atlantic ocean.</p>
