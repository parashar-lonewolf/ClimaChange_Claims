        <p>MICHAEL K. DEAVER, the longtime friend of President and Mrs. Reagan who left a $72,000 White House job to build a multimillion-dollar lobbying business, last week became the first person to be indicted under the post-Watergate law providing for special prosecutors to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against senior Government officials.</p>
        <p>The indictment, on five counts of perjury, came nine months after Whitney North Seymour Jr., a New York lawyer, was named for an inquiry into whether Mr. Deaver had turned too quickly to private gain the knowledge and access he acquired in public service as Mr. Reagan's deputy chief of staff. In a series of appeals, the last of which was rejected by United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist only hours before the indictment, Mr. Deaver had asked that the grand jury's investigation be stopped while he challenged the constitutionality of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.</p>
        <p>The special counsel's inquiry - which Mr. Deaver himself had called for - was prompted by allegations that in pursuing his clients' interests, he had violated a one-year bar on former top officials' trying to influence the agencies that once employed them and a lifetime ban on their acting as representatives on matters in which they participated ''personally and substantially.'' Mr. Deaver left the White House in May 1985.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour's investigations involved Mr. Deaver's work for the Governments of Canada and Puerto Rico, on the issues of acid rain and tax credits for business investors, as well as contracts with other foreign governments, including South Korea, and with military contractors. The indictment charges that Mr. Deaver lied five times about his lobbying work, twice in testimony before a Congressional subcommittee, and three times before the grand jury.</p>
        <p>In an appearance outside his office building, Mr. Deaver said, ''I am confident I have not committed any perjury.'' In a statement from the White House, President Reagan said: ''Mike Deaver has been our friend for 20 years. We wish him well.''</p>
