        <p>9:30 P.M. (Sundance Channel) ART FROM THE ARCTIC -- Between 2003 and 2005 David Buckland, a British filmmaker, organized three sailing expeditions to the high Arctic as part of his Cape Farewell project, a collaboration among artists, educators and scientists created to focus attention on climate change. This film follows those expeditions as artists like the sculptors Max Eastley and Rachel Whiteread, the photographer Alex Hartley and the writer Ian McEwan are inspired by the otherworldly sights and sounds. Above, an installation by Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) AMERICAN IDOL -- Barry Gibb coaches the final four on how to hit the high notes in some of the songs he made famous with the Bee Gees.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13) POCAHONTAS REVEALED -- It is perhaps our country's most resounding love story: the tale of the English colonist John Smith, who was saved from execution at the hands of the Indian chief Powhatan by the chief's daughter, Pocahontas. But what is fact and what is fiction? This ''Nova'' special, in honor of the 400th anniversary of the settlement at Jamestown, re-evaluates the myth of Pocahontas, primarily through new archaeological evidence from Werowocomoco, the site of Pocahontas's village. Members of Virginia tribes re-enact the clash between their ancestors and the English colonists.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (TCM) ALICE ADAMS (1935) Turner Classic Movies looks back at the early years of Katharine Hepburn's career, starting with this George Stevens romance, based on the Booth Tarkington novel, about a small-town wallflower with designs on a more upscale life. At 9:45, ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me -- A Self Portrait'' features home movies and photographs; followed by ''Sylvia Scarlett'' (1936), in which she disguises herself as a boy, at 11; ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she plays the queen, at 12:45 a.m.; ''A Woman Rebels'' (1936), about a Victorian suffragist, at 3; and ''Quality Street'' (1937), a comedy of manners based on the J. M. Barrie play, at 4:30.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Fox) HOUSE -- A 19-year-old college student shows up at Princeton-Plainsboro after coughing up blood. Meanwhile Foreman (Omar Epps) says he is resigning but won't say why. And House (Hugh Laurie) hands an attractive nutritionist (Piper Perabo in a guest role) an employment application in the hope that she'll stick around.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) WHEN KIDS GET LIFE -- The United States is one of the few countries in which children under 18 can be prosecuted as adults and sentenced to life without parole. In this ''Frontline'' documentary five young men serving life terms in Colorado examine their crimes and punishment, and the prospect of being behind bars forever.</p>
        <p>11:35 (NBC) THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO -- Feist, right, the Canadian import of the moment, is the musical guest.</p>
