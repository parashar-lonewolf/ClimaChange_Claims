        <p>LEAD: ANITA KELLY, a science teacher at the Independent Day School in Middlefield, placed a ladder against the one-story school building.

        <p>ANITA KELLY, a science teacher at the Independent Day School in Middlefield, placed a ladder against the one-story school building. Then she and Elizabeth McCormick, a sixth grader at the school, made their way up the ladder to the roof, to empty a container with a funnel on top. ''We're taking the rainwater that falls and sending it to Wesleyan University to be analyzed,'' Elizabeth explained.</p>
        <p>Along with teachers and students at about a dozen other schools in Connecticut, and one just over the border in Massachusetts, Mrs. Kelly and Elizabeth are taking part in a project intended to involve students in science and to provide much-needed information on acid rain in Connecticut. The project is also a pilot for the Thames Science Center in New London, which is developing an environmental science curriculum for Connecticut schools.</p>
        <p>The students collect rainwater and send samples to Wesleyan in Middletown. There the samples are analyzed to determine how acidic they are and what chemicals they contain.</p>
        <p>Those involved with the project say that surprisingly little is being done to study acid rain in the state.</p>
        <p>''There's very little done in Connecticut on a systematic basis,'' said Johann C. Varekamp, an associate professor of environmental science at Wesleyan, who is an overseer of the project. ''We're doing something new.'' He noted that some acid rain studies in the state focused only on a particular area, while others were concerned only with the pH of the rainwater, which is the measure of its acidity or alkalinity.</p>
        <p>Pinpointing Pollution Sources</p>
        <p>In this project, the pH of rainwater around the state is being measured and compared. ''We want to know how acidity varies throughout the state,'' Professor Varekamp said. The samples are also being analyzed to determine their levels of sulfates, nitrates and other chemicals, to help pinpoint sources of pollution.</p>
        <p>The project evolved after a research associate at Wesleyan, Ellen Thomas, who is married to Professor Varekamp, taught a course on environmental science in the university's graduate liberal studies program. Several teachers taking the course set their students to work collecting rainwater and measuring its pH, and they reported that the students seemed to enjoy and learn from the experience.</p>
        <p>''We decided it would be interesting to do more,'' Dr. Thomas said, citing the lack of information on acid rain in Connecticut. When she began working part time as chief scientist at the Thames Science Center, helping to develop its new curriculum, she asked teachers to join in an effort to collect and analyze rainwater.</p>
        <p>Now students in Avon, Clinton, East Haddam, Greenwich, Hebron, Middlefield, Middletown, New London, Norwich, Wallingford and West Hartford, as well as in Hampden, Mass., are collecting rainwater. ''Each week the kids measure the volume of water collected, fill a little sample bottle, and ship it to me,'' said Nelson Hardigg, a senior environmental science major at Wesleyan, who is active in the project. Mr. Hardigg uses an ion chromatograph to identify the chemicals present in the samples. He is basing his senior honors thesis on his work.</p>
        <p>More Variation Than Expected</p>
        <p>''My main interest is sulfates and nitrates,'' Mr. Hardigg said. He noted that emissions from coal-burning factories produce sulfuric acid, while exhaust from cars produces nitric acid. By determining the level of sulfates and nitrates in the samples - and by studying weather patterns - Mr. Hardigg hopes to show the extent to which pollution in various areas of the country comes from coal-fired plants, mainly in the Midwest, or from traffic. He spends up to 12 hours each week analyzing samples sent by students.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Hardigg said, ''What we see is that there's more variation than we expected from location to location in sulfates, nitrates and pH.''</p>
        <p>Professor Varekamp noted that Mr. Hardigg and the participating schools were helping the effort to understand the nature of acid rain in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>He noted that in the Netherlands, where he was born, people were surprised when studies showed how much air pollution originated from the decomposition of wastes on the country's many hog farms, and that in Connecticut as elsewhere, thorough investigation could help to locate unsuspected pollution sources.</p>
        <p>Besides, Professor Varekamp said, ''We feel it's a great idea to involve students,'' too many of whom are turning away from science. ''They all want to go to business school,'' he said. ''I personally feel we're doing a service by generating enthusiasm for science.''</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm From Teachers</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardigg agreed. ''I want to make science more accessible, more understandable,'' he said, and to that end he periodically sends data back to the schools. He also hopes someday to make science-related documentary films.</p>
        <p>Teachers are also enthusiastic about the project. John Fedors, who teaches science at Greenwich High School, said his students regularly collect rainwater - thawing it in a microwave oven if it has frozen. They then measure it for volume, test its pH, record their findings, and send samples to Wesleyan. When they receive the data printouts from Mr. Hardigg, they study the information on their samples and others taken around the state.</p>
        <p>''They're actually doing something,'' Mr. Fedor said. ''They're collecting samples and recording data. They're learning how to graph. They're getting a picture of what's happening within the state. When someone says 'acid rain,' they know more about it. They're involved.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kelly, of the Independent Day School in Middletown, said: ''Students get the experience of measuring things, of doing things in an organized way - the way scientists work. And they get the idea that science happens in the real world; it's not artificial.''</p>
        <p>Jane Holdsworth, director of the Thames Science Center, said the center wants to ''involve teachers and students in real science, and acid rain is a real-world problem.'' She said that the present effort is a pilot, and that the center hopes to have rainwater collected and analyzed as part of a curriculum that it will offer to schools around the state, with data fed over the center's computer network. The data will become part of the curriculum content. ''If we need an example, we'll have a real example from Connecticut itself,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>The project is financed mainly by the Thames Science Center and Wesleyan. The Jessie B. Cox Charitable Trust provided the center with money for the ion chromatograph, and Northeast Utilities recently contributed to the project. The National Science Center paid for a pilot of the center's environmental science curriculum.</p>
