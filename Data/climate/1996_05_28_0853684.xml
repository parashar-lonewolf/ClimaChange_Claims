        <p>AS devastating as the present drought in the southern Great Plains has been,  scientists who study ancient climates are finding that droughts, floods and severe cold far surpassing anything in the modern era have punctuated the 10,000 years since the last ice age.</p>
        <p>The discovery has surprised experts because the climate of this most recent period in earth history, called the Holocene, has long been considered relatively stable and serene, and its comparative tranquillity has long been thought essential to the development of civilization.</p>
        <p>Now, paleoclimatologists are finding in case after case that the Holocene climate has been more volatile than had been believed. The disturbing implication is that these natural catastrophes could come again at any time, quite apart from any change in climate that might result from emissions of waste industrial gases that can trap heat.</p>
        <p>"We like to think of whatever climate we're in as normal," said Dr. Daniel Muhs, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey in Denver, "and our natural assumption is that it will keep on that way -- that's a very tenuous assumption."</p>
        <p>It turns out that the climate of the last century and a half, the brief period in which people have been measuring temperature and precipitation, has indeed been relatively placid. These comparatively calm recent decades have nevertheless had their own ups and downs, like the drought that struck the southern Great Plains in the 1930's, creating the Dust Bowl.</p>
        <p>That drought, modern America's worst, stripped farms of their topsoil after farming had exposed the soil to wind erosion, touching off the mass migration of the Okies to California. The relentless wind "cried and whimpered over the fallen corn" while people huddled inside, tying handkerchiefs over their noses and donning goggles to go out, John Steinbeck wrote in "The Grapes of Wrath."</p>
        <p>But according to new evidence presented by Dr. Muhs last week at a meeting of the American Quaternary Association in Flagstaff, Ariz., there have been several times during the Holocene when even more severe droughts have converted other, larger stretches of the Great Plains to seas of windblown sand dunes like those  of the Sahara. These conditions were seen most recently in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the region was heavily settled.</p>
        <p>In 1810, in one of a number of historical accounts collected by Dr. Muhs and  his colleagues, the explorer Zebulon Pike wrote this about parts of Kansas and Colorado: "These vast plains of the western hemisphere may become in time equally celebrated as the sandy deserts of Africa; for I saw in my route, in various places, tracts of many leagues, where the wind had thrown up the sand, in all the fanciful forms of the ocean's rolling wave, and on which not a speck  of vegetable matter existed."</p>
        <p>The dunes are still there, mostly grazed by cattle, and only a thin, fragile  cover of vegetation holds them in check. In the 1930's, the dunes were on the verge of becoming active when the drought ended; that is, the vegetation was just beginning to succumb and unleash the blowing sands. Should the sands be unleashed today, Dr. Muhs said, some highways and railroads would probably be buried. Lots of grazing range would cease to exist, and much habitat, including  extensive wetlands, would disappear. Stifling sand would rain onto productive agricultural fields downwind, and some dunes could migrate onto adjacent farms.</p>
        <p>"It would be pretty catastrophic, I think," Dr. Muhs said.</p>
        <p>The Sahara-like conditions could be touched off if predicted climatic changes resulting from atmospheric accumulations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like  carbon dioxide come to pass, according to a study by Dr. Muhs and his colleagues. Experts predict that a greenhouse world would make the Great Plains  both drier and warmer, perhaps enough to reactivate the dunes. But natural forces could also do the trick: "With or without the greenhouse, potentially we  could have this kind of effect," Dr. Muhs said.</p>
        <p>The litany of Holocene climatic extremes has been growing of late. About 8,000 years ago, for instance, much of Earth was in the grip of a cold spell more severe than the so-called Little Ice Age of the 15th to the 19th centuries, according to analyses of ice cores from Greenland. "This is a big event," said Dr. Richard Alley, a paleoclimatologist at Pennsylvania State University, "clearly something that affected a huge chunk of the world, and it's a lot bigger than modern humans have ever experienced." Even though the Little Ice Age was less severe, it caused great hardship, bringing crop failures and starvation to much of Europe.</p>
        <p>During some periods in the Holocene, some places have been characterized not  by drought, heat or cold, but by outsized floods. Starting about 3,300 years ago, according to an analysis of ancient sediments by Dr. James Knox, a geographer at the University of Wisconsin, the upper Mississippi Valley suddenly began experiencing a series of what would today be called 500-year floods. The 1993 floods in that region were of that magnitude, but paleoclimatologists are uncertain whether they presage another outbreak of severe floods. One remarkable feature of the great floods 3,300 years ago is that they were touched off by relatively modest changes in the global patterns of atmospheric circulation, Dr. Knox said.</p>
        <p>Evidence is also mounting that severe droughts and floods devastated a number of early civilizations. The Peruvian coast of South America is a case in point. An analysis of Andean ice cores dating back to the fifth century A.D. has revealed that the region endured alternating droughts and wet periods lasting up to 400 years each. Dr. Lonnie G. Thompson, a paleoclimate expert at Ohio State University, said that archeological evidence indicated that the rise and fall of a number of pre-Inca cultures "are in sync with these precipitation changes."</p>
        <p>The wet-dry variations might have been caused by long-term oscillations in the ocean-atmosphere climate system, analogous to the short-term changes typical of El Nino -- the vast pool of warm water in the tropical Pacific that appears from time to time, altering regional climates around the world. That theory is bolstered, Dr. Thompson said, by core samples from Tibet that show wet-dry cycles matching those in Peru.</p>
        <p>Other evidence of global or at least hemisphere-wide climatic changes affecting earlier civilizations has previously emerged. Two years ago, Dr. Scott Stine of California State University at Hayward reported that what is now California had experienced two droughts beginning about 1,100 years ago, the first lasting 220 years and the second 140 years. Both droughts were much more intense than the six-year dry spells that afflict modern California from time to time. They also coincided roughly with similar droughts in South America that caused the collapse of that continent's most advanced pre-Inca empire, a state called Tiwanaku -- and they coincided with a warm period in Europe that allowed  the Vikings to colonize Greenland and vineyards to flourish in England.</p>
        <p>Last year, a University of Florida team led by Dr. David A. Hodell reported that an unusually severe drought about 1,200 years ago might have contributed to the abrupt decline of the classic Maya civilization in Yucatan.</p>
        <p>And in 1993, an American-French archeological team headed by Dr. Harvey Weiss of Yale University reported that the sudden onset of a 300-year drought had brought about the collapse, 4,200 years ago, of the Akkadians, the Middle East's earliest known empire.</p>
        <p>Until recently, paleoclimatologists have focused more on the climatic record  of the ice ages because those temperature swings were much larger, and therefore more interesting to scientists, than those of the Holocene. By comparison, "people figured that the Holocene is truly boring," Dr. Alley said. Then, in 1993, attention shifted to the last warm interglacial period before this one, which lasted from about 130,000 to 120,000 years ago. Reports in that year on studies of Greenland ice cores suggested that the last interglacial period had experienced abrupt and previously unexpected swings of global temperature. But that finding turned out to be ambiguous.</p>
        <p>Now, as the results of studies under way for some time are beginning to come  in from around the world, the spotlight is shifting to the current era, and a broad pattern of abrupt and severe climatic change in the Holocene is being seen for the first time. The studies show clearly that the Holocene has abounded in climatic swings "large enough to dwarf changes seen in the instrumentally based  climate record of the last 150 years," Dr. Jonathan T. Overpeck wrote recently in the journal Science.  Dr. Overpeck directs the paleoclimatology program of the National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colo.</p>
        <p>Some of most arresting findings are those having to do with the Great Plains. Vast stretches of the plains, from Texas and New Mexico to Nebraska and South Dakota, consist of classic sand dunes covered thinly by vegetation. One area, the Nebraska Sand Hills, is the biggest dune field in the Western Hemisphere. When atmospheric circulation settles into a characteristic pattern of no rain and high heat over the region, the vegetation dies. The dunes, naked to the wind, go into their Sahara mode.</p>
        <p>Through radiocarbon dating of strata in the dunes and historical accounts from the 1700's and 1800's, Dr. Muhs and colleagues have found that the stripping of vegetation caused by droughts has several times activated the dunes over large areas in the last 3,000 years.</p>
        <p>The historical accounts make it clear that when 19th-century textbooks referred to the Great American Desert, the allusion was not just born of some effete Eastern bias. The Nebraska Sand Hills, for instance, were described by an explorer in 1796 as a "great desert of drifting sand, without trees, soil, rock, water or animals of any kind, excepting some little varicolored turtles, of which there were vast numbers." In 1855, a sketch by another explorer depicted bare, peaked dunes in the Sand Hills stretching to the horizon.</p>
        <p>In the 1860's, a drought much more severe than the one that caused the Dust Bowl apparently brought the desertification of the West to its most recent peak; after that, the dunes stabilized again. Dr. Muhs said that it might take less than a decade of drought to kill enough vegetation to create desert conditions again.</p>
        <p>Aerial photographs show that in much of the plains in the mid-1930's, including the Dust Bowl region, some dunes were already "going active." Had the  drought not ended when it did, Dr. Muhs said, a repeat of the 1860's could have  resulted.</p>
        <p>The mega-droughts have come so often, he said, that it is impossible to judge whether the "normal" condition of the plains is to have controlled or active dunes.</p>
        <p>The present drought in the southern Great Plains, which threatens cattle ranchers and wheat growers with bankruptcy, is a little more than six months old. It would probably take at least two or three more years of drought, Dr. Muhs said, for the desert to begin to be unleashed again. He and his colleagues  have concluded that the predicted greenhouse effect would probably mobilize the  dunes once again. "If you superimpose that on one of the warm, dry periods we know has recurred repeatedly in the last 1,000 years or more," Dr. Muhs said, "you're looking at an enormous impact on the landscape."</p>
        <p>Either way, Dr. Overpeck wrote in Science, future climatic changes of the kind produced earlier in the Holocene "may be our biggest worry in the years to  come."</p>
