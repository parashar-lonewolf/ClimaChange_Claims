        <p>Study suggests that where one lives plays important role in temperature extremes that are associated with increased death rates; finds that while residents of relatively temperate American South are likely to be put at greater risk by deep freeze, people who live in North are more susceptible to deaths caused by too much heat (S)</p>

        <p>Extremes in temperature, whether hot or cold, have long been associated with increased death rates. But a new study suggests that where one lives may play an important role.</p>
        <p>While residents of the relatively temperate American South are likely to be put at greater risk by a deep freeze, people who live in the north are more susceptible to deaths caused by too much heat.</p>
        <p>The findings are reported by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and are reported in a recent American Journal of Epidemiology.</p>
        <p>The conclusions may prove useful, said Dr. Frank C. Curriero, the lead author of the study, as health officials weigh what steps to take in response to climate changes, whether they are the periodic upheavals caused by El Ni√±o or long-term global warming.</p>
        <p>Generally, the researchers found, the risk of weather-related death went down as the temperatures rose and the cold no longer posed a threat.</p>
        <p>But that was only true to a point. Death rates, they said, began to climb again after the temperature rose enough.</p>
        <p>The researchers examined the temperature patterns and death rates of 11 cities. The coldest one was Chicago; the warmest, Miami.</p>
        <p>Other factors also play a role. The association between cold temperatures and death was most pronounced in cities with high concentrations of the elderly and lower in cities with more heating systems.</p>
