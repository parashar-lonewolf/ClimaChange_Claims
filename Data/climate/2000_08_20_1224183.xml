        <p>An ice-free patch of ocean about a mile wide has opened at the very top of the world, a sight that has presumably never before been seen by human beings and is more evidence that global warming may be real. The last time scientists can be certain the pole was awash in water was more than 50 million years ago. ''It was totally unexpected,'' Dr. James J. McCarthy, an oceanographer and director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, said after lecturing aboard a tourist cruise on a Russian icebreaker earlier this month. He said that six years ago, the ice near the North Pole was six to nine feet thick.</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 29, 2000, Tuesday  A front-page article on Aug. 19 and a brief report on Aug. 20 in The Week in Review about the sighting of open water at the North Pole misstated the normal conditions of the sea ice there. A clear spot has probably opened at the pole before, scientists say, because about 10 percent of the Arctic Ocean is clear of ice in a typical summer.</p>
        <p>The reports also referred incompletely to the link between the open water and global warming. The lack of ice at the pole is not necessarily related to global warming. New studies of the polar icepack and its recent changes are reported today in Science Times on Page F3.</p>
