        <p>LEAD: More than 100 House members have introduced legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that.</p>
        <p>More than 100 House members have introduced legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that.</p>
        <p>The gases are the two major components of acid rain produced in the burning of coal and other industrial processes, that are carried aloft by air currents and then returned to earth.</p>
        <p>The bill, introduced Thursday, drew strong support from environmental groups but was quickly opposed by the coal, automobile and electric utilities industries, which have fought environmentalists to a draw since the Reagan Administration began in 1981.</p>
        <p>''This is the year for clean air,'' said Representative Gerry Sikorski, Democrat of Minnesota, a sponsor of the legislation. As evidence of this, he cited a ''new attitude'' by President Bush as opposed to that of former Ronald Reagan as President, and ''increased public awareness and concern about our environment.''</p>
