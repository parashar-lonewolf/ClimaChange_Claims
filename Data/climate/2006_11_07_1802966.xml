        <p>On Sept. 8, 1923, Joseph Dixon and Leo Wilson hiked with packhorses to an alpine meadow near the base of Lassen Peak in Northern California. The trip was difficult; the two men, researchers from the University of California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, were soon snowed out of their campsite.</p>
        <p>Eighty-three years later to the day, Jim Patton and John Perrine -- also researchers from the museum, which is now part of what has since become the University of California, Berkeley -- enjoyed an easier arrival in the same meadow. Parking their cars, the two men stepped out onto a carpet of corn lilies and wild mint to continue what their predecessors had started: one of the largest wildlife-distribution studies ever.</p>
        <p>The tidy parallels in time, place and purpose between the scientists of yesteryear and those of today are no accident. They are, rather, part of a major undertaking called the Grinnell Resurvey Project.</p>
        <p>Joseph Grinnell, the museum's first director, outlined his aims after its founding in 1908. In a collection that today boasts the last grizzly bear killed in California and tortoise shells as big as the hood of a small car, Grinnell's vision, enshrined on a plaque outside the library, remains one of the most interesting things on display: ''I wish to emphasize what I believe will ultimately prove to be the greatest purpose of our museum,'' he wrote in 1910, ''and this is that the student of the future will have access to the original record of faunal conditions in California and the West, wherever we now work.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Patton, curator of mammals at the museum and an emeritus professor, said Grinnell ''saw that there were changes in California in his lifetime that the future would want to be able to measure in some fashion.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think that even today he gets the credit that is due,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Grinnell and his colleagues hiked the peaks and traced the coastlines of California to build the museum's collection. From 1904 to 1940, they scribbled 13,000 pages of notes, took more than 2,000 photographs and collected specimens at 700 locations around the state. Their work provides one of the best portraits of 20th-century diversity in North America.</p>
        <p>Now, this portrait is proving invaluable to scientists not just because it offers a snapshot of the past, but because it may help them peer into the future.</p>
        <p>According to David Tilman, the McKnight presidential chair in ecology at the University of Minnesota, ecology is in the midst of transforming itself from a descriptive science into a predictive science.</p>
        <p>''This transformation has come none too soon,'' Dr. Tilman said. ''The world faces immense environmental challenges that we will only resolve if we can forecast how ecosystems respond to alternative practices and policies.''</p>
        <p>But despite its clear promise, most scientists agree that ecosystem forecasting is in its infancy and that its methodologies and applications are ripe for refinement. In particular, modern ecologists say they are hungry for data sets against which they can test predictions about climate and land-use changes. The data must be detailed enough to provide a foundation for quantitative analysis, but must also encompass time and space scales large enough to record ecosystem changes.</p>
        <p>It is a tall order, but in preparing for the centennial of the Berkeley museum, Craig Moritz, the museum director, said he realized Grinnell's data set fitted the bill.</p>
        <p>In 1900, California had fewer than two million residents. The state is now the most populous in the country, home to more than 36 million people. In trying to decipher how ecosystems change as population density rises and the climate shifts, there may be no better place to look than the Golden State.</p>
        <p>In 2003, 99 years after Grinnell set out on his first sampling trip, Dr. Patton led researchers into Yosemite National Park to resurvey Grinnell's Yosemite transect. Using colorfully annotated maps dating from the late 1800s, the biologists revisited about 40 sites. At each one, they placed traps in the areas flagged in Grinnell's notes and -- just as their predecessors had done -- jotted observations about the mammals they caught. ''We're not just standing on the shoulders of giants, we're trying to walk in their footsteps,'' said Dr. Perrine, a postdoctoral fellow.</p>
        <p>Unlike the data gathered by the scientists of the early 1900s, however, the information collected today is stored on global positioning systems and laptops, and the limited number of animals killed now inform genetic studies not possible 100 years ago.</p>
        <p>For Bill Monahan, a graduate researcher at the museum, the information flowing back to his lab from Dr. Patton, Dr. Perrine and others has already helped refine the climate models on which he works.</p>
        <p>The recent Yosemite survey, for example, recorded several shifts indicative of climate change in the geographic ranges of species. The Western harvest mouse, the piñon mouse, the California pocket mouse and the Inyo shrew had never been recorded in the relatively high-elevation park until they showed up in researchers' traps. On average, since the Grinnell period, these species have expanded their ranges upwards by 2,100 feet in the Yosemite area.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Patton saw his first piñon mouse, a cinnamon-colored animal with big ears, on Mount Lyell in Yosemite, he remembers thinking, ''What the hell is this thing doing here?'' But the mice kept showing up. ''They were known up to 7,600-7,800-feet elevation, and I trapped them almost at tree line just below Mount Lyell at 10,500 feet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>High-elevation species like the Alpine chipmunk and the pika, a small Roman-nosed relative of the rabbit, meanwhile, have retracted their ranges up the same mountainsides. Since habitat modification cannot explain these results, Dr. Patton says climate change is probably driving the upward migration. Mr. Monahan said none of the models he had used fitted the data exactly. The reason, in large part, he said, is that species' ranges are affected by many factors, and that ecosystems are incredibly complex. More data are needed.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, researchers are resurveying other high-elevation areas in Lassen and elsewhere, as others gear up to address questions about the effects of land-use patterns on ecosystems.</p>
        <p>''The modern Yosemite data allow us to evaluate model performance in one small part of the state,'' Mr. Monahan said. ''The longer-term goal of the resurvey is to be able to evaluate model performance statewide and, where appropriate, project the models forwards in time.''</p>
        <p>With this goal in mind, Justin S. Brashares, an assistant professor at Berkeley, says California ecologists hope Grinnell's data will soon allow them to ''move beyond toothless statements about development being bad for nature and actually quantify how our Wal-Marts, vineyards and subdivisions have impacted California's fauna. It's a rare opportunity and we hope to run with it.''</p>
