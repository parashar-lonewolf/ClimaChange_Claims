        <p>Peter Maniscalco's Opinion piece, ''Same Old Unwise Ideas on Energy'' [July 15], is an interesting collection of opinions and fables. Explaining our recent political climate regarding Shoreham with references to mythology is clever but useless.</p>
        <p>He speaks of a recent report on global warning and ties it to burning  fossil fuels and using nuclear power. He should know that nuclear plants  do not pollute. Then we get a dose of ''the decision-making power on energy choices is held by people invested in the old ways of producing energy.''</p>
        <p>His criticism of LIPA and Richard Kessel is misdirected. Mr. Kessel,  Mario Cuomo, Governor Pataki, local politicians and the leaders at Lilco were instrumental in the closing of Shoreham. Because of their active complicity, we ratepayers and taxpayers have a $7 billion debt. We  bought the Shoreham plant, which we can't use and paid too much for. As with many other political scams, our grandchildren will be stuck with the debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maniscalco is under the impression that we are ready to use  renewable technology but that the bad guys are keeping them from us. He also looks forward to the ''unveiling of and implementation of a visionary energy plan for Long Island'' that could include solar, wind and fuel cells. Yes, we could build all these. If we want to pay a lot more  for our energy and are willing to build huge towers with whirling fans  for many miles along our shore and cover many, many square miles with  solar panels. None of the renewable sources he names are practical, cost-effective replacements for our energy needs. And what will we call these  facilities? Maybe Energy Parks.</p>
        <p>Nuclear energy is practical. Both France and Japan generate a major  portion of their electricity using nuclear power. We have more than 200 nuclear plants in our country. They work and don't pollute. Being afraid that there could be a nuclear accident while we are told that the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans are shortened every year because of the pollution spewed out of our plants makes no sense.</p>
        <p>Yes, we must work on sources of energy that lessen our dependence on coal, oil or gas and lower the levels of air pollution caused by these  sources. Being afraid of change or ignoring reality will not lead to a  solution.</p>
