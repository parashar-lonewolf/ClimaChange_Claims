        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Mr. Bush's Beginning'' (editorial, April 29): In time, history may have a slightly harsher view of President Bush's achievement. The Chinese test of the president's diplomatic skills, for example, found them wanting. The blunder on Korea that seemed to have insulted both the North and the South is another example of weak diplomacy. Along with global warming and missile defense, the whole impression is that Mr. Bush is like a bull in a china shop.</p>

        <p>Is it conceivable that a man with little diplomatic or political experience, a man who has not traveled or observed the customs and cultures of other parts of the world, would be able to be an effective world leader? I do not know if it is prudent to rely completely on handlers to guide the president through the churning waters of world diplomacy. It gives me a queasy feeling.</p>
