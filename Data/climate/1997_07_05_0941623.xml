        <p>After a smooth seven-month journey, an American spacecraft came to a bouncing, rolling landing on Mars today to begin intensive studies of what the planet is made of and whether life could have possibly arisen there in its distant past.</p>
        <p>The first landing on Mars in 21 years, which mission officials described as nearly perfect, occurred shortly before 10 A.M. here in California (1 P.M. Eastern time). It was still night on the dusty, rocky red plain of Ares Vallis, dry and freezing, almost exactly where Mars Pathfinder had been aiming. Almost immediately, radio signals indicated a successful arrival.</p>
        <p>''I'm ecstatic, absolutely ecstatic,'' Brian Muirhead, deputy project manager here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, exclaimed after the first data came streaming in. ''We are on the surface of Mars and have received our first telemetry.''</p>
        <p>More than six hours later, the first transmitted photographs showed the spacecraft and its attached roving vehicle in the foreground, resting upright, as well as a broad field of rocks and sand stretching to hills on the far horizon. A color mosaic of 120 of these pictures was made public tonight.</p>
        <p>But an examination of the pictures revealed a hitch that project officials said would almost certainly delay the deployment of the six-wheel rover, named Sojourner and weighing 23 pounds on Mars, until late Saturday afternoon. Such a delay, scientists said, was not surprising and should not reduce the mission's research output.</p>
        <p>Looking at the pictures, engineers saw that the air bags that had cushioned the spacecraft's impact were deflated, as planned, but some of them were bunched up near the rover. To retract the bags more fully, commands were sent to the craft to lift the petal-like part of its outer shell where the rover is still stowed. While the petal is lifted, electric motors will try to pull the air bags away from the rover.</p>
        <p>Until this is done, engineers plan to hold off releasing the two ramps down which the rover is supposed to roll onto the Martian surface. Sojourner will be the first mobile vehicle to operate on another planet and is a test model for more advanced roving vehicles to be used on future missions to Mars.</p>
        <p>While controllers waited for Pathfinder's first pictures, Vice President Al Gore telephoned his congratulations to Daniel S. Goldin, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, who was here for the landing, and to the engineers and scientists of the project.</p>
        <p>President Clinton said in a statement that the return to Mars ''marks the beginning of a new era in the nation's space exploration program.''</p>
        <p>At each step in Mars Pathfinder's descent to the surface and early operations, cheers broke out in the control rooms here, cheers that carried echoes of a collective sigh of relief, for the record of flying to Mars has been spotted with frustrating failure.</p>
        <p>Over the years Russian spacecraft have suffered seven disastrous malfunctions while scoring only four partial successes. Until now, the United States had six successes, beginning with the Mariner 4 fly-by of the planet in 1965, and three failures. The most recent of these came in 1992,  when Mars Observer was inexplicably lost as it approached the planet for a planned orbiting missions.</p>
        <p>There was relief also because much is riding on Pathfinder's success. The mission is not only the first in an ambitious program of Mars exploration in the next decade but also a critical test of a new approach to planetary expeditions by the United States. Instead of mounting a few complex, multipurpose and expensive missions, the emphasis now is on building several relatively low-cost craft with limited objectives that can be ready to go to Mars every 26 months.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wesley T. Huntress Jr., the chief of space sciences at NASA, said this ''amounts to the second era in the exploration of Mars.''</p>
        <p>As the first such craft, Pathfinder was launched three years after development began, and the entire mission is estimated to cost $266 million. The last American mission, the failed Mars Observer, cost $1 billion. A second low-cost craft, Mars Global Surveyor, is on its way to orbit Mars in September for a two-year mapping reconnaissance, which had been Mars Observer's primary objective.</p>
        <p>NASA's plans call for two missions -- a lander and an orbiter -- to be flown to the planet at each of the subsequent 26-month windows of opportunity, culminating in a mission in 2005 to bring back samples of carefully selected Martian rocks and soil for analysis. Scientists think there is little hope of answering life-on-Mars questions until they can study those rocks.</p>
        <p>Although Pathfinder and its rover are not equipped to search for signs of life, project scientists expect a device on the rover called an alpha proton X-ray spectrometer to determine the mineral content of rocks scattered several hundred feet from the landing site. Since the rocks are thought to have been washed onto the plain from the ancient highlands nearby, their mineral composition should provide clues as to the planet's early environment, whether it was indeed once a warmer, wetter place where microbial life could have possibly developed.</p>
        <p>The Ares Vallis landing site was selected by geologists, who studied photographs taken by the Viking orbiters, because it appears to be a flood plain where a variety of ancient highland rocks should have been deposited after catastrophic floods. The site is about 19 degrees north of the Mars Equator and some 500 miles southeast of the place where the first Viking spacecraft landed in July 1976. That was the first successful landing on the planet.</p>
        <p>The two Viking landers conducted life-detection experiments, but failed to detect any indisputable signs of biological activity. That result dampened lingering hopes of finding Martian life and interest in continued exploration of the planet, until geologists in recent years pointed out that the many eroded channels on Mars indicated that liquid water once flowed over the surface and just might have created conditions supporting life.</p>
        <p>After plans for Mars Pathfinder were already under way, NASA and university geochemists announced last August the discovery of minerals, hydrocarbons and possible microfossils in a meteorite that fell from Mars. This evidence, they said, indicated that life might have existed on Mars in its first billion years. Their interpretation, though controversial, excited new interest in exploring Mars.</p>
        <p>Dr. David S. McKay, a leader of the meteorite analysis team at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said today: ''We think we have some additional lines of supporting evidence. But we do not have the smoking gun yet.''</p>
        <p>Dr. McKay said he doubted that Pathfinder would find anything to corroborate the meteorite findings.</p>
        <p>''The best we can hope for is that the rover will perhaps find interesting rock types, sedimentary rocks,'' he said, referring to the kind of rocks usually formed in the presence of water. ''Beyond that, if we could actually see a fossil in a rock, but I think that's not likely.''</p>
        <p>The Pathfinder landing craft is equipped with instruments for recording weather conditions and a camera with two lenses and 24 filters for producing color stereoscopic photographs of the landscape. The camera can swivel 360 degrees to take panoramic shots.</p>
        <p>''We will have a lot of opportunities to make tremendous discoveries,'' said Dr. Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, who led the team developing the camera system.</p>
        <p>The rover also carries three color cameras, two forward and one rear, to help it navigate the surface and take close-up pictures of the rocks it examines with its X-ray spectrometer. As planned, the rover should be able to nose up and press the spectrometer to the surface of a rock, zapping it with protons. An analysis of the backscattering protons should tell geologists the nature and composition of the rock. The instrument is sensitive to all chemical elements except hydrogen and helium.</p>
        <p>For a few anxious hours today, though, all that mattered was getting Pathfinder to the surface in working order.</p>
        <p>Navigation experts reported the spacecraft's aim was true as it raced toward the planet, accelerating to 16,600 miles an hour because of the pull of Martian gravity. The craft was operating autonomously, by commands stored in its computer. Given the 10 1/2 minutes it takes for radio signals to travel from Mars to Earth, there was no time for ground controllers to direct each event or respond immediately to problems.</p>
        <p>At about 5,300 miles above the surface, the spacecraft jettisoned its cruise stage, which contained fuel, rockets and other systems for maneuvers over the seven-month flight. Half an hour was then left before the craft plunged into the fringes of the thin Martian atmosphere, which is mostly carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The atmospheric friction should have begun slowing the spacecraft, at 80 miles above the surface and heating its shielding to a glowing red. This was an unseen spectacle in the dark of the Martian night. But flight controllers, monitoring a faint radio signal, could tell that Pathfinder was indeed diving through the atmosphere and decelerating.</p>
        <p>''Spacecraft is now slowing down very rapidly,'' announced Rob Manning, the chief engineer.</p>
        <p>At maximum deceleration, engineers figured, the spacecraft was being jolted by forces nearly 20 times greater than Earth's gravity, much stronger than anything felt by astronauts re-entering Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>But was Pathfinder coming in at a safe angle? Its entry into the atmosphere had been at an angle of about 14 degrees. Any sharper, and the craft would probably burn up. Any  shallower, and it would skip out of the atmosphere and soar off into space.</p>
        <p>At an altitude of less than seven miles, the parachute unfurled to more another round of cheers in the control room. Drifting down, the craft released its heat shield, then detected the ground with its radar, at one mile up. Then the air bags inflated, descent rockets fired for a few seconds and Pathfinder dropped to the surface at a velocity of 23 miles an hour, bouncing at least three times.</p>
        <p>The entry and descent had taken four and a half minutes. At first, there was only radio silence from Pathfinder. Then, at 10:08 A.M., Mr. Manning reported a barely detectable signal, which he said was ''a very good sign.''</p>
        <p>One by one, signals reassured controllers that the spacecraft had apparently landed upright, that the deflated air-bags had been retracted and that the outer shell had opened to expose the camera and rover.</p>
        <p>At this, Mr. Manning, who supervised the entry operations, announced facetiously, ''This is Rob Manning, and I'm out of a job.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward C. Stone, the director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, declared, ''It certainly appears we have landed and have a good operating system.''</p>
        <p>By then, the sun was rising on Mars Pathfinder and its landing site at Ares Vallis.</p>
