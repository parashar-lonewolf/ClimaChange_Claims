        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Repower Play'' (editorial, Dec. 18), you state that the cost of energy has risen relentlessly, that consumers have a ''freewheeling appetite for power'' and we must have cleaner air.</p>
        <p>Well, Long Island had a chance to have more lower-cost energy with cleaner air. It was called the Shoreham nuclear power plant. It was fully operational and about to go online, producing more than 800 megawatts of power.</p>
        <p>It was closed by pressure of environmentalists who considered the plant dangerous, even though not one American has ever been injured by a nuclear power plant. It was closed even though it would have resulted in cleaner air, producing no greenhouse gases or acid rain. Officials said we would never need the additional power that Shoreham would produce.</p>
        <p>If Shoreham were now operational, we would have more electricity, cleaner air and no debt for paying for a plant never used. The people who railed against Shoreham are the ones responsible for the problems we now face.</p>
