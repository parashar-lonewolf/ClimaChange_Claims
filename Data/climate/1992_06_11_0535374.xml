        <p>Only a year after claiming his role as leader of the new world order, President Bush leaves Thursday for Brazil and an Earth Summit where opposition to his environmental policies threatens to produce the kind of embarrassing diplomatic wrangles that marred his recent trade mission to Japan.</p>
        <p>But White House advisers, reflecting both Mr. Bush's ideological opposition to regulation and the realities of campaign politics, say that Mr. Bush is determined to take full election-year advantage of his uncomfortable new role, in which he is seen by many as global environmental spoilsport.</p>
        <p>The White House said today that Mr. Bush would speak "hard truths" in defense of the American environmental record on his two-day visit to Rio de Janiero for the United Nations conference. Senior officials predicted the President would offer a blunt defense of his stands on major issues that have drawn critical fire at the summit.</p>
        <p>Criticism has focused on opposition by the United States to firm timetables for curbing carbon dioxide emissions associated with global warming and on its refusal to sign a treaty to protect plants and animals. Both these positions are in disagreement with Japan and European nations.</p>
        <p>The United States has also been assailed by poor countries who charge that Washington should come up with more money to help them pay for programs to protect their environments.</p>
        <p>In Rio today, negotiators said they were nearing agreement on a multibillion dollar accord in which industrialized nations would help pay for environmental efforts in the developing world.  [ Page A9. ]</p>
        <p>Countering the criticism, the Administration argues that the environmental records of some of prominent foreign critics, who are already complaining about United States' bullying and indifference to global concerns, would collapse under close scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush finds himself in this position because of the trade-off he made by placing economic and political needs, rather than diplomatic or scientific concerns, at the center of Administration's environmental stance. In addition, because of budget restrictions, the Administration believes that it cannot afford to come up with the multibillion-dollar aid packages that are being proffered in Rio by Japan and European countries.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, moreover, Mr. Bush's words and his environmental positions are attuned to the political base of party loyalists and Reagan Democrats -- particularly those in the Sun Belt and the Rockies -- that swept two Republicans into the White House, and who are now being seduced by the pro-business oratory of Ross Perot. The President's Role</p>
        <p>As a result, on the eve of his arrival in Rio de Janiero for the United Nations conference, the President finds it difficult to cast himself in the role he prefers -- that of the unifying leader of "the sole remaining superpower" who is glad to serve as the rallying point for lesser and more timid nations.</p>
        <p>In effect, Mr. Bush is expected to argue in Rio that on matters of global warming, endangered species, forest conservation and aid to poor nations' environmental programs, the world is marching out of step with Washington, and not vice versa.</p>
        <p>By playing to the hilt the role of global maverick, aides to the President say, Mr. Bush hopes to display a brand of tough leadership that will play extremely well at home, especially in an election that features the tough-talking Mr. Perot. But Mr. Bush, in taking this line, also risks a repeat of the sort of clumsy and fractious disputes that marked his politically embarrassing mission last January to Japan, in which Japanese leaders rejected American demands for trade concessions and the President collapsed from stomach flu at an official dinner.</p>
        <p>"There isn't any question that we don't have a great record on the environment, a first-rate record on the environment, the best record in the world," Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, said Wednesday in defining the current White House line. "For the United States not to go to Rio and talk about the best record in the world would defy logic."</p>
        <p>A second senior official later added: "To the extent it's a benefit from a political aspect, that's pure gravy."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush arrives in Rio late on Thursday evening after an all-day flight that will take him first to Panama for a speech and a meeting with President Guillermo Endara, who replaced Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as that nation's leader in 1989.</p>
        <p>In Rio, the President will sign a treaty setting out first steps to curb warming of the Earth's atmosphere and will make a brief speech to the Earth Summit audience before dining on Friday with President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil. He will hold meetings and a news conference before returning to Washington late Saturday or early Sunday.</p>
        <p>Political and policy aides to Mr. Bush insisted this week that his unyielding stances at the Rio summit were driven more by ideology than by political calculus, and that those stands have been widely misread both by diplomats and the world's press. Questions of Money</p>
        <p>In either case, it is clear that the White House currently lacks either the political mandate or the national resources to play the role that Mr. Bush has relished in past foreign crises.</p>
        <p>Financially, the Administration believes that it cannot afford to sign on to the most dramatic proposals at Rio even if it wanted to. The multibillion-dollar infusions demanded to address poor nations' environmental problems, and which Germany, Japan and some other Western nations are touting, neither exist in America's strapped treasury nor could pass political muster if they did.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Bush's aides and political advisers privately express fury that the United States is being pilloried at the Brazilian summit by its longtime allies for refusing to commit to actions that they argue are not just unattainable, but often hypocritical.</p>
        <p>"Japan's out there killing whales and running driftnets, for God's sake, while we've got the world's toughest environmental laws and we're twisting ourselves into knots over how many jobs to abolish to save a subspecies of an owl," fumed one Republican adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And these guys presume to lecture us about environmental responsibility?"</p>
        <p>The differences between American and European and Japanese positions on the environmental issues arise from more than a willingness to spend money. The summit has demonstrated that on environmental issues, American allies analyze the issues differently, seeing environmental problems as an opportunity and challenge. German and Japanese companies stand to gain, for example, from the development of "clean" technologies that could be adopted throughout the world.</p>
        <p>The White House has decided to try putting Mr. Bush on the offensive in Brazil in an effort to reap whatever political benefit can be extracted from the trip. Officially, Mr. Bush's re-election campaign has taken no role in that decision, but his political advisers are openly pleased by it.</p>
        <p>"This is what leadership is all about -- standing up for what's right and doing the best thing for all Americans," the campaign's spokeswoman, Torie Clarke, said.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Bush's advisers believe his unyielding stances will yield benefits where the President most needs them: among conservative ranchers, miners and businessmen in the Rocky Mountains and points west who have long been a Republican bulwark. Adjusting His Dialogue</p>
        <p>The President has recently adjusted his dialogue to stress disgust with environmental advocates and his insistence that curbs on pollution and development will not come at the cost of jobs. Speaking in Fresno, Calif. two weeks ago, he charged that environmentalist critics of his Earth Summit positions are "extremes" who want to "shut down" American society.</p>
        <p>"I don't think the issue is whether the rest of the world agrees with the decisions of George Bush," Steven Goldstein, the spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel J. Lujan, said. "The issue is whether George Bush will insure that economic factors are taken into account in these environmental decisions. And that may not play well in Managua, but it plays extremely well in Ogden, Utah."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush nevertheless comes to Rio not as the accomplished leader of cold war coalitions, but as a head of state who is at loggerheads with much of the rest of the planet on the most basic initiatives of the United Nations summit.</p>
        <p>Showing a personal interest on the subject, he singlehandedly forced negotiators to excise from the global warming treaty any reference to deadlines for capping emissions of pollutants. His refusal to sign the treaty increasing protection of endangered plants and animals is based on the claim that the treaty infringes on patent rights and contains open-ended financing commitments. Opposition to a Deadline</p>
        <p>The President's aides argue that both actions have been widely misread. The United States opposed a deadline on reducing emissions of global warming gases, they say, because the deadline was unattainable and because only two nations -- the United States and the Netherlands -- had prepared any blueprint for cutting those emissions.</p>
        <p>The treaty that Mr. Bush effectively dictated, and which he will sign in Rio on Friday, sets no deadline for cutting emissions but does require every nation to devise an "action plan" for reducing pollution, and to report regularly on whether that plan's goals are being met.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides also argue that the United States has rightfully rejected the second treaty, covering endangered species, because it surrenders control over World Bank environmental funds to an undefined melange of treaty-signing nations, and because it undercuts American patent laws and business practices.</p>
        <p>Even the Administration's harshest critics allow that those claims have merit. But even some of its supporters agree that the White House has been unusually obstinate, grasping at fine points of principle and refusing to accept concessions that could have eliminated the objections to both documents.</p>
        <p>Administration officials attribute the President's stance ultimately to a longtime struggle within the Administration between environmental moderates and a passionate band of conservatives who view the Earth Summit as a scientifically fraudulent and economically disastrous venture.</p>
        <p>The conservatives, mostly in Vice President Dan Quayle's office and in economic policy posts, have captured the high ground and Mr. Bush's favor in many recent debates. They are backed by other conservative strategists like Interior secretary Lujan, for two decades a Congressman from New Mexico, who see environmental policy as a way for Mr. Bush to win back Western conservatives who are deserting him.</p>
