        <p>Senior Bush Administration officials gave the President a list of options today from which to fashion a comprehensive national energy strategy.</p>
        <p>The 60-plus options, which involve everything from car mileage standards to hydroelectric dams, are the product of nearly 18 months of interagency work coordinated by the Energy Department and supervised by the President's Economic Policy Council. They options also represent perhaps the most ambitious energy study ever conducted by the Government.</p>
        <p>But critics say the decision to offer the President a menu of options rather than overall strategy recommendations constitutes a significant retreat from the goal Mr. Bush seemed to have in July 1989, when he ordered the study. Framework for Legislation</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush declared then that the United States could not and would not wait for another energy crisis to find a solution to the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil. The study was supposed to provide a framework for energy legislation that the President would submit to Congress in early 1991.</p>
        <p>While that is still the idea, energy experts on Capitol Hill fear that unless clear objectives and coordinated solutions quickly appear, it will be difficult to build Congressional support.</p>
        <p>The decision to take a more piecemeal approach apparently came at the insistence of the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, an engineer and a candidate for Energy Secretary 10 years ago, who did not like the path the early thinking was taking and decided the White House would put together its own strategy.  Little Urgency Seen</p>
        <p>But by all accounts, including drafts of the study that have circulated throughout the energy and environmental community, President Bush heard little that is new in the ideas for promoting energy supplies and reducing demand. And he does not seem to have injected the project with much urgency, even though nearly 400,000 American troops are deployed in the Persian Gulf, which holds about two-thirds of the world's oil reserves.</p>
        <p>Some of the most bitter feuding within the Administration has occurred over efforts by the Office of Management and Budget to pre-empt decisions in matters like subsidies for rural electrification and rates charged by Federal power agencies, by putting economic considerations ahead of energy concerns. Mr. Sununu and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, are also said to be at odds with senior officials in the Energy Department, including Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.</p>
        <p>In an interview this week, the Deputy Energy Secretary, W. Henson Moore, acknowledged the friction, calling it a useful part of the process. "It's healthy that you have a debate like that," he said.  Options Aren't Ranked</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Moore added, the 60-odd options were not ranked for the President but were grouped according to the degree of endorsement.</p>
        <p>One group of options consists of those approved in all quarters; it is believed to include a recommendation that regulatory impediments be removed to the use of more natural gas. A second group consists of options supported by some Bush operatives and opposed by others; this is thought to include the idea of opening up various offshore and wilderness areas to oil and gas drilling.</p>
        <p>A final set of options will be presented as those recommended by none of the officials taking part, Mr. Moore said. Among these, no doubt, is a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on motor fuels mentioned in at least one draft.  Environmentalists Disturbed</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, critics and skeptics have assailed the priorities that seem to be emerging from the process, with environmentalists and those who favor greater reliance on alternative fuels voicing the strongest concern.</p>
        <p>Public Citizen, an advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader, this week called the options "a politically expedient response to the Persian Gulf crisis that lacks any long-term vision and will result in continued energy waste and environmental destruction." The group said it deplored any options that would seek to revive nuclear power and further entrench fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal.</p>
        <p>Whatever Mr. Bush decides to order from the options is not expected to become known for several weeks. A decision may emerge either piecemeal or full blown in budget proposals and the State of the Union Message in late January.</p>
        <p>At the moment, however, many fear that while the Administration has briefed Congress on the list, it has done little else to smooth the way for passage of an energy bill.</p>
