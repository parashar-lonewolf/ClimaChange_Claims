        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Op-Ed, Nov. 24) notes the threat to our national security caused by our reliance on fossil fuels. This vulnerability cannot be solved by more domestic production. That's why any credible energy plan must steadily reduce our fossil fuel consumption. Increasing the fuel economy standard would be a useful initial step.</p>
        <p>Beneficial energy plans would include measures to nurture energy resource diversity, promote energy efficiency and conservation, and ensure that the full social and environmental costs of energy use are included in its cost.</p>
