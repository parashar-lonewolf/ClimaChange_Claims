        <p>"SPRING scares me," confides a friend. "Everything pulsating. All the longer daylight means to me is that I have to lower the window shades earlier to watch TV." Many urban souls thrive on winter depression, enjoying the flu as an excuse to cuddle under covers, popping cough drops and videocassettes. One recent afternoon, several city friends refused to accompany me to the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, saying they didn't care to "see everything in bloom, looking, you know, so hyper-real and computer-enhanced."</p>
        <p>I understand. Spring can be pushy. I myself prefer a moody day, wind-whipped and gray, to visit the garden, before the true, manic spring begins, with the overloud bird chirping and all the rest. So I rushed up before most of the buds could open and too much pollination was under way. There were spores in the air, to be sure, but germination was discreet and I had the muted experience I craved, and more.</p>

        <p>"SPRING scares me," confides a friend. "Everything pulsating. All the longer daylight means to me is that I have to lower the window shades earlier to watch TV." Many urban souls thrive on winter depression, enjoying the flu as an excuse to cuddle under covers, popping cough drops and videocassettes. One recent afternoon, several city friends refused to accompany me to the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, saying they didn't care to "see everything in bloom, looking, you know, so hyper-real and computer-enhanced."</p>
        <p>I understand. Spring can be pushy. I myself prefer a moody day, wind-whipped and gray, to visit the garden, before the true, manic spring begins, with the overloud bird chirping and all the rest. So I rushed up before most of the buds could open and too much pollination was under way. There were spores in the air, to be sure, but germination was discreet and I had the muted experience I craved, and more.</p>
        <p>What I wanted was just a bit of spring. A touch of color. A faint stirring in the earth. A delicate show of proof that even in 1991, when the world and the weather seem so out of whack, life can renew itself, and me along with it. (It was always nice to commune with nature, but now with oil fields blazing in Kuwait and other ecological disasters, it would be understandable if nature no longer wanted to commune with us.)</p>
        <p>I arrived on the eve of what the New York Botanical Garden staff calls its "renaissance," for April 28 marks the Centennial Celebration, a century since the Pierre Lorillard estate was dedicated as a scientific organization and a garden open to the public. My visit was a literal return to my roots, for as a child I spent many an enchanted afternoon in the garden. I may also have felt a generational tug, for my grandmother practically lived in the Botanical Garden on and off from 1920 until 1945.</p>
        <p>Advised by her doctor "to move to a hot, wet climate," she moved instead into one of the hothouses, where she kept regular hours nearly every day during those years. She sat on a bench in the Fern Forest, writing in her journal. The notebooks still feel damp and her purple handwriting seems to seep from the page, as her thoughts were recorded in the high humidity.</p>
        <p>"We still have a lot of weirdos who come every day," reports Marilyn Ratner, public relations coordinator.</p>
        <p>And I'm becoming one of them. Perhaps it's genetic, but I fell instantly under the spell of the garden.</p>
        <p>It had been 30 years since my last visit when, one raw morning, I boarded the 15-seat white van that stops in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to pick up bucolically inclined passengers for the $7 round trip. On this particular run, I was the lone passenger. The soft-spoken driver, Thomas Hartfield, says it is still early in the season. He resumed the shuttle service on March 1, and often in cold weather he has made the trip alone, shuttling himself to the Metropolitan and the American Museum of Natural History, before returning, still alone, to the garden. "People think the Botanical Garden is like the Bahamas or something," says Mr. Hartfield, "that it's got to be hot to go. But it's not so." Mr. Hartfield himself says he likes to wander the 250-acre preserve "to go off into a twilight zone by myself."</p>
        <p>The shuttle ride was itself soothing, taking the Henry Hudson Parkway, alongside a white-capped river, and cutting diagonally through Riverdale to reach the garden. At the entrance to the garden, I held my breath: Would it have deteriorated, become weed-choked, neglected? Not at all. The garden appeared more pristine than ever, completely fenced off from the surrounding cityscape. The grounds were still the subtle gray and mauve of earliest spring, hemmed by a deep shadow that led to corridors of evergreen in the wild 40-acre parcel that is referred to as "the last remnant of the forest that once covered New York."</p>
        <p>The very phrase "the forest that once covered New York" put me into a rustic trance. I glimpsed the footpaths, trod by moccasined Indians. There was the New York that was meant to be, a forest primeval with glacial boulders and towering, ancient trees. "We have trees that are from the 17th century," says the president of the garden, Gregory Long. Mr. Long, who came to the garden from the New York Public Library only two years ago, has vowed to "make the garden more user-friendly."</p>
        <p>The problem has been fear. "People are afraid to come to the Bronx," admits Mr. Long, but he insists that the garden is safe. And if attendance is any indicator, many people seem to agree. More than 500,000 visitors passed through the garden's gates last year, up about 25 percent from 10 years earlier, according to Carl Lauby, director of public relations.</p>
        <p>"We have brilliant security," Mr. Long says. "We hired a man from the zoo, who brought things under control there. And we have a great dog." The dog, Kato, a German shepherd, provides at least what Mr. Long calls "a visual and audial deterrent." Security patrols constantly circle the completely fenced-in grounds, Mr. Long says. The bottom line is, he says, "there is virtually no crime in the garden." The staff members are so convincing, I begin to feel I am safer in the Botanical Garden than in my own apartment. To listen to the staff, I could probably run naked as a naiad on the fountain, except then I'd be arrested by security.</p>
        <p>"The misfortune," explains Mr. Long, "is that one of our entry routes is off the Bruckner Expressway, the same exit taken in 'The Bonfire of the Vanities,' " a detour that led Tom Wolfe's protagonist into a Bronx hell.  "I prefer to tell people to go up the Henry Hudson. It's a much gentler approach, with the view of the river, and it's actually faster; there's less traffic." By Foot or Tram</p>
        <p>To further his dream of making the garden more "user friendly," Mr. Long has begun to clean up the cute little 1910 railroad depot that serves as the Metro-North stop, across from the main garden entrance, and he has banned autos from the main roads, instituting instead a white 45-seat covered tram that circles the garden, dropping visitors off at the various points of interest. These points themselves are pictured on a new map, which also gives walking times (20 minutes to the Snuff Mill year-round restaurant). Mr. Long stresses "the pedestrian experience" -- pedestrian in the best sense, because only on foot can one pick up the scent, and see the subtle changes in the flowers and foliage.</p>
        <p>I take a walking tour of the Thomas Everett Rock Garden, which is ideal for a muted spring experience. There are no loud, flamboyant blooms, only shy alpine flowers, and brave little crocuses, poking up through the gravel. There is an unusual feature: a series of water basins, called a moraine, which provides a habitat for the shyer alpine flowers.</p>
        <p>Richard Schnall, the vice president of horticulture, gives me a tour of the garden, and tells me that city pollution may have actually spared the garden, by providing a "gray belt" of death that no parasites could survive. "The Japanese beetles couldn't make it across the Bronx River Parkway to eat our roses," he reports. "And you should have seen our dogwoods; we had the only dogwoods. The blight couldn't get in here." He does remark, sadly, that there are signs of "urban grime" but adds that the plants are generally thriving.</p>
        <p>So if the first mild day of spring brings you no pleasure but only grim proof that global warming is under way, you might benefit from a visit to the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory where "the other greenhouse effect" is under way. The other greenhouse effect is nothing short of ecstasy, brought on by the exotic displays. Beside the Still Waters</p>
        <p>The conservatory is a Victorian glass palace, the crystal dome of my childhood reveries. Its exterior is now slightly peeling, which for me adds to its charms, "but we want to repaint," says Ms. Ratner. Outside the conservatory are two reflecting pools, Tropical and Temperate. Off season, the pools are dormant, gray, but they still lure me: I want to lie down beside their still waters, rest my tired head near some dead lily pads. I understand why Oliver Sacks, the famed physician and author ("Awakenings"), says he is a daily visitor to the garden "for sustenance." There is a sacred near-silence.</p>
        <p>I enter the Palm Court, which is eerily as I remember it, down to the graffiti scratched on a palm frond -- "Manny-Brooklyn-1957." Here are one-quarter of all the species of palms on our planet. Some are a century old. I look up -- something there is that is cheered by the sight of a coconut. I learn, from the placard, that "coconuts come in threes."</p>
        <p>On a chilly day the conservatory alone provides a thrilling visit. One is warmed by the hot temperature inside and the startling entertainment value of the plants. "We try to put out plants that will do things," explains Ms. Ratner, pointing out the plant of the week, a Vietnamese voodoo plant, also known as "the devil's tongue" (Latin name: Amorphophallus Rivieri). The sign promises that the plant, with its inflamed red bloom, will emit "a foul carrion odor." I lean forward and sniff -- it certainly does emit a foul, carrion odor. I reel back.</p>
        <p>In another gallery, Furcraea selloa, a member of the agave family, brings back the legend heard here in my childhood -- that every hundred years, the plant sends forth a shoot so long, so violent that it breaks through the roof. It's true, and the garden keeps several agaves on hand so that you may luck out and see a roof-opener on the day of your visit. Spores Are in the Air</p>
        <p>There are 11 galleries in the conservatory; a gallery for every plant fetishist. If you are a type that prefers parched plants, you can choose between Old and New World deserts. A neck-craner? You can head for "the hanging gardens." But for the "Green Mansions" type, it is best to head straight for the intense world of the Fern Forest, where ferns and orchids seem to grow, visibly, in the sexual mist. A mini-rock mountain rises, supporting more jungle-style foliage, and my heart hammers in the old childhood excitement. In my head, I even hear the old childhood chant: Mogambo, Mogambo. Here is my Emerald Forest, the enchanted realm of all my fictional friends -- Tarzan, Rima, Sheena and Kim. All are alive in here. One can even see fernlets, plant embryos, clinging to their mother ferns. You can practically see them propagate. Spores are in the air. This gallery is ideal for lovers, who might sink to the loamy, scented soil and give in to nature on the spot (but it's against the rules). You can, however, be legally married here (for a nice, healthy contribution in five figures). Weddings are held inside the conservatory at night by candlelight and with music. I yearn to be wed, right here, even though I am already married.</p>
        <p>Ah well. Perhaps my daughter. Here among the ancient palms, the 900-million-year-old fossil (a cycad that looks like a vegetable brain), one cannot escape a sense of both mortality and immortality that is, well, Wordsworthian. "The whole place is Wordsworthian," says Mr. Long.</p>
        <p>I ask: can I be buried here? The answer is: "No. But there may be a way to plant a tree in your memory."</p>
        <p>Fine. I'll take it. In the meantime, one should high-tail it to the Bronx and experience firsthand "the splendor in the grass" and "the glory in the flower." For even the most jaded urban dwellers, like bulbs, can be forced to bloom. HOW TO GET THERE AND WHAT TO SEE</p>
        <p>The New York Botanical Garden is at 200th Street and Southern Boulevard in the Bronx. By car, it can be reached by taking Southern Boulevard, south of Mosholu Parkway, which is easily accessible from the Bronx River Parkway. Visitors can also take the Metro-North Commuter Railroad; the garden is 20 minutes from Grand Central Terminal and a round-trip ticket, which includes admission to the conservatory, is $7 ($5 for the elderly and $2 for those 5 to 11 years old). Information: (212) 532-4900.</p>
        <p>In addition, a shuttle bus runs on days the garden is open; the first bus from Manhattan leaves at 9:30 A.M. from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and makes a stop at 9:45 at the American Museum of Natural History. It continues throughout the day, making stops at these locations approximately every 2 1/2 hours. The last bus to leave the garden departs at 5:45 P.M. The bus is $7 round trip. Reservations are necessary: (212) 220-8700.</p>
        <p>Garden grounds are open from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. Tuesdays through Sundays; Enid A. Haupt Conservatory hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesdays through Sundays.</p>
        <p>Admission to the garden is by donation. Admission to the conservatory: adults, $3.50; students, those 6 to 16 years old and the elderly, $1.25. Parking is $4. Annual memberships, at $35 for individuals and $45 for families, include discounts in the shops and reduced rates to many events. Information: (212) 220-8700 or (212) 220-8777.</p>
        <p>These are some of the weekend events at the garden:</p>
        <p>TOMORROW AND SUNDAY: Daffodil and Magnolia Weekend, featuring 10,000 daffodils representing 200 varieties. Star and saucer magnolias will line Magnolia Way. Also the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory Festival will feature lectures, tours and demonstrations relating to the exhibition "Gertrude Jekyll: An English Flower Garden" in the conservatory. The exhibition on Jekyll, the English garden designer, runs through May 19.</p>
        <p>APRIL 13 AND 14: Environmental Fair, with free guided tours and recycling and conservation demonstrations.</p>
        <p>APRIL 20 AND 21: Cherry Weekend, featuring the blossoming cherry trees throughout the 250-acre garden. Events on April 20 include performances by Asian dance troupes and ikebana and origami demonstrations.</p>
        <p>APRIL 27 AND 28: Tulip and Salad Gardening Weekend, starring 25,000 tulips. A selection of salad gardening plants will be for sale.</p>
        <p>APRIL 28: Centennial Celebration. This is the big day, when staff members will be costumed as the founders of the garden, including Nathaniel Lloyd Britton, Cornelius Vanderbilt and others.</p>
        <p>MAY 4 AND 5: Azalea Weekend, featuring the garden's assortment of azaleas.</p>
        <p>Sunday Afternoons in the Garden, a series of informal presentations on the world of plants at 1:30, 2:15 and 3 include:</p>
        <p>THIS SUNDAY: "A Taste of the Tropics," on exotic fruits and nuts.</p>
        <p>APRIL 14: "Birds of a Feather," on bird calls and the role of birds in the environment. WHERE TO EAT</p>
        <p>Grazing can take on new meaning when you munch alfresco amid all the exotic flora. The two places to eat at the New York Botanical Garden offer much the same fare: "Younger than springtime" salads, fresher than one would expect. The reason: the proprietor fetches fruits and vegetables from the Hunts Point Market, a kiwi toss away. After grazing, browsing may be in order at the garden's shop.</p>
        <p>THE TULIP TREE CAFE: Near the Main Garden Gate (the one opposite the Metro-North station) is an outdoor cafe with umbrella tables and banners hanging from the Museum Building. A charming spot that recalls the salad days of the 1970's at Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. A spectacular bronze fountain, alive with mythical beings, is running again for the first time in many years ("We got it to gurgle," says Gregory Long, president of the garden).</p>
        <p>SNUFF MILL: A charming 1840 mill, left over from the original Pierre Lorillard estate. Here, the Lorillards ground their tobacco leaves with their own rose petals for a custom blend of snuff. A pleasant thought as one orders a kosher frank or a tuna salad, the two most popular items on the snacky menu. Service is cafeteria style but the setting is straight out of George Eliot. The Mill dining patio flanks the Bronx River, which is surprisingly clear and bubbling with Bronx energy over a waterfall. "We've gotten rid of Styrofoam, and gone to paper for cups and plates," Mr. Long says.</p>
        <p>THE SHOP-IN-THE-GARDEN: Spring fever may strike when you go on a manic shopping spree in the Shop-in-the-Garden, situated in the the Museum Building. Here there are beautiful white leather gardening gloves (you will feel like Deborah Kerr), charming watering cans, cute hose faucets with crouching frogs and hummingbirds perched on them. But the big sellers are the books and the flowering plants. If you can't hotfoot it up to the Bronx, there is a sister shop in the I.B.M. Building, 590 Madison Avenue at 57th Street in Manhattan. Small sacks of soil ("We don't call it 'dirt' ") sell for $3.</p>
