        <p>A Skeptical Europe Awaits Bush on 5-Day Trip  President Bush will arrive tomorrow in Spain to begin a five-day trip across Europe, where there is little love of America's new president and a growing perception that the United States, under his leadership, is looking out only for itself these days -- polluting the skies, breaking treaties and flirting with new arms races.</p>

        <p>Challenge From Iran Reformists  Supporters of President Mohammad Khatami's attempts to create a freer Islamic republic said his re-election victory should prompt his conservative opponents to reassess their bids to frustrate change.</p>

        <p>Storm's Toll Is High In Texas and Louisiana  Storm-weary Houston residents emerged from waterlogged homes to face highways littered with jackknifed 18-wheelers, roads lined with abandoned cars and trash, and whole neighborhoods under water. Tropical Storm Allison, which hammered the Texas and Louisiana coastlines for nearly a week, left at least 16 people dead, nearly $1 billion in estimated losses, and about 10,000 homes and 5,000 buildings damaged.</p>

        <p>U.S. Lags in Climate Science  In little more than a decade, the United States has fallen significantly behind other countries in its ability to simulate and predict long-term shifts in climate, according to a wide range of scientists and recent federal studies. President Bush plans to use a Rose Garden speech on global warming policy today to propose several ways to improve the situation, government officials say.</p>

        <p>Oklahoma City After Bombing  Of the myriad ways the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building transformed Oklahoma City, perhaps one of the most unexpected and surprising is that the city is now a tourist attraction. The inevitable tension -- the fine line between remembrance and exploitation -- is hardly lost on residents.</p>

        <p>Timothy J. McVeigh, who killed 168 people in the bombing, spent his last full day of life in a 9- by 14-foot prison holding room only steps away from the death chamber in Terre Haute, Ind., writing letters, and waiting. He was in ''amazingly good spirits,'' one of his lawyers said. ''Quite frankly, he is ready to die.''</p>

        <p>Hog Farmers' Last Stand  For a coalition of small, independent hog farmers in the Midwest, a mandatory fee assessed on hog sales that produces money for advertising pork has grown from an irritant to an emblem of a last stand against the rapid consolidation of agriculture and agribusiness that they say is driving them out of the business.</p>

        <p>Boot Camp for Conservatives  The art of selling conservatism as compassion is taught in Arlington, Va., a few miles from the White House, at boot camp for young conservatives who aspire to power.

        <p>Pataki Sets Green Goals For New York State  Governor Pataki ordered that state buildings get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources like solar or wind power by 2010, an effort that environmentalists lauded as the most ambitious of its kind in the country. He also appointed a task force of industry leaders, state officials and environmentalists to find ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in New York, to combat global warming.</p>

        <p>Puerto Rican Day Parade  The parade, in its 44th year one of New York City's largest events, swept up Fifth Avenue in a clamorous display of ethnic pride and surging political power that drew an estimated two million enthusiastic spectators and was watched over by 6,000 police officers. The extraordinary police presence had been assigned to deter any recurrence of the violence that followed last year's parade.</p>

        <p>A Network With Chinese Ties  Phoenix Satellite Television could begin broadcasting its Chinese-language news channel in Taiwan as early as July, if it wins government approval.
