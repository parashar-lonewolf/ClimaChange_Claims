        <p>Top prize in team category of 2004 Siemens Westinghouse Competition in Math, Science and Technology is awarded to Yueqi Guo and Xianlin Li, classmates at North Carolina School of Sciences and Mathematics in Durham, for their project on cancer detection; Aaron Goldin of Encinitas, Calif, takes top prize in individual category for his gyroscope that converts energy from ocean waves into electricity (S)</p>

        <p>Yueqi Guo, a 17-year-old senior at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Durham, grew up hearing that her grandfather in China had died because doctors failed to recognize his cancer until it was too late.</p>
        <p>''I never got a chance to meet him,'' said Ms. Guo, who goes by the name Lucie. ''He died as a result of the lack of technology there.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Guo completed a summer program at a Duke University breast cancer research lab, she and a classmate, Xianlin Li, decided to continue pursuing new ways to detect cancer. Their work earned top honors -- and $100,000 in scholarship money -- yesterday in the team category of the annual Siemens Westinghouse Competition in Math, Science and Technology.</p>
        <p>Other winners in that category were Jessica Fields of Jericho High School in Jericho, N.Y., and Taylor Bernheim of Ramaz Upper School in Manhattan. Their research delved into the development of human tissue, searching for ways to induce regeneration. They will divide a $50,000 scholarship prize from the Siemens Foundation in Iselin, N.J., which named 18 winners at a ceremony in Washington.</p>
        <p>The research by Ms. Guo and Ms. Li presents potential biological markers for early detection of breast cancer. ''Mammograms detect breast cancer after it physically manifests,'' said Ms. Li, 17. ''This method could detect it before it manifests physically.''</p>
        <p>The winner in the individual category, and the recipient of a $100,000 scholarship, was Aaron Goldin, a senior at San Dieguito High School Academy in Encinitas, Calif., who took the top prize for inventing a gyroscope that converts energy from ocean waves into electricity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldin, 17, , said he was motivated by concern over the finite supplies of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>The organizers and financial supporters of the Siemens Westinghouse contest said they hoped the prizes would attract students to fields that are not necessarily priorities for many American teenagers.</p>
        <p>Of the 18 finalists culled from 1,213 applications, 4 attend private schools and 14 attend public schools.</p>
