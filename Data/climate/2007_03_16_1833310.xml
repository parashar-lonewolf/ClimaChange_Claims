        <p>HANDLING BAD NEWS How do medical device manufacturers react when they start receiving reports of injuries caused by their products? Some case studies are revealing. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>BID FOR THE BOARD OF TRADE The Intercontinental Exchange surprised financial markets by making an unsolicited $10 billion bid to wrest the Chicago Board of Trade away from its planned merger partner, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. [C1.]</p>
        <p>FOR THE PLAINTIFFS Richard F. Scruggs, the trial lawyer representing homeowners seeking money to pay for Hurricane Katrina damage, is folksy and smooth as molasses in court. He has turned the case into a financial and public relations nightmare for the insurance industry. [C1.]</p>
        <p>G.M. WARNS ON ACCOUNTING General Motors, a company once known as the model of corporate accounting, warned investors that its performance was threatened by ''ineffective'' controls over financial reporting. [C3.]</p>
        <p>CADBURY TO GO TWO WAYS Cadbury Schweppes, which is based in Britain, said that it planned to split off its American beverage unit, which makes Dr Pepper and Snapple drinks, from its candy businesses, after pressure from shareholders. Separating the businesses would help Cadbury focus on its confectionary unit, which analysts consider to be the center of the company. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A GAUGE OF INFLATION GOES UP Prices rose broadly and sharply for businesses in February as an array of goods, from children's toys to tobacco, became more expensive. [C3.]</p>
        <p>OPEC WON'T INCREASE PRODUCTION OPEC ministers said that they would keep oil production at current levels, despite calls to pump more supplies into an increasingly tight market. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A CODE FOR HEDGE FUNDS The finance minister of Germany said that he favored the development of an internationally accepted ''code of conduct'' for the $1.4 trillion hedge fund industry. [C2.]</p>
        <p>RETURNS VS. CONSISTENCY Many of Silicon Valley's technology investors have proclaimed their passion for alternative energy, seeking innovations that use ethanol, solar and wind. But a number of them have also invested in companies that promote fossil fuels -- the source of many of the problems their other investments are meant to fix. V.C. Nation. [C1.]</p>
        <p>A CATCHY PHRASE? PRICELESS Madison Avenue's ability to contribute phrases to the vernacular -- think ''the pause that refreshes'' or ''where's the beef?'' -- is becoming more valuable as so-called buzz marketing or word-of-mouth marketing grows increasingly important to advertisers. [C4.]</p>
        <p>TRIBUNE OFFER LOSING FAVOR A proposal from Sam Zell, the Chicago real estate billionaire, to purchase the Tribune Company is falling from favor, according to people close to the situation. [C4.]</p>
        <p>TWO BANKS, ONE PARTNERSHIP Carver Federal Savings Bank, the country's largest black financial institution, and Merrill Lynch have struck an unusual alliance that will provide the Wall Street firm entree into minority neighborhoods. [C7.]</p>
        <p>MARKETS OVERCOME INFLATION DATA Stocks managed a moderate advance as signs of strength in corporate takeover activity, jobs and overseas markets allowed investors to stomach a sharp rise in wholesale inflation. [C6.]</p>
        <p>NEW PIPELINE BYPASSES BOSPORUS Russia, Greece and Bulgaria signed an agreement to build a 175-mile oil pipeline bypassing the crowded Bosporus in Turkey. [C2.]</p>
        <p>GAME ON Sony's PlayStation 2 has lost its stature in the gaming world to more advanced (and expensive) machines. But a new game for the PS2, called God of War II, is perhaps the best single-player action-adventure game yet made for any console. A review. [E27.]</p>
        <p>COLLEGES AND LOAN COMPANIES Dozens of colleges have accepted financial incentives -- including cash payments and expense-paid trips -- from student loan companies to steer student business their way. [A16.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>ALL ABOUT EXECUTIVE PAY The chief executive at Berkshire Hathaway took home the same $100,000 in 2006 that he has been earning for 25 years. More coverage of executive pay packages and interactive features are in a special section on the executive pay at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>RECONSIDERING THE BYPASS After more than a decade-long decline, is bypass surgery poised for a comeback? An article and audio slide show are at nytimes.com/health.</p>
        <p>EAT YOUR GREENS Restaurant owners are finding ways to handle the garbage and mess of a professional kitchen while reducing the effects on the environment. A special section on business and the environment is at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>Business Briefing</p>
        <p>Articles on these developments are at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>SHAREHOLDERS OF THE CVS Corporation, the drugstore chain, voted yesterday to approve the company's $23.9 billion plan to buy pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx. (REUTERS)</p>
        <p>NETSMART TECHNOLOGIES may not poll shareholders on a $115 million offer to sell out to private equity firms until it tells investors more about how the software company was shopped, a Delaware judge ruled. (AP)</p>
