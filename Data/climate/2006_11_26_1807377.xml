        <p>IT was supposed to be the dawn of a new era.</p>
        <p>In the 1990s, Connecticut, like many other states, radically restructured its electricity system. Public officials discarded the century-old notion that electricity is a ''natural monopoly.'' Instead, they embraced the notion that new technologies, market forces and the breakup of utility monopolies would reshape the electricity industry for the better. Consumers, they predicted, would soon enjoy the fruits of a deregulated electricity market: more choices, lower rates, even a cleaner environment.</p>

        <p>IT was supposed to be the dawn of a new era.</p>
        <p>In the 1990s, Connecticut, like many other states, radically restructured its electricity system. Public officials discarded the century-old notion that electricity is a ''natural monopoly.'' Instead, they embraced the notion that new technologies, market forces and the breakup of utility monopolies would reshape the electricity industry for the better. Consumers, they predicted, would soon enjoy the fruits of a deregulated electricity market: more choices, lower rates, even a cleaner environment.</p>
        <p>It hasn't worked out that way. Rates in Connecticut and elsewhere have been going up -- about 25 percent in the past year alone for many consumers. Choice is almost non-existent. And Connecticut's oldest and dirtiest power plants remain on line. Consumers are starting to take notice. Recent rate increases in Illinois and Maryland set off political storms. A similar reaction is looming in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The mess can be traced to two high-stakes bets made at the outset of restructuring -- both of which have been losers.</p>
        <p>First, restructuring advocates gambled that competitive markets would open the gate to a flood of new, low-cost power. Initially, they were right -- nearly 20 percent of Connecticut's electric generating capacity has been built since 2000. Almost all of that new capacity, however, in Connecticut and nationwide, was powered by natural gas, driving up demand for the fuel. When North American production of natural gas couldn't keep pace, prices for both natural gas and electricity spiked.</p>
        <p>Burned by their experience with natural gas plants, and lacking certainty about the future direction of the market, investors shied from building new power plants. This has led grid operators like ISO New England, which is desperate to keep power flowing, to use incentive payments to encourage power plant construction. Those new payments will cost Connecticut ratepayers $800 million over the next four years alone.</p>
        <p>The second bet was that new competitors would enter the retail electricity market, offering more choice to consumers. Competitive markets for large consumers did arise in some states, but few companies have sought the business of homeowners and small businesses. In Connecticut, while consumers do have some new choices, including the option to buy ''green power,'' the vigorous retail market envisioned by restructuring supporters never came to be. Only a small number of residential consumers have actually switched providers.</p>
        <p>If Connecticut is to serve electricity consumers well, policymakers must digest the hard lessons of restructuring and chart a new course for the future.</p>
        <p>First, they must accept the fact that retail competition for small consumers simply isn't going to happen, at least not on terms beneficial to consumers. Utilities will have to continue providing power to most consumers for the foreseeable future. That means we should shift from short- and medium-term purchases on the wholesale power market -- which have saddled consumers with rates that are both high and volatile -- to an approach that favors long-term planning and stable, affordable rates.</p>
        <p>Second, it's time to recognize that merely building power plants isn't a solution. Plants were constructed haphazardly in the late 1990s and early 2000s and, as a consequence, wound up tying electricity prices to the whims of the natural gas markets. Now, just a few years later, we're faced with a projected shortage of power.</p>
        <p>It's time for a new approach. Connecticut needs a balanced mix of energy resources to fulfill its power needs. A good model can be found in neighboring Rhode Island. A new law there requires utilities to develop purchasing plans to procure power for consumers at the lowest possible cost. Utilities will be required to invest in energy efficiency -- for example, by providing incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances and industrial equipment -- whenever such investments are cheaper than the cost of power on the open market. To improve stability and reliability, utilities must use a mix of energy resources, including energy efficiency, locally generated power and renewable energy.</p>
        <p>This comprehensive approach is a long way from the ''hands off'' approach to planning and purchasing taken by Connecticut and other states during restructuring. But we've learned over the last decade that we cannot count on market forces alone to deliver clean, reliable and reasonably priced electricity to consumers. With thoughtful planning, and by taking advantage of clean, efficient resources wherever we can, Connecticut can ensure that we have enough energy to keep our economy running while preventing runaway rate increases for consumers.</p>
