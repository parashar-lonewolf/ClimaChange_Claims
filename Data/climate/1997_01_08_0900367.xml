        <p>A three-way race to conquer the last great goal of balloonists -- a non-stop voyage around the globe -- began inauspiciously yesterday when the first of this year's contenders, a giant British balloon, decided to make a forced landing in Algeria today, less than a day after its three-man crew launched it from Marrakesh, Morroco.</p>
        <p>The 195-foot-high Virgin Global Challenger successfully ascended and climbed to 30,000 feet, but 16 hours later its captain, Richard Branson, 46, radioed that the balloon had lost so much helium that it could not possibly complete the trip. He therefore decided to land in Algeria and end the attempt.</p>
        <p>Two other balloon teams remained on the ground awaiting favorable weather to try the daunting trip, one from Switzerland and another from the United States. The Swiss captain, Dr. Bertrand Piccard, and the American balloonist who planned to fly solo, Steve Fossett, both said they would make their attempts regardless of the fate of the British balloon.  The unsuccessful effort of the Virgin Global Challenger was the latest in a long series of failures by other balloons to make the trip, and underscored the difficulty of long-distance ballooning. Though balloonists have repeatedly crossed both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, all efforts to circle the earth have failed, including some by balloonists who earlier made transoceanic flights.</p>
        <p>The most common reason, which apparently accounted for the latest fiasco, has been leakage of lifting gas from the gossamer-thin plastic sheeting from which long-duration balloons are made. Despite reinforcing tape that strengthens balloon envelopes, they are easily damaged by strong winds and the twisting of cables. Balloons have also come to grief because of freezing conditions at high altitude that jam vital valves and disable pumps.</p>
        <p>Even flying within the jet streams at speeds greater than 100 miles an hour, a balloon would need a minimum of about 12 days to fly around the world, and many accidents can happen. In his attempt last year, Mr. Fossett had problems not only with loss of lift but also with electrical power, and he narrowly escaped having to ditch in the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Each time a plastic (polyethylene) balloon is torn or damaged it must be replaced, and these balloons are expensive, in some cases a quarter million dollars or more.</p>
        <p>The captain and main financial backer of the unlucky Virgin Global Challenger is a veteran balloonist.  Mr. Branson, 46, is chairman of the Virgin Group of Companies, which owns Virgin Airways.</p>
        <p>The two other teams were awaiting improved weather conditions before launching. One, a two-man team headed by Dr. Piccard, 39, a Swiss psychiatrist and balloonist, is ready to begin its journey from Chateau d'Oex in Switzerland. The other will be flown solo by Mr. Fossett, 52, a Colorado investment banker, who is ready to launch his balloon from a stadium at St. Louis, Mo. The three crews were not racing against each other, and no prize or trophy awaits the winner, apart from a place in the record books.</p>
        <p>But the glory of being first to circle the world in a balloon is the last great goal of the world's aeronauts, and many millions of dollars have been spent on unsuccessful efforts in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Aside from the formidable technical problems of keeping a huge manned balloon in the air for up to three weeks, the two remaining teams face discomfort and may encounter danger if they enter the airspace of certain countries, notably Libya, Iraq, Iran, China and North Korea.</p>
        <p>Each of the crews regards the potential hostility of frontier troops in these or other countries as the most serious danger they face.</p>
        <p>In 1995, during a balloon race in Europe, a hydrogen-filled balloon piloted by two Americans strayed across the Polish border into Belarus and was shot down by a Belarussian helicopter. Both balloonists were killed, casting a pall over international ballooning, including round-the-world projects.</p>
        <p>To a certain extent a balloon pilot can set a course by rising or descending into wind streams going in the desired direction. But in general balloonists are at the mercy of prevailing winds and can wander dangerously off course.</p>
        <p>Before its difficulties, the Global Challenger was completing systems tests at various altitudes. David Partridge, the project manager, had said the balloon was nearing its point of entry into the jet stream some 34,000 feet up, where strong eastward winds were expected to accelerate it to speeds up to 250 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>In 1987 Mr. Branson acted as co-pilot of his Virgin Atlantic Flyer, which became the first hot-air balloon to cross the Atlantic. In 1991, flying another balloon, he crossed the Pacific from Japan to Canada. He is married and has two children.</p>
        <p>The second member of the crew  was Per Lindstrand, 46, the Swedish founder and president of Lindstrand Balloons Ltd. of Oswestry, England, the company that built the Virgin Global Challenger. Mr. Lindstrand, who has two children, is also a veteran of several transoceanic balloon flights.</p>
        <p>The third crew member, Alex Ritchie, 50, a mechanical engineer, was a last-minute replacement for Rory McCarthy, who became ill.</p>
        <p>Another competitor, Mr. Fossett, plans to fly his relatively small and crudely equipped balloon without help. Weather permitting, he hopes to launch his Solo Spirit soon from St. Louis, and he said yesterday that his balloon was ready to ascend from Busch Stadium as soon as the winds are favorable.</p>
        <p>A third competitor in the grueling race will be the Breitling Orbiter, built with the backing of the Swiss watchmaking company Breitling.</p>
        <p>Its pilot, Dr. Piccard, is a champion hang-gliding pilot. Dr. Piccard is the grandson of Auguste Piccard, inventor of the ''bathyscaph'' deep-sea submersible, who was also the first person to ascend into the stratosphere. His balloon with its pressurized capsule rose to 51,774 feet on May 27, 1931.</p>
        <p>Dr. Piccard's father, Jacques Piccard, built and piloted a submersible that still holds the depth record of 35,815 feet.</p>
        <p>Dr. Piccard will have one fellow crew member on the Breitling Orbiter, Wim Verstraeten, a professional balloonist from Belgium. Dr. Piccard and Mr. Verstraeten won the first trans-Atlantic balloon race in 1992, and they plan to begin their round-the-world attempt in the next few days from Chateau-d'Oex.</p>
        <p>The three balloons competing this year are all held aloft by helium gas supplemented during the chill of night flying by hot air. Helium and hot air are contained in separate balloon chambers.</p>
        <p>At night and in cold conditions, helium contracts and loses lift, and a balloon depending on helium alone must drop ballast to keep from descending. But a balloon with hot air and helium need not carry much ballast, since it can make up for lost helium lift by heating air with propane burners.</p>
        <p>The three balloons are very different from one another, though.</p>
        <p>The Virgin balloon is large enough to carry a large, pressurized crew capsule, in which three men can travel fairly comfortably. Fresh air is continuously pumped under pressure into the capsule.</p>
        <p>The Breitling balloon is smaller. Its capsule lacks an air pump, so its two-man crew is compelled to breath oxygen from tanks and to remove stale carbon dioxide from the air with an absorbent filter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fossett's Solo Spirit has a capsule barely large enough for one man. It is completely unpressurized, so Mr. Fossett will have to fly at lower altitudes than the others.</p>
