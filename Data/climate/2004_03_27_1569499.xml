      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial contends that Environmental Protection Agency Admr Michael Leavitt has two excellent opportunities to improve Bush administration's dismal record on clean air issues; says first is to overhaul his agency's pallid proposal to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, and second is to strengthen companion proposal aimed at reducing smog and acid rain by making major reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions</p>

        <p>Michael Leavitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has before him two excellent opportunities to improve the Bush administration's dismal record on clean air issues. The first, which he seems willing to grasp, is to overhaul his agency's pallid proposal to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The second is to strengthen a companion proposal aimed at reducing smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>The mercury proposal, largely assembled before Mr. Leavitt took office in November, is most in need of repair. Mercury is a dangerous contaminant that usually enters the food chain through fish; the country's 1,100 coal-fired power plants produce 48 tons of it, about 40 percent of the nation's industrial mercury pollution, every year. The administration's proposal aims at a 30 percent reduction in power plant emissions by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018, mainly through a market-based trading system that would let companies choose to reduce their own emissions or to buy credits from other companies.</p>

        <p>Michael Leavitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has before him two excellent opportunities to improve the Bush administration's dismal record on clean air issues. The first, which he seems willing to grasp, is to overhaul his agency's pallid proposal to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The second is to strengthen a companion proposal aimed at reducing smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>The mercury proposal, largely assembled before Mr. Leavitt took office in November, is most in need of repair. Mercury is a dangerous contaminant that usually enters the food chain through fish; the country's 1,100 coal-fired power plants produce 48 tons of it, about 40 percent of the nation's industrial mercury pollution, every year. The administration's proposal aims at a 30 percent reduction in power plant emissions by 2010 and a 70 percent reduction by 2018, mainly through a market-based trading system that would let companies choose to reduce their own emissions or to buy credits from other companies.</p>
        <p>These targets seem impressive. But they are less ambitious than the goals the Clinton administration had in mind when it left office and less ambitious than the alternative strategies presented by the E.P.A.'s professional staff, whose views were largely ignored in the final draft. The plan is weak for the same reason that most of Mr. Bush's environmental initiatives are weak: it was drawn up largely by the agency's political appointees, who in turn took their cue from the power companies and from their allies in the White House and on Vice President Dick Cheney's staff. Indeed, several paragraphs in the proposal were lifted verbatim from memos written and supplied by industry lobbyists.</p>
        <p>In addition to the proposal's dubious pedigree, Mr. Leavitt has also discovered that even the target of 70 percent cannot be achieved because of quirks in the proposed trading system. So he is now promising a new or amended version. By all accounts, he is going about it the right way (consulting his experts, for once) and asking the right question: what can industry reasonably be expected to achieve with current technologies without going broke? And what he's likely to find is that the power companies can afford bigger reductions on a quicker timetable.</p>
        <p>The same message applies to the other proposal on Mr. Leavitt's desk, a rule aimed at major reductions in sulfur dioxide, a component of acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to both smog and acid rain. This is a generally good proposal. The Adirondack Council says that the reductions the plan calls for -- 70 percent drops for each pollutant by 2015 -- will end the scourge of acid rain in the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>This would be a huge achievement, but here again the cuts could be faster and deeper. Earlier this month, North Carolina became the first Southern state to ask the E.P.A. for relief under the Clean Air Act from pollution that blows in from out of state -- a problem the Northeastern states have been trying to address for years. North Carolina's petition could give Mr. Leavitt the leverage he needs with the administration to get a stronger proposal.</p>
