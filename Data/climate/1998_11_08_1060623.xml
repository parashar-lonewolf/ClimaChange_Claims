        <p>Article describes working relationship between US Senators from New York Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, Republican, in wake of announcement that Moynihan is retiring at end of his term and D'Amato losing re-election bid to Repr Charles E Schumer (M)</p>

        <p>One is a towering Democrat with a mane of white hair, the other a medium-built Republican with a bald pate. One speaks in the pinched cadences and flowery language of the university, the other in the earthy phrases and nasal tones of Long Island subdivisions. One spends his spare moments writing books and giving lectures, the other raising campaign cash and playing cards.</p>
        <p>It would be hard to find an odder couple in the Senate than Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York's four-term Democrat, and Alfonse M. D'Amato, the three-term Republican. And so it seems only fitting that events last week should herald the end of their Congressional careers in distinctively different ways.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. D'Amato was soundly defeated by Representative Charles E. Schumer after one of the loudest, most passionate and expensive campaigns in state history. Just three days later, Mr. Moynihan announced that he would avoid the threat of a primary challenge and retire when his term ends on Dec. 31, 2000.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato went down fighting until the end; Mr. Moynihan offered little emotion or fanfare, just a straightforward, ''It's time to go,'' spoken softly to a handful of reporters in separate conversations.</p>
        <p>Yet for all their obvious contrasts, Mr. Moynihan and Mr. D'Amato had a strikingly cooperative working relationship for most of their 18 years together in the Senate. They frequently shared credit for legislation and budget items, helped win approval for each other's judicial nominations, defended each other against criticism, went out of their way to attend joint news conferences and did almost nothing to help their parties oust the other from office. Their alliance was stronger than that of many same-state senators from the same party.</p>
        <p>But it would be wrong if history remembered the Moynihan-D'Amato era simply as a time of remarkable cooperation between a seemingly ill-matched couple. In truth, they worked well together largely because of their differences.</p>
        <p>Nowhere was that clearer than in the realm of politics. Mr. D'Amato was the master builder and paramount leader of New York's Republican Party, which, at least until Tuesday, was considered among the most efficient and powerful political organizations in the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato influenced local and state politics to a degree unmatched by perhaps any other senator in modern American history, helping elect a governor, several Congressmen and dozens of local officials. Most of those people remained loyal to Mr. D'Amato, doling out jobs and contracts to his friends, allies and contributors, and fighting for his re-election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan, on the other hand, is almost a party unto himself. Though he is fond of recalling how he cut his teeth on the brawling clubhouse politics of Hell's Kitchen five decades ago, Mr. Moynihan has had little to do with the state Democratic Party since.</p>
        <p>He despises fund-raising, and so never raised much money for anyone, including himself. He has focused almost entirely on global affairs and domestic policy, caring little for the hand-dirtying work of selecting candidates, punishing enemies and resolving intraparty feuds.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. D'Amato, who fought ferociously to insure that an obscure State Senator named George E. Pataki would receive the Republican nomination for governor in 1994, Mr. Moynihan rarely took sides in a Democratic primary fight until this year, when he supported his old friend Peter Vallone in his doomed candidacy for governor.</p>
        <p>Yet despite his lack of party involvement -- or, perhaps, because of it -- Mr. Moynihan was a vote-getting machine, having set the record for margin of victory in a New York Senate race in 1988.</p>
        <p>Ever the pragmatist, Mr. D'Amato understood that toppling Mr. Moynihan would have been difficult at best, foolhardy at worst. Ever the diplomat, Mr. Moynihan did little to make his colleague ever consider it.</p>
        <p>Odd as it might sound for a man who wore his partisan loyalties on his sleeve, Mr. D'Amato clearly recognized the value of having strong ties to prominent Democrats in a state where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by a ratio of 3 to 2.</p>
        <p>So it was that Mr. D'Amato frequently invoked Mr. Moynihan's name on the campaign trail this year, whether in Rochester or Nassau County, recalling their joint efforts to get acid rain legislation, protect state transportation funds and oppose the Clinton Administration's attempts to rescind Federal Medicaid funds.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Moynihan, to the dismay of many Democrats, obligingly went along. When Mr. D'Amato held news conferences in Washington to promote legislation that was important to his campaign this year, Mr. Moynihan often attended. And when environmental groups accused Mr. D'Amato of masquerading as a defender of the environment, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff, Tony Bullock, came to the junior Senator's defense.</p>
        <p>None of this is to suggest that Mr. Moynihan was not a loyal Democrat. He was concerned about the Republicans winning a filibuster-proof, 60-seat majority in the Senate this year. And he seemed genuinely pleased about Mr. Schumer's victory, saying he would feel more secure about retiring knowing that the state's next senior Senator would be a Democrat.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moynihan also believed deeply in bipartisanship, even when the concept seemed so out of vogue in recent years. In a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. D'Amato simply could get things he could not, like additional money for mass transit this year.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Moynihan has commented on the importance of close cooperation between senators from the same state, particularly given New York's declining power in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato, who in his autobiography warmly described Mr. Moynihan as a friend, statesman and scholar, tends to be less theoretical than the senior Senator. In an interview five years ago, for example, he offered this bare-bones assessment of their relationship, ''We don't get in the way of each other,'' he said.</p>
