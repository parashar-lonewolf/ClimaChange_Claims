        <p>Industrial and developing countries agreed in Paris this week to establish a new fund within the World Bank devoted to protecting the global environment.</p>
        <p>The United States, which had resisted the formation of such a fund, has now conditionally agreed, Bush Administration and bank officials said today.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, a three-year pilot program would provide $1 billion to $1.5 billion for projects like preserving tropical forests and biological diversity, protecting the marine environment and promoting the efficient use of energy to slow global warming.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the fund said it would help build environmental concerns into the development process in the poorer countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Development in many if not most of these countries now emphasizes rapid industrialization, economic growth and export expansion without regard to the effect on ecological systems.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Environmental Program and the United Nations Development Program will help oversee the new fund, a World Bank statement said today.</p>
        <p>The United States, which had hedged on supporting the establishment of such a "green window" inside the World Bank, agreed in Paris to back it, said Leandro Coronel, a bank spokesman. Bank's Record Criticized</p>
        <p>An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said the United States' support of the fund was a conditional compromise.</p>
        <p>One condition, he said, was that any contributions to environmental projects beyond what the United States is now contributing to the World Bank would be made through the United States Agency for International Development rather than through the bank.</p>
        <p>Another condition was that loans to developing countries for environmental purposes could be forgiven only if the benefits of the loan were global in scope as opposed to benefiting only the receiving nation.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups in this country, however, strongly oppose entrusting the fund to the World Bank. They contend that the bank, despite protestations of concern for the environment, continues to back ecologically destructive projects like broad-scale lumbering operations.</p>
        <p>Larry Williams, director of the Sierra Club's international program, said, "Environmentalists all agree that a green fund is desperately needed to help the developing countries deal with their environmental problems. We are, however, extremely concerned about the World Bank's ability to manage such a fund, given its dismal environmental record."</p>
        <p>"We would much prefer a fund be established and operated either by another existing international agency or possibly by some new entitity," Mr. Williams said. He added that the environmental groups may soon come up with their own proposals for establishing a fund for dealing with global environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Glenn T. Prickett, a research associate of the Natural Resources Defense Council, asserted that the World Bank "has not shown a real interest in working with environmental groups and the public in the developing countries to see that its projects in those countries are environmentally sound."</p>
