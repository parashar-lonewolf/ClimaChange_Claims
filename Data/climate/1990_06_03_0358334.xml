        <p>LEAD: In summertime, when the livin' is easy, the drinking should be, too. Hearty wines, robust wines, complex wines - they are for long winter evenings, important dinners and serious guests. Summer is the time to drink wine, not think about it.</p>
        <p>In summertime, when the livin' is easy, the drinking should be, too. Hearty wines, robust wines, complex wines - they are for long winter evenings, important dinners and serious guests. Summer is the time to drink wine, not think about it.</p>
        <p>Well, that's not quite accurate. Let's think about it now, so we won't have to later on. It is in summer, more than any other time of year, that we tend to drink wine as an aperitif. Yes, of course, wine is meant to go with food. But there are lazy afternoons when a beer would be too heavy and the occasion calls for something more than a cold soda.</p>
        <p>Are there wines that can stand alone on such occasions? Now more than ever before. Probably the best all-around wine for warm-weather drinking is a good chardonnay - in particular, the California-style chardonnay, with lots of rich flavor, good body and a hint of sweetness that enables it to stand by itself.</p>
        <p>Many white wines tend to lose their character when chilled, but a good chardonnay, like a good Sauternes, can stand up to the cold, which makes it an ideal wine for hot summer days. I'm not suggesting that you add ice cubes, although there are knowledgeable people who do, but you needn't fear bringing a good chardonnay down to the point where it is icy cold.</p>
        <p>Most of the world's best white table wines, with the exception of riesling and gewurztraminer, are made from chardonnay grapes, but not all of them qualify as sipping wines. The best whites of Burgundy, for example, along with genuine Chablis, are made from chardonnay grapes but are meant to be drunk with food. Australian chardonnays, Long Island chardonnays and a few from Italy - although most of them tend to be expensive - are California-style chardonnays and thus can stand alone.</p>
        <p>If any group of wines can compete with the chardonnays, it is Germany's rieslings. The complex aromas and tastes, even in a simple riesling, are a delight, and a great German wine, with its intriguing interplay of a more intense natural sweetness and acid, is a truly memorable experience. However, the superb qualities of the traditional German riesling have gone mostly unrecognized by a generation of wine enthusiasts. (There has been some experimenting with very dry style rieslings in Germany in recent years in response to a market that seems to prefer a drier taste.) Perhaps if we think of these as aperitif wines, they will make more sense to our seemingly jaded palates.</p>
        <p>Besides those of Germany, some of the loveliest rieslings come from Alsace, in France. The Alsatians manage to vinify their rieslings so that most of the sweetness but none of the flowery bouquet and rich taste are lost. The same is true, only more so, with the Alsatian gewurztraminers. These extraordinary wines are truly delightful as aperitifs. In fact, I find it difficult to think of many foods they complement. There is a school that says gewurztraminer is perfect with Chinese food. I think it's somewhat of a waste, paired with egg rolls or Sichuan chicken.</p>
        <p>Rieslings from other parts of the world never seem to match those of the Rhine and Mosel valleys in Germany or the slopes of the Vosges mountains in France, where the Alsatian wines are produced. There are a few decent rieslings made in the Italian Tyrol and, of course, Austria makes some excellent wines from these grapes. Unfortunately, the Austrian vintners are still trying to recover from a scandal a few years back when large amounts of their wines were artificially sweetened. California produces both rieslings and gewurztraminers. They can be pleasant enough, especially the sweet, late-harvest wines, but few of them ever display the intensity of the German and Alsatian wines. For one thing, the California climate is too hot.</p>
        <p>The favorite sipping wine in recent years among those who follow the latest fashions in ''pop'' wines has been white zinfandel. ''Pop,'' or popular, wines are wines or wine products (the wine cooler is another example) favored by consumers who don't usually drink much traditional, dry table wine. White zinfandelwas invented, if that's the word, some years ago as a way of using a currently unpopular red-wine grape to satisfy the apparently insatiable demand for white wine. Skilled wine makers separate the skins of the grapes, which produce the color, from the pulp and juice to make a nearly white wine. (The white in the name is a misnomer: The wine is a pale rose; some people call it a ''blush wine.'') White zinfandel is sweetened in various ways, sometimes by the addition of muscat wine, sometimes with partially fermented grape juice, and made slightly fizzy by the addition of carbon dioxide. While there are reports that its popularity has peaked in some markets, millions of cases continue to be sold each year. In any case, anyone who is even slightly interested in better wine will prefer a good riesling, which is naturally sweet, to a made-up product such as white zinfandel.</p>
        <p>In the south of France and in other hot spots such as Italy, Spain, Greece and the Carribbean - wherever lots of wine is consumed - red wine is frequently diluted with water in the summer months, since water is a thirst quencher and wine is not. The water also serves to cut the tannins, which give red wine its character but make it harder to drink alone, without food. Beaujolais is about as close as most of us will ever come to a sipping wine that is also red - and is a good summer wine because it is uncomplicated and can even be chilled. Nevertheless, like all red wines, it is better with food.  For many people who can't decide between red and white, the solution is a rose wine - served chilled, of course. Sophisticated wine drinkers usually disdain roses because they are neither fish nor fowl. A genuine pink rose is made by removing the grape skins after partial fermentation, whereas many are made simply by mixing a white wine with a little red. (If it's cheap, it's probably the latter.) While most of the new breed of roses such as white zinfandel are somewhat sweet, true roses such as the Tavels from the Rhone Valley and the Anjous from the Loire are quite dry - as are the new Rhone-style roses from California. That means they are at their best when served with food. But if you find yourself in Cannes on a hot day in July, and you are people-watching on the Croisette, order a bottle. It won't affect your concentration and, if nothing else, it looks lovely in the glass.</p>
        <p>SIMPLY FOR SIPPING</p>
        <p>* Sundial Chardonnay, Fetzer, 1988. When it comes to an easygoing summer wine for lazy living, this remarkably low-priced wine from one of California's best-known wineries is hard to beat. Everything you want in a light chardonnay at an unbeatable price. $7.50.</p>
        <p>* Robert Mondavi Chardonnay, 1987. With all the talk of hot, new wineries, we tend to forget that - year in, year out - Mondavi chardonnays are consistently elegant wines. They display a Burgundian refinement while remaining true to their California heritage when it comes to taste. Will grace any warm-weather occasion, with food or without. $16.50.</p>
        <p>* Brown Brothers Chardonnay Reserve, Victoria, 1987. The Australians make chardonnay in the California style; in blind tastings it's not always easy to distinguish among them. But once you've tasted this particular wine, it won't be difficult to pick it out again. It's concentrated and full flavored. $15.</p>
        <p>* Gewurztraminer, Trimbach, 1987. At one time gewurztraminer was a cult wine; its fans kept it a guarded secret to keep the price down. Now the secret is out, and lots of people love this intensely flowery, almost spicy Alsatian wine. $8.50.</p>
        <p>* Gewurztraminer, Handley Cellars, 1988. Two can play at this game - countries, that is. California gewurztraminers have yet to reach the intensity and complexity of the Alsatian variety, but this one from Anderson Valley in Mendocino County comes close. If anything, it's probably a better sipping wine, because it's a bit softer. $7.50.</p>
        <p>* Riesling Rangen-Clos Saint-Urbain, Domaine Zind Humbrecht, 1987. In recent years, Leonard Humbrecht has emerged as one of the most talented of all Alsatian wine makers, and this single-vineyard riesling may represent the pinnacle of his craft. It's so rich, it would be a shame to do anything but sip it. A rare treat. $17.</p>
        <p>* Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett, J.J. Prum, 1985. The great sundial overlooking the Mosel near the storybook village of Wehlen gave this famous riesling from the most prominent producer in the region its name. This is a sipping wine par excellence, from one of the finest German vintages in recent years. $15.</p>
        <p>* Beaujolais-Villages, Georges Duboeuf, 1989. When in doubt, drink Beaujolais. It's the quintessential light red wine - great by itself, but perfect with hamburgers, summer salads, anything. It should be chilled, but not too much - 20 minutes in an ice bucket. $6.50.</p>
        <p>PRICES ARE FOR 750 ML. AND ARE APPROXIMATE.</p>
