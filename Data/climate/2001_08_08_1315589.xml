        <p>General Motors said today that it planned to develop and market fuel cells to heat and power homes and businesses by the middle of the decade to further a technology it expects to supplant the internal combustion engine.

        <p>''Our commitment is to drive towards significant volume, hundreds of thousands, by the end of the decade,'' Larry Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development, said at a major automotive conference.

        <p>General Motors said today that it planned to develop and market fuel cells to heat and power homes and businesses by the middle of the decade to further a technology it expects to supplant the internal combustion engine. But G.M., like other automakers, does not plan to introduce fuel cell vehicles to the public until at least the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>''Our commitment is to drive towards significant volume, hundreds of thousands, by the end of the decade,'' Larry Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development, said at a major automotive conference. ''It can change the world,'' he added. ''Automobiles can be reinvented around this technology.''</p>
        <p>A fuel cell generates electric power by separating the electrons from the protons of hydrogen atoms. The electrons generate a current, and then recombine with their protons, and with oxygen, creating water. Fuel cells are considered one of the cleanest ways of producing electricity because they emit water vapor and heat, although many fuel cells draw their hydrogen from methanol, gasoline or natural gas and do give off some pollutants.</p>
        <p>The first fuel cells were created in the 19th century. The technology was used on the lunar lander. And G.M. created the first demonstration vehicle powered by a fuel cell in the late 1960's. But while all the big car companies are working on fuel-cell powered vehicles, making them viable in mass-produced automobiles faces many challenges. Fuel cells contain expensive precious metals like platinum and palladium. They have not been shown to work in extreme weather. And the nation's gas stations would need to be reconfigured.</p>
        <p>Today, G.M. demonstrated a Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck powered by a gasoline fuel cell apparatus that took up less than half of the truck's bed, but the gasoline now available contains too much sulfur for it to be used to power the cell.</p>
        <p>G.M. said it plans to enter the home and business market through a partnership with one of the many companies developing fuel cells, but it has not picked a partner. But it has formed a partnership with General Hydrogen and Quantum Technologies, two companies making fuel cells or equipment for fuel cells, on auto-related projects.</p>
        <p>G.M. will enter an already crowded field developing fuel cell technologies that includes Plug Power of Latham, N.Y.; International Fuel Cells, a subsidiary of United Technologies; and Ballard Power Systems, a Canadian fuel cell company that has partnerships with the Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups praised any progress on fuel cell research but said it was another modest step and pointed out that G.M.'s announcement today came after its vigorous lobbying campaign that helped persuade the House of Representatives to exclude significantly tougher fuel economy standards from the new energy bill.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to stave off using technologies they do have now,'' said Ann Mesnikoff, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>''Fuel cells are a technology on the horizon,'' she added. ''But between now and fuel cells, there are dramatic improvements we can get.''</p>
        <p>Jason Mark of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group based in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''Gasoline could compromise the potential of fuel cells.''</p>
        <p>''There will be some emissions from the tail pipe, and the fuel economy might not be much greater than the hybrids available today,'' he added. ''So what's the point?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns of G.M. said the eventual goal was not a gasoline-powered fuel cell, but one that could power a zero-emission vehicle. The gas-powered cell would be an intermediate step and would, he said, improve typical gas mileage 50 percent. Toyota's Prius, a hybrid car that has an electric engine and a gasoline engine, is already in that ballpark. Mr. Burns also said that the gas-powered fuel cell would reduce carbon dioxide emissions 50 percent.</p>
