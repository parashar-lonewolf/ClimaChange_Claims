        <p>Every non-heavy metal band that appropriates metal's texture and volume must alter it: it's incumbent on them to shake off metal's brutish, dull-witted associations of the past for a discerning young audience. Nirvana had Beethovenian pathos, Soundgarden had slow and careful song hooks the size of continents.</p>
        <p>The New York band Helmet -- led by the singer and guitarist Page Hamilton, a bookish, unlikely hero to the audience that reads magazines like Metallurgy and Kerrang! -- has rhythm, and a brilliant sound mix. At Irving Plaza on Monday night, the audio was of such high quality that in Mr. Hamilton and Chris Traynor's mostly solo-less, clockwork guitar riffing, a listener could get beyond hearing the distortion as formalized aggression and experience it as tone color.</p>

        <p>Every non-heavy metal band that appropriates metal's texture and volume must alter it: it's incumbent on them to shake off metal's brutish, dull-witted associations of the past for a discerning young audience. Nirvana had Beethovenian pathos, Soundgarden had slow and careful song hooks the size of continents.</p>
        <p>The New York band Helmet -- led by the singer and guitarist Page Hamilton, a bookish, unlikely hero to the audience that reads magazines like Metallurgy and Kerrang! -- has rhythm, and a brilliant sound mix. At Irving Plaza on Monday night, the audio was of such high quality that in Mr. Hamilton and Chris Traynor's mostly solo-less, clockwork guitar riffing, a listener could get beyond hearing the distortion as formalized aggression and experience it as tone color.</p>
        <p>The precision wasn't just in the guitars. Helmet's drummer, John Stanier, has a style that's quantifiably different from heavy-metal drummers. It has the efficacy of funk, with a snare-drum sound pitched unnervingly high; it's metal that connotes anxiety rather than sloth or the usual dead-eyed anger.</p>
        <p>Helmet is 8 years old now. On a recent album, ''Aftertaste'' (Interscope), it has shaved off all experimentation to concentrate on the sleek clangor that's always been its best hand. And Mr. Traynor, a recent addition to the group, moves to the music as though he means it. This is a new development for a band that formerly had little discernible body language.</p>
        <p>But there's still a big difference between Helmet and heavy metal in what the band projects. Metal bands are larger than life: their function is to act out a crowd's fantasies of power, self-abasement or evil.</p>
        <p>The members of Helmet are blank slates who don't talk in between songs. Mr. Hamilton's lyrics are as pointedly oblique -- with moral judgments lurking underneath layers of cool -- as the apothegms adorning Barbara Kruger's artworks. ''The tic begins/where's the manner end?'' he shouted in ''Tic,'' a song that might be about the self-help or publicity industry -- the image-improvement business, at least. ''The climate change will never get in/silent and strong and prepossessed.'' Those might be pejorative words to Mr. Hamilton, but they described the clean, distilled, airless feel of his band.</p>
        <p>The Melvins, a decade-old trio from the Northwest with a small but dedicated group of admirers (Kurt Cobain was among them), opened the concert. The band is one of Helmet's models, and Helmet can sound like a higher-fidelity version of them. The singer Buzz Osborne has always had an anonymous voice and guitar style, but the band's wide-ranging set had personality. It was as well plotted as a ritual, with only the slightest pauses between songs. There were unpredictable juxtapositions of quick-tempo hardcore punk and Black Sabbath's sludgy acid-rock.</p>
