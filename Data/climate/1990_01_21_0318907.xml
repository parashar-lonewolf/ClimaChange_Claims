        <p>LEAD: UPON its return this week, the Senate will immediately face the moment of truth on strengthening the Clean Air Act, a goal that has eluded Congress for a decade.</p>
        <p>UPON its return this week, the Senate will immediately face the moment of truth on strengthening the Clean Air Act, a goal that has eluded Congress for a decade.</p>
        <p>Failure to act soon, the advocates of strong legislation warn, would condemn the nation to widespread deterioration of air quality.</p>
        <p>Some describe the stakes as even higher. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said Congress's ability to enact clean-air legislation this year is ''a test of our ability as a society to come to grips with problems that are part of what is now the most dangerous threat to our nation and our species.''</p>
        <p>Each year since 1980, legislators have tried to amend the law. Each year they have failed in the face of conflicting regional interests; powerful, well-financed opposition by industry and, during the Reagan years, a hostile White House.</p>
        <p>But President Bush, far from hostile, put forth his own broad proposal last year. Industry is still spending large amounts of money to fight specific proposals, but corporate leaders are taking pains to voice support for a stronger law. And while some Midwestern states that would bear a substantial economic burden continue to voice opposition, they are isolated politically.</p>
        <p>If, given the active encouragement of the President, the enthusiastic support of the majority leader and the Speaker of the House, the demands of the public for cleaner air and an industry that gives at least lip service to a more stringent law, Congress cannot pass strong legislation this year, it is hard to see how it could at any time in the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>''Who is going to vote for dirty air?'' asked Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate's environmental protection subcommittee.</p>
        <p>But there will be some obstacles. One is a dispute over costs and benefits that has already erupted here. On Friday, Mr. Bush sent a letter to Senate leaders warning that he could not accept a bill whose costs exceed those in his legislation. Administration officials said the cost of the Senate bill to industry and consumers would be about $40 billion a year by 2000. The President's bill, they contended, would achieve virtually the same goals for about half the cost.</p>
        <p>The House of Representatives must also approve legislation this year, and a House subcommittee has reached a compromise that removes one longstanding obstacle to action on auto emissions.</p>
        <p>The existing law has produced modest improvements in air quality and has held in check the clouds of pollution that would otherwise have been spewed into the atmosphere. But the statute, passed in 1970 and last amended in 1977, left some major pollution problems unaddressed and proved inadequate to deal with others.</p>
        <p>The Senate bill, like the President's legislation and a bill pending in the House of Representatives, would address several forms of pollution: Acid Rain The 1970 law required industry to clean up pollution in the immediate vicinity of its source. Many polluters, particularly big, coal-fired power plants, did so by sending emissions through tall smokestacks, which dispersed the pollutants over a wide area. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are transformed chemically in the atmosphere and return to earth as acidic rain, snow and dust. This pollution, much of it emanating from the Midwest, has been found to damage freshwater life and buildings in the Northeast and Canada, and it may be detrimental to human health.</p>
        <p>The Senate bill and the Bush legislation would require that by 2000, 107 big power plants in the Midwest reduce sulfur emissions by 10 million tons a year, or about half the amount they are now releasing. After that, total sulfur emissions could not exceed the levels of 1980. It would also require that nitrogen oxide emissions be reduced by 2 million tons by 2000, a somewhat deeper cut than envisioned by the Administration's proposal. The legislation would give utilities credits for reducing pollution below required limits, and these credits could be sold or traded to other polluters.</p>
        <p>Smog</p>
        <p>Volatile chemical vapors from auto exhaust and similar pollution from industrial and commercial sources, reacting with sunlight, create the smog that chokes many urban and suburban areas. Smog was limited by the law's requirements that car manufacturers install devices to reduce tailpipe emissions. But with a rapidly growing number of cars on the road each driving more miles, the requirements have proved inadequate. More than 100 major cities now exceed the maximum permissible smog levels at some point during the year.</p>
        <p>Under the Senate bill, car makers would have until 1995 to reduce their vehicles' hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions to levels currently required by California. They would have to make a second round of emissions cuts by 2000. The Administration called for only the first round of reductions but also proposed requiring auto makers to produce a certain number of cars that run on fuels that pollute less than gasoline.</p>
        <p>Toxic Chemicals</p>
        <p>The 1970 law called on the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate hundreds of dangerous chemicals such as benzene and butadiene. The agency has taken action on only eight chemicals, however, in part because the law's mandate is ambiguous and agency officials have been unable to devise an effective regulatory approach.</p>
        <p>The Senate bill would require polluters to install the ''maximum available control technology'' to reduce emissions of the 187 chemicals deemed most dangerous to health over the next seven years, twice the number of chemicals proposed by the Administration.</p>
        <p>Global Pollution</p>
        <p>The Senate bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by imposing stricter fuel efficiency standards on motor vehicles. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the industrial gases that scientists believe are causing long-term warming of the globe by trapping heat from the sun. The bill would also ban all emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that deplete the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>These provisions would add up to major progress in cleansing the skies. They also would cost a lot more than the $35 billion a year the country is currently spending to improve air quality.</p>
        <p>Corporate spokesmen and some Administration officials are saying the cost of the Senate bill would hurt industry's ability to compete in international markets.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be harsh, but that is a lot of nonsense,'' replied Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island and co-sponsor of the legislation. ''We will be able to keep a lot of people healthy by cleaning up the air and spend a lot less money on medical bills.''</p>
        <p>The American Lung Association issued a report on Friday that concluded that the health costs associated with air pollution are now $40 to $50 billion a year, more than the cost of the Senate bill. The association's estimate does not include the costs of damage to buildings, crops and forests.</p>
        <p>But the costs of the new requirements would fall unequally on different areas of the country and different industries. The brunt of the acid rain costs, for example, would fall on a handful of Midwestern states. The changes could cost jobs in states like West Virginia that produce high-sulfur coal. These states ask that the costs be shared by the whole country. States that have already reduced pollution demur, saying they should not have to pay for cleaning up a second time.</p>
        <p>Such issues will produce spirited debate. Some Senators have threatened to filibuster. It seems unlikely, however, that, after 10 years of spinning in place, Congress will fail to act on clean air now that all the political signs are in proper alignment.</p>
        <p>''If Congress doesn't succeed this time, I don't know what it will take for them to succeed in the future,'' said S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Control Officers. ''All that is left for them to do now is political posturing and horse trading.''</p>
        <p>A FEW ADJUSTMENTS ARE CALLED FOR</p>
        <p>If the Clean Air Act amendments now being taken up by the Senate become law, the effects would soon be visible in the lives of most Americans. Many proposals involve motor vehicles, which cause much of the nation's air pollution. Here are some likely repercussions:</p>
        <p>*  Electric bills for many customers in the Midwest would rise as public utilities are forced to install expensive scrubbers or shift from high-sulfur coal to more costly low-sulfur grades. There is some dispute over how much electric bills would go up, but in some cases the increase would be 20 percent or more.</p>
        <p>*  The price of automobiles would go up as new equipment required by the amendments to cut exhaust emissions and to recover gasoline vapors during refueling is installed. Estimates of the costs vary, but they would probably be about $250 per car by 2000, or, as a Senate staff aide noted, about the cost of one power window.</p>
        <p>*  Service stations would be required to install special suction devices on pumps, also to catch gasoline fumes.</p>
        <p>*  Cities that do not meet the standards on air quality would be required to set aside car pool lanes on the biggest commuter arteries. Employers would also be required to set up car pools.</p>
        <p>*  Large cities not in compliance with the air standards would have to switch their bus fleets to fuels like methanol or natural gas that pollute less than gasoline. The change would have to be accomplished by 1994.</p>
        <p>*  To reduce the carbon dioxide pollution that is contributing to the greenhouse effect, manufacturers would have to build cars that require less gasoline per mile driven. Each car-maker would have to achieve an average of 33 miles a gallon by 1996 and 40 miles a gallon by 2000. Auto fleets now average about 28 miles a gallon.</p>
