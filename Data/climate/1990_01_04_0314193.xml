        <p>LEAD: Following are excerpts from the text of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State address to the Legislature yesterday:</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from the text of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State address to the Legislature yesterday:</p>
        <p>Today we take the first steps into the last decade between us and the 21st century.</p>
        <p>From here, we can see the outlines of a bright and exciting new time of progress -for our state, our nation and the world beyond.</p>
        <p>You and I have been working together to prepare for this moment for seven years.</p>
        <p>In 1983, the first time I had the privilege of addressing you, the state was still feeling aftershocks of our economic crisis in the 70's. We had to close a potential deficit of nearly $2 billion.</p>
        <p>We knew, despite that, that if we were to make ourselves ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead, we needed to further reduce our state income taxes and to put more people to work. We knew we would have to rebuild roads and bridges, cleanse and preserve our environment, revitalize our schools, reorganize our criminal justice system and adapt our human services to new, rapidly changing realities.</p>
        <p>Crack and Violent Crime</p>
        <p>The challenge was actually even greater.</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, a terrible new drug, crack, appeared on the streets and brought with it a surge of violent crime. Homelessness appeared across the nation on a scale unseen since the Great Depression. The lethal syndrome, AIDS, spread with frightening effect.</p>
        <p>And just when we needed its help most, Washington withdrew resources that we required to deal with these problems. These were awesome challenges. But we were not intimidated. Nor did we use the Federal Government's failure to help as an excuse. Instead, you and I went to work. We put aside the unimportant differences between us, and developed a new, vibrant ethic of cooperation - a new sense of family. ...</p>
        <p>Together we produced the two largest tax cuts in our history and the lowest income tax rate in 30 years. ...</p>
        <p>Our investments in our fight against alcohol and drug abuse and related crime are up 400 percent. We nearly doubled our prison cells and developed the largest drug and alcohol treatment system in the nation, serving 100,000 people a day. ...</p>
        <p>We agreed we should lead in protecting the environment. Together we created the first controls on acid rain implemented in the nation; the first energy plan integrated with environmental needs; a huge environmental bond issue; aggressive recycling and landfill-control programs. Thousands of acres of our natural beauty acquired and preserved.</p>
        <p>There's more. Governments are often judged by the bricks and mortar they leave behind. By that measure, you - and I -would do especially well. We created a dynamic period of construction - nearly $50 billion worth of bricks and mortar. ...</p>
        <p>Washington now admits states have a cluster of extraordinary national problems like drugs and inadequate education. But Washington says it can't help with national resources because they must go to huge Federal income tax cuts that help a lot of people, mostly the richest. Actually, this only shifts the burden on to the states and the real-estate and sales taxes that hurt a lot of people, but the middle class and poor most of all.</p>
        <p>Large Potential Deficits</p>
        <p>That has hurt us. Now the weakness of the national economy is hurting us more.</p>
        <p>As a result, much of the Northeast, including New York, today faces large potential deficits.</p>
        <p>We will not have the revenues to satisfy all the demands upon us, or even our own desires. ...</p>
        <p>The Anti-Drug-Abuse Council headed by the Lieutenant Governor has submitted an excellent, comprehensive report.</p>
        <p>In recent days it has taken on new relevance because a number of well-known people have advocated legalizing drugs. . . .</p>
        <p>Let me say as clearly as I can: I reject this idea as the abandonment of a whole generation of children, and adults, now caught in addiction - and of generations to come as well. I would not do it to my children. We ought not let the state do it to our children.</p>
        <p>Instead of surrendering, I will recommend strengthening every part of our drug effort -law enforcement, education, treatment, prevention. My agenda in 1990 will include an unprecedented expansion of our alcohol and drug treatment capacity: 15,000 new residential treatment beds, and outpatient treatment for 20,000 additional people. We will give special attention to pregnant women and mothers with young children. ...</p>
        <p>Despite the immense resources we have committed, our health care system is hurting, and so are some of the people it is meant to serve.</p>
        <p>Reimbursement Rates</p>
        <p>We need new and better ways to deal with reimbursement rates, to ease health personnel shortages, to regulate the system, and to communicate with the men and women who make the system work.</p>
        <p>One thing is particularly apparent: adequate primary care in the community - prevention and early intervention - will reduce illness and help limit the overwhelming expense of hospital care.</p>
        <p>It's also clear that we must do more for the 2.5 million New Yorkers who are among the 37 million Americans with no health insurance of any kind.</p>
        <p>This year, in the third year of the Decade of the Child, I will propose a new program, a unique one, I believe. I call it New York Child, for children's health insurance for lifelong development. It will help cover every uninsured child in this state from birth through age 17, for primary and preventive care, and catastrophic illness. . . .</p>
        <p>I will propose as well, a neighborhood-based initiative to improve services for pregnant women, new parents and at-risk children in our most disadvantaged communities. ...</p>
        <p>I propose we try a new performance-oriented approach to public education: providing clear goals and effective measurement of student achievement; evaluating schools by improvement in student performance, and not by technical compliance with the words of state mandates. I will offer a program to demonstrate how this can work.</p>
        <p>Most Vulnerable People</p>
        <p>As we journey toward the next millennium, we must continue to serve the needs of our most vulnerable people.</p>
        <p>I will ask you for a new supplement to S.S.I. for persons with AIDS who are in special adult care facilities. We will expand prevention efforts for high-risk adolescents, women and young children; increase help for incarcerated or paroled persons with AIDS; and expand support for the community organizations, which serve as our front line of defense.</p>
        <p>And we have a solid new program this year, begun jointly by the state and H.E.L.P., Andrew Cuomo's not-for-profit corporation. It is the first public residential health care facility for persons with AIDS in the country. It will provide 66 beds. We will replicate this cost-effective prototype to create hundreds of other beds. ...</p>
        <p>As part of our long-term plan to assist the homeless mentally ill, we'll work with New York City to develop additional beds, including new S.R.O. and supported housing units, and we'll expand and improve services for people with disabilities. . . . ...</p>
        <p>I have asked our director of economic development, Vincent Tese, to invigorate our promotion of exports - emphasizing high technology and agriculture - and to expand our current international partnership program. Our extensive ''Global New York'' agenda will be a centerpiece of our work in the months ahead. ...</p>
        <p>I spoke earlier of all we accomplished in protecting our environment. It's time now for another solid down payment on a better and more beautiful future for the generations to follow us.</p>
        <p>We all agree on the importance of these things: helping local governments deal with solid waste; preserving environmentally sensitive lands, maintaining our magnificent parks and historic treasures. To do all these things, I will ask your support for a 21st century environmental bond issue of $1.9 billion. . . .</p>
        <p>Initiative and Referendum</p>
        <p>But let me mention a few more particulars:</p>
        <p>* Raising workers' compensation benefits and the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>* Extending - this month - the protections for Mitchell-Lama residents, or tens of thousands of people could lose their homes.</p>
        <p>* A strong law against bias-related violence. New ways to discourage investment in South Africa. A law banning assault weapons, and a law establishing life imprisonment without parole.</p>
        <p>As freedom and democracy are enjoying a rebirth around the world, we should strengthen them here, at the source.</p>
        <p>I will ask you to give New Yorkers an important extension of their right to participate in their government, with a limited initiative and referendum. It would require us to vote publicly - one way or the other - on proposals the citizens indicate by petition they believe to be particularly significant. ...</p>
        <p>If we only understand this bright new change fully and use it well, historians a hundred years from now will look back and write about the political miracle of the 20th century. ...</p>
        <p>Think of it. If we could reaffirm the notion of family and reject, as we always have at our best, the proposition that we can exist and thrive as a house divided - or a world divided, fractionalized - by sex, or nationality, or race, or color, or religion. If we could rouse ourselves from indifference toward the growing gap between our wealthiest and most fortunate citizens, and those who continue to struggle.</p>
        <p>If we could wean ourselves from a national addiction that has made our country the prime market for the world's drug trade.</p>
        <p>If all those who wound up in treatment centers or prisons were instead working in laboratories or factories or offices, using their gifts productively, helping themselves and the rest of us.</p>
        <p>Going Forward</p>
        <p>Imagine then, what we could do in this state, and in this nation.</p>
        <p>Then, someday, not too long from now, another governor could stand here and tell his audience - no, tell her audience - that we, the generations that endured depression and global war and the decades-long threat of nuclear destruction, never lost hope and never stopped going forward.</p>
        <p>That we took, always, as our continuing inspiration the words of a great New York poet, Walt Whitman, who beckoned us to come still further, by reminding us that ''the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.''</p>
        <p>Let us sing them, together.</p>
