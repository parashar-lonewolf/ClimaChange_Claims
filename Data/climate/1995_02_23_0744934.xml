        <p>It is very unlikely, scientists agree, that the precise chemical pathways from which life arose will ever be known. But it may at least be possible to identify some of the chemical steps that might plausibly have played roles in the origin of life, and three biochemists believe they have found just such a step.</p>
        <p>In a paper scheduled for publication today by the British journal Nature, those biochemists -- Dr. Stanley L. Miller of the University of California at San Diego and two associates there -- describe a way they have discovered to synthesize pantetheine from a mixture of chemicals not derived from a living organism.</p>
        <p>Pantetheine in the body is a precursor of coenzyme A, a substance that is essential to the metabolism of both simple and complex creatures and that plays a key part in building the chemical bonds that hold proteins together.</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that because coenzyme A is involved in so many fundamental enzyme reactions at every level of life, it must have become biologically important very early in the history of life.</p>
        <p>The object of Dr. Miller's experiment was to determine whether pantetheine (pronounced panta-THEE-een) could be synthesized reasonably easily from chemicals presumed to have existed before life began. His group found that the reaction from the mixing and warming of three such prebiotic chemicals -- pantoyl lactone, beta-alanine and a sulfur-containing compound called cysteamine -- yielded pantetheine, which is the major component of the coenzyme A molecule.</p>
        <p>"We cannot know whether this synthesis mirrors what actually happened at the dawn of life," Dr. Miller said, "but it looks like a possibility."</p>
        <p>His group found that the reaction that yielded pantetheine could be made to proceed at a temperature as low as 104 degrees Fahrenheit -- "a discovery," he said, "that came as a pleasant surprise."</p>
        <p>For 42 years, Dr. Miller has explored the chemistry of life's origins, sometimes with dramatic results. In a landmark experiment in 1953, when he was a graduate student of Dr. Harold Urey, he created a kind of genesis-in-miniature by passing an electric spark through a sealed glass vessel containing a mixture of simple gases: methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and water vapor. The ingredients reacted to form various amino acids, the molecular building blocks of proteins, which in turn are the building blocks of living organisms.</p>
        <p>Since then, Dr. Miller has created 13 of the 20 known amino acids, using laboratory apparatus containing different mixtures of gases possibly duplicating those of the earth's atmosphere some four billion years ago.</p>
        <p>In the latest experiment, Dr. Miller, Dr. Anthony D. Keefe and Gerald L. Newton dissolved the three reactant chemicals in water and then concentrated them by evaporation. They then heated the dry mixture, analyzed the result and found that they had synthesized a significant quantity of pantetheine.</p>
        <p>"Pantoyl lactone, beta-alanine and cysteamine are all extremely soluble in water," Dr. Miller said, "and that fact might have caused them to separate from less soluble compounds and become very concentrated in ancient lagoons where water evaporated."</p>
        <p>Dr. Miller concluded that pantetheine could have been a component of what he calls "the prebiotic soup," the solution of chemicals from which life spontaneously arose.</p>
        <p>Other biochemists are not in unanimous agreement with this interpretation. Another possibility was proposed in a comment published by Nature from Dr. James P. Ferris, a chemist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. "Perhaps," he wrote, "most coenzymes were not synthesized readily from their component parts on the primitive earth but are the products of an early form of life."</p>
        <p>In any case, the riddle of life's origin is shrouded in a myriad of mysteries besides the problem of coenzymes' creation. One mystery awaiting explanation is how enzymes themselves came into being, and how these complex proteins developed the ability to direct and control the synthesis of other proteins from simple amino acids. Another suite of mysteries has to do with the origins and evolution of two nucleic acids -- ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) -- which not only replicate themselves but also direct the assembly of proteins into complete living organisms.</p>
        <p>A few scientists, including Dr. Francis Crick of the Salk Institute in San Diego, who was the co-discoverer of the double spiral structure of DNA, believe that the creation of life was so complex that its seeds may have come to earth from some distant point in the universe. Dr. Miller and most other scientists, however, argue that this merely begs the question of life's chemical origin; the mystery is merely transferred from the earth to some other planet.</p>
        <p>"I don't want to exaggerate the importance of our work on the prebiotic synthesis of pantetheine," Dr. Miller said, "but it's another step toward understanding how life might have arisen."</p>
