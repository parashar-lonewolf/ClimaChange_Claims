        <p>LEAD: CAN America curb its addiction to fossil fuels?</p>
        <p>CAN America curb its addiction to fossil fuels?</p>
        <p>A decade ago, in the wake of the Arab oil embargo, the worry was dwindling world supply. Today, fears focus on demand.</p>
        <p>Oil, gas and coal will almost certainly be available in abundance well into the next century. But warming of the atmosphere caused by burning these carbon-based fuels in ever-growing quantities - the ''greenhouse effect'' - could prove catastrophic to the world economy. And while there may be plenty of opportunities for conserving energy and switching to non-carbon fuels, a new study by Donald A. Norman, an economist at the American Petroleum Institute, suggests that the costs of adjustment will be high.</p>
        <p>When oil prices took off in the 1970's, energy consumers went on a crash diet. Cars were downsized, houses insulated and basic industrial processes streamlined to reduce the proportion of heat going up in smoke. All told, the energy Americans use to produce a dollar's worth of gross national product has declined by 27 percent since 1974.</p>
        <p>That speedy fix, combined with a robust supply response from leading oil-exporting nations, made fools of energy Cassandras who forecast prices as high as $100 a barrel by 1990. And it left policy makers with the comforting impression that, should necessity dictate, the economy could always pull off another conservation miracle.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it could, Mr. Norman argues. But his statistical extrapolation suggests that it would not be easy. Mr. Norman estimated the demand for energy over the last 38 years, relating consumption to both prices and G.N.P. He then projected the increases in energy prices needed to contain consumption while the economy grows at a historically plausible rate of 3 percent annually.</p>
        <p>To induce sufficient conservation to hold energy use to 1987 levels in the year 2000, the average price of all fuels would have to rise from the current per-barrel equivalent of $13 to a whopping $38. To manage a 10 percent cut in energy use over the same period, a not unthinkable goal if poor countries are to be given leeway to consume more fossil fuels as they industrialize, the price faced by consumers would have to jump to $80.</p>
        <p>These numbers, implicitly confirmed by the Energy Department's own long-term estimates of demand, are not quite as alarming as they appear at first blush.</p>
        <p>They are not forecasts of prices likely to prevail in private markets - virtually every economist agrees that the world would be awash in unused oil production capacity if energy prices rose so sharply. Thus, unlike the oil shocks of the 1970's, the adjustment would not require the transfer of wealth from energy-consuming nations to producers.</p>
        <p>Nor does the resistance to conservation implied by the stiff price increases needed to curb demand prove that all conservation would be expensive. Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute has argued for years that switching to more efficient fluorescent lighting, home appliances and industrial motors would pay even with $15-a-barrel oil. Custom and ignorance, not cost, are in the way.  It is also worth remembering that Mr. Norman estimated the demand for all fuels, not just the ones that add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Rapid growth in solar power and hydropower, which now account for less than three-tenths of 1 percent of American energy production, could slow carbon dioxide pollution without reducing overall energy consumption. By the same logic, even a modest shift from coal to natural gas, which releases far more heat per pound of carbon burned, would offer economies a little extra room to grow.</p>
        <p>All that said, there is still plenty of sobering news implied by Mr. Norman's estimates. The only non-carbon source of power that could make a tangible difference over the next few decades is nuclear power. Yet no new nuclear plants are in the pipeline, and there is little prospect of new ones being financed by private utilities until public attitudes change radically.</p>
        <p>Nor does experience offer much hope that the public would tolerate the use of efficient, market-based incentives to reduce carbon dioxide effluents where fossil fuels would be cheapest to replace.</p>
        <p>One such approach, taxing fuels according to the harm they cause, has always been a political non-starter because it is widely viewed as unfair to those who cannot afford to pay. The virtues of an equivalent approach, issuing permits to emit carbon dioxide that could be traded like postage stamps or shares of General Motors, may be equally difficult to sell to a skeptical public.</p>
        <p>The path of least political resistance would probably be direct regulation, putting the burden on government to decide who got to burn carbon and how much. While it may not be impossible to run such a broad system of regulation efficiently, Mikhail Gorbachev knows just how tough it can be.</p>
