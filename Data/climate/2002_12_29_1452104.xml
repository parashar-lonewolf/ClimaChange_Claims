        <p>The only way to catch one of the best foreign movies in town is on the fly. There will be two chances, on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, to see ''The Hole,'' the 1998 end-of-the-world comedy by Tsai Ming-liang, a 45-year-old Taiwanese director whose deft portraits of the dislocations of modern life regularly collect prizes at major festivals. ''The Hole'' is showing as part of the Museum of Modern Art's wide-ranging, 50-film series at the Gramercy Theater celebrating the 50th anniversary of the adventurous French film journal Positif.</p>
        <p>Originally commissioned for a program of films for the new millennium, ''The Hole'' salutes the future with paranoia and sly humor. It's the last week of 1999, and Taipei is in the grip of a nasty water-borne flu called ''end of the millennium virus,'' which makes people behave like cockroaches, scuttling around on all fours and hiding in dark spaces. The hapless residents of one quarantined apartment complex have been ordered to evacuate, but some, including a young grocer (Lee Kang-sheng) and the professional woman who lives below him (Yang Kuei-mei), irritably refuse.

        <p>The only way to catch one of the best foreign movies in town is on the fly. There will be two chances, on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, to see ''The Hole,'' the 1998 end-of-the-world comedy by Tsai Ming-liang, a 45-year-old Taiwanese director whose deft portraits of the dislocations of modern life regularly collect prizes at major festivals.

        <p>Originally commissioned for a program of films for the new millennium, ''The Hole'' salutes the future with paranoia and sly humor. It's the last week of 1999, and Taipei is in the grip of a nasty water-borne flu called ''end of the millennium virus,'' which makes people behave like cockroaches, scuttling around on all fours and hiding in dark spaces. The hapless residents of one quarantined apartment complex have been ordered to evacuate, but some, including a young grocer (Lee Kang-sheng) and the professional woman who lives below him (Yang Kuei-mei), irritably refuse. When a plumber knocks a hole in the grocer's floor that breaches the woman's ceiling, their lives are inadvertently joined.</p>
        <p>With long takes, minimal dialogue and camera work so restrained there are virtually no close-ups, Mr. Tsai's films can be so quiet they alter your sense of time. But ''The Hole'' is practically raucous. Marrying a cranky version of boy-meets-girl romance with a bolt-from-the-blue awfulness well known to city dwellers everywhere, it features a plenitude of rude jokes and an urban-misery soundtrack that just doesn't quit. Acid rain falls from the sky in a steady cataract, and the concrete bowels of the apartment complex emit a constant industrial rumble.</p>
        <p>This could well be unbearable, if the movie weren't punctuated by hilarious 50's-era musical numbers featuring pert showgirls and the couple themselves lip-synching the exuberant tunes of the Hong Kong singing star Grace Chang. In the exotic lurks the familiar. When ''The Hole'' won the international critics' award at the Cannes Film Festival, it was cited ''for its daring combination of realism and apocalyptic vision, desperation and joy, austerity and glamour.'' Not a bad description of New York.</p>
