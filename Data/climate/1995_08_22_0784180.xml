        <p>American manufacturers are urging the Clinton Administration not to make any early new commitment to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" as a new round of international talks begins in Geneva.</p>
        <p>The talks, which opened yesterday and are expected to last two weeks, are the first round in a negotiation that is to last two years and is expected to produce new worldwide emission-control targets. Many fear greenhouse gases are warming the atmosphere to unhealthy levels.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher earlier this month, an association embracing virtually all major American manufacturerers called the Global Climate Coalition argued that proposals in Geneva could result in "significant harm to the U.S. economy and U.S. competitiveness."</p>
        <p>It specifically attacked one by a group of 38 small island nations that fear they would be flooded if rising temperatures melted the polar ice caps and raised ocean levels. Such island nations as Fiji and Madagascar want the industrialized world by the year 2005 to cut back greenhouse-gas emissions another 20 percent below their 1990 levels.</p>
        <p>Instead, the American manufacturers called for the Administration to study the potential impact on economic growth, competitiveness and trade flows of any further emission reductions beyond that already agreed to by industrialized countries at the United Nations' Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro three years ago, when they agreed to reduce them to 1990 levels by the year 2000. At the time, the Bush Administration would not agree to those guidelines, but the Clinton Administration has since pledged that the United States would meet them.</p>
        <p>"Of particular concern to the members of the Global Climate Coalition is the urgent need for a plan and timetable for a thorough analysis of the potential impacts on economic growth, trade competitiveness and jobs in the U.S. and how they compare to the impact on nations in Asia and Europe that compete with the U.S.," the letter says.</p>
        <p>But it noted with regret that the Administration had warned that efforts to cut the Federal budget deficit make it "unlikely that money would be available in fiscal year 1996 for adequate analysis."</p>
        <p>The letter to Secretary of State Christopher is signed, among others, by the presidents or chief executives of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper Association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association and the National Mining Association.</p>
        <p>"We live in a very competitive world," said John Shlaes, the coalition's executive director. "What are presented as environmental issues are really economic and trade issues we do not yet fully understand."</p>
        <p>But a senior State Department official involved in the climate negotiations insisted that the United States wanted a detailed analysis of the economic impact of any new reduction pledge. "Industry seems afraid we're going to rush into signing things; we're not," he said.</p>
        <p>The agreement by industrialized nations to cut carbon-dioxide emissions, which are caused by burning fossil fuels, to 1990 levels by the end of the century is part of a document known as the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which about 170 countries have signed.</p>
        <p>But at a meeting of these nations in Berlin in April, the industrialized world conceded that with the possible exception of Germany and Britain, it had little chance of achieving that goal.</p>
        <p>Instead, these countries made a new commitment, known as the Berlin Mandate, under which they would try to set new emission targets for the years after 2000 by 1997.</p>
        <p>Though the scientific evidence for global warming is still inconclusive, the decision reflects a broad agreement that reducing output of greenhouse gases is a sensible precaution until more is known about their effect on the climate.</p>
        <p>The Berlin Mandate also specifically provides for the negotiators to examine a proposal by the Alliance of Small Island States under which the industrialized world would be required to cut emissions 20 percent more below the 2000 target level by 2005, with possible additional reductions in 2010 and 2020.</p>
        <p>But the senior State Department official called the plan "barely credible when we can't even get to 1990 emission levels by 2000."</p>
