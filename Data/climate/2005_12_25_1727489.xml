        <p>Forest Fever</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Svoboda, writing in Wired magazine, reports on a possible flaw in the idea that trees reduce the effects of global warming.</p>
        <p>Forget planting trees to negate  global warming -- according to Stanford University atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira, the wrong location can actually make the Earth hotter.</p>
        <p>Trees may be good at capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but their dark leaves are also very efficient at soaking up sunlight, which is later released as heat. At certain latitudes, the net effect of these two processes is warming, rather than cooling.  Forest growth in equatorial areas, on the other hand, reduced global temperatures  because the warmer air in these regions allows more moisture to evaporate from the leaves of trees.</p>
        <p>Caldeira stressed that lawmakers shouldn't advocate chopping down swaths of forest.  He thinks investing in new sources of clean energy, like hydrogen and biofuel, is a better way to address the global-warming problem.</p>
        <p>Beating Up Barbie</p>
        <p>TimesOnline, the Times of London Web site at www.timesonline.co.uk, reports that, according to recent research, British children routinely torture their Barbie dolls.</p>
        <p>The methods of mutilation are varied and creative, ranging from scalping to decapitation, burning, breaking and even microwaving, according to academics from the University of Bath. The findings were revealed as part of an in-depth look by psychologists and management academics into the role of brands among 7- to 11-year-old schoolchildren.</p>
        <p>Violence and torture against Barbie were repeatedly reported across age, school and gender.</p>
        <p>''You might expect little girls to love their Barbie and expect an imaginary love in return. Instead girls feel violence and hatred towards their Barbie,'' Agnes Nairn, one of the researchers, said.</p>
        <p>One interpretation of this phenomenon is that the children are reacting to the proliferation of different types of the doll, which range from Fashion Barbie to Queen Elizabeth I Barbie and even a Geisha Barbie.</p>
        <p>''The children never talked of one single, special Barbie. The girls almost always talked about having a box full of Barbies.  Barbies are not special; they are disposable, and are thrown away and rejected,'' Dr. Nairn said.</p>
        <p>The Best Beginnings</p>
        <p>The January/February 2006 issue of The American Book Review will include a list of the 100 best first lines in novels, chosen by a group of literary enthusiasts. Here are the top seven.</p>

        <p>2. ''It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.'' ''Pride and Prejudice,'' Jane Austen (1813)</p>
        <p>3. ''A screaming comes across the sky.'' ''Gravity's Rainbow,'' Thomas Pynchon (1973)</p>
        <p>4. ''Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.'' ''One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' Gabriel García Márquez (1967; translation by Gregory Rabassa)</p>
        <p>5. ''Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins.'' ''Lolita,'' Vladimir Nabokov (1955)</p>
        <p>6. ''Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.'' ''Anna Karenina,'' Leo Tolstoy (1877; translation by Constance Garnett)</p>
        <p>7. ''riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.'' ''Finnegans Wake,'' James Joyce (1939)</p>
