      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I can't decide whether I am envious of Mark Greenberg and Robin Muhlfeld for their beautiful home, individual bedrooms and everyone having his ''own space,'' or overly disturbed by the fact that they have four vehicles parked in the drive (''New Money Is Inflating Suburban Homes''). Is it really necessary to have that many vehicles for one family? I hope that after they peruse the magazine, they read about global warming and the environment. A giant leap? I don't think so.</p>
