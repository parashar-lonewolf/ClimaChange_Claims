        <p>IF you're coming out of ''The Color Purple'' on a Friday night and find every yellow cab taken, all is not lost: waiting nearby is probably a three-wheeled, human-powered rickshaw known as a pedicab. In recent years, pedicabs have become ubiquitous in Midtown. They pick up theatergoers on Broadway, courting couples in Central Park and give gawking tourists a new way to stare at the tall buildings.</p>
        <p>Sadly, however, they might not be around for much longer if some City Council members have their way. Five Council members have introduced a measure to ban pedicabs from certain sections of the city. They claim that the ban is necessary because ''streets are congested'' and pedicabs ''create hazardous conditions in high traffic areas.''</p>
        <p>Pedicabs? A threat to public safety? When was the last time you jumped back to avoid being hit by a speeding pedicab? Midtown is crowded and at peak hours traffic can stop dead, but it seems unlikely that a few hundred pedicabs, each one about 50 inches wide, are appreciably increasing congestion, particularly as they are not all in operation at once and many of them focus on tourist circuits of Central Park.</p>
        <p>Pedicab drivers are naturally upset by the proposed ban -- not just because they could lose their jobs, but also because tourists like them and they contribute to the city's visitor-friendly reputation.</p>
        <p>There is reason to believe that the pedicab ban may be driven by resentment from horse-drawn carriage owners. According to New York magazine, some horse-and-carriage owners have hired Thomas McMahon, a former chief counsel to the City Council, to lobby for a pedicab ban. Several pedicab drivers have said that they think horse-drawn carriage owners were angry that pedicabs were getting some of their business.</p>
        <p>The League of Humane Voters of New York City, an animal-rights group, agrees. In a press release, John Phillips, executive director of the league, called the proposed ban ''a thinly veiled attempt by the horse-and-carriage industry to deny visitors and residents of Midtown access to cruelty-free methods of transportation.'' Horse-drawn carriages, which are restricted from Midtown during the week but have access on the weekends, are certainly bulkier and less maneuverable than the nimble little pedicabs. (They also leave behind their own form of street-level pollution.)</p>
        <p>The wording of the measure also suggests that the ban is intended to reimpose the carriages' monopoly on Central Park tourism. It defines Midtown as stretching from Second Avenue to Ninth Avenue and 30th Street to 65th Street. Including the south side of Central Park in the ban will do nothing to ease New York's traffic woes, but will do a great deal to fatten carriage owners' wallets.</p>
        <p>Symbolically, the proposal to ban pedicabs comes at a particularly inopportune moment. Representatives from more than 150 nations just met in Montreal to discuss reducing the greenhouse gases that are believed to be causing global warming. President Bush and the United States were conspicuous in their stubborn refusal to cooperate. New York should not be equally blind. Supporting pedicabs -- a pollution-free transportation alternative -- would demonstrate New York's support for sane environmental policies.</p>
        <p>Certainly pedicabs need to be regulated. For starters, pedicabs need to be licensed, properly insured and inspected regularly for safety defects -- and a bill to do exactly that has been put before the City Council and is supported by pedicab owners.</p>
        <p>But there's no need to ban pedicabs. They do little harm, they provide a clean-air transportation alternative and they give our city a little bit of extra charm.</p>
