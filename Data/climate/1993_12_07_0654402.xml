        <p>ACCORDING to conventional wisdom, the world's climate over the last millennium has been dominated by two big global events: a medieval warm period, between about 900 and 1300 A.D., when vineyards flourished in Britain and the Vikings colonized Greenland; and a Little Ice Age from the 15th to the 19th centuries, when mountain glaciers expanded, extreme cold ravaged Europe and people occasionally walked from Staten Island to Manhattan on the ice.</p>
        <p>More precise analysis is now casting serious doubt on this picture of worldwide, centuries-long climatic episodes, so much so that a number of scientists are urging that the commonly used terms "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval Warm Period" be abandoned.

        <p>ACCORDING to conventional wisdom, the world's climate over the last millennium has been dominated by two big global events: a medieval warm period, between about 900 and 1300 A.D., when vineyards flourished in Britain and the Vikings colonized Greenland; and a Little Ice Age from the 15th to the 19th centuries, when mountain glaciers expanded, extreme cold ravaged Europe and people occasionally walked from Staten Island to Manhattan on the ice.</p>
        <p>More precise analysis is now casting serious doubt on this picture of worldwide, centuries-long climatic episodes, so much so that a number of scientists are urging that the commonly used terms "Little Ice Age" and "Medieval Warm Period" be abandoned. "These terms have become entrenched in the literature, but they obfuscate what really took place, when and exactly where," said Dr. Raymond S. Bradley, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.</p>
        <p>Emerging in place of the conventional view is a much more complex picture in which different climatic conditions prevailed in different parts of the world at a given time, and climates fluctuated between warmer and colder on a scale of decades rather than centuries.</p>
        <p>The new picture is far from complete, and the effort to fill it in has important implications both for understanding how global climate behaves and for learning whether a pronounced warming trend in the 20th century is a natural phenomenon or the result of humans' impact on the atmosphere. So far, depending on how the incomplete evidence is read, it gives comfort to both sides of that debate.</p>
        <p>The subject was explored yesterday in a symposium at the semiannual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Climate and weather vary on many scales of time and space, from the grand rhythms of ice ages over thousands of years and whole continents to seasonal variations and the local day-to-night oscillations that are a familiar part of daily life. Short-term oscillations are superimposed on long-term ones, and all are governed by the interplay of external influences like solar radiation and the climate system's highly complex internal interactions. Better Climate Analyses</p>
        <p>Much is known about the grander ice-age rhythms and the short-term seasonal and daily ones, but on the intermediate scale of centuries the picture has been less clear. Historical accounts of climatic episodes and the observed advance and retreat of mountain glaciers in many parts of the world over the last 1,000 years led paleoclimatologists to postulate the two long, sustained warm and cold spells that they called the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.</p>
        <p>Under this formulation, the centuries-long Medieval Warm Period saw sustained global temperatures perhaps 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer than the 20th Century, while the global temperature was 2 to 3 degrees colder in the Little Ice Age. By comparison, the earth is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last ice age.</p>
        <p>A number of improvements in methodology, including analysis of climate-sensitive tree rings, ice corings, fossil pollen and a more critical and painstaking analysis of historical documents, have enabled scientists to gauge the millennium's climatic rhythms more precisely, said Dr. Malcolm K. Hughes, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona who convened the San Francisco symposium.</p>
        <p>Using these updated methods, scientists are concluding that while there have been periods of pronounced warm and cold over the millennium, they have been of much shorter duration than has been thought and have taken place in limited regions at different times rather than globally.</p>
        <p>For instance, Dr. Debra Meese and Dr. Anthony J. Gow of the United States Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., reported that an analysis of corings taken from the summit of the Greenland ice sheet showed that while there was no sustained Little Ice Age there, a relatively cold period of greatly fluctuating climate took place after 1700. They also found that a Medieval Warm Period did occur there between 620 and 1150 A.D., during which conditions were above freezing.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Hughes and Dr. Henry Diaz of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., reported that a careful analysis of tree rings, mountain glaciers and historical documents failed to show that the Medieval Warm Period observed in the North Atlantic region was global in its reach. There is some evidence for a sustained medieval warming at high altitudes like the Greenland summit and the Andes, but it does not exist at lower altitudes, said Dr. Hughes. No Sustained Little Ice Age</p>
        <p>And while it is true that mountain glaciers did advance in many parts of the world during what has been termed the Little Ice Age, he said, it is far from clear that they advanced simultaneously.</p>
        <p>In fact, a reconstruction of the Northern Hemisphere's climate from 1400 to 1970 by Dr. Bradley and Dr. Philip D. Jones of the University of East Anglia in England showed not a single, long-term pattern of any kind but rather a wide range of variations in different parts of the world, with oscillations between warmer and cooler regional climates taking place on scales of a decade or two.</p>
        <p>The analysis involved summer temperatures, since that is when the climatic record as reflected in tree rings, pollen production and ice melting is clearest. It showed, for instance, that Europe had relatively cold summers in the 17th century, the early 19th century and the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- but no sustained Little Ice Age.</p>
        <p>North America's experience not only differed from that of Europe but also showed variations from one part of the continent to another. Pollen data from Minnesota, for instance, indicated the coldest conditions in the late 1500's, around 1700 and around 1840. An analysis of tree growth in the Western United States showed that temperatures in the 17th and 18th centuries were comparable with the generally warm conditions of the early 20th century, but were interrupted by several cold periods of 10 to 20 years' duration. The coldest conditions were in the early 1600's and early 1800's.</p>
        <p>In China, Dr. Bradley and Dr. Jones found, temperatures declined from around 1500 to a pronounced minimum in the mid-17th century, rose to levels comparable to 20th-century warmth for brief periods in the 18th century, then dropped again to low readings in the early-to-mid-19th century.</p>
        <p>A composite record for Europe indicated that summer temperatures from 1400 to the 1570's fluctuated around the average for the period from 1860 to 1960, which Dr. Bradley and Dr. Jones used as a benchmark. Then the temperatures declined and remained below the average until the 1690's, before rising in the 18th century and then plunging again in the 19th century. Greenhouse Effect Scrutinized</p>
        <p>The Bradley-Jones composite record for the Northern Hemisphere for the last 600 years shows a pronounced temperature drop in the 16th century followed by an erratic rise over the next two centuries, a more modest drop in the 19th century and a surge above average in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>This record can be read in two ways, says Dr. Bradley. If one considers the period from the mid-16th century to the late 20th century, a steady warming trend appears to underlie the decade-to-decade temperature fluctuations. This perspective, says Dr. Bradley, seems to favor those who see the recent warming of the 20th century as part of a natural phenomenon. But if one considers the period from 1400 to 1900, the decade-to-decade fluctuations oscillate around an unchanging average somewhat below the 1860-to-1970 benchmark. Then it jumps sharply upward in the 20th century. This perspective, said Dr. Bradley, seems to favor those who see the 20th century as an aberration and attribute it to emissions of industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>To resolve the question requires a further research step, now under way but not complete: matching the reconstructed temperature trends against trends in the factors that cause climate to change, like solar radiation, volcanic activity and reflective sulfate emissions from industry that cool the earth, greenhouse gases that warm it and shifts in currents in the tropical Pacific Ocean that produce El Nino events and warm the globe.</p>
        <p>"Then," said Dr. Bradley, "we can begin to see where these curves match up and begin to isolate the causes of this variation" in temperature, and "we will be able to understand whether it's greenhouse gases that have truly affected climate over the last 100 years" or whether the 20th century's warming is a natural variation in climate.</p>
