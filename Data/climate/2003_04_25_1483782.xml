        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday announced an ambitious state program for reducing greenhouse gases, including a controversial recommendation to lower carbon dioxide emissions from smokestacks to 25 percent below 1990 levels during the next seven years. Environmentalists support the cap, saying it would set a favorable precedent for the rest of the country. But many power plant owners and others oppose it, saying that it would increase their operating costs, leading to higher electricity rates, and put New York at a disadvantage when attracting new businesses. Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said the governor would support such a cap only if other Northeastern states agreed to similar limits.</p>
