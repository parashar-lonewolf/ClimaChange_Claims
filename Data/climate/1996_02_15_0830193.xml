        <p>Charles Riley weaves his pickup through snow-coated hills spotted with the small farms and scattered homes of his fellow coal miners. He points to the mountainous gob heap of castaway shale and rock, to the tall concrete portals in the flanks of hills, to the five-story superstructure of the new, 320-foot elevator shaft.</p>
        <p>Far beneath these roads lies the dank and eerie subterranean city that is the Tygart River Mine. The state of the art in coal mining, it spreads over more than 20 square miles with a grid of numbered streets and avenues, trolley tracks, pipes to drain off the sulfur- and acid-laced water and cables for running machines and computers.</p>
        <p>"Last summer, management said there was another 15 or 20 years of coal in here," said Mr. Riley, 49, a son and grandson of miners, a high school graduate  who put his three children through four years of college. "Everyone went and bought new homes, new cars. I bought a new Jeep Cherokee."</p>
        <p>But the Peabody Holding Company, the nation's largest coal producer, shut down the Tygart River Mine and dismissed all 368 workers last December, making it one of hundreds of mines to close in a landscape altered by a single provision of the Clean Air Act of 1990. Tygart was the biggest operation in once-mine-pocked Marion County, and its closing leaves just one large mine open  in Marion. Adjacent Monongalia County lost two of its five major mines last year, and a third that employs 500 miners is to close this year.</p>
        <p>Conditions across most of the Eastern coal country are the bleakest since the Great Depression, largely because the coal here is too high in sulfur to easily meet the clean air requirements. Mines are thriving in the West and in eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia, all producers of low-sulfur coal. But they are closing through most of Appalachia and in other coal-mining areas east of the Mississippi, and their loss is leaving huge gaps in the surrounding  communities. It is the anguished human face of policies that even miners acknowledge have purified the air they breathe and the streams they fish in.</p>
        <p>Since 1990, according to the National Coal Association, nearly 1,000 coal mines have closed in the United States, nearly all east of the Mississippi, leaving 2,500. The United Mine Workers of America says coal mine employment in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, western Kentucky and northern West Virginia has plunged more than 30 percent since the start of the decade, to 25,906 workers, about half because of automation. In the highly automated, surface-mined states of Colorado and Wyoming, employment has grown about 2 percent, to 5,514.</p>
        <p>The mines in the high-sulfur areas are shutting because when the coal they yield is burned, the sulfur produces sulfur dioxide, a cause of acid rain. Under the Clean Air Act, power plants were required to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by half as of January 1995, and they must cut them further by 2000.</p>
        <p>Utilities can install scrubbers to filter their smoke, but the scrubbers cost $100 million or more, so few have. Often at less cost, they can meet the air standards by blending high-sulfur coal with low-sulfur coal from Wyoming and Montana or from eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia.</p>
        <p>Either way, the Clean Air Act has cut demand for high-sulfur coal and driven  down prices to a point where many mine operators say they cannot make profits.</p>
        <p>"Because of market conditions and the Clean Air Act, it was a marginal situation to begin with," said Garry Groves, a spokesman for the Eastern Associated Coal Corporation, the Peabody subsidiary that operated the Tygart River Mine.</p>
        <p>Then, in August, a roof caved in. Only one worker was injured, losing a finger. But preventing future damage was too costly in view of the low price of  the coal. "That was the last straw," Mr. Groves said. Peabody is now turning more to low-sulfur Western mines.</p>
        <p>Nationwide, coal production is headed for a record 1.05 billion tons, said John Grasser, a spokesman for the National Coal Association. In the 1990's production in the long-dominant East will have fallen 14 percent by the end of this year, to 542 million tons annually, while in the West it will have jumped 26 percent, to 504 million tons. "It's directly related to the low-sulfur coal out there," Mr. Grasser said.</p>
        <p>With the shutdown here in north-central West Virginia, Peabody drove a spike  through the heart of an economy whose gentry -- with cars bought for cash, backyard swimming pools, wives who stayed home -- consisted of the $50,000-a-year men who dug the coal.</p>
        <p>What hurts the miners hurts the local economy in proportions far exceeding the effect of other jobs. In 1994, before the Tygart River Mine closed, Marion County's 1,342 coal miners made up 7 percent of the workers and collected 16 percent of the wages paid in the county. Companies that equip mines and service  their gear, also high wage payers, are folding as fast as the mines.</p>
        <p>Jobs in mining, manufacturing and construction energize an economy more than  others. Economists call them primary jobs because they beget secondary jobs that cater to the primary employers and their workers. "They have a lot to do with driving a local economy," said Stephen Shackelford, an economist in the West Virginia Bureau of Employment Programs.</p>
        <p>With the loss of the mines and of several factories as well, he said, Marion  County has lost nearly 400 retail jobs in the first half of the 1990's and 27 of its 355 stores. A study done for the Marion County Chamber of Commerce says county residents are spending $90 million more a year outside the county than in it.</p>
        <p>"It hurts," said Charles Reese, president of the Marion County Chamber of Commerce. Along with the loss of mines, the county, with a population of 58,000, is littered with the corpses of departed manufacturing companies, like Owens-Illinois, a glass company, and Sharon Steel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reese said the county's 9 percent unemployment rate, compared with the national rate of 5.6 percent, was actually higher because many workers had stopped looking for jobs and were not counted.</p>
        <p>"Things are not balancing out," he said. "We are getting some high-technology jobs where the skills are high but the wages are low. I think sometimes we should yell and scream more. It's just not our style."</p>
        <p>Miners tend to be among the brightest of the community's high school students because the wages for the jobs have given mine operators the pick of the lot. The average miner here today is in his late 40's.</p>
        <p>Like Charles Riley, Michael Chefren, 50, went no further than high school but has put three children through college and into careers far removed from mining. He started at the Tygart River Mine 21 years ago, about a year after it opened,  and became a surface maintenance supervisor earning $55,000 a year. The money enabled him to buy a 45-acre farm. His wife, Jean, does not work.</p>
        <p>"Everything we own is paid for," he said. "No mortgage. If I buy it, I pay for it. The last thing I financed was a car, in 1985." He has savings, is taking federally financed courses and is thinking of starting a business.</p>
        <p>Even if he could, he is not certain he would return to the mine. "I feel pretty good not getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning and putting in 12 and 14  hours a day," he said.</p>
        <p>Rich Eddy of Fairmont, president of District 31 of the United Mine Workers of America, who oversees members in 31 of the state's 55 counties, says he is still skeptical that high-sulfur coal contributes to acid rain. But many miners welcome the changes that environmental regulation has brought.</p>
        <p>"All of us grew up in coal camps and lived within walking distance of the mines," said Gary Pastorial, 46, who was laid off from Tygart. "Everyone burned  coal in their homes, and when you went out in the evening, you couldn't see the  air. One of my chores was to scrub the front porch with a mop every day because  it was black."</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Pastorial lives in a spotless ranch house he just built in an upper-income subdivision, and he looks upon a horizon of pristine air. "The West Fork River was dead," he said. "Now people fish in it."</p>
        <p>Congress is helping to soften the blow of layoffs attributed to the Clean Air Act. Like most people who lose their jobs, the miners receive unemployment compensation for six months. But the Government also pays for them to go to school for up to two years to learn new skills and keeps paying them their unemployment benefit, typically $290 a week, for the duration.</p>
        <p>But no training is likely to yield jobs like the ones these men have lost. Many are taking courses in the construction trades, which pay a little more than a third of the $17 an hour they typically earned in the mines. But a state analysis of the county economy says that in 1994 and 1995, there were 456 applicants for 21 construction jobs.</p>
        <p>"If they don't go to school, they're going to be lucky to get $5 an hour," said Cathy Tarley, manager of Marion County office of the state job service. "If they do go to school for two years, they might get $8 to $10."</p>
        <p>Most new jobs are in health care and in Government offices requiring clerical skills. "We're trying to get wives in for training," Mrs. Tarley said. "A lot of the jobs that are being created are more suitable for females."</p>
        <p>John Beveridge spent 22 years in the mines, the last 13 at the Peabody mine.  He is a roof bolter, a highly skilled worker who bores six-foot-long rods into the roofs of mines to keep them from falling. It is treacherous work; the driller must learn to read sounds and vibrations to know when a roof might crash. Mr. Beveridge said his worst injury was a broken leg.</p>
        <p>As a youth, he completed three years of college, majoring in psychology. He also boxed professionally for 15 years as a hobby. But nothing paid like mining. "You could work seven days a week if you wanted to," Mr. Beveridge said. He made $48,000 last year in the mine before he was let go in early October.</p>
        <p>"I'm scared to death," he said. "I'm 44 years old. I'd like to live another 50 years. What am I going to do?"</p>
