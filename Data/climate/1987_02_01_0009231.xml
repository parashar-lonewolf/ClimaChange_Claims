        <p>LEAD: JIM BRADLEY, Ontario's Minister of the Environment and one of his country's leaders in the fight against acid rain, came to New York this weekend in his effort to persuade Americans that this insidious killer of fish and other aquatic organisms must be swiftly eliminated.</p>
        <p>JIM BRADLEY, Ontario's Minister of the Environment and one of his country's leaders in the fight against acid rain, came to New York this weekend in his effort to persuade Americans that this insidious killer of fish and other aquatic organisms must be swiftly eliminated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley timed his visit to coincide with the city's Sportsman's Show - which closes tonight at 7 - at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and yesterday he was at his province's booth at the affair. Earlier on the weekend he had dined with a small group of Canadian officials, environmentalists and newsmen.</p>
        <p>Canadians have long thought that the United States has been dragging its heels in its acid-rain abatement program, a matter of particular concern to them because much of the sulfur dioxide pollution from the American Middle West and other states is carried by prevailing winds across the border into Canada. Some of that pollution also reaches this country's Northeast.</p>
        <p>One of the most recent manifestations of Canada's frustration took place last month in Ottawa during a meeting between that country's Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, and Vice President Bush. Mr. Mulroney said this country wasn't living up to a joint Canadian-American agreement to reduce acid rain.</p>
        <p>Acid rain - or, more accurately, acid precipitation - falls on land and water in the form of rain, snow, fog, or dry particulate matter. It is created by the burning of fossil fuels, coal, gasoline or oil, and arrives as sulfur dioxide or nitrous oxide. About half of the latter comes from trucks and automobiles.</p>
        <p>Coal-fired power plants account for most of the sulfur dioxide emissions in this country. Smelters also contribute heavily to this form of pollution. Although most of acid rain crossing the border falls on Canada, there is some transport in the other direction.</p>
        <p>There is ample scientific documentation of acid rain's destruction of fish and other aquatic life in more than 14,000 lakes in eastern Canada and some 200 lakes and ponds in New York State's Adirondacks. Its role in killing or stunting trees is less clear, but there is strong circumstantial evidence that it does contribute to the decline of forest productivity in North America.</p>
        <p>In both North America and Europe, such a decline has been noted in areas getting a heavy dose of acid precipitation. There is also evidence suggesting that pulses of acidic water in rivers entering the Chesapeake Bay are one of the reasons for the repeated reproductive failures of that region's striped bass, which, historically, have accounted for most of the East Coast's migratory populations of the species.</p>
        <p>Those who have long been fighting to reduce acid rain note that the technology for accomplishing this exists, that although -as in the case of the forests - its precise role in certain forms of environmental degradation isn't defined, there is more than enough evidence to justify an all-out abatement effort. Mr. Bradley, who advocates this approach, is well suited to bring his country's message south of the border. His province is Canada's major source of sulfur dioxide.</p>
        <p>In March 1985, the Environmental Ministers of Canada and the provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland agreed to reduce (from 1980's level) sulfur dioxide emissions 50 percent by 1994. In December of the same year, Mr. Bradley went even further by announcing that his province's reduction goal, with the same target date, would be 67 percent. These regulations cannot be appealed and there are heavy fines if they are not followed.</p>
        <p>A new Ontario law provides for jail sentences and fines up to half a million dollars a day for flagrant violations of orders aimed at ending or abating pollution of water, land or air. The new law reaches into the board rooms of corporations - directors and senior corporate officials can be held responsible for violations. It also applies to public utilities and agencies, and there is a provision in it that can be used to strip away any profits realized from ignoring pollution abatement schedules.</p>
        <p>Ontario's four major sources of acid precipitation are two smelters in Sudbury, INCO and Falconbridge; Algoma in Wawa, an iron ore sintering plant, and Ontario Hydro, the province's electrical utility.</p>
        <p>INCO, Mr. Bradley said, at first thought that the abatement program was too ambitious. But now, he says, the company is advertising its role as environmentally sensitive.</p>
        <p>He said that in the long run the economic well-being of all will be best served by dealing forthrightly and swiftly with all forms of environmental degradation. He also said that he believed Ontario's residents were willing to pay for environmental controls and added, ''I am prepared to go to the people any day of the week, and 90 percent of them will be with me.''</p>
        <p>He said that although he was encouraged by attempts in this country's Senate and House to deal more stringently with acid-rain pollution, he has not been similarly uplifted by the Reagan Administration's performance in the field.</p>
        <p>In the postdinner conversation, several of those present reiterated the fear that President Reagan's endorsement of a joint Canadian-American acid-rain report last March had lulled many Americans into a false belief that this country was finally dealing with its acid rain problem.</p>
        <p>Among other things, that report called for a five-year, $5 billion research project in this country - financed equally by industry and the Federal Government - to refine the techniques for burning coal cleanly. At the Bush-Mulroney Ottawa meeting, when asked if the Administration's $287 million 1987-88 budget appropriation - was in keeping with the agreement, Mr. Mulroney replied, ''Absolutely not. There's a lot more they can do. I'm from Missouri, and I'm going to believe this when I see the cash.''</p>
        <p>One of the guests at the dinner, Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist with the Enviromental Defense Fund, told the Canadians that their presence in this country was a shot in the arm to American environmentalists.</p>
