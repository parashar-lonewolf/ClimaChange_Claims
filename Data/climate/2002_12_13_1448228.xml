        <p>In the mountain village of Pontresina, near the plush ski resort of St. Moritz, construction workers are putting the finishing touches on a giant earth dam designed to keep the residents safe -- not from water, but from a cliff that scientists say is in danger of crumbling because the permafrost that anchors it is melting.</p>

        <p>In the mountain village of Pontresina, near the plush ski resort of St. Moritz, construction workers are putting the finishing touches on a giant earth dam designed to keep the residents safe -- not from water, but from a cliff that scientists say is in danger of crumbling because the permafrost that anchors it is melting.</p>
        <p>The dam, about 500 yards wide and about as tall as a four-story building, will cost the equivalent of about $5 million.</p>
        <p>Eugen Peter, president of the village council, called the structure a precaution against a warming Alpine climate.</p>
        <p>''We knew the permafrost would not be here in 20 years because of global warming,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Permafrost is frozen ground that can act as glue for the rocks perched at the top of a mountain.</p>
        <p>Researchers in Switzerland and throughout Europe have charted a gradual melting of it, not only in the Alps but in mountains all over the world.</p>
        <p>''Since 1850, things have gotten warmer,'' with a distinct acceleration in melting in the past 20 to 30 years, said Andreas Kääb, a geography researcher at the University of Zurich who is mapping the creep of permafrost and glaciers.</p>
        <p>In Switzerland, the warming is particularly dangerous because its mountains are more densely populated than in most other countries.</p>
        <p>When glaciers melt, they create lakes that can overflow and flood a town below. As permafrost warms, it can release rock and mud that can slide in a giant mass through a village.</p>
        <p>Emmanuel Reynard, a professor at the University of Lausanne, said mudslides in parts of Switzerland in recent days could well be caused by record-breaking rainfall accelerating the melting of the permafrost.</p>
        <p>''The beginning of debris flow is high precipitation, or long periods of precipitation,'' Dr. Reynard said.</p>
        <p>He said some parts of Switzerland, like the cantons of Graubunden, near the Italian border, and Valais, near the French border, are more sensitive to mudslides because of their topography and dense population.</p>
        <p>Swiss scientists are studying landslides to determine which ones may have been caused by melting permafrost.</p>
        <p>One terrifying instance was in September in the Caucasus, in Russia.</p>
        <p>There, scientists say, 140 million cubic feet of rock layers, including a mass of ice, rock and ferns, snapped off and began a free fall down the the northern slope of Kazbek Mountain, gathering fresh mud, trees and rock until it hit the Kolka Glacier.</p>
        <p>A portion of the glacier sheared off and an estimated 2.1 billion cubic feet of snow, trees, ice, debris, rock, mud and water continued to rumble toward the bottom of the mountain. It landed in the Genaldon Gorge, near Karmadon, and killed about 140 people. The compressed avalanche dammed several lakes, including one whose water rose to flood level, threatening a second village.</p>
        <p>For now, scientists say, such events are rare. As construction continues at ever higher levels in mountainous areas, however, the number of people who ski, hike, cycle or even live on or below permafrost areas is likely to increase.</p>
        <p>''The art is how we can live intelligently with these giants,'' said Reto Baumann, a forester at Switzerland's environmental agency. ''A dam can only catch a mud grave; it can't prevent one.''</p>
