        <p>IT'S bulb season again, and gardeners are making like squirrels, tucking away crocuses, snowdrops, daffodils and tulips. But how attractive is a bulb whose vernacular name is ''stinking rose''?</p>
        <p>Here's why gardeners living in New York State should try to overlook that title and seriously consider planting Allium sativum, which most of us know as garlic: It grows easily, looks spectacular in a garden in midsummer and has health benefits. (And in this season, it's important to remember that those who eat it regularly rarely report vampire trouble.)</p>
        <p>We happen to be living in something of a champagne region for this root crop. Sulfur is what gives garlic its flavor and heat, says David Stern, an organic farmer who is president of the Garlic Seed Foundation, and New York soil has very high levels of garlic-friendly sulfur compounds. Mr. Stern sees this as the one silver lining to the clouds of Midwest power plant emissions that travel to the region and come down as acid rain, although at least one other expert, Eric Block, a chemistry professor at SUNY Albany maintains that most of the sulfur is naturally present in the soil anyway.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, however, cloves should be planted right about now -- to leave a few weeks before the first hard frost. ''Six weeks will give you 16 inches of roots,'' says Mr. Stern, and that anchors the garlic for the winter.</p>
        <p>He also champions the hard-neck varieties -- which put up a stem that eventually gets thick and woody. The heads are smaller than those usually sold in grocery stores, but the cloves themselves are larger and reputedly more flavorful. The plants also have more cold tolerance.</p>
        <p>Temperature is important throughout the growing cycle. Once the ground is frozen, growers mulch the garlic thickly, which prevents the cycle of freezing and thawing that can heave plants out of the ground. In the spring, Mr. Stern says, he pulls the mulch off to prevent rot.</p>
        <p>Once temperatures warm up, however, he mulches again, so the soil doesn't overheat. ''Anytime the soil gets above 90 degrees,'' he said, ''garlic stops growing.'' The experts at Cabbage Hill Farm, a grower in the region, prefer to interplant the garlic with flowers to keep the roots cool.</p>
        <p>As the plant begins to grow, it puts up a scape, or flowering stalk. Now the garlic gets acrobatic, looping around and twining together with neighboring scapes.</p>
        <p>Finally, reaching a height of 5 or even 6 feet, the tip splits, revealing a mix of miniature bulbs (bulbils) and flowers. It is this spectacle that leads some growers to plant cloves in their flower borders in October. ''I let it go for bouquets,'' said Eileen Zidi, a Cabbage Hill grower. ''It's gorgeous.'' She and other growers sell the scapes at the Mount Kisco farmers' market.</p>
        <p>The bad news is that this energetic showing costs the garlic head up to a third of its potential bulk, so you might want to cut some of the scapes. Mr. Stern recommends cutting as soon as the stems curve downward for their first loop. At this point, the mildly flavored shoots are still tender enough to eat. Evelyn Bartmann, herbalist and beekeeper at E.B.'s Golden Harvest, a farm in Yorktown, pickles them, but they can also be chopped up for a stir-fry.</p>
        <p>''On June 22nd,'' says Mr. Stern, '' garlic knows it's going to die.'' At this point, the head is about as big as a marble, but it will now go through a metabolic change and start doubling in size each week. Presumably, Westchester garlic is in the know a bit earlier than Upstate garlic. Ms. Zidi says the county's is ready to harvest by the end of June or the first week in July -- ''when you see the leaves completely dying off.''</p>
        <p>The garlic comes out ''succulent and green,'' says Mr. Stern. Growers hang it up, or lay it on wire racks, for a few weeks of curing.</p>
        <p>Which of the hundreds of named cultivars to plant? Most farmers at the annual Garlic Festival in Saugerties in September agreed with Mr. Stern that the hard-neck varieties were the most reliable and flavorful. A variety called Music was a frequently cited favorite. Pat Reppert, the festival's organizer, is partial to Allium longicuspis. It doesn't appear in most garden catalogs but is offered for sale by some Hudson Valley farmers. ''It's a beautiful garlic,'' she said. ''It's hotter, and to me it has more nuances of flavor.''</p>
        <p>But according to Mr. Stern, much of this is splitting cloves. Recently concluded genetic tests have revealed that there are only 11 different varieties of garlic, he added, and even these distinctions are unimportant.</p>
        <p>''Garlic derives flavor from soil,'' he reminded, ''not from variety.''</p>
