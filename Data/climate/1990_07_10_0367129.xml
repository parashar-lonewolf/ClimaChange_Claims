        <p>LEAD: Senior European officials at the economic summit conference accused the United States today of frustrating their efforts to reach a new accord to combat global warming.</p>
        <p>Senior European officials at the economic summit conference accused the United States today of frustrating their efforts to reach a new accord to combat global warming.</p>
        <p>The European officials, including members of the British, French and Italian delegations who asked not to be identified, angrily complained that John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, had taken the leading role in organizing American opposition to the global warming initiative.</p>
        <p>Asked at a news briefing this morning why the United States was resisting a West German proposal to set a target for reducing gases that cause global warming, Mr. Sununu replied, ''The issue is being addressed with a level of haste.'' He added, ''There seems to be some propensity to deal with the issue without putting all the data on the table.''</p>
        <p>In a letter sent to summit leaders last month, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany called for ''internationally binding regulations with ''radical measures to limit'' gas emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Kohl said: ''We must view the threat of climate change as a global challenge to all mankind. The world expects the seven summit countries to come up with far-reaching, specific proposals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu insisted today that the Bush Administration had endorsed limits on some emissions through the Clean Air Act, but he opposed new emission limits, contending that they would require major changes in the American way of life and the nation's industrial structure.</p>
        <p>He noted, for instance, that because the United States was much larger than Japan or any of the European nations it had a greater reliance on cars and trucks to transport people and products.</p>
        <p>Commenting on Mr. Sununu's position, James T. B. Tripp, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group, said, ''These statements may serve to explain why United States per capita consumption of fossil fuels is so high compared to Western Europe and Japan, but they are not legitimate excuses for United States refusal to limit carbon dioxide emissions and take steps to use energy much more efficiently.''</p>
        <p>Although President Bush has mustered allies to support his views on the two other major issues being addressed at the summit talks - aid to the Soviet Union and international trade - he now stands alone on the third area of the agenda, the environment.</p>
        <p>As the summit meeting's official sessions began today, European officials worried that the United States would block their effort to win a commitment to stabilize and then reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Many scientists believe that these gases trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape back into space. The trapped gases then produce a gradual warming of the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Pledges Made by Others</p>
        <p>Except for the United States, all the industrial nations represented at the summit meeting have now pledged to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, at least by early in the next century.</p>
        <p>Even Britain and Japan, which formerly sided with Washington in insisting that more scientific and economic information was needed before taking action, are developing plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. West Germany has taken the lead, with a goal of reducing such emissions by 25 percent in the next 15 years.</p>
        <p>President Bush's apparent determination to block a global warming initiative at this summit meeting stands in sharp contrast to his embrace of major environmental commitments at last year's economic summit talks in Paris.</p>
        <p>In the final communique of that meeting, the national leaders declared that ''decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''</p>
        <p>On the issue of global warming the communique stated, ''We strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the economy.''</p>
        <p>Even as the summit delegations began gathering here this weekend, European officials hoped that the Houston talks would build on the rhetoric of the Paris communique. But at a meeting Sunday night American officials raised a series of paralyzing objections, a European participant said.</p>
        <p>''We had thought we were making progress,'' the European official said today, ''but at last night's meeting it was discouragingly obvious that Sununu was back in the ascendancy, and the United States was yielding nothing.''</p>
        <p>European officials said that the first sign that President Bush would resist a global warming initiative came when William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was left behind in Washington. Mr. Reilly was a prominent member of the Bush delegation to the Paris talks.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Reilly's absence the role of chief adviser on environmental matters has been assumed by Mr. Sununu, who has publicly disagreed with Mr. Reilly on assessments of environmental dangers. At the news briefing this morning, Mr. Sununu rejected the kind of joint commitment to specific limitations on gas emissions that the West Germans among others are pressing the meeting to adopt.</p>
        <p>He said, ''There is a concern that this idea of a permanent cap in perpetuity does not understand not only our growth needs, but the growth needs of the developing countries of the world.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''So what we are seeking is a commitment that is broader, a commitment that would allow both the industrialized countries and the developing countries to address the broad issue of greenhouse gases without picking them one by one, setting caps on them individually.''
