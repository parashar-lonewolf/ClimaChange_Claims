        <p>As world leaders converge here starting on Monday to take stock of the global environment five years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, a growing number of experts say that government subsidies to industries not only squander money that could be spent cleaning up the Earth, but but also actually damage it.</p>
        <p>Subsidies for energy suppliers, water services, road building, agriculture and fisheries and other activities often have side effects that cost from $500 billion to $900 billion in environmental damage, according to a surprisingly varied group of experts -- from the left and right, industrial countries and the third world.</p>
        <p>Such payments can make some commodities too cheap, leading to profligacy, experts say. Other goods and services become artificially more expensive, in effect taxing consumers while bolstering inefficient industries that squander natural resources.</p>
        <p>Thus, farmers in Asia, enjoying inexpensive water, electricity and fertilizer, are tempted to overirrigate and chemically pollute fields and streams. In the United States, automobile manufacturers build bigger, more gas-guzzling cars, and harmful emissions rise and public transportation atrophies. In Germany, according to one estimate, it costs the Government more than $70,000 a year to keep each coal miner at work extracting an uneconomical fuel that dirties the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''There's something unbelievable about the world spending hundreds of billions of dollars annually to subsidize its own destruction,'' says a new report from the independent Earth Council, based in Costa Rica, and the Institute for Research on Public Expenditure in the Netherlands. The report, ''Subsidizing Unsustainable Development: Undermining the Earth with Public Funds,'' recommends re-examining all subsidies to sift out those that are damaging from those that still serve a social or economic purpose.</p>
        <p>Subsidies do not appear to be on any nation's priority list for the summit meeting, known as Rio Plus 5. President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore are expected to attend, among leaders from more than 60 countries. The President is scheduled to speak on Thursday. American officials list as top issues the debates over global warming and how best to protect the world's forests. Many poor nations want to confront the richer nations with demands for more money and technology transfers, which they say they need to bring environmental protection up to date.</p>
        <p>The issue of subsidies is a difficult one for any leader to tackle, even though it knows no ideological or national boundaries and is not related to levels of development. Governments of the left and right, in rich industrial nations and the poorer third world, use subsidies to win votes or mute dissent and they have become difficult to abolish.</p>
        <p>''Many of these subsidies are kept in place through political pressure, campaign donations or even bribery,'' said Worldwatch Institute in Washington in a report, ''Paying the Piper: Subsidies, Politics and the Environment.''</p>
        <p>The author of that report, David Malin Roodman, concluded that ''more than $500 billion a year of consumers' and taxpayers' money is spent by governments to subsidize deforestation, overfishing and other environmentally destructive activities.'' Subsidies for fishing fleets have produced enough fishery boats and equipment to catch twice the available fish in the world's seas, Mr. Roodman said.</p>
        <p>In India, a recent study for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram found that the national and state governments together were spending about $40 billion, or 14.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product, on subsidies. More than $5 billion of that goes to support prices for petroleum products, with agriculture subsidies close behind. Less than 4 percent of India's economy goes toward education.</p>
        <p>The assault on subsidies is particularly noteworthy in the third world, where grass-roots groups are resisting years of demands by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that such supports be eliminated or reduced. The local groups say that cutting subsidies hurts the poor, especially women and children.</p>
        <p>The Indian Government and others in the third world now question those assumptions. Mr. Chidambaram's study, based on research by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi, found that the rich, not the poor, more often benefited from subsidies, because the rich were in a position to buy and use subsidized commodities and services. Inexpensive electricity does not help the poorest, unelectrified villages, or the farmer unable to afford a subsidized bag of high-yield fertilizer.</p>
        <p>''The poor generally don't benefit from subsidies as much as the middle class,'' said Anders Wijkman, director of the bureau for policy and program support at the United Nations Development Program, which recently published a report, ''Energy After Rio.'' That report says that subsidies to conventional energy sources like coal, oil and nuclear power are ''a significant impediment to sustainable energy futures.''</p>
        <p>''They make it more difficult for new, sustainable energy technologies to enter the market, while simultaneously reducing the economic efficiency and creating fiscal burdens for the government,'' the report said. ''Energy price subsidies are often an ineffective and inefficient way of helping those living in poverty.''</p>
        <p>In Tanzania, the report noted, kerosene subsidies were found to be helping mostly the wealthier households that buy the bulk of the fuel.</p>
        <p>At the Cato Institute in Washington, Jerry Taylor, director of natural resources studies, characterized many subsidies as ''socialist'' measures, and argued that the environment would be better left in the hands of an ''unfettered'' private sector, not dependent on Federal aid.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Taylor said that subsidies to agriculture in rich and poor countries had contributed to excessive use of pesticides, fungicides and herbicides. Import quotas and price supports protecting the American sugar industry have raised sugar prices and led to destruction of parts of the Everglades, an example cited by American environmentalists.</p>
        <p>In a speech earlier this year to the Environmental Grantmakers Association in Washington, Mr. Taylor said: ''It makes no sense for the Federal Government to subsidize environmental destruction on one hand, while establishing laws, regulations and vast bureaucracies to mitigate it on the other.''</p>
