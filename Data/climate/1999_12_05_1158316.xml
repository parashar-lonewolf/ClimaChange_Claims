The proposal calls for the construction of nine capsules that would be airdropped onto the Antarctic ice shelf.

        <p>Italo Calvino devotes the fifth of his ''Six Memos for the Next Millennium'' to what he calls multiplicity -- the idea that literature should encompass the variety, breadth and emotional richness of the modern self. The Ocean project embodies something close to this idea. Using computer software, the designers have molded a series of three-dimensional shapes that would result from wrapping a thin skin of titanium around ceramic capsule containers. The shapes would be different because the contents would be different, but all would be smooth, tactile things embodying doves, porpoises, whipped cream, fine sand, powder snow, the curve of a woman's torso as painted by Ingres.</p>
