        <p>LEAD: Icebergs seem to be breaking away from the Antarctic ice shelves in abnormally large numbers, and the Government's iceberg watchers are wondering whether the trend may be a harbinger of climate changes to come.</p>
        <p>Icebergs seem to be breaking away from the Antarctic ice shelves in abnormally large numbers, and the Government's iceberg watchers are wondering whether the trend may be a harbinger of climate changes to come.</p>
        <p>One giant iceberg, called B-9, drew unusual attention when it broke loose and began drifting northward late last year, removing the equivalent of half a year's snowfall from the continent. B-9 has now run aground on an underwater protrusion, according to Dr. Glenn Rutland of the Navy-National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Joint Ice Center.</p>
        <p>At a recent briefing Dr. Rutledge said B-9 was just the latest of an unusual number of icebergs, although scientists have not been watching Antarctica long enough to be sure how much natural fluctuation there is in iceberg production.</p>
        <p>Climate experts are concerned about the breakup of the ice shelves because it could be a consequence of the rising temperature of the earth's atmosphere. If more water leaves Antarctica in the form of melting water and icebergs than arrives in snow, the sea level will rise.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rutledge said there was not yet enough data to know whether the recent trend would continue. ''The Earth, as a system,'' he said, ''is difficult to predict.''</p>
