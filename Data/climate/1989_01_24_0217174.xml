        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Japan's dispatching of four whaling vessels to the Antarctic, eloquently deplored in ''Japan's Contemptuous Whalers'' (editorial, Dec. 21), demonstrates the weakness of international environmental law and the relative lack of vigor in enforcing it.</p>
        <p>The last year has seen a growth in awareness of global international problems not seen since the late 1960's, brought on by scientific studies measuring global warming, ozone depletion, deforestation, pollution of the oceans and the overall destruction of living resources.</p>
        <p>Mechanisms must be found to make international environmental laws, conventions and treaties stronger - and enforceable - and to enact new ones.</p>
        <p>Unilateral actions aren't enough, as the whaling problem demonstrates. The United States, as a world leader in whaling protection, has banned Japanese fishermen from United States waters. This did not stop Japan from sending four whaling boats to the Antarctic - on what you call a hunting trip -masquerading as a scientific mission.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department must decide whether to ban the import of fish and fish products from Japan, but that could spark a trade war that would hurt the United States more than the Japanese. It's not fair for one country to try to be the world's environmental policeman, and it won't work.</p>
        <p>Leadership in international environmental law is not likely to come from national governments in any case. Traditional international law actually hinders the solution of environmental problems because it is created by nations to govern relations between them. These laws nearly always address complicated political problems. Enforcement is quixotic at best.</p>
        <p>The failure of governments to enforce the Whaling Convention and other breaches of international environmental law are likely to be challenged only by nongovernmental organizations and individuals. The shortcomings of traditional international law provide a great moment for such groups. Organizations like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, having stirred the public's interest in international environmental affairs, must now pursue international legal avenues.</p>
        <p>They must identify the breaches of international law and publicize them. They can help write and get ratifed new, binding international treaties and conventions. They can attempt to take international environmental lawbreakers to the International Court of Justice, the European Court of Justice and other international tribunals. They must inform citizens of international environmental rules so they can enforce them in national courts in all countries.</p>
        <p>The resulting burden on private organizations will be great. The obstacles they confront will be greater. But the problems demand an all-out response, and the success of Amnesty International in using international law to pursue its noble purpose gives reason to hope that a similar attempt can work in environmental matters as well.
