        <p>Day 2 of Genoa Meeting: Policy and Protests  The United States' leading allies told President Bush that they intended to move ahead and ratify the Kyoto Protocol on global warming by next year, even without American participation. Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched toward the city's center, occasionally skirmishing with a watchful police force that took a lower profile on the streets as they struggled to control surging crowds.</p>

        <p>Negotiators from 178 countries moved a step closer to agreement on the final details of the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty rejected by Mr. Bush. The agreement would be the first to require industrialized countries to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.</p>

        <p>Pressures on Mexico Farmers  Peasants are taking to the streets to protest the forces they say undermine their way of life -- from the explosion of free trade under Nafta to plummeting market prices and cuts in government support -- pushing the agricultural industry to the point of civil unrest.</p>

        <p>Move to Oust Indonesia Leader  Indonesia's legislature demanded by a unanimous vote that President Abdurrahman Wahid defend himself on Monday in what is called an accountability speech, as part of the process to remove him from office.

        <p>Hong Kong Ruling Irks China  The Chinese government said it disapproved of a ruling by Hong Kong's highest court that granted residency to a 3-year-old boy born in the territory to a mainland Chinese mother and that rebuffed the government's request to consult Beijing before handing down the ruling.</p>

        <p>Soaring Cost of Drugs Chips at Plan for Elderly  Lawmakers are struggling to deliver a prescription drug benefit for the nation's elderly. But even the most generous benefits now under consideration will probably fall far short of what the elderly expect.

        <p>A Chinatown Within Chinatown  Since immigrants from Fujian Province in China began flooding into the United States, they have built a vibrant refuge for themselves in a grimy corner of Lower Manhattan. Every Monday, the day of rest for Chinese restaurants, Fujianese immigrants from around the country converge there, the one place in their fragmented American universe where everyone speaks their dialect and businesses cater to their needs.</p>
