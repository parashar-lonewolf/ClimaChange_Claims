        <p>Nissan Motor will offer its flagship Maxima sedan with a cleaner-burning diesel engine in the United States by 2010, the company's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said on Wednesday, offering new details of a plan intended to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and help Nissan meet new emissions rules.</p>

        <p>Nissan Motor will offer its flagship Maxima sedan with a cleaner-burning diesel engine in the United States by 2010, the company's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said on Wednesday, offering new details of a plan intended to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and help Nissan meet new emissions rules.</p>
        <p>The timing of Nissan's announcement and a visit here by Mr. Ghosn to meet with lawmakers and lobbyists -- coming as the auto industry faces the possibility of stiffer environmental regulations -- suggests that the automaker is looking to polish its image as a green company.</p>
        <p>Nissan, which would not be the first automaker to offer cleaner diesel technology in the United States, has been slower than other Japanese automakers in developing green technology. While Toyota and Honda have sold gasoline-electric hybrid models for years, Nissan did not begin selling one until January.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ghosn said that consumer tastes and looming federal guidelines gave the company ample reasons to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles.</p>
        <p>''The global automotive industry has a responsibility to be part of the solutions that increase fuel efficiency,'' he said in a speech here at the Council on Foreign Relations. He noted that the diesel Maxima would have up to 30 percent better fuel economy than the standard gasoline version. ''We will be ready to offer our customers what they want.''</p>
        <p>Modern diesel technology, already widespread in Europe, is slowly making its way to the United States. The new engines are a far cry from the coughing, stinking diesel engines of the past, and have lower greenhouse gas emissions and better fuel economy than gasoline engines.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler offers a new-era diesel engine in the Mercedes E-Class, and has plans to start selling a diesel Grand Cherokee this year.</p>
        <p>General Motors, Honda, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW have plans sell diesel engines that meet federal guidelines in the future.</p>
        <p>But diesel engines have been less popular in Japan. Mr. Ghosn said on Wednesday that Nissan plans to sell the new diesel vehicles in Japan and China by 2010.</p>
        <p>Nissan has not said what percentage of its Maxima fleet in the United States or abroad would have diesel engines.</p>
        <p>Daniel F. Becker, director of the Sierra Club's global warming program, said the new engine would allow Nissan to make up for some of its past environmental missteps.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of categories in which Nissan is sort of a laggard among the Japanese leaders,'' he said. ''It's good news that Nissan is trying to find ways to improve its environmental performance. If they follow the lead of Honda and Toyota, it can bring much cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles to market and make more money doing it.''</p>
        <p>With its sales and overall performance in a slump, Nissan is taking a hard look at what does, and does not, sell. ''Consumers want environmentally friendly cars,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''They want to have the pleasure of driving without the guilt.''</p>
        <p>Later, in answer to questions from reporters, Mr. Ghosn made it clear that the company would not buy Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, which is looking at spinning off the money-losing division. ''Some people are a little worried about Nissan,'' he said. ''So you don't want to engage in anything like this.''</p>
        <p>He declined to address why the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz did not seem to be working. Mr. Ghosn has faced questions himself about whether the alliance of Nissan and the French carmaker Renault is a failure.</p>
        <p>''If you want to know the reality, you have to be inside,'' he said, adding that even from the inside, it is not always easy to tell why the business is stumbling. ''The execution of alliances is something that's extremely delicate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghosn also offered his thoughts on the troubles in the American auto industry, which he said are probably cyclical.</p>
        <p>''We are used to hitting bumps and reflecting on them,'' he said. ''Hitting bumps is normal in our industry.'' He added: ''The mistake is to say, 'Don't worry. There's no problem.' ''</p>
