        <p>MORE than three billion acres of land, amounting to 11 percent of the world's vegetated surface area, have become seriously degraded since World War II, an environmental research group has reported.</p>

        <p>MORE than three billion acres of land, amounting to 11 percent of the world's vegetated surface area, have become seriously degraded since World War II, an environmental research group has reported.</p>
        <p>The soils, mostly in Asia and Africa, have lost much of their capacity to produce crops or lumber or support livestock, the group, the World Resources Institute in Washington, said in a report last week. In total, they represent an area the size of China and India together.</p>
        <p>"Soil that you can't produce crops on anymore is real serious business," said Robert Livernash, senior editor of the report. "This is an alarm bell."  Survey of Scientists</p>
        <p>The study by the World Resources Institute drew on data from more than 250 soil scientists about levels of erosion, salinization, and physical destruction in the world's soils. Major causes of damage include farming, overgrazing and deforestation, the study said.</p>
        <p>More than a third of the degraded area is in Asia, where severe water erosion has destroyed soils in western India, the Himalayas, Southeast Asia and China, and wind erosion threatens western China and Mongolia.</p>
        <p>Nearly half of Asia's damaged soils were degraded by deforestation and a quarter by overgrazing and most of the rest by agriculture.</p>
        <p>When fields become unproductive, farmers often abandon them for newly cleared lands, making soil degradation a major contributor to loss of forests worldwide.</p>
        <p>"I rank this as the No. 1 environmental problem in the world," said Dr. David Pimentel, professor of entomology and agricultural sciences at Cornell University.</p>
        <p>"Ninety-eight percent of the world's food for people comes from the land as opposed to the sea or rivers or all the rest," he said. "When we degrade this land we get deforestation. We get losses in biodiversity. We get global warming." Very Slow Process</p>
        <p>Dr. Pimentel said the problem of soil degradation received too little attention. "Even farmers don't appreciate the degradation that is occurring because it occurs so slowly," he said.</p>
        <p>A farmer can lose one twenty-fifth of an inch of soil in one good rain storm at night, which is more than five tons of topsoil on a single acre.</p>
        <p>"The next morning a farmer wouldn't notice that," Dr. Pimentel said. "But about 20 years after this you'd have lost one inch of topsoil, which takes 500 years to reform."</p>
        <p>Though soil quality has degraded since 1945, agricultural productivity has risen because of better crop varieties, irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides. But productivity could have been higher had soil quality been maintained.</p>
        <p>For instance, farms in the hilly Palouse area of eastern Washington State are estimated to have lost more than 500 pounds of winter wheat per acre because heavy erosion has impoverished their soils. No Hope for Some Lands</p>
        <p>Most of the three billion damaged acres can be restored to full productivity only with major and often costly improvements. More than 22 million of those acres have had their biotic functions fully destroyed so that no amount of effort will restore them.</p>
        <p>While many farmers own the land they work and are committed to harvesting from it for the long term, it is often not in their economic interest to invest in conservation or restoration.</p>
        <p>In fact, on very fertile lands, an individual farmer may not benefit at all from conservation practices. The World Resources Institute report suggests that it is therefore up to governments to tackle the issue.</p>
        <p>"We already know a lot of different ways to solve these problems," Mr. Livernash said, "but it's really a question of having the money and the political will to do it. There are lots of techniques to restore degraded lands or to reduce or prevent soil erosion."</p>
        <p>Study results were reported in "World Resources 1992-93," published by the World Resources Institute, P.O. Box 4852, Hampden Station, Baltimore, Md. 21211.</p>
