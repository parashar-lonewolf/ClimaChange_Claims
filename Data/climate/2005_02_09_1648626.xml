        <p>Two enormous industrial complexes in Brooklyn have begun receiving some of their energy from power generated by 20 windmills near Syracuse, city officials said, under the largest wind power purchase by the city so far.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, set to be announced today, the city's Economic Development Corporation is purchasing 3.7 million kilowatt-hours of wind power from ConEdison Solutions, a subsidiary of the conventional-electric company.

        <p>Two enormous industrial complexes in Brooklyn have begun receiving some of their energy from power generated by 20 windmills near Syracuse, city officials said, under the largest wind power purchase by the city so far.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, set to be announced today, the city's Economic Development Corporation is purchasing 3.7 million kilowatt-hours of wind power from ConEdison Solutions, a subsidiary of the conventional-electric company. The energy, roughly what is needed to power about 900 city residences for a year, will be used to meet 12 percent of the annual power needs for Bush Terminal and the Brooklyn Army Terminal, manufacturing and office centers that total five million square feet, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''Every kilowatt-hour of green, renewable power used in the city proportionally reduces the need for generating energy by power plants using fossil fuels, thereby reducing air pollution,'' said Gil C. Quiniones, senior vice president of energy and telecommunications at the Economic Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>The reduction in power plant emissions as a result of the Brooklyn energy purchase would be the equivalent of reducing automobile use by about 3.5 million miles a year, said Philip Herman, managing director of business development at ConEdison Solutions.</p>
        <p>Historically, the city has bought renewable energy in the form of hydroelectric power, Mr. Quiniones said. And as the city continues to look for ways to reduce its dependence on traditional power plants, it is also pursuing other energy alternatives, including the use of fuel cells in water pollution control plants. In addition, it plans to install solar panels this year at the Bronx High School of Science and the New York Hall of Science in Queens.</p>
        <p>But as the cost of wind energy in New York State has decreased over the last few years, Mr. Quiniones said, it has become among the most promising of the new technologies.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping that we are able to lead by example'' to encourage more businesses and institutions to turn to renewable energy sources like wind, he said. Towns and cities around the region have been considering buying wind-generated power or bringing in wind turbines, and real estate developers have increasingly been looking to build so-called green complexes.</p>
        <p>''The more people that buy renewable energy, there's economies of scale,'' Mr. Quiniones said, ''and hopefully that will spur innovation.''</p>
