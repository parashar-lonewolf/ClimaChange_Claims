        <p>Ned Lamont has become a political sensation in Connecticut by being a multimillionaire who wants the troops out of Iraq. But he would love, love to get people talking about other things than his wealth or the war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont breezed past Iraq the other night at a fund-raiser in Stamford for his campaign against Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. Instead he delved into Israel, jobs, Terri Schiavo, and his beef with Don Imus, the radio talk show host, who recently called Mr. Lamont a ''bug-eyed pencil neck geek.''</p>
        <p>''Imus is incredibly popular here in Fairfield County, so I have to deal with that,'' Mr. Lamont said in an interview afterward. ''People need to know the real me, not just the war and the money, if I'm going to pull this off.''</p>
        <p>In just four months Mr. Lamont has upended the Democratic status quo by coming from nowhere (well, the Greenwich Board of Selectmen) to mount an energetic bid to topple Mr. Lieberman, who was his party's nominee for vice president in 2000. Having stoked voter anger over the senator's support for the war in Iraq, Mr. Lamont is also trying to score points by portraying Mr. Lieberman as neglectful on local issues and overly friendly with the Bush White House.</p>
        <p>In the process, Mr. Lamont has become a darling of the antiwar left, receiving donations from Barbra Streisand, the philanthropist and financier George Soros, and 20,000 other people, including untold numbers of liberal bloggers. Indeed, more than other insurgent candidates this year, he represents the soul-searching among Democrats over the way forward in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''This is the campaign where prowar Democrats and antiwar Democrats may sort themselves out on Iraq,'' said Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee for president in 1988. He is neutral in the race, but has supported Mr. Lieberman in the past and recently spoke to Mr. Lamont about regional rail policy.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it is about Lamont,'' Mr. Dukakis said, ''but he seems to offer a straight choice that is causing a lot of Democrats to think through Iraq.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, Mr. Lamont is an accidental politician, complete with the boyish facial reactions and sheer earnestness that helped draw Mr. Imus's derision. (The host is a fan of Mr. Lieberman.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont wears moderately priced suits from Jos. A. Bank and, at 52, still uses words like heck and poppycock. He quit an exclusive country club in Greenwich this year, saying it was too white and too rich and he did not want it to become a campaign issue. He was not even his own first choice to challenge Mr. Lieberman; he tried to coax others -- he will not name names -- but they thought running against a three-term senator was foolhardy, he said.</p>
        <p>So, finding no takers, Mr. Lamont entered the race in March.</p>
        <p>With national reporters now traveling here to cover him, and his unlimited advertising budget giving Mr. Lieberman agita, Mr. Lamont has concluded that he might just beat the senator in the Democratic primary on Aug. 8 -- as long as voters see him as credible, not just as a single-issue rich guy trying to buy an election.</p>
        <p>Iraq, in other words, may not be enough, Mr. Lamont says. More and more he is trying to round out his profile, pressing his ideas for universal preschool and his work as a guest instructor at a public high school in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>He is also bringing up the other reasons he decided to run for Senate, sometimes out of the blue, such as the death of Ms. Schiavo.</p>
        <p>When her health began deteriorating in Florida last year, Mr. Lieberman emerged as one of a few Democrats in Congress who supported government intervention to keep her alive, on a feeding tube, against her husband's wishes.</p>
        <p>''The last place I want my government is in my hospital room,'' Mr. Lamont said.</p>
        <p>He has been on a steep learning curve ever since he entered the race. Blogs, for instance, were news to him. He had not heard of the Daily Kos until a voter mentioned it, even though it is a widely read political blog that has cheered Mr. Lamont on as a David against Mr. Lieberman's Goliath. ''I was like, 'Daily what?' '' Mr. Lamont recalled.</p>
        <p>Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the Daily Kos, said in an interview by e-mail message that he would have been more surprised if Mr. Lamont had heard of the Web site.</p>
        <p>''For whatever reason, people think Lamont's candidacy is 100 percent blog-driven, when the reality is much different,'' Mr. Moulitsas wrote. ''Blogs are merely feeding off the excitement Lamont is generating in the grass roots.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont has struck a chord with some voters by portraying Mr. Lieberman as out of touch, someone who is a national political figure instead of a leader in Connecticut, who appears on television more than he marches in local parades. It is a tactic common among underdog challengers, but there is a crucial difference in this race: Money.</p>
        <p>The candidate can tap a personal fortune of between $90 million and $300 million, according to campaign financial disclosures; advisers estimate his wealth at some $200 million.</p>
        <p>A scion of bankers at J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., Mr. Lamont said that he grew up with a trust fund -- he would not disclose its size -- but that his inheritance accounted for less than 10 percent of his current wealth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont used a bank loan in 1984 to start Lamont Digital Systems, a Greenwich telecommunications company that wires college campuses. It is privately held and has shrunk to about 40 employees today from 100 in 2001. Mr. Lamont drew a salary of $546,044 in 2005, and is now a minority shareholder.</p>
        <p>His wife, Annie Lamont, is a partner in Oak Investment Partners in Westport; according to the disclosure forms, one of her Oak holdings is valued at between $25 million and $50 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont has declined to publicly disclose several years of tax returns, despite pressure from Mr. Lieberman, but said he planned to release his 2005 returns shortly.</p>
        <p>He has already given his campaign $2.5 million, and said in an interview that he was willing to spend millions more. His ads have memorably painted Mr. Lieberman as out of touch and a Bush soul mate, including one in which the senator's face morphs into the president's.</p>
        <p>The challenge has unnerved Mr. Lieberman, friends of the senator say, so much so that he has announced he will run as an independent in the fall general election if Democrats shun him next month.</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Lieberman try to paint Mr. Lamont as a power-hungry opportunist who voted with Republicans as a Greenwich selectman but is now posing as a liberal to woo the most strident voters, who are more likely to vote on a hot summer day. These advisers also accuse him of trying to buy the election.</p>
        <p>''He was born into privilege and believes it's his birthright to go right to the top as a U.S. senator,'' said Sean Smith, Mr. Lieberman's campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont grew up in Syosset, N.Y., in a family that had long been involved in business and usually voted Republican; a great-grandfather, Thomas Lamont, was a chairman of J. P. Morgan, though a great-uncle, Corliss Lamont, was a well-known socialist. Mr. Lamont attended Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard, and the Yale school of management before moving to Greenwich. He and his wife, Annie, have three teenage children, two girls and a boy.</p>
        <p>For years the Lamonts were members of the Round Hill country club in Greenwich, but Mr. Lamont said he resigned his membership because he did not want it to become a distraction in his campaign. Mr. Lamont said the club excluded people because it was so expensive, and also said he was ''a little bit'' concerned that many of its members werewhite.</p>
        <p>''It's not as diverse as it should be,'' Mr. Lamont said. ''I didn't pay as much attention to that before the race began, to tell you the truth.</p>
        <p>''They don't have any discriminatory policies,'' he added.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that his only major stint in public service was born out of boredom, when he decided in 1987 to run for the Board of Selectmen. He served only one term, but continued to dabble in politics, supporting the presidential campaigns of Mr. Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Bill Bradley, and, in 2004, Bob Graham at first, and then Howard Dean and John Kerry.</p>
        <p>His political donations have included a total of $1,500 to Mr. Lieberman since the fall of 2002, when the senator voted to support military action in Iraq; $1,000 of it went to the senator's presidential campaign in 2003, before Mr. Lieberman quit the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont said those donations did not suggest he once favored the war; he believes Mr. Lieberman, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and others were misled by the White House on Iraq. Rather, Mr. Lamont said he soured on Mr. Lieberman's unremitting defense of the war and of President Bush.</p>
        <p>''The president rushed us into this war based on false assumptions, like W.M.D., and Senator Lieberman has cheered him on all the way,'' he said, indulging in a bit of hyperbole, since Mr. Lieberman votes like other Democrats most of the time.</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Lieberman say that Mr. Lamont has been callow on Iraq. At first the challenger was reluctant to endorse an immediate troop withdrawal; as liberals embraced him, he has became more full-throated. As the recent Senate debate on Iraq was unfolding, Mr. Lamont said he favored a plan by Senators John Kerry and Russ Feingold to set a firm exit date for troops -- yet he also said he was comfortable with another Democratic plan that did not have a timetable.</p>
        <p>The Lieberman campaign accused him of trying to have it both ways, but Mr. Lamont said he was being a pragmatist. ''Deadline, time frame, whatever words you want -- just get the troops out,'' he said. ''In business we have deadlines all the time, we operate well with deadlines.''</p>
        <p>If he makes it to Washington, Mr. Lamont said, he hopes to become known as an advocate for preschool education, much as Al Gore became associated with global warming. Before hopping into his Ford Escape Hybrid recently, Mr. Lamont cited Mr. Gore as one of his heroes in politics -- though not because he chose Mr. Lieberman as his running mate six years ago.</p>
        <p>''Gore spoke about something bigger than himself -- global warming and the environment,'' Mr. Lamont said. ''I'm trying to get Democrats to think in a bigger way about Iraq, if I can. And schools and jobs and health care, too.''</p>
