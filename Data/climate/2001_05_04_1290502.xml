        <p>Citing a growing concern about global warming, the Entergy Corporation, one of the nation's largest electric power generators, announced yesterday that it planned to cap its emissions of carbon dioxide over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Entergy's decision comes weeks after President Bush reversed a campaign pledge to regulate the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants -- a reaction, many analysts said, to pressure from the utility industry.</p>
        <p>Opponents of emission controls argued that the cost would damage the industry and the economy.</p>
        <p>But industry experts and some environmental advocates said yesterday that Entergy's shift showed that the industry's views on climate change were not monolithic.</p>
        <p>''It is incumbent upon every individual and business to take voluntary initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the risks we face today,'' said J. Wayne Leonard, the company's chief executive. ''Entergy's program will demonstrate that companies can do the right thing while remaining competitive and profitable.''</p>
        <p>Entergy, which is based in New Orleans and operates plants in six states, took pains to note that its decision was not meant as a slap at the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>The company's plan would cap its carbon dioxide emissions at last year's levels over the next five years, despite plans to significantly increase its power generation. About 17,500 megawatts of the electricity that Entergy generates in the United States is from fossil fuels, and it expects to increase that capacity by 5,000 megawatts over the next five years, mainly by building natural- gas-fired plants.</p>
        <p>The company estimated that it released about 50 million tons of carbon dioxide last year. Without the cap, new plants would add 5.5 million tons to its emissions. The pledge does not affect Entergy's nuclear plants, including the Indian Point 3 plant in New York, or its foreign holdings.</p>
        <p>Entergy shares rose 20 cents yesterday, to $40.45, on a day when power company stocks generally were lower.</p>
        <p>The company plans to work with Environmental Defense, an advocacy group based in New York, to develop its emissions reduction program. It will also be the first American power company to join the Partnership for Climate Action, a group including DuPont, BP Amoco and Royal Dutch/Shell, that has pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 80 million metric tons annually by 2010.</p>
        <p>Entergy is still trying to figure out how it will cut emissions. The company said that 80 percent of the reductions would come from its operations and the remainder from trading emissions credits -- essentially paying others not to pollute.</p>
        <p>Utilities in the Energy Department's Climate Challenge program sought to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 47.6 million metric tons by last year. Industry experts say Entergy's plans up the ante and may prompt other power companies to take similar steps.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Entergy said Mr. Leonard had been studying arguments about climate change for some time but decided to cap the company's emissions after listening to scientists at a conference on global warming that Entergy sponsored in New Orleans last September.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates offered cautious praise for Entergy's decision, with one activist noting that global warming is a crucial issue in Louisiana.</p>
        <p>''We're so low in the water here in Louisiana that we will be among the first and worst affected as seas rise,'' said Gary Groesch, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy in New Orleans.</p>
