        <p>In a novel legal action, the City Councils of Oakland, Calif., and Boulder, Colo., have voted to join Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace in a lawsuit charging two federal agencies with failing to conduct environmental reviews before financing projects that the cities say contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit contends that the agencies -- the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation -- have provided $32 billion in financing and insurance over the last 10 years for fossil-fuel extraction projects overseas like oil fields, pipelines and coal-fired power plants without assessing the contribution those projects make to global warming.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the two federal agencies, which provide financing for American corporations for projects that commercial banks often deem too risky, said they could not comment on the specifics of the lawsuit because they were in litigation but they said they followed good environmental practices.</p>
        <p>Mayor Jerry Brown of Oakland, who is a former governor of California and a former presidential candidate, said in an interview today that the suit was necessary because ''there's been such an abject failure on the part of the Bush administration to protect the people of this country from the seriously deleterious effects of climate disruption.''</p>
        <p>The Oakland city council, which voted on Dec. 17 to join the suit, contends that global warming could cause the sea levels to rise, putting the city's groundwater aquifers at risk of saltwater contamination and threatening to flood the airport and sewer systems.</p>
        <p>Mayor Will Toor of Boulder, said in a statement that Boulder officials, who voted to join the suit in August, were disturbed by predictions that global warming would bring more rain and less snow, which could threaten water availability in much of the West, where the water supply relies on gradual melting of the annual snowpack.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Toor said that predictions of severe drought could require water restrictions and might mean an increased risk of wildfires, which could affect not only human life but the city budget to the tune of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration, which rejected joining the Kyoto Treaty on climate change, has been increasingly criticized for its climate policy, even though last year President Bush accepted findings by a panel of American experts that most of the global warming in recent decades had been caused by human activity.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Bush set a climate policy that until 2012 would rely on voluntary measures by industries to slow growth in emissions of carbon dioxide and the other heat-trapping gases. He said more research was needed to clarify the potential environmental risks of warming before stronger measures were taken, although White House officials said recently that they might speed up their timetable in seeking compliance.</p>
        <p>Bo Ollison, a spokesman for the Export-Import bank, said that the bank had followed all necessary procedures in its projects. ''The bank is very confident that we apply all rules, laws and regulations, including N.E.P.A., whenever we do a transaction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Spinelli, a spokesman for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, said, ''All projects OPIC supports must meet the strictest environmental standards.'' He added, ''Project sponsors must provide environmental impact assessments, major projects are posted on the OPIC Web site to allow for public comment, and, where appropriate, OPIC's environmental staff will actually visit the host country of a potential project to conduct due diligence.''</p>
        <p>The suit, however, filed in United States District Court in San Francisco, says the two agencies have refused to review the fossil-fuel projects they are involved in for their effects on climate change and that such reviews are required by the federal government.</p>
        <p>''The case law is clear,'' said Brian Dunkiel, a Vermont lawyer representing the environmental groups and the cities. The National Environmental Policy Act, he said, ''requires agencies to look at the impacts of their activities if a decision is made in the United States and the activity causes impact on the United States or on the global commons,'' meaning Antarctica and the international oceans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunkiel added, ''The agencies say there is no significant impact, but they have made that determination without doing an environmental assessment.''</p>
        <p>He said the suit targets these two relatively obscure federal agencies because the fossil-fuel projects that they finance account for the release of significant carbon dioxide emissions, both agencies ''have virtually completely evaded all'' National Environmental Policy Act review, and they were both designated by the administration as playing a major role in the Bush/Cheney energy plan.</p>
        <p>The suit seeks to have the agencies conduct the environmental reviews on their future energy projects so that their claims of no significant impact can be scrutinized.</p>
