        <p>To the Editor: The cover story ''Patagonia in a New Light'' (March 4) undervalues scientists' views on climate change and glacial retreat a bit too much and too often.</p>
        <p>Having never visited Patagonia before, perhaps the glacial retreat situation there wasn't very obvious to the writer. He might want to consider other sites in the Andes, such as Peru's Quelccaya ice cap, where land beneath the glacier has been exposed for the first time in at least 5,000 years, and where the melting has accelerated in the last 30 years to the point that thousands of years of ice could disappear within just a few years.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it is difficult to make the connection between warming in the last 150 years to ice that has been around for thousands, but most scientists will agree that you can attribute receding glaciers to an increase in global temperatures.</p>
