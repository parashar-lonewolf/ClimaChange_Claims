        <p>U.S. TO RENEW TIES WITH LIBYA -- The Bush administration announced that it would re-establish full diplomatic ties with Libya, which is led by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. While Libya is a major oil-producing state, a State Department official insisted: ''This decision is not undertaken because Libya has oil.'' [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>BAUSCH TO STOP PRODUCT'S SALE -- Bausch &amp; Lomb said that it was halting sales of a soft-contact lens cleaner because tests showed that misuse could lead to an infection, and possibly blindness. [C1.]</p>
        <p>HOSTILE TAKEOVERS -- Mike Matthews, a sound-effects designer and onetime promoter of Jimi Hendrix, bought a Russian factory making vacuum tubes for guitar amplifiers. But he has encountered a problem increasingly common in Russia: someone is trying to steal his company. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BELLSOUTH DISPUTES REPORT -- BellSouth said that it had not shared customer calling records with the National Security Agency, denying a report last week that it was among three major telephone companies to have done so. [A18.]</p>
        <p>HEART DEVICE SAFETY -- Two major producers of heart devices, Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, responding to a report critical of the industry's oversight of product safety, said they planned to broaden how they conduct such reviews. [C3.]</p>
        <p>ENRON TRIAL -- During closing arguments at the Enron fraud trial in Houston, a prosecutor accused two former Enron chief executives of ''extraordinary arrogance'' and called them ''masters of the cover story'' who pushed the rules and crossed the line into illegality. [C1.]</p>
        <p>YUAN GAINS -- China allowed its currency to strengthen past the symbolic level of eight yuan to the dollar, rattling Asian markets. [C1.]</p>
        <p>WI-FI IN THE PARK -- New York officials set a July deadline for a city contractor to have a wireless network up and running in Central Park, in what would be a major expansion of free Internet access. [B3.]</p>
        <p>STOCKS RISE -- Stocks advanced as a plunge in oil and metals prices eased concern that accelerating inflation would drive the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 47.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 11,428.77. [C15.]</p>
        <p>CARBON MARKET -- The European carbon trading market, hailed as a way to curb global warming, has suffered nose dives, missteps and misreadings that have led to a clamor for major change. Market Place. [C1.]</p>
        <p>EBAY PATENT DISPUTE -- The Supreme Court sent the long-running patent dispute between eBay and MercExchange back to the lower federal courts. [C1.]</p>
        <p>RACING THE CLOCK -- After procrastinating for weeks, Medicare beneficiaries flocked to centers for the elderly around the country and made frantic telephone calls to insurers to beat the deadline for getting prescription drug coverage. [A19.]</p>
        <p>BOEING SETTLEMENT -- Boeing, the nation's No. 2 military contractor, has agreed to pay $615 million under a tentative deal with federal prosecutors that will allow it to avoid criminal charges. The agreement would end a three-year investigation into wrongdoing by Boeing employees. [C3.]</p>
        <p>ABC ADDS TO SCHEDULE -- ABC, which has some of television's biggest hits, and some misses, will announce a new prime-time schedule populated with a raft of new series. [E1.]</p>
        <p>LOOKING BEYOND TV -- Eager to improve its ratings and advertising sales, NBC is counting on digital media as much as television for a comeback in the 2006-7 season. Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C10.]</p>
        <p>'CODE' UNDER WRAPS -- In contemporary Hollywood, to release a movie without first having it undergo test screenings is fairly rare. For one like Sony's ''Da Vinci Code,'' it is close to unprecedented. But to preserve a climate of mystery and excitement around the movie, that has been the studio's course. [E1.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>VIDEO: THE ENRON TRIAL -- Paula Dwyer, deputy business editor; Kurt Eichenwald, investigative reporter; and Joe Nocera, business columnist, discuss the trial of Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling at nytimes.com/enron.</p>
