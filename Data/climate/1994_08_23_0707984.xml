        <p>THE perpetual whine around one's ears and the repeated slaps at the persistent airborne pests were like a retrospective weather report. It was precisely 10 days after a major thunderstorm had drenched the St. Croix River valley and the latest opportunistic crop of those infamous summer-spoilers -- mosquitoes -- had hurried through their transformation from egg to larva to pupa, producing bloodthirsty adult females intent on guaranteeing a next generation.</p>
        <p>Here in Minnesota, where T-shirts sporting chest-sized mosquitoes call the insect the "state bird," it is little comfort to know that to a mosquito, human blood is second-rate, less tasty than that from birds and even buffalo.</p>
        <p>But at least one Minnesotan, Dr. Roger D. Moon, an entomologist, says the time has come to appreciate this adaptable creature for what it is. The world's 3,500 species of mosquitoes -- 51 of them in Minnesota and 57 in New York State -- live in deserts, rain-filled hoofprints, tree holes, pitcher plants, puddles created by melting snow, old tires, empty cans and flower pots as well as in more traditional wetlands. Any animal with blood -- even those with thick fur or feathers, tough hides or limited skin area, like turtles -- is likely to be attacked by one or more mosquito species.</p>
        <p>"Mosquitoes have survived because they have evolved different ways to make a living, to get what they need to reproduce," explained Dr. Moon, who has been studying the subject for more than a decade. Understanding the evolution and biology of mosquitoes and the ecology of human-mosquito interactions is crucial to preventing the social and environmental devastation that can result from a surge in mosquito-borne diseases.</p>
        <p>The malaria-bearing anopheles mosquito still resides in the United States and has caused recent outbreaks in California. The tree-hole mosquito, Aedes triseriatus, is a vector of La Crosse encephalitis, a brain infection with a mortality rate of about 30 percent. The mosquito picks up the virus from infected birds. Although the virus replicates in birds and mosquitoes, it does not make those hosts sick. But people bitten by a virus-carrying mosquito can become fatally ill, even though humans are dead-end hosts in which the virus does not reproduce well enough to help it survive, Dr. Moon said.</p>
        <p>Even more worrisome is the recently introduced Asian tiger mosquito -- named for its stripes, not its ferocity -- which is proving to be an indiscriminate incubator for human pathogens. In the South, it has transmitted dengue, also called breakbone fever because it makes people feel as if their bones are breaking, and perhaps Eastern equine encephalitis, which has a fatality rate of 50 to 80 percent and leaves half its survivors with brain damage.</p>
        <p>The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, although primarily a tropical species, has already adapted to Chicago winters by evolving changes in its biological clock to help protect it from cold. Dr. William A. Hawley, working at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, showed that the eggs of temperate-zone tiger mosquitoes, instead of hatching after they are laid, go into diapause -- the insect version of hibernation -- as winter approaches. That happens earlier in the fall in more northern habitats, protecting the eggs from early frost, because the insect's biological clock triggers diapause at longer day lengths as the species spreads northward.</p>
        <p>"In only a few years, the mosquito's biological clock had evolved to track local climatic conditions," Dr. Hawley wrote in Natural History magazine. The species even briefly took up residence in Minneapolis, where winter temperatures of 20 degrees below zero are not uncommon. But the breeding population was wiped out by quick local action: a blast of insecticide and the elimination of a huge lot of old tires imported from Japan for retreading.</p>
        <p>"We should have done the same all over the country when the Asian tiger mosquito was first detected," said Dr. George Craig, an entomologist at the University of Notre Dame and a specialist in mosquito-borne diseases. "But the threat wasn't taken seriously and now this mosquito, which acts like a natural test tube for deadly viruses, has become a common pest, infesting every county in Georgia and Florida, many Southern and Midwestern states and now in the East, in Delaware, Baltimore and Pennsylvania."</p>
        <p>In addition to its talents for breeding viruses, the Asian tiger mosquito is an eclectic daytime feeder, capable of creating repositories of life-threatening infection in birds, rodents, farm animals and pets, increasing the chances of spreading disease to people.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, no mosquito can transmit H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Instead of multiplying in mosquitoes, as encephalitis viruses do, H.I.V. is digested in the mosquito's gut, so there is no virus available to contaminate the saliva mosquitoes inject when they bite.</p>
        <p>Dr. Moon put it this way: "If you are sitting next to an infected person with a swarm of mosquitoes all around you, you'd be likely to die of blood loss before a mosquito would spread the virus to you." Feasting on Blood</p>
        <p>The nation's most common mosquito pest, appropriately named Aedes vexans, is just a nuisance and not a disease vector, Dr. Moon noted while he and his visitor strolled through a wooded area on the University of Minnesota's St. Paul campus. It was not long before the subject of his discourse alighted on his arm. He allowed the mosquito to bounce around like a lunar module looking for a suitable landing site until she found a hairless spot on his hand. Dr. Moon said, "When a person slaps a mosquito and says triumphantly, 'Got him,' it's really, 'Got her.' The males don't even bother to land on you."</p>
        <p>The mosquito's proboscis quickly drilled into a surface capillary and she began filling her belly with blood. As she fed, she salivated, injecting an anesthetic and anticoagulant into Dr. Moon's hand to help insure an uninterrupted meal. A long minute or two later, the satiated mosquito, her abdomen red and swollen, drifted off, almost too heavy to fly, to a sanctuary where she could concentrate the protein in the blood and disgorge the watery remains.</p>
        <p>No one knows why mosquitoes may appear to prefer one person over another. Carbon dioxide, the gas prominent in exhaled air, acts as a distant attractant, Dr. Moon explained, and mosquitoes have sensors that detect color and motion. They prefer dark colors and are sensitive to odors, Dr. Moon said, adding, "If the right olfactory cues are not there, the mosquito will get up and search elsewhere." Laboratory experiments have shown that mosquitoes prefer warm body parts to cold ones, that they are drawn to lactic acid in sweat and breath and that they respond to certain hormones and amino acids in body fluids. Menstruating women are avoided.  Attracting Mosquitoes</p>
        <p>Experts say that there is little evidence that mosquitoes are drawn more to some people than to others.  Some people react more vigorously to the allergenic ingredients in mosquito saliva. In fact, in most people, mosquito bites resemble desensitizing allergy shots; as the mosquito season progresses, victims react less and less to the bites.</p>
        <p>Different species use different strategies to find their hosts. According to studies by a Japanese zoologist, Dr. Masahiko Nishimura, some are patrollers, who fly around looking for blood-filled targets, while others are pouncers, who wait for unsuspecting passers-by. "These are the same two strategies large predators use to find their prey: stalking and ambush," Dr. Moon pointed out.</p>
        <p>Female mosquitoes mate only once, storing a lifetime of sperm in an abdominal sac called a spermatheca. In most species, the females must then take in a blood meal to produce 125 or so eggs, which are fertilized en route to being laid. The process can be repeated one or more times over her lifetime. The eggs can survive for years in dry areas, waiting to hatch into larvae when the site becomes flooded. The larvae feed on microorganisms on the bottom of their watery home.</p>
        <p>In most species, the larvae must surface periodically to breathe by punching through the water's surface with a respiratory siphon at their rear end. Once near the surface, mosquito larvae are easy pickings for such wetland wildlife as minnows and small fish, frogs, reptiles, wading birds, pregnant ducks, dragonflies and an aggressive carnivorous insect called a backswimmer.</p>
        <p>The cattail mosquito's larvae stay in relative safety near the bottom. They use an armored siphon to punch holes in cattail roots and breathe air bubbles through them. This common mosquito, an early evening feeder, is thought to be the East Coast vector for Eastern equine encephalitis, Dr. Moon said.</p>
        <p>Adult mosquitoes are eaten by bats and birds, so they are important in the food chain. And since all male adult mosquitoes and newly emerging females rely on plant nectar for sustenance, they are important pollinators, particularly for certain orchids. Selective Controls</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Erik Kiviat, executive director of Hudsonia, an environmental organization at the Bard College Field Station in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., when communities begin mosquito-control programs, they should consider the value of these insects as pollinators as well as the impact of control measures on beneficial species. "We need to reduce nuisance mosquito bites and disease transmission with a minimum impact on wetlands, birds, amphibians, fishes, pollinators, plants and other organisms," he wrote in the organization's newsletter.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kiviat said two popular methods of mosquito control were nontoxic or relatively so to other animals and plants: methoprene, a growth-regulating hormone that disrupts the development of mosquito larvae, and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, or BTI, a bacterium that kills larvae when they consume it along with food particles.</p>
        <p>Another biological technique involves introducing fish that preferentially dine on mosquito larvae, although this method has sometimes backfired when the fish drove out other desirable species, like frogs and salamanders. Dr. Kiviat said more promising biological controls might use smaller predators and parasites of mosquito larvae, like fungi, protozoa, nematodes, tadpole shrimp, dragonflies and -- for the supreme insult -- the cannabalistic mosquito, Toxorhynchites.</p>
