        <p>The three dozen supporters at the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion should have been a piece of cake for Attorney General Robert Abrams. His abortion-rights stand is a strong political card. Yet even here it was not straightforward. "Why aren't you saying more on abortion?" asked a contributor. "Why are we getting clouded up?"</p>
        <p>"I didn't think I'd have to repeat my record for this group," said Mr. Abrams, flushing. "Every stop I make, I mention I'm pro-choice, it's one of the three cornerstones of my campaign."</p>

        <p>The three dozen supporters at the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion should have been a piece of cake for Attorney General Robert Abrams. His abortion-rights stand is a strong political card. Yet even here it was not straightforward. "Why aren't you saying more on abortion?" asked a contributor. "Why are we getting clouded up?"</p>
        <p>"I didn't think I'd have to repeat my record for this group," said Mr. Abrams, flushing. "Every stop I make, I mention I'm pro-choice, it's one of the three cornerstones of my campaign."</p>
        <p>For Mr. Abrams, it has been a campaign where his message is constantly "clouded up." His opponent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, has often controlled the agenda. The Senator has raised twice as much money as Mr. Abrams, who still devotes half his day to fund-raising. It's hard for Mr. Abrams not to hear himself being attacked when he turns on the radio or TV.</p>
        <p>During an hourlong interview en route to a news conference Thursday, Mr. Abrams mainly answered questions in campaign jargon. Even with easy questions he was cautious. Asked what it was like battling a Senator who had voted with President Bush 80 percent of the time and yet now touts his similarities with Bill Clinton, Mr. Abrams answered: "I feel like I'm living in a surreal world -- is that proper grammar?"</p>
        <p>He grew animated, when asked about Senator D'Amato's negative ads. "That reminds me," he said to his aide. "I heard a new D'Amato commercial. We've got to get a copy. 'Fact: Bob Abrams will raise Medicare taxes on old people. Fact: Bob Abrams will do this. Fact! Fact! Fact!' None of it's true. It sounds like I hate old people, but all I hear is, 'Fact! Fact! Fact!' "</p>
        <p>His next stop should have been easy, a sidewalk news conference to blast Mr. D'Amato's work on the Senate banking committee. But there was Senator D'Amato's press aide, Zenia Mucha, holding her own impromptu news conference beside Mr. Abrams's news conference.</p>
        <p>"We don't do this to you," said an Abrams aide.</p>
        <p>"Aren't I free to speak?" said Ms. Mucha. Another D'Amato staff member stood among reporters, asking Mr. Abrams loaded questions. Mr. Abrams spent much of his news conference with a miserable, frozen smile.</p>
        <p>The Attorney General, a Democrat, hasn't had much luck selling even his best assets. In 1990 the National Association of Attorneys General voted him the best in America. "He created the modern Attorney General's office that's public policy oriented," says the group's president, Jeffrey Amestoy, a Republican who is Attorney General of Vermont. "Offices across the country look to New York." Yet Mr. Abrams's ads do not mention the award.</p>
        <p>Eric Goldstein, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, says Mr. Abrams's office led challenges in the Reagan and Bush years, forcing tougher standards on acid rain and incinerator emissions. Matthew Diller of the Legal Aid Society, says Mr. Abrams has been "virtually unique" in fighting for grants that the Bush Administration withheld from the poor, forcing the release of $200 million to New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams started a criminal division. Edward McDonald, a former Federal prosecutor and an expert on organized crime, credits the Attorney General for first spotting "massive tax fraud" by the Mafia in the gasoline industry. "They saw it before we did," he says.</p>
        <p>And yet in the press you hear Senator D'Amato's charges more loudly: that Mr. Abrams procrastinated for days before taking a position on the Persian Gulf war and did the same before visiting Crown Heights during the racial disturbances last summer. And that many cases he prosecuted were more show than substance.</p>
        <p>The candidates' hate for each other is plain. At the end of the recent radio debate on WFAN-AM with Don Imus, they weakly shook hands, making no eye contact. They did not speak during commercials. "You could have cut the tension," said Mr. Imus.</p>
        <p>The dirtiest state campaign in memory has taken a toll on Senator D'Amato, too. At WFAN Mr. Imus noted that the Senator seemed the more nervous of the two. When he rose to shake Mr. Imus's hand, Mr. D'Amato knocked over the stand holding the moderator's questions. "A little tense," said Charles McCord of WFAN.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abrams has always been considered a strong campaigner, but this time he's been portrayed as The Nebbish, boring and humorless.</p>
        <p>"You know I've always found Bob Abrams to have a good sense of humor," says Mr. Amestoy, the Vermont Attorney General. "I remember him at a convention walking around in shorts and T-shirt, this Attorney General people hold in awe and he's carrying around his daughters' crayons and coloring books and joking about it."</p>
        <p>So what happened to the funny guy? "I guess I didn't really realize how vicious it would be," said Mr. Abrams.</p>
