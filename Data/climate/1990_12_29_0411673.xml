        <p>Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has signed a clean air bill that adopts California's auto emissions standards, the toughest in the country.</p>
        <p>The new emission standards, to be phased in from 1995 to 2003, are intended to reduce smog-producing pollutants sharply.</p>
        <p>Based on California's new tailpipe standards, the law requires auto makers to cut emissions of hydrocarbons by 75 percent and nitric oxide by 50 percent beyond the requirements of the new Federal Clean Air Act. Hydrocarbons and nitric oxide are the chief components of smog and contribute to acid rain as well as to the warming trend known as the greenhouse effect, environmentalists say.</p>
        <p>The new law, signed Thursday, also requires that Massachusetts adopt California's new warranty, testing and recall provisions.  The Cost of Bad Air</p>
        <p>"We are paying a tremendous economic cost for bad air, and this is a piece of state legislation that has national implications," said Representative David Cohen, a Democrat from Newton who sponsored the bill in the House. "The problem with other states is just that none of them had the courage" to follow California, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said the new law is expected to help reduce air pollution in the state by 25 percent.</p>
        <p>According to environomental experts, all other Northeastern states, as well as Texas and Illinois, are considering adopting California's new standards.</p>
        <p>California has had standards that are more stringent than those set by the Federal Government since the 1970's. States can adopt either the Federal standards or California standards. Action in New York</p>
        <p>This fall, environmentalists applauded New York for adopting the same anti-pollution standards that are to go into effect in California for cars in the 1993 model year. Under its new law, Massachusetts will adopt the even stricter standards that California has set for cars in the 1994 model year. New York and several other states are expected to adopt the more stringent emission control standards as well.</p>
        <p>"We hope its passing in this state will give other states the impetus to do the same," said Jenny Carter, an environmental lawyer with the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>California officials have estimated that the anti-pollution equipment would cost about $170 a car. Other auto industry estimates put the price at about $300.</p>
        <p>Under an agreement with automobile manufacturers, supporters of the Massachusetts bill agreed to postpone the date the new anti-pollution equipment must be in place from model year 1993 to model year 1995. The 1995 cars will go on sale in late 1994.</p>
        <p>The new law will require that pollution control equipment be covered by a warranty for seven years or 70,000 miles. It would also require that the automobiles carry diagnostic equipment to alert the driver if the anti-pollution equipment was not working, Ms. Carter said.</p>
        <p>The new law would also allow the state to order a recall if the pollution-control equipment failed at an unacceptable rate, she said.</p>
