        <p>At the National Hurricane Center, a gray bunker bristling with satellite dishes on the outskirts of Miami, meteorologists scanned readings last weekend gleaned by aircraft plunging into the eye of Hurricane Ivan and they squinted at satellite images while preparing a fresh forecast for the track of the dangerous storm.</p>
        <p>After assessing the data and the output of half a dozen supercomputer storm simulations, Stacy R. Stewart sat in front of a map of the Atlantic and Caribbean with an eraser and colored pencils, drawing the storm track newly estimated for the next five days. The map was filled with erasures of older storm projections that had at one point been the best bet but now were off by hundreds of miles as the storm's northerly curve drifted west.</p>
        <p>This is the state of hurricane science in the new century: a mix of growing skill and persistent uncertainty, of intuition and algorithms, satellites and erasers.</p>
        <p>A great deal has been learned from remote sensing and eye-diving aircraft and computers running trillions of calculations a second. Predictions are improving. But in the midst of such progress, the forces that guide the path and growth of individual hurricanes remain cloaked in mysteries, like the hidden eye in the swirling, miles-high bands of cloud and rain.</p>
        <p>Never has the need for improved forecasts been greater. Not only are more people in harm's way, on coasts from Asia to Florida, but most experts now agree that after two decades of relative quiescence the Atlantic will have increased hurricane activity for up to several decades.</p>
        <p>The reason is that the Atlantic Ocean shifted, as of 1995, to a pattern of water temperatures and air circulation that energizes storms. Experts also foresee a slow rise in hurricane intensity and rainfall from global warming.</p>
        <p>While forecasting individual storms remains a vexing challenge, the projections of hurricane paths have improved enough that last year the hurricane center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, lengthened its forecasts from three days to five.The change came after two years of testing showed that the five-day forecasts were as accurate as three-day forecasts had been 15 years earlier.</p>
        <p>The forecasts create a broad ''error cone'' of possible tracks, often widening by hundreds of miles beyond the third day. But they can be of great value to the Navy and emergency-management offices, which had clamored for years for NOAA to expand its hurricane horizons.</p>
        <p>The Navy needs nearly a week to safeguard the big fleets in harbors like Pensacola and Jacksonville, Fla., and emergency planners want to know where they should stockpile supplies and move the staff.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, many residents of hurricane country do not understand how to interpret the longer forecasts. If one looks only at the centerline, the changes in predictions may seem extreme. That line can waver back and forth ''in a windshield-wiper effect'' one day to the next, said Max Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center.</p>
        <p>In recent days, as the centerline showing the most probable path of the storm wavered over Florida and back into the gulf several times, each new computer run seemed to spawn bursts of panic buying of gasoline and groceries across large portions of the storm-weary state.</p>
        <p>At one point, uncertainty was so great that some nursing homes on both the east and the west coasts were simultaneously preparing to evacuate in opposite directions.</p>
        <p>''The longer-range forecasting really helps us in terms of our planning and giving us that sort of cone where we think things are going to go,'' said Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
        <p>But for the public, he conceded, ''I think that can be a kind of frustration.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Jeb Bush echoed that frustration at a news conference on Monday, encouraging citizens not to fixate on the day-to-day swings of the storm tracks. ''I don't know if it's the five-day forecasts or the slowing down of the last two storms that's created a little bit of a challenge in terms of people's patience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a science policy expert at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said government agencies of all sorts still had a lot to learn about alerting the public to uncertain risks, with the Department of Homeland Security's color coding of terrorist threats another example.</p>
        <p>It is important to keep in mind just how much worse hurricane forecasts were not long ago, said Robert E. Tuleya, a meteorologist and hurricane modeler at Old Dominion University. For a storm like Ivan, he said, ''Ten years ago we would have been alerting the whole gulf coast and the southeast Atlantic coast.''</p>
        <p>Now, the meteorologists at the Miami center are producing a fresh five-day forecast at least four times a day, shaping preparations for what could still end up being an exceedingly rare third hurricane strike on Florida in one season.</p>
        <p>Still, as of Monday the hurricane could hit as far west as New Orleans and as far east as Tallahassee.</p>
        <p>Hurricane Ivan's devastating march across the tropics after it formed as anonymous Tropical Depression 9 on Sept. 2 was precisely predicted because a big ridge of high pressure around the Bahamas steered it as predictably as rails carry a train.</p>
        <p>But its new territory, the Gulf of Mexico, has no such clear ''steering'' forces. It holds a mix of conditions almost guaranteed to make this hurricane a maverick.</p>
        <p>It could well be weakened because the winds in the upper atmosphere are out of sync with those near the surface, creating a condition called shear that can pull apart the towering eye walls that contain the hurricane's combustion chamber.</p>
        <p>But it is also going to slow to an agonizing crawl, forecasters said. The combination of slow speed and no clear zones of low and high pressure that either push or tug at such storms has created the potential disaster zone of more than 350 miles across.</p>
        <p>Some influences on such giant storms have become much better understood, like the role of El Niño warmings of the Pacific in shaping high-altitude winds that can shear the tops off Atlantic hurricanes. Indeed, a weak Niño condition is developing now, although any storm-damping influence would not come before October, forecasters say.</p>
        <p>And new technologies have clarified how storms grow. A fresh advance has come from cloud-probing radars aboard NASA's TRMM satellite, which monitors tropical precipitation.</p>
        <p>The radar essentially provides a CT scan, revealing the presence of fast-rising columns of air that act as energy pumps, allowing the storms to transfer the heat of tropical waters skyward. The budget for the satellite was nearly cut this year but was restored once scientists explained its importance to storm forecasting.</p>
        <p>Other forces that nurture or kill hurricanes have only just been discovered, like the impact of hot, dry, dusty layers of air blown off the Sahara, which can race westward across the Atlantic, catching up to a hurricane and decapitating it from behind, said Jason Dunion, a federal hurricane expert in Miami.</p>
        <p>One area of little progress is estimating whether a storm will strengthen or weaken.</p>
        <p>''There are so many pieces of the intensity puzzle,'' Mr. Dunion said last week, just before taking off in a government Gulfstream jet out of Tampa to pepper Hurricane Ivan with dozens of canisters that transmit wind, temperature, humidity and air pressure readings every half second.</p>
        <p>Even with an incomplete picture, the hurricane center has to generate its forecasts. They have steadily improved in predicting storms' actual paths, albeit at a pace of about 1 percent a year, Mr. Dunion said.</p>
        <p>Some improvements have come not only in the half dozen leading computer models, run on potent machines from Camp Springs, Md., to Reading, England, but also in how their output is interpreted.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, for example, the federal forecasts are influenced by a computer program at Florida State University in Tallahassee that analyzes all the other models' predictions as an ensemble, watching for which ones best track the actual storm movements and which ones have explainable errors. It adjusts for the errors and produces a more accurate forecast, scientists say. But the forecasters at the hurricane center still have the final say and often reject trends indicated by the computers, particularly when conditions are like those in the Gulf of Mexico at the moment.</p>
        <p>Without clear clues from the atmosphere, the computer forecasts splay ''like the legs of a squashed spider,'' said Mr. Mayfield, the hurricane center director.</p>
        <p>Late Monday afternoon, Stacy Stewart was once again the forecaster charged with charting Hurricane Ivan's next moves.</p>
        <p>Once again he would stare at an arcing array of computer screens showing the Technicolor pinwheel of clouds and all the vulnerable possible targets, from Havana to New Orleans. And once again he would wield his pencils, and assuredly his eraser.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 16, 2004, Thursday  An article in Science Times on Tuesday about predicting the path and growth of hurricanes referred incorrectly to the Navy installations in Pensacola and Jacksonville, Fla. They are naval air stations; they do not have fleets of ships.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 4, 2004, Monday  An article in Science Times on Sept. 14 about predicting hurricanes referred incorrectly to the Navy installation in Pensacola, Fla. It is a naval air station; it does not have a fleet of large ships. A correction of that article in this space on Sept. 16 referred incompletely to the harbor in Jacksonville, Fla. In addition to the Jacksonville Naval Air Station, it indeed has a base with ships, the Mayport Naval Station.</p>
