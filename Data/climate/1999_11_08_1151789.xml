        <p>There were two important and potentially far-reaching victories for clean air advocates last week. On Wednesday, the federal government announced legal action aimed at forcing 32 coal-fired power plants in the Midwest and South to install modern anti-pollution controls or risk severe monetary damages. Two days later, Gov. George Pataki of New York disclosed that he would shortly impose new emissions standards on cars and some other vehicles sold in New York in an effort to force the automobile manufacturers to produce much cleaner cars on a faster timetable than required by federal law.</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, clean air advocates were on the run, devastated by back-to-back rulings in the D.C. Court of Appeals in response to lawsuits brought by the big utilities and a few Midwestern states.

        <p>There were two important and potentially far-reaching victories for clean air advocates last week. On Wednesday, the federal government announced legal action aimed at forcing 32 coal-fired power plants in the Midwest and South to install modern anti-pollution controls or risk severe monetary damages. Two days later, Gov. George Pataki of New York disclosed that he would shortly impose new emissions standards on cars and some other vehicles sold in New York in an effort to force the automobile manufacturers to produce much cleaner cars on a faster timetable than required by federal law.</p>
        <p>Only a few months ago, clean air advocates were on the run, devastated by back-to-back rulings in the D.C. Court of Appeals in response to lawsuits brought by the big utilities and a few Midwestern states. The rulings invalidated new federal air-quality standards and blocked a carefully negotiated plan that would have forced 22 states east of the Mississippi to reduce emissions of the chemicals that cause smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>The rulings were particularly devastating for New York and other Northeastern states that for years have suffered from air pollution that blows eastward from dirty, coal-fired plants in the border states and the Midwest. These plants are major sources not only of urban smog and acid rain, but also of the gases that contribute to global warming and mercury emissions that are lethal to fish and wildlife. Since then, however, the eastern states, led by New York, have counterattacked. In September, Eliot Spitzer, New York's Attorney General, threatened to sue 17 coal-fired plants in five Midwestern and border states unless they reduced their emissions. The federal actions announced Wednesday complement Mr. Spitzer's strategy while doubling the number of plants on the target list.</p>
        <p>Both the federal and state lawsuits are based on a largely untested provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act. In general, the act ''grandfathered'' older coal-producing plants built before 1970, exempting them from the law's strict pollution standards in the mistaken expectation that they would be shut down in a few years. But the law also specified that plants that were significantly modernized to produce more energy had to comply with the same pollution controls as new plants. Mr. Spitzer and the federal government claim that the companies named in their lawsuits deliberately ducked that obligation in order to save money.</p>
        <p>If the suits succeed, the clean air benefits could occur within a few years. Mr. Pataki's plan will take longer to show results, but they could be huge. Under the new regulations, New York will adopt California's emissions standards, which are tougher than the federal government's and will require the industry to produce in 10 years cars that emit only half the pollution they do now. Since New York and California account for a huge share of the national market, the super-clean New York-California car could become the standard for the country. Earlier this year, some environmentalists feared that the Clinton administration and politicians with possible national aspirations, like Mr. Pataki, would be reluctant to offend pivotal Midwestern states and key industries with elections approaching. Happily, these fears seem to have been unwarranted.</p>
