        <p>Editorial, deploring threat to world's forests, hails Suriname's decision to permanently protect four million acres of untouched tropical forests; cites role of Conservation International, which has set up trust fund to help Suriname manage area</p>

        <p>The world's forests have been under siege since the turn of the century, but this year has been calamitous.

The easy explanation is El Nino, a perverse weather system that has flooded some regions but left others bone dry. But the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging, mining and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable to fire.

The group became actively involved in Suriname several years ago, when Asian timber interests -- having pretty much stripped their own countries of marketable hardwoods -- sought timber rights on 11 million acres of Suriname's forests. Suriname rejected that deal, and has now put four million of these acres out of reach.</p>

        <p>The world's forests have been under siege since the turn of the century, but this year has been calamitous. In Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Central America, Africa and Indonesia, fires have destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New York State. The easy explanation is El Nino, a perverse weather system that has flooded some regions but left others bone dry. But the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging, mining and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable to fire. For that reason, the fires are likely to reoccur, with or without El Nino, unless something is done to curb mankind's insatiable appetite for wood.</p>
        <p>In that context, there was a small ray of hope in the announcement last week that a small South American country, Suriname, had decided to give permanent protection to four million acres of untouched tropical forests, about one-tenth of the entire country. Suriname reached its decision at the urging of Conservation International, an American environmental group that has set up a private trust fund to help Suriname manage the area. The group became actively involved in Suriname several years ago, when Asian timber interests -- having pretty much stripped their own countries of marketable hardwoods -- sought timber rights on 11 million acres of Suriname's forests. Suriname rejected that deal, and has now put four million of these acres out of reach.</p>
        <p>What makes this decision so heartening is that Suriname is a poor country that might normally have jumped at the quick profits promised by foreign logging interests. Far richer nations like Brazil have been unable to resist these blandishments, and Asian timber interests are even now burrowing deeper into the Amazon rain forest. At the other end of the economic scale, Guyana, Surname's destitute neighbor, has opened up two-thirds of its forest mass to foreign companies.</p>
        <p>Suriname chose the long-term economic value of forests over short-term revenues from logging and other resource-depleting activities. It hopes over time to make money from tourism generated by the forest and its spectacular animal life, from non-timber forest products like tannins and resins, and from ''bioprospecting'' -- the search for medicines among forest plants. The National Institutes of Health and big pharmaceutical companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb are already engaged in this search. This avenue has been left unexplored by most of the world's governments, which own 80 percent of the world's forests and which as a rule cannot see beyond the next truckload of mahogany. The lure of short-term gain is also the main reason various international agreements, including the non-binding ''forest principles'' adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, have had zero impact.</p>
        <p>The larger point here is that a living forest is worth more than a dead forest, locally and globally. Healthy forests prevent erosion and water pollution. They also act as a natural ''sink'' for the carbon-based gases that contribute to global warming, and, perhaps most important, they harbor at least half of all plant and animal species, with enormous untapped benefits for human health.</p>
        <p>More than one-half of the world's original tropical forests have now disappeared, mostly in this century. At present rates of destruction, half of what is left could vanish in the next 50 years. This depressing prospect has not, however, inspired the wealthier nations to act constructively. One of the few tangible products of the 1992 Earth Summit was the Global Environmental Facility, a multilateral body designed to persuade poor countries to hang on to their natural assets, rain forests included. But the United States, which pledged $435 million over five years, is $200 million in arrears.</p>
        <p>The task of saving the forests has thus been left to private conservation groups, whose resources are limited. The very fact that one of these groups and one small country have joined to save four million acres might shame Western governments into broader action.</p>
