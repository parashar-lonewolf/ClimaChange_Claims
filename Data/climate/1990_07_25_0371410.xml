        <p>LEAD: FRESH from their triumphs in Eastern Europe, free-market economists are pushing market solutions for problems closer to home.

        <p>FRESH from their triumphs in Eastern Europe, free-market economists are pushing market solutions for problems closer to home. Markets are being touted as the most efficient way to save wildlife, improve public education and reduce acid rain. Could they also be used to tame the scourge of America's city-sprawls: the rush-hour traffic jam?</p>
        <p>Influential citizen groups in California think so. And in the last few weeks they have made cautious converts of the regional pollution and transportation authorities, whose leaders are scrounging for politically acceptable ways to contain traffic-related smog. The big question now is whether they can sell a fresh approach to a motoring public that takes the ''free'' in freeway very, very seriously.</p>
        <p>Under the gun from both state and Federal authorities to prevent deterioration in air quality, Southern California stitched together a pollution-control plan last year that included regulation of everything from aerosol deodorants to barbecue grills. To reduce anticipated car use by 40 percent in the year 2010, the planners talked of rules that would induce one-third of commuters to forsake their own vehicles for car pools, mass transit or home computer terminals. Just how that ambitious goal might be met, however, was left up in the air.</p>
        <p>The quick and dirty way to get Californians to drive less would be to ration car use or parking or gasoline consumption - or all three. But that would be a regulatory nightmare, not very different than the one faced every day in a thousand ways by Soviet planners. Would those with extra-long commuting trips get extra ration coupons? How about families with more or less children than average? And who would enforce the rules, which are likely to be greeted with as much enthusiasm as root canal surgery?</p>
        <p>The less painful and less intrusive alternative, argued a panel drawn from the Environmental Defense Fund, the libertarian Claremont Institute, business interests, auto clubs and a number of local governments, would be to ration road use by price. By coincidence the Bay Area Economic Forum, a committee of local governments with close ties to both business and environmental groups, came up with similar findings at virtually the same time. And with little public fanfare, the recommendations of both groups were embraced in principle by local regulators of air quality.</p>
        <p>High on the lists are congestion or emission taxes - fees for consuming scarce road space and scarcer clean air. Collecting fees at toll booths, the Bay Area Economic Forum acknowledges, would itself add to congestion and pollution. But the region could borrow an idea from Singapore, where rush-hour use of critical arteries is regulated with windshield stickers. Anyone caught on the wrong road at the wrong time without a sticker (purchasable at convenience stores) would be in for a stiff fine.</p>
        <p>A more expensive but technologically feasible variation on the system would use road sensors and in-car computers to measure travel. Motorists could then be billed monthly, according to flexible pricing formulas for time-of-day use and miles driven. Revenues could be used to subsidize mass transit.</p>
        <p>The trouble with congestion taxes high enough to alter commuter behavior is that they would cost a lot of angry people a lot of money. Michael Cameron, an analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland, believes that much the same results could be achieved with far less political hassle by giving everyone limited rights to commute by car, and then allowing those who need more (or merely want more) to buy rights from other motorists.</p>
        <p>Car owners might, for example, be allowed to drive 200 miles a week on bottleneck roads at rush hour. Use would be measured with road sensors and on-board computers. Extra mileage allowances could be bought or sold from vending machines, the way modern mass transit systems now keep track of electronic fare cards. Prices might be recomputed frequently to balance changing supply and demand. Those who chose to trade in mileage allowances for cash would be paid by check, much the way tax refunds are paid today.</p>
        <p>This may sound like a far too ambitious leap into the brave new world of managing cities by computer. But the technology, analysts argue, is no longer pie-in-the-sky. And once car-dependent commuters understand that the practical alternatives are poisonous air or bureaucratic controls on personal mobility, the brave new world may begin to look very good.</p>
