        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''What Became of Energy Independence?'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 9), Charles K. Ebinger correctly sounds the alarm over the public's attitude toward the drop in oil prices. We cannot stop planning for our energy future because the crunch at the gas pump has been temporarily eased. And indeed, the Reagan Administration has turned its back on America's energy future by cutting programs to develop ''renewable'' technologies and, more recently, by the President's veto of legislation requiring new appliances to be more energy-efficient.</p>
        <p>However, while Mr. Ebinger correctly characterizes current attitudes toward our future energy needs, his solution misses the mark.</p>
        <p>He says the Arab oil embargoes of 1973 and 1979 taught us to rely more heavily on our own energy sources -especially coal and uranium. However, conservation and energy-efficiency improvements, not nuclear power, proved the most appropriate mechanism for reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Since 1978, savings from improved energy efficiency have in effect supplied 23 percent of U.S. energy. Renewable energy sources contributed more new energy over the last decade than coal and nuclear energy combined, and currently provide twice as much primary energy as nuclear power.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, while nuclear power creates electricity, more than 90 percent of our oil is used for industry, automobiles and home heating. Those crucial functions cannot be subsumed by nuclear power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ebinger cites the Chernobyl accident as a major contributor to nuclear industry woes. In reality, Chernobyl only slightly exacerbated the growing public dissatisfaction with nuclear power. Analysis of polling data shows a steady decline in public support for new nuclear construction. In 1975, 65 percent of the public supported building more nuclear power plants. But in early 1986, before the Chernobyl accident, nearly 70 percent opposed new nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>Much in the last 11 years has eroded public support - the Three Mile Island accident, the economic disaster of the Washington Public Power Supply System and thousands of ''incidents and accidents'' at plants each year.</p>
        <p>Besides the Chernobyl accident, 1986 was marked by cost overruns and significant safety incidents. For example, last December, during preoperational testing, valve malfunctions were discovered at the Nine Mile II plant in upstate New York. The cost to correct the problem is estimated at $240 million, bringing the total cost of the plant, originally set at $316 million, to $6 billion.</p>
        <p>Public and political support for nuclear power has eroded not because of the accident in the Ukraine but because of the industry's economic and safety record here at home. By perpetuating the myth that nuclear power is a viable alternative to oil imports, Mr. Ebinger does a disservice. The real lesson of the energy crisis of the 70's is that energy efficiency, not nuclear power, is the key to America's energy future.
