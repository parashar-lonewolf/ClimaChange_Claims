        <p>Admitting that for years it improperly disposed of household appliances containing ozone-depleting chemicals, New York City has agreed to pay a fine of $1 million to the federal government and to spend $3 million on garbage-collection equipment to reduce air pollution, the federal Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fine, a settlement of a federal suit filed in March 1999, is one of the largest penalties ever imposed on any private or government agency for violating the 1990 Clean Air Act, an agency spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit charged the city with collecting discarded refrigerators and air-conditioners and crushing them without first removing the refrigerant chemicals they contained. The cooling gases -- called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's -- were therefore released into the air.</p>
        <p>Refrigerant gases are believed to be a significant cause of the reduction of ozone gases in the atmosphere, which create a shield against radiation that causes skin cancer. The Clean Air Act was passed in part to help protect the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Susan Kath, chief of the New York City environmental law division, acknowledged that the city had been improperly compacting and dumping refrigerators and other appliances containing CFC's since 1992.</p>
        <p>In addition to the fine, the city agreed to buy nine heavy-duty garbage trucks that run on compressed natural gas, which is far less polluting than the diesel fuel now in use. The cost will be $570,000, said Mary Mears, spokeswoman for the E.P.A. The city will also start to install emission-control devices on buses and garbage trucks.</p>
        <p>To comply with the Clean Air Act, Ms. Kath said, the city recently started a program enabling residents wanting to get rid of a refrigerator or other cooling appliance to notify the city, which sends someone to remove the CFC-containing unit.</p>
