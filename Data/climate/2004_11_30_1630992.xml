        <p>''A Foreboding Thaw'' (editorial, Nov. 27) is aptly named, for the implications of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment go far beyond the Arctic.</p>
        <p>For two million years Earth has alternated between two states: one with large, the other with medium-size North Polar caps. But Santa's home has lost half its thickness in three decades and Greenland is melting 10 times faster than it was just four years ago. In Greenland, meltwater is seeping through crevasses, lubricating the ice sheet's base, accelerating ''rivers of ice'' and increasing the potential for a portion to slip.</p>

        <p>''A Foreboding Thaw'' (editorial, Nov. 27) is aptly named, for the implications of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment go far beyond the Arctic.</p>
        <p>For two million years Earth has alternated between two states: one with large, the other with medium-size North Polar caps. But Santa's home has lost half its thickness in three decades and Greenland is melting 10 times faster than it was just four years ago. In Greenland, meltwater is seeping through crevasses, lubricating the ice sheet's base, accelerating ''rivers of ice'' and increasing the potential for a portion to slip.</p>
        <p>The Arctic Assessment is about the state of the global climate, and we are rapidly heading toward a small North Polar Cap -- conditions of eons past. Let's hope that the inevitable surprises wake us but do not swamp us.</p>
