        <p>The FPL Group announced its $11 billion acquisition of Constellation Energy on Monday, one of the largest such transactions in the history of the American electricity industry, with a focus on using two decidedly retro energy sources, coal and nuclear power, to make the deal work.</p>
        <p>Lewis Hay III, the chairman of FPL, who will become the chief executive of the new concern, spoke in a telephone interview about the need for greater fuel diversity. The combined company, which is to take the name Constellation, will become the nation's third-largest provider of nuclear-fueled electricity, after Exelon and Entergy, and one of the largest suppliers of coal-fired power.</p>
        <p>That translates into less reliance on natural gas, a fuel that was cheap and abundant in the 1990's but that has soared in price over the last year as a result of a shortage of domestic supply. Natural gas prices on Monday climbed 41 cents, to $14.02 a million British thermal units, remaining near record levels that have led to two other large deals in the energy industry in the last week: ConocoPhillips's acquisition of Burlington Resources and Southern Union's purchase of Sid Richardson Energy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hay pointed out that this year's hurricanes had significantly curtailed the supply of natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico. FPL had in recent years been contemplating projects to supply Florida, its home market, with imported natural gas delivered to a nearby terminal in the Bahamas. But those projects did not materialize because of environmental opposition and political quarrels in the Bahamas, leaving FPL to look elsewhere for fuel to meet electricity demands from Florida's fast-growing population.</p>
        <p>Hence the allure of Constellation, which combines expertise in the area of energy trading with a portfolio of nuclear and coal assets that provide fuel for about three-quarters of its electricity. (By comparison, FPL, the parent company of Florida Power and Light, relies on natural gas for more than half its fuel needs.) Among the nuclear assets that Constellation controls are the Nine Mile Point 1 and most of the Nine Mile Point 2 plants in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>''It's going to create a very significant player in the merchant power industry with geographical diversity and fuel mix diversity,'' said Michael Worms, an analyst at Harris Nesbitt, the investment banking unit of the BMO Financial Group.</p>
        <p>Mayo A. Shattuck III, the chief executive of Constellation, who will be chairman of the new company, said that consolidation in the industry was just beginning, with the United States having about 100 companies that are considered utilities, compared with just 7 in Japan. FPL and Constellation started talking about a potential deal earlier this year after another big deal, Duke Energy's purchase of Cinergy.</p>
        <p>''We would expect more of this to happen,'' said Mr. Shattuck, echoing analysts who are forecasting a merger boom in the year ahead. ''Our idea was, let's get to the endgame sooner.''</p>
        <p>The new Constellation will have extensive reach in deregulated energy markets, allowing it to test its mettle, for instance, in areas where relatively cheap electricity produced from nuclear power and coal can nimbly compete with more expensive electricity from natural gas. The new company will also have a large renewable energy business, thanks to FPL's investments in wind farms; about a quarter of FPL's fuel needs are supplied by wind.</p>
        <p>The combined company will have revenue of about $27 billion and the nation's largest portfolio of electricity generation assets, with more than 45,000 megawatts of capacity. Shareholders of FPL will control 60 percent of the new company, with Constellation shareholders owning the remainder. Constellation shareholders will get a 15 percent premium over the average closing price of the stock in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch advised FPL; Morgan Stanley advised Constellation.</p>
        <p>FPL shares fell 19 cents yesterday, to close at $42.76. Constellation closed at $59.10, down $2.52.</p>
