        <p>Several transportaion systems in Europe and the public bus system in Sioux Falls, S.D., are testing a new fuel made from either canola, sunflower or soy oil for use in diesel engines.</p>
        <p>Just pour the fuel into the tank, says the developer, Novamont, part of the Ferruzzi-Montedison Group of Italy. There is no need for any modification of the engine (or boiler if it is used for heating).</p>
        <p>The advantages are environmental, and many transportation systems are faced with finding ways to meet new environmental standards. A spokeswoman for Ferruzzi-Montedison said that the cost of the vegetable-oil fuel was higher than diesel fuel but that mass production should eventually lower the price.</p>
        <p>Novamont is building a plant in Livorno, Italy, to make the fuel, which it calls Diesel-Bi. It is expected to start production by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Diesel-Bi does not contain sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain, when burned. Novamont says the fuel reduces emmissions of other pollutants by 50 percent, except for carbon dioxide. But the carbon dioxide emitted is the amount the vegetable that was used to make the oil absorbed while growing. So there is no net accumulation of carbon dioxide, the leading cause of the greenhouse effect. And there are no black fumes from the test buses and taxis.</p>
        <p>The Sioux Falls project, involving two buses, is being coordinated by Central Soya, a Ferruzzi-Montedison subsidiary, based in Fort Wayne, Ind. Novamont says Diesel-Bi's advantages include that it is biodegradable if spilled and safe to handle, with a low flash point. And farmers will benefit from a new use of their crops. Diesel-Bi - the suffix is pronounced bee - is 90 percent vegetable oil and 10 percent methanol or ethanol. Properties similar to diesel are obtained by making alcohol esters of the various plant oils in a catalytic process.</p>
