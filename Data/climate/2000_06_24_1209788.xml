        <p>China Modernizing Its Army  A Pentagon study said China was modernizing its armed forces to counter military threats from technologically superior enemies, but ''significant shortcomings'' in weapons and training would leave it unable to challenge the United States for ''an indefinite period of time.''</p>

        <p>Media Mogul Balks at Questions  Vladimir A. Gusinsky, whose arrest last week raised fears of a crackdown on the Russian press, refused to answer prosecutors' questions and derided as nonsense charges that he had defrauded the government. Although President Vladimir V. Putin said his government was drafting an ''information doctrine'' rooted in press freedom and the absence of censorship, Mr. Gusinsky said the government was trying to shoehorn the independent press into the role of an information ministry.</p>

        <p>Mexico Race Too Close to Call  Opinion surveys show the two leading presidential candidates in a virtual tie, with as many as one-fourth of the voters undecided. The surveys have intensified the extraordinary uncertainty and tension over the July 2 election, which has become a plebiscite on the Institutional Revolutionary Party, after 71 years in power.</p>

        <p>Leaks in Mideast Talks  A campaign of leaks is under way to expose Israel's bargaining positions in peace negotiations and press Prime Minister Ehud Barak not to make significant concessions to the Palestinians. The latest leak came when an Israeli newspaper printed the contents of what it called an American ''nonpaper'' that it said could provide the basis for a three-way, retreat-style summit meeting in the Washington area.</p>

        <p>Gore Says Aides Failed To Explain Fund-Raiser  In a caustic exchange with a senior Justice Department prosecutor two months ago, Vice President Al Gore denied being told by aides that a 1996 luncheon at a Buddhist temple was a fund-raising event, according to a transcript of the interview that Mr. Gore's lawyers made public.</p>

        <p>Mr. Gore was campaigning in the West, with a schedule that was heavy with fund-raising events.</p>

        <p>C.I.A. Link in Campaign Inquiry  A former C.I.A. official has offered fresh evidence to support accusations that a top Democratic Party official, Donald Fowler, sought to enlist the intelligence agency to aid Roger Tamraz, an entrepreneur who had contributed at least $300,000 to the Democratic Party.</p>

        <p>Bush Seeks to Change Subject  Gov. George W. Bush sought to shift attention away from the execution of Gary Graham in Texas on Thursday night and toward Vice President Al Gore's views and record on a range of issues, especially fossil fuels and gasoline prices.</p>

        <p>Federal Execution Looms  Juan Raul Garza, a migrant farm worker convicted seven years ago of marijuana smuggling and three drug-related murders, is scheduled to be put to death on Aug. 5, the first federal execution since John F. Kennedy was president. Mr. Garza wants to ask President Clinton for clemency, but the inmate's lawyers said the process was formidable.</p>

        <p>Support for Tobacco Suit  The House, by a margin of 215 to 183, voted to let the Justice Department use money from other federal departments in a lawsuit against tobacco companies. The measure was strongly supported by the Clinton administration and vigorously opposed by House Republican leaders.</p>

        <p>Court Won't Bar Elian's Return  A federal appeals court in Atlanta refused to reconsider the case of Elian Gonzalez, leaving the Supreme Court as a last stop for the Miami relatives who want to bar his return to Cuba, perhaps as early as Wednesday.</p>

        <p>No Mechanical Trouble Found  N.T.S.B. investigators writing a report about the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister last summer were said to have found no mechanical problems, but the staff has yet to reach a conclusion about the cause of the crash.</p>

        <p>AT&amp;T Offers New Plan  AT&amp;T submitted a proposal to the F.C.C. that would give telephone customers more flexibility in seeking to save money on long-distance calls. But it appeared to fall short of offsetting criticism from consumer groups and federal regulators over company plans to raise certain costs for tens of millions of customers.</p>

        <p>Amazon Takes a Beating  Shares of Amazon.com, the Internet industry's bellwether stock, plummeted 19 percent as investors grew nervous about the company's financial health and its prospects for profitability. Other Internet companies, like eBay and America Online, were sucked into the downdraft.</p>
