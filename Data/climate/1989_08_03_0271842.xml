        <p>LEAD: Even as the nation increasingly worries about high oil imports and dirty air, construction of power plants that run on low-pollution ''renewable'' electricity sources is beginning to drop sharply, experts say. Renewable sources include sunlight, water, wood, wind, geothermal steam and landfill gas.</p>
        <p>Even as the nation increasingly worries about high oil imports and dirty air, construction of power plants that run on low-pollution ''renewable'' electricity sources is beginning to drop sharply, experts say. Renewable sources include sunlight, water, wood, wind, geothermal steam and landfill gas.</p>
        <p>A comprehensive survey by an investor research group projects that completions of such plants will peak this year after rising sharply since the beginning of the decade and will decline substantially in the next five years. It found that the prospects for such plants have been hurt by low prices for the fuels they would replace, like oil and gas; by changes in some state regulations that discourage investment in such plants, and by an electricity surplus in parts of the country.</p>
        <p>''It's an irony that just as policy makers and the general public are latching onto the benefits of renewables, we're poised for a big decline,'' said one of the authors of the study, Susan Williams, of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group in Washington financed by institutional investors. Electricity in Demand in East</p>
        <p>The falloff comes just as a growth in demand for electricity in much of the East is creating a boom for the independent companies that sell power to utilities and that in the past were the primary builders of renewable-source energy projects. But most of the new independent projects in the East will use natural gas or coal. Some will also use oil. Ms. Williams and another researcher, Kevin Porter, surveyed 108 renewable energy companies and found that plant completions will peak this year at 1,280 megawatts, which is about the capacity of a single large nuclear plant and is enough to power about 600,000 households. But the plants under construction or planned by the companies for completion in 1993 come to only 200 megawatts. All told, the plants already operating can produce about 7,600 megawatts, about 1 percent of the nation's generating capacity.</p>
        <p>But growth in the use of renewable energy sources is widely viewed as inevitable as fossil fuels like oil and gas are exhausted and as concern rises about ground-level ozone, the greenhouse effect and other forms of pollution. Smaller Factors in Decisions</p>
        <p>Still, those factors are entering into development decisions less now than they did previously, experts say.</p>
        <p>''A great deal of attention was paid in the late 70's and early 80's to renewables,'' said Charles T. Condy, chief executive of the California Energy Company, a geothermal concern in San Francisco. ''But the sex appeal got lost someplace. I think it got lost at $8 a barrel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Condy said that geothermal development was continuing, but more slowly than it would if oil and gas prices were higher. ''The industry ought to be thinking long term,'' he said. ''But we're encouraging a short-term solution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Condy is not alone. ''Anyone who thinks oil prices are going to stay over the long term at a low level is making a mistake,'' said Jeffrey C. Genzer, of the National Association of State Energy Officials. But Mr. Genzer said the states and Federal Government might return soon to promoting alternative energy. Research Money Down</p>
        <p>Federal research and development money for alternative energy sources is down by 82 percent since its peak in 1980. Solar and wind projects also benefited from a tax credit, although most of the solar products did not involve the production of electricity. David B. Goldstein, a senior staff scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ''There's lots of vocalizations about the importance of oil independence, the greenhouse effect and acid rain. But when it comes down to a decision being made, not one penny is being spent to avoid these kinds of impacts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein said that, in the choice among conventional energy sources, like oil, gas and coal; renewables and conservation, the conventional sources are the most expensive. He added that many alternative sources cost less, although efficiency improvements are cheaper than either. Experts say geothermal, hydroelectric and biomass projects, including wood- and garbage-burning plants, are the least expensive of the alternative technologies.</p>
        <p>Other alternative technologies are still more expensive than conventional sources. They could decline in price with more investment in research and development, but that money will probably be available only if there are orders for more plants. One example, Mr. Goldstein and other experts say, isphotovoltaic cells, which make electricity from sunlight and could supply a large portion of the nation's electricity in the next century.</p>
        <p>The 456-page study concluded: ''As they approach the 1990's, many of these developers believe that their markets can only improve, but wonder if they will survive long enough to benefit.''</p>
        <p>The strongest renewable-source contenders now are waste-to-energy plants, although the primary reason for them remains disposing of waste rather than producing energy. Also strong are hydroelectric and geothermal plants. Windmills have fallen by the wayside because of the expiration of tax provisions that favored their construction. Photovoltaic cells -which make electricity directly from sunlight - are still uncompetitive financially. But solar thermal plants - using the sun's heat to boil water to make electricity - are competitive.</p>
        <p>If development of such energy sources declines, experts say, the nation will face a harder transition to a post-petroleum era, or may end up importing the technology it needs. Technology Lead Threatened</p>
        <p>The American lead in some alternative technologies is already threatened. For example, in photovoltaic cells, which were invented in the United States, Japanese and German companies are making technical progress. Yesterday, Siemens A.G. and ARCO reached agreement for the German company to buy Arco Solar, the world's largest manufacturer of the cells.</p>
        <p>A second solar approach, using the sun's heat to boil water and make electricity, is also showing promise, and the most prominent builder of such plants in this country is an Israeli concern, Luz International.</p>
        <p>Experts say the oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979 created a boom in construction of alternative energy plants. But the price collapse of 1986, and the expectation that oil prices would not continue to escalate, were a major blow.</p>
        <p>In California, state regulators responded a decade ago to the energy crisis by trying to stimulate the development of alternative energy plants, requiring the utilities to give contracts, called ''standard offers,'' to alternative producers to buy their electricity at a guaranteed price per kilowatt-hour. The price would rise each year, tracking the expected price of oil.</p>
        <p>At the time the standard offers were devised, ''everyone thought that by now, 1989, the price of oil was going to be $40 or $50 a barrel,'' said Douglas Cogan, an energy expert at the Investor Responsibility Research Center. Oil today is less than $20. Contract Eases Financing</p>
        <p>With a standard-offer contract in hand, a developer could get financing to build an unconventional power source. Without a long-term power sale contract, a developer must convince lenders that the projects will produce power at a competitive rate no matter what the fluctuations in the price of the main competing source of electricity, natural gas or oil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Condy said his company was receiving about 9 cents a kilowatt-hour under standard-offer contracts. That is cheaper than the electricity produced by some nuclear plants, which at some California plants costs more than 10 cents, he said. But new natural gas-fired plants can sell power for about 5.5 cents a kilowatt-hour, with gas at its current level. Coal projects built by indepedent producers are in the range of 5 to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>
        <p>That disparity is one reason California stopped issuing standard-offer contracts. Another is that the West Coast is now awash in electric power, and does not need additional capacity of any kind.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams, the author of the research-center study, said costs for geothermal plants run from 4.5 to 10 cents per kilowatt-hour; for wood-burning plants, 6 to 9 cents; for wind, 7 to 9 cents; for small hydroelectric projects, 4 to 9 cents; for solar thermal plants, 12 to 25 cents, and for photovoltaic cells, 25 to 35 cents.</p>
        <p>In other states, new electric supplies are now developed through a kind of auction in which utilities and independent power producers submit bids, offering electricity at a certain price. Experts say that system puts renewable sources of energy at a disadvantage because their initial costs are higher in an era when fossil fuels are cheap.</p>
        <p>It is possible to devise a bidding system that gives more weight to the strengths of renewable energy sources - mainly, their reduced vulnerability to fuel cost increases. But Peter Bradford, chairman of the New York Public Service Commission, said, ''There is only so much that a rational utility or consumer would pay now for protection against a price increase some distance in the future.''</p>
