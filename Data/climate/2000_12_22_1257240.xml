        <p>Pressing ahead with landmark litigation to curb pollutants that contribute to acid rain in the Northeast, state and federal officials said last night that they had reached a tentative settlement with a third utility to cut emissions from power plants significantly.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, which would be the largest of three settlements in a case involving several companies, the Cinergy Corporation of Cincinnati will spend at least $1.4 billion in the next 12 years to cut sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions from its 10 coal-burning plants in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.</p>
        <p>Carol Browner, the administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which had sued the company, said last night that the Cinergy settlement was the largest  reached under the Clean Air Act. The total surpasses the $1.2 billion sum negotiated a month ago with a Virginia utility that had also been sued  -- by the State of New York, with the E.P.A.'s cooperation -- over its power plant emissions.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. also reached a settlement this year with a Tampa utility. The agency has sued nine companies with nearly 100 power plants in a four-year effort to go after utilities whose coal-powered generators spew tons of pollutants.</p>
        <p>Those emissions, carried east by prevailing winds, are widely tied to acid rain that has scarred mountainous areas like the Adirondacks and Catskills with ''dead lakes'' and dying forests, and added to smog and asthma problems in several cities.</p>
        <p>''Cleaner air, fewer premature deaths, fewer respiratory illnesses, fewer bronchitis cases,'' Ms. Browner said in interview, explaining the ramifications of the settlement, reached with the participation of the attorneys general of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.  ''We are thrilled.''</p>
        <p>New York's attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, who in September 1999 sued, or served notice of imminent legal action on, several out-of-state utilities said, ''We could not be happier.''</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Cinergy admits no wrongdoing but must pay $8.5 million in civil penalties to the federal government. The company must also finance environmental projects valued at $21.5 million.</p>
        <p>Cinergy agreed to cut its sulfur dioxide emissions, a key component in acid rain, by 409,000 tons annually, and nitrogen oxides, a culprit in smog, by 101,000 tons per year.</p>
        <p>It will install smokestack scrubbers and other equipment at its plants and convert the fuel source at three plants to natural gas from coal within the next 12 years.</p>
        <p>''We have pursued a settlement because it is preferable to spending years in time-consuming and wasteful litigation and is consistent with our environmental leadership position,'' James E. Rogers, the chairman, president and chief executive of Cinergy, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Cinergy, one of the nation's largest energy companies, operates the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company and PSI Energy Inc., which have more than 1.4 million electric customers and 478,000 gas customers.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists said the fact that the companies have settled knowing that a new presidential administration is imminent -- with a new E.P.A. administrator who many expect will be New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman -- demonstrates the strength of the cases.</p>
        <p>Governor Whitman in a statement last night praised the settlement as ''one step forward in what will be a decades-long process.''</p>
        <p>The agency says the companies made major modifications to expand or extend the life of older coal-burning plants without installing the proper pollution controls. The companies have said that the modifications were related to maintenance.</p>
