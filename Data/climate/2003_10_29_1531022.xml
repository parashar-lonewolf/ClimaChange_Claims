        <p>Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah was confirmed on Tuesday as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and will take over next week at the agency, which is the scene of major environmental battles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt, who was confirmed, 88 to 8, will contend with suits by states that challenge the Bush administration decision not to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and easing rules for coal-burning power plants.

        <p>Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah was confirmed on Tuesday as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and will take over next week at the agency, which is the scene of major environmental battles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt, who was confirmed, 88 to 8, will contend with suits by states that challenge the Bush administration decision not to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and easing rules for coal-burning power plants. He also has to determine how to deal with mercury that coal-burning plants emit. The administration has said it wants to set draft regulations for those emissions by Dec. 15. Rules have to be in place by 2007.</p>
        <p>Some agency watchers raised concerns about how Mr. Leavitt would handle occasionally tense relations with the White House.</p>
        <p>''The tests begin to become when he has a tough regulatory decision to make and the White House starts leaning on him to go one way or another,'' Russell E. Train, environmental administrator under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, said. ''He is going to have to make a decision which will tell us how he will run the agency, whether he will maintain his independence of the White House or subject himself to the influence of the White House.''</p>
        <p>''I accept this responsibility knowing that the president is committed to substantially more environmental progress and doing it in a way that does not compromise our place in the world competitively,'' Mr. Leavitt said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The confirmation vote ended a 56-day process that included a boycott by Democrats and partisan debate on the administration's environmental record. The three previous administrators won approval within two weeks of their nominations.</p>
        <p>The confirmation of Mr. Leavitt, a three-term governor with strong ties to many senators, headed for a quick ending this week after it became clear that the Republicans had enough votes to override the six Senate Democrats who had placed holds on his confirmation. Minutes before a critical vote on Monday night, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said she had reached an accord with the White House to re-examine the air quality of Lower Manhattan and would drop her opposition.</p>
        <p>''There was no way we were going to get the votes to stop the vote from occurring,'' Mrs. Clinton, who ultimately voted for Mr. Leavitt, said in an interview. ''A lot of people know him. They are impressed with his getting things done. There were members of the Democratic Caucus who have personal longstanding relationships with him.''</p>
        <p>When asked in a briefing about Mrs. Clinton and the confirmation process, he said, ''I've had no unhappy personal moments related to the confirmation.''</p>
        <p>In the debate, Democrats focused on the administration, with a handful attacking Mr. Leavitt's record in Utah.</p>
        <p>''This vote should not be seen as an endorsement of the Bush administration environmental policy, but a vote in support of a fine and honorable man who has an extremely difficult job ahead,'' said Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.</p>
        <p>Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, placed a hold on Mr. Leavitt because of his record in Utah. Mr. Lautenberg criticized Mr. Leavitt for placing ''economic gain of regulated industries above protecting the long-term health of the public.''</p>
        <p>Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, criticized enforcement on clean water and toxic dumping in Utah.</p>
        <p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, defended Mr. Leavitt and said environmental activists were misleading the Democrats.</p>
        <p>''I might as well point out that Utah is also in complete compliance with E.P.A.'s air quality standard,'' Mr. Hatch said. ''This is rare among states, and it wasn't the case when Governor Leavitt took office.''</p>
        <p>Of the six senators who placed holds, three are Democratic presidential hopefuls who not only did not speak in the debate, but were also absent from the vote. They were John Edwards of North Carolina, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut. Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, also was absent.</p>
        <p>Along with Mr. Lautenberg, the others opposing the confirmation were Barbara Boxer of California, Jon Corzine of New Jersey, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, Mr. Durbin, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Charles E. Schumer of New York.</p>
