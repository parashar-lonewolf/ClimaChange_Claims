        <p>As part of the Bush administration's recent high-profile push to develop hydrogen as the fuel of the future, the Energy Department and the European Union agreed yesterday to start a cooperative effort aimed at bringing hydrogen-powered cars and electricity generated from fuel cells to market over the next two decades.</p>
        <p>But important differences emerged in their approaches to the energy technology, largely driven by a much greater urgency in Europe than in the United States to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases scientists say contribute to global warming. The European Union, for instance, plans to derive significant quantities of hydrogen from water using renewable energy sources, while the Bush administration is focusing on experimental coal technology.</p>
        <p>More significant, the European Union has set aggressive goals, including a plan to replace 20 percent of the fuel now used to run vehicles with alternative energy sources by 2020, while the Bush administration has not. The European Union also plans to develop the hydrogen technology while trying to reduce gasoline consumption now by sharply tightening vehicle fuel efficiency standards, an effort that has stagnated for more than a decade in the United States.</p>
        <p>The agreement was announced in Brussels yesterday after a meeting between Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, and Spencer Abraham, the United States Energy Secretary. The agreement had sat unsigned for several years, a senior energy department official said, but was dusted off after President Bush announced the government's renewed interest in supporting hydrogen technology during his State of the Union address this year.</p>
        <p>''We have the same goal, though the research has different characteristics,'' Mr. Prodi said in a telephone interview after meeting with Mr. Abraham. ''We can work together to get the best results.''</p>
        <p>Through a chemical process in fuel cells, hydrogen can generate electricity, with water vapor as the only emission. While most everyone, including major oil companies, agrees that hydrogen would be an ideal fuel, it is far from commercially viable.</p>
        <p>Electricity has to be used to isolate hydrogen from water, and a point of contention among the many parties interested in hydrogen technology is how that energy is generated, whether by using natural gas, coal or renewable sources. Right now, less than 5 percent of the world's limited hydrogen production comes from renewable sources, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a trade publication.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Prodi and the American energy official portrayed their different approaches as complementary, rather than conflicting. ''The big difference is where we plan to take the energy from to produce the hydrogen,'' Mr. Prodi said. ''In the European Union, we don't have cheap coal. But in the U.S., there is a lot of cheap coal.''</p>
        <p>Both sides say that the goal of the American research effort is to avoid generating more carbon dioxide simply to isolate hydrogen as a fuel that does not produce global warming gases. The administration is supporting a major $1 billion project aimed at developing a method to isolate permanently in the ground the carbon dioxide in coal that would normally be released to the atmosphere when it is burned. ''It really gets my goat, the idea that we would take emission-free technology and taint it with dirty methods,'' the Energy Department official said. ''That is not part of our plan.''</p>
        <p>The European Union plans to invest 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) over five years in its hydrogen project, compared with the Bush administration's proposal to spend $1.7 billion for a similar period, European and American officials said.</p>
        <p>Some of that money will go to fostering research among large automakers, utilities and oil companies into fuel cell technology and an infrastructure of hydrogen service stations. Companies maintain they need government aid and broad-based partnerships with other corporations to make their technology commercially viable.</p>
        <p>Still, with the prospect of affordable hydrogen cars a distant dream, the European Union is working in the interim on mandating higher vehicle fuel efficiency, said Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington and an adviser to Mr. Prodi. The Bush administration is considering a proposal to increase fuel efficiency on sport utility vehicles by 1.5 miles per gallon over three years. Some renewable energy experts like Mr. Rifkin argue that Europe and the United States are likely to clash, rather than cooperate, over future energy strategies.</p>
        <p>''In Europe, there is a deeply felt sense of stewardship of the environment that is not felt here,'' Mr. Rifkin said. ''It is so fundamentally different that in 10, 20, 30 years, it is going to create a lot of rifts.''</p>
