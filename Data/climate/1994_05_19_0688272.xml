        <p>HALF a million households around the country will soon receive catalogues that look as if they came from a time warp: sent by local electric utilities, they promote using more electricity.</p>
        <p>After years of encouraging customers to conserve energy by selling compact fluorescent light bulbs and super-efficient water heaters, utilities are sending customers catalogues that say it's O.K. to feel good about using more electricity.</p>
        <p>The catalogue, called "The Clean Switch: Twenty Fascinating New Products That Are Good for the Earth," offers devices that use electricity instead of gasoline, propane or wood. There are cordless electric lawn mowers and weed whackers, an electric barbecue grill and even an electric canoe. Other items are products that have always been electric, like fax machines, but that in a roundabout way replace devices that pollute, like post office trucks.</p>
        <p>The catalogue is the brainchild of a Washington energy consultant, Mark Mills, who argues that anything done with a fossil fuel can be done better with electricity. Mr. Mills produced the catalogue, which a dozen utilities will put their names on and mail to their customers.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, utilities have turned to something called demand-side management, making supply match demand by reducing demand, mostly through efficiency. The utilities have been offering fluorescent bulbs that fit where an incandescent bulb usually goes, and other devices that make electricity do more work. Mr. Mills said the utilities are now worrying about what happens on the customer's side of the electric meter. And they are expanding that concern beyond electricity to conserving all forms of energy.</p>
        <p>The catalogue looks as if Reddy Kilowatt, the lightning-bolt stick figure who encouraged the use of electricity until his retirement 20 years ago, hooked up with the Sharper Image and maybe Eddie Bauer.</p>
        <p>The products are a real grab bag, including a bare-bones fax machine (Sharp, $284.95); an electric fireplace (Comfort Flame, $830 or $930, depending on wattage); a washer for cars and exterior walls that increases water pressure (Karcher, $219.95); a battery-powered canoe ($2,499.95), and an electric barbecue grill (Thermos, $299.95). Consumers can be forgiven for not instantly seeing the connections among them.</p>
        <p>But all the products are completely nonpolluting where they are used and are supposed to be cleaner over all, even when power-plant emissions are taken into effect. They are also supposed to do the job with less energy because electric generating stations use fuel more efficiently than the internal-combustion engines of lawn mowers, outboard motors and the like. Less fuel means less carbon dioxide, which scientists say is changing the earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Fax machines, for example, are supposed to be a replacement for mail. For a 20-page document sent by overnight service coast-to-coast, faxing would eliminate two pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, Mr. Mills calculated. If 10 percent of American households were to fax 50 pages a year instead of mail, 20 tons of carbon dioxide would be eliminated. This calculation takes into account carbon dioxide made by the power plant that energizes the telephone line and the fax machine; the post office truck and airplane make more.</p>
        <p>Is all this true, or is it simply a way for utilities to make more money? Maybe both. John J. Plunkett, the senior vice president at Resource Insight, a Boston-based consulting firm whose clients are mostly environmental groups and consumer advocates, said, "If you look at all the costs of doing the same things these gizmos do with other fuels, it is certainly possible that in some instances, you're going to reduce the total cost of that service."</p>
        <p>He said some of the devices might not save much but could improve the quality of a service, like a fax machine that is faster than mail service.</p>
        <p>Statistics show that the trend around the country has been to switch energy-consuming devices to electricity. In 1993, about 36 percent of all the fuel used -- including coal, oil, natural gas and uranium -- went to run electric generators. Twenty years earlier, the figure was only 27 percent. The amount of energy used to make electricity increased 50 percent between 1973 and 1993.</p>
        <p>The catalogue, showing its ecological sensitivity in eight pages of recycled paper printed with nontoxic soy-based ink, includes two electric mowers, a Black &amp; Decker ($334.95) and a Ryobi ($354.95). With a bit of hype, it notes that one runs for an hour and a half on a charge while the other "boasts a 90-minute run time." Both pollute much less than the gasoline variety, experts say. Operating a gasoline mower for an hour pollutes the air as much as running a new car for more than 11 hours, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Running the electric mower does not gas the dandelions. It does release some pollution at the power plant, of course, but those emissions are not as large or as damaging, experts say. For one thing, power plants emit no hydrocarbons, which are major ingredients of smog; lawn mowers emit them in profusion, in the form of unburned fuel. For another, even if the power plants use oil -- which is unusual -- they generally make much more efficient use of it, wringing more usable energy from each gallon than a lawn-mower engine does.</p>
        <p>The pressure washer pumps up water to 1,000 pounds a square inch, which makes it possible to wash a car with less water. That in itself is environmentally friendly. But getting water to the tap often entails a high energy cost if it is delivered by electric pump. And if it is disposed of through a sewage treatment plant, then even more electricity is used.</p>
        <p>The catalogue is new but is part of a pattern that started a few years ago. Consumer products are increasingly made with electricity instead of other forms of energy. Many new cars, for example, have finishes that were dried with infrared lamps instead of natural gas, reducing energy use. New York City is testing buses with electronic mufflers that cancel out engine noise, replacing conventional mufflers that soak up mechanical energy from the engine.</p>
        <p>And there is more on the horizon. California, New York and Massachusetts are planning to require auto makers to sell electric automobiles in a few years, and entrepreneurs are planning new electric products for the home, including a high-efficiency microwave-powered clothes dryer.</p>
