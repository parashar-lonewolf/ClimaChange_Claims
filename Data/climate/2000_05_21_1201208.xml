        <p>MY daughter had a toddler's delight in our backyard. Her  awe concerning its smallest detail, whether the color of an autumn leaf or an ant's laborious journey, would often penetrate my workaday fatigue and persuade me to delay dinner in favor of lingering outside. To me, our backyard was a quiet but ordinary patch of grass. To my Anna, it was a whole universe, infinite with possibilities.</p>
        <p>The backyard and the toddler have both changed. But with a little ingenuity, the backyard can still offer, if not a universe, surely more activities than meet the eye.</p>
        <p>Here are some ideas:</p>
        <p>*''Children like icky things,'' said Carol King, a garden columnist and a contributing editor for House and Garden magazine. ''They like frogs and worms and rocks. Give them freedom to be dirty. Help them build a house out of sticks.''</p>
        <p>Ask children to help plant a garden, Ms. King suggests, but have realistic expectations. ''They aren't going to like eggplant even if they grow it themselves,'' she said. Get some kid-size tools so children will gain gardening skills, she added.</p>
        <p>She suggested that parents help younger children plant big things, like sunflowers, which can grow 8 to 10 feet tall, and pole beans, which can also reach 8 feet. Plant the beans so the vines curl up three poles, forming a tepee. When the plants are big enough, the vines will form a secret space for children to sit and be surrounded by the towering plants.</p>
        <p>Help children plant dahlias, which grow gratifyingly fast and will bloom in July with flowers the size of dinner plates. ''They look like marigolds on steroids,'' Ms. King said.</p>
        <p>For more ideas, she recommends ''Roots, Shoots, Buckets and Boots: Gardening Together With Children,'' by Sharon Lovejoy (Workman Publishing, 1999).</p>
        <p>*If building houses out of sticks is too boring for the Nintendo generation, help your children make a backyard volcano instead. The following easy-to-follow instructions are from the book, ''Science Arts: Discovering Science Through Art Experiences,'' by MaryAnn Kohl and Jean Potter (Bright Ring Publishing, 1993):</p>
        <p>Take an empty soda bottle and put a mound of moist soil around the bottle without letting any soil inside. Put one tablespoon of baking soda into the bottle. Add red food coloring to one cup of vinegar and pour the vinegar into the bottle. The baking soda and the vinegar will react to create carbon dioxide that will force red, foaming liquid out of the bottle, like lava from a volcano.</p>
        <p>*The Web site Familyeducation.com offers these instructions for making an ant farm:</p>
        <p>Take two plastic bottles and cut a small hole in the middle of each bottle. Put a plastic tube in each hole to join the bottles together. Put holes in the top and in the tube. They should be large enough to allow the ants to breathe, but not so large the ants could escape. Add soil and tiny amounts of water. Add ants, and every two days add small amounts of water, sugar, bread and honey..</p>
        <p>*No time for a camping trip? Have one in your backyard. Set up the tent and tell stories around a campfire. If your town doesn't allow open fires, build a campfire in a barbecue grill.</p>
        <p>*Use your yard for a neighborhood art show. Gather kids to make art projects, then hang the art on clothesline and invite the parents.</p>
        <p>*Become a bird-watcher. A good beginners' bird-watching book is ''Peterson's First Guide to Birds of North America,'' by Roger Tory Peterson (Houghton Mifflin,  1998), said Kim Macklin, education director of the Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center in Mystic. She suggested that parents and children make their own backyard bird feeder by tying string onto pine cones, then rolling the cones in peanut butter and black-oil sunflower seeds and tying them onto tree branches.</p>
        <p>To attract a particularly interesting breed of bird, Ms. Macklin suggested scattering orange halves around the yard to lure Baltimore orioles with their distinctive orange markings. The orioles make distinctive pocketlike nests out of grass, she said.</p>
        <p>Because so few old trees are left with holes big enough for birds to nest in, especially in the suburbs, children and their parents can provide shelter for birds by building simple birdhouses. Nail boards together to make small wooden boxes and drill holes of varying sizes in them. If you aren't handy with a hammer, cut a two-inch hole in a clean milk carton and push a pencil under the hole to make a perch for birds. Use some wire to hang the house on a tree.</p>
        <p>Keeping track of backyard birds can contribute to science through Project FeederWatch, a joint project of Cornell University and the National Audubon Society. It enlists thousands of people across the country to keep daily journals of birds that show up at bird feeders, sending the data to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</p>
        <p>Information is available by calling  (800) 843-2473, writing FeederWatch, 159 Sapsucker Woods Road, Ithaca, N.Y., 14850, or on the Web at www.birds.cornell.edu.</p>
        <p>*Night in the backyard can also be a magical time, said Leslie Brown, professor of astronomy at Connecticut College. To see constellations and planets, get as far away as possible from bright lights, she said. A great object for budding astronomers to view is the moon, Dr. Brown said, especially  through a good pair of binoculars.</p>
        <p>''For most young children, the moon is enough,'' she said. ''They don't need Saturn or Jupiter.'</p>
        <p>Joe Rao, lecturer at the Hayden Planetarium, agreed, recalling the nights he spent as a boy gazing at the stars from his Bronx backyard. This year should be a better-than-average year for backyard astronomers to catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis, or  northern lights, Mr. Rao said.</p>
        <p>Sun particles create the phenomenon, often described as multicolored curtains in the night sky. It occurs most often at the end of 11-year cycles, when solar flares and sunspots occur frequently. This is one such year, Mr. Rao said. Besides writing the Sky Watch guide for The New York Times, he writes a monthly newsletter that highlights celestial happenings for beginning stargazers. A subscription is $12 a year and can be obtained by sending a check to Skyway Inc., P.O. Box 541, Levittown, N.Y. 11756.</p>
        <p>*Last but not least, just enjoy being with your children without making plans.</p>
        <p>''Kids may already have soccer and language school,'' Ms. King said. ''Just being outside can be a vacation.</p>
