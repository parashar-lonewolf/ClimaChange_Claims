        <p>LEAD: Radio observations in Antarctica have revealed another ''hole'' in a chemical of the stratosphere, deepening the mystery of what happens there in the spring.</p>
        <p>Radio observations in Antarctica have revealed another ''hole'' in a chemical of the stratosphere, deepening the mystery of what happens there in the spring.</p>
        <p>The ''hole'' that has been of primary concern is in the ozone layer that protects the Earth from damaging ultraviolet solar rays. In recent years, scientists have documented a marked seasonal decline in ozone over Antarctica. But today, scientists also reported a mysterious seasonal gap in nitrous oxide.</p>
        <p>While the temporary decline in nitrous oxide is not believed to pose any direct danger, it is probably linked to the ozone fluctuations, scientists said.</p>
        <p>The almost total absence of nitrous oxide last spring was ''very strange,'' said Dr. Robert L. de Zafra of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, who took part in the observations at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. ''It does not follow anything we know. And we are rock sure of our data.''</p>
        <p>''Any theory for the ozone hole,'' he said, ''must accomodate the absence of nitrous oxide.''</p>
        <p>Nitrous oxide is constantly being formed, chiefly by biological activity, and normally is diminished only gradually by a variety of chemical reactions in the stratosphere. It is usually spread uniformly from pole to pole. Puzzling Findings on Ozone</p>
        <p>New findings regarding the springtime depletion of ozone were also described here today at the spring meeting of the American Geophysical Union.</p>
        <p>The Stony Brook group participated in the National Ozone Expedition, which has previously reported that large amounts of chlorine were present when the ozone hole formed during the last Antarctic spring. A second expedition will return to Antarctica in October for the next Southern Hemisphere spring.</p>
        <p>The detection last year of unexpectedly large amounts of chlorine in the lower stratosphere over Antarctica seemed to support the hypothesis that chlorofluorocarbons, manufactured industrial chemicals, were involved in the depletion of the ozone layer there. Today, Philip M. Solomon of the Stony Brook team reported another finding that seemed to corroborate that theory: data showed that chorine tended to decline along with the ozone, suggesting the two were interacting.</p>
        <p>Yet the nitrous oxide findings underscored the continuing lack of knowledge. The possible role of nitrous oxide is unclear since the gas is thought to be involved in chemical reactions that both generate and deplete ozone.</p>
        <p>The key threat to the ozone, Dr. de Zafra said, is a molecule in which two oxygen atoms are attached to opposite sides of a chlorine molecule. This molecule is vulnerable to sunlight, but can accumulate during the polar night.</p>
        <p>Evidence that a similar, but less complete, ozone hole develops in the Arctic was also reported here today. Analysis of observations made by the weather satellites Nimbus 4 and Nimbus 7 from 1970 to 1984 have shown maximum decreases over Spitsbergen, a Norwegian island, in both May and October. The decline was minimal over southern Alaska.</p>
        <p>Nimbus data from Antarctica have traced the annual progression of the ozone depletion. They showed depletion beginning in the high stratosphere in May, the Antarctic autumn, and moving progressively downward in the stratosphere during the darkness of Antarctic winter. The observations were reported by the NASA/ Goddard Space Flight Center.</p>
        <p>Several reports indicated that the ozone depletion occurs in discrete layers, rather than uniformly, apparently dependent on sudden influxes of air from elsewhere. This was also found in the Canadian Arctic.</p>
        <p>A novel explanation for the ozone depletion was proposed by Dr. Maurice Dubin and Dr. Igor J. Eberstein of the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. During the period of continuous winter darkness, they pointed out, the polar area is pointed directly away from the sun. Meteoric particles that fall into the stratosphere remain confined there by an intense circumpolar flow of air.</p>
        <p>The particles, largely formed of frozen gases, break up when electrified by the springtime return of sunlight. This increases their surface area 100-fold and, according to the hypothesis, exposes the ozone to substances that stimulate its conversion into water or gaseous oxygen.</p>
