        <p>Tony Blair has always served as the world's Bush-whisperer, but at their joint news conference last night, it was almost the reverse. Mr. Blair, the normally silver-tongued prime minister, seemed stiff and defensive, and it was Mr. Bush who tried to smooth things over and help Mr. Blair out.</p>
        <p>British political analysts have repeatedly predicted that Mr. Blair, a lame duck whose popularity in Britain has never been lower, will be out of office as early as next year. But when a British reporter actually suggested that this was his last official Washington visit, he looked dismayed and tongue-tied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush jumped in, saying with a laugh, ''Don't count him out, let me tell it to you that way.'' He also asked the British to give his friend another chance. ''I want him to be here so long as I'm the president.''</p>
        <p>That role reversal was as good a sign as any of how the two friends' political standing has eroded since they made the case together for war in Iraq. Last week even The Economist, a British magazine that has been more favorable to Mr. Blair than most, called his partnership with Mr. Bush the ''Axis of Feeble.''</p>
        <p>In the past, Mr. Blair always raced to Washington to buck up Mr. Bush with his eloquence and aplomb, spending his own political capital to enhance that of the American. Mr. Bush was obviously grateful for his ally's support, yet last night he hinted that if he had to go it alone, he could take it from here -- even in the realm of the English language.</p>
        <p>Asked what he most regretted, Mr. Bush replied that he was sorry he had used terms like ''bring it on'' and ''dead or alive,'' and that he had learned to express himself in a ''little more sophisticated manner.''</p>
        <p>It was never an even-steven friendship; Mr. Blair risked his popularity in Britain when he stood by Mr. Bush and supported the war. In return he received gratitude, but little else.</p>
        <p>One reason Mr. Blair's reputation is so tattered is his critics dismiss him as a poodle, doing his master's bidding. It did not help that before the war, Mr. Blair was unable to persuade his American friend to seek a second United Nations resolution authorizing military action.</p>
        <p>He did not have much luck with other issues important to Europeans, from an effort to double aid to Africa to the need to take steps to avert global warming. (It probably did not help Mr. Blair's morale that ''Stuff Happens,'' a play by David Hare that focuses on the imbalance of power between the White House and 10 Downing St., is on the New York stage.)</p>
        <p>No one has been a better bedfellow for George Bush than Tony Blair, but last night the steadfast British prime minister tugged the covers to his side, adding his own, broader agenda to the subject at hand.</p>
        <p>He spoke of ''the importance of trying to unite the international community behind an agenda that means, for example, action on global poverty in Africa, and issues like Sudan; it means a good outcome to the world trade round, which is vital for the whole of the civilized world, vital for developing countries, but also vital for countries such as ourselves; for progress in the Middle East; and for ensuring that the global values that people are actually struggling for today in Iraq are global values we take everywhere and fight for everywhere that we can in our world today.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair came to Washington to help the president, but this time, perhaps for the first time, he looked like he needed the president's help.</p>
