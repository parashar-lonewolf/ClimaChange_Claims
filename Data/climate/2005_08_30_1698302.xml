        <p>Putting a Lid on It</p>
        <p>As society pumps more and more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, scientists are trying to determine what can be done to reduce the effect on global temperatures. One area of research is in developing ways to store much of the gas, perhaps underground or in the sea.</p>
        <p>But nature already has several storage systems for carbon dioxide, including plants and trees, which use the gas in photosynthesis. Scientists have wondered if trees will soak up some of the additional carbon dioxide, by growing faster. The effects of CO2 enrichment have been tested on shrubs, grasses and small trees, but it is more difficult to conduct such experiments on large trees in a natural forest.</p>

        <p>Putting a Lid on It</p>
        <p>As society pumps more and more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, scientists are trying to determine what can be done to reduce the effect on global temperatures. One area of research is in developing ways to store much of the gas, perhaps underground or in the sea.</p>
        <p>But nature already has several storage systems for carbon dioxide, including plants and trees, which use the gas in photosynthesis. Scientists have wondered if trees will soak up some of the additional carbon dioxide, by growing faster. The effects of CO2 enrichment have been tested on shrubs, grasses and small trees, but it is more difficult to conduct such experiments on large trees in a natural forest.</p>
        <p>An international team led by researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland has done just that, however, with a novel approach that involved setting up a 140-foot-tall construction crane in the middle of a hardwood forest of oaks, lindens, maples and other species.</p>
        <p>They used the crane to run a network of porous plastic tubes through the forest canopy and pumped carbon dioxide through it over four years. Over that time they measured various aspects of tree growth to see the effect the elevated CO2.</p>
        <p>Their conclusion: although the response differed among the tree species, over all there was no increase in leaf or stem growth over the four years. The trees grew vigorously, the researchers reported in the journal Science, but they did not add biomass. So perhaps trees will not be of much help in storing excess carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Farmers' Almanac</p>
        <p>An El Ni√±o event can bring heavy rains to certain areas and drought to others. Either way, the weather can wreak havoc on agriculture.</p>
        <p>Forecasters have gotten better about predicting such seasonal events, however, so farmers can plan accordingly. If drought is expected, for example, they can plant drought-resistant seeds, or alter planting times to make better use of what little rainfall there is.</p>
        <p>That all works well if the farmers hear of the forecast. In much of the developing world, however, there is no reliable way for subsistence farmers to hear of potential droughts before they happen.</p>
        <p>In Zimbabwe and a few other countries, efforts have been made to get such forecasts to farmers, usually by radio. The question then is, Do they do any good? Do farmers change their planting plans in response?</p>
        <p>Anthony Patt and Pablo Suarez of Boston University and Chiedza Gwata of the University of Zimbabwe investigated these questions in four Zimbabwean villages where local farmers plant maize, sorghum and millet. In each village, a groups of 50 farmers attended a brief workshop where the forecasts were explained and alternative planting strategies discussed.</p>
        <p>The study, published in The Proceedings in the National Academy of Sciences, showed that farmers who attended the workshop made better use of the forecasts than those who heard of them through other means. And farmers who changed their planting schemes had better harvests. So timely access to forecasts is useful, the researchers say, though other assistance -- in the form of cheaper fertilizer, say, or better availability of credit for making improvements like irrigation -- may be even more important.</p>
        <p>The Ripple Effect</p>
        <p>There's more evidence of the power of the Dec. 26 earthquake that spawned the tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people around the Indian Ocean. The wave continued around the world, though at much lower energy, guided by an undersea ridge.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and other institutions reported in the online edition of Science that small waves were recorded at places like Halifax, Nova Scotia (halfway around the world from the quake's epicenter) up to a day after the event.</p>
        <p>Wave heights were much smaller than the tsunami, ranging from a few inches in England to 10 inches in Alaska to about 20 inches in Halifax and Peru.</p>
        <p>Bacteria Get Their Day: Undercount Is Rectified</p>
        <p>How many different species of bacteria would you find in a thimbleful of soil? Until recently, scientists would have said about 10,000.</p>
        <p>While that is a remarkable number, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have now revised it upward by at least two orders of magnitude. In a study published in the journal Science, they report that a gram of unpolluted soil contains a million bacterial species or more.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to count, or even identify, that number of species. The researchers -- John Dunbar, Jason Gans and Murray Wolinsky of the laboratory's bioscience division -- analyzed data on DNA reassociation kinetics, or how long it takes for broken-up bits of DNA from all the bacteria, roughly a billion cells in a gram of soil, to reassemble. The amount of time indicates how many species are present.</p>
        <p>''Think about going to a party with a partner,'' Dr. Dunbar said. ''The more people there are at the party, the harder it's going to be to find your partner just by bumping into each other.'' It's the same with fragments of DNA, he said. ''The more sequences you have in the sample, the more diverse it is, the longer it takes for the pieces to come back together.''</p>
        <p>The researchers actually reanalyzed old data, using more sophisticated mathematics that took into account that there might be a lot of some species and very little of others. ''In previous analyses, researchers did not account for differences in species abundance,'' Dr. Dunbar said. ''As a result, they dramatically undercounted.''</p>
        <p>''In one sense, what we did was very trivial,'' he added. ''We simply allowed for the fact that species are almost certainly present at different abundances. The sophisticated thing we did was reorganizing the math to allow us to analyze this.''</p>
        <p>Their results showed that of the million or more species, 99.9 percent were present in small quantities. A relative handful of species dominate.</p>
        <p>The researchers also analyzed data from polluted soil, showing that heavy metal contamination sharply reduces microbial diversity. So the method should prove useful in studying damage from pollution or other environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>''We've taken a very old experimental technique and developed new mathematical methods that can accurately assess species loss due to pollution and climate change,'' Dr. Dunbar said.</p>
