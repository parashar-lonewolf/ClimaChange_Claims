        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 23 Science Times article on the Sun's contribution to global warming omits critical data and obscures the most important fact about the trend -- a potentially disruptive warming of Earth is inevitable unless industrial emissions are curtailed.</p>
        <p>It is odd that the chart of temperatures accompanying the article is cut off at 1975 and refers only to the Northern Hemisphere. Had global data for the past 20 years been included, the assertion by some that ''the majority of the century's warming occurred before 1940'' would be seen to be incorrect.</p>

        <p>Your Sept. 23 Science Times article on the Sun's contribution to global warming omits critical data and obscures the most important fact about the trend -- a potentially disruptive warming of Earth is inevitable unless industrial emissions are curtailed.</p>
        <p>It is odd that the chart of temperatures accompanying the article is cut off at 1975 and refers only to the Northern Hemisphere. Had global data for the past 20 years been included, the assertion by some that ''the majority of the century's warming occurred before 1940'' would be seen to be incorrect.</p>
        <p>Observed warming of 1 degree Fahrenheit is the net result of many atmospheric changes, some of human origin and some natural. One reason most scientists are confident that greenhouse gases have contributed to this warming is that the atmospheric buildup of most of these gases is known to high accuracy. Consequently, their heat-trapping effect can be calculated precisely. An analogous calculation cannot yet be done for the solar effect because there are insufficient data to directly determine the Sun's variation over the past century.</p>
        <p>Unless greenhouse emissions are curtailed soon, the human influence on climate is likely to overwhelm natural variations over the coming century.</p>
