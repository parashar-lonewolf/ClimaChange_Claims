        <p>LEAD: RESEARCHERS at the University of Michigan have set up an underground laboratory that offers a window on the little-understood interaction of plants, nutrients and animals below the surface of a forest in northern Michigan.</p>
        <p>RESEARCHERS at the University of Michigan have set up an underground laboratory that offers a window on the little-understood interaction of plants, nutrients and animals below the surface of a forest in northern Michigan.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the lab, at the University of Michigan Biological Station on Douglas Lake near here, will be used to study the impact of the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere on the growth and development of underground roots and animals, and how carbon, energy and nutrients are transferred among organisms in the soil.</p>
        <p>The lab, called a Soil Biotron, is a 120-foot-long cement block tunnel, 10 feet wide by 10 feet tall, just under the surface. The laboratory houses 34 window bays, each containing 16 removable glass panes permitting observation and direct access to the soil from the surface to a depth of about four feet.</p>
        <p>''Scientists have a very poor understanding of how energy and nutrients are transferred among organisms in the soil,'' said Dr. James A. Teeri, a professor of biology and director of the station. ''We hope to learn something about that down here.''</p>
        <p>Before the Soil Biotron was built, the principal studies of underground life were made from core samples, in which the researcher examined organisms in the soil, usually destroying them in the process. These studies were inadequate because they were small in scope, and the organisms could not be kept in a natural state for long. In the soil lab, researchers can now make observations through the windows, following one organism or one root for long periods. Focusing on a Root</p>
        <p>As an example, Dr. Teeri pointed to a camera being used by his colleague, Dr. Robert D. Fogel, associate professor of biology. He is studying the relationship between photosynthesis and the availability of water and nutrients, and how the relationships control the growth of trees and other plants.</p>
        <p>The camera was focused on a root and timed to take a picture every 30 minutes. In a few months, Dr. Fogel hopes to have a photographic record of the development of the root and life around it.</p>
        <p>Another convenience of the soil lab, Dr. Teeri noted, is that ''we can open up windows to introduce food or organisms, or remove them for study.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We know that the trees take sunlight and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but we really don't have any idea what proportion of that actually ends up underground.</p>
        <p>''We don't understand much about the interactions in the soil, including the transfers of energy, carbon dioxide and nutrients,'' he said. ''Who eats whom is not well understood.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Fogel said: ''We know that trees take some carbon dioxide. We can measure how fast it is taken up to make food, and we know that a substantial amount of that carbon - food - is transferred underground to the roots. But beyond that we don't know.'' Photosynthesis Halted</p>
        <p>''We know that there are lots of decomposers in the soil,'' Dr. Fogel continued, ''and lots of small animals, but we don't know much more.''</p>
        <p>''We'd like to know to what extent does the interaction of soil organisms with roots influence the whole tree to grow,'' the researcher said. ''We think there is a very high cost to the tree in the growth and replacement of the roots. As the nutrients are depleted, the roots are forced to explore for more food.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Teeri pointed out that last July, at the peak of the heat wave and drought, photosynthesis halted completely throughout the forest because all tree energy was devoted to sending roots in search of water.</p>
        <p>''We don't know if all these changes are good or bad,'' he said. ''The Soil Biotron is one of the first places on earth where we can study both the above ground and below ground effect of carbon dioxide on trees.</p>
        <p>''We know the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been at a higher rate than ever before in the history of the planet,'' Dr. Teeri said. In 1970 the level of carbon dioxide averaged 315 parts per million at the biological station, while for the past year it has averaged 350 parts per million, representing a rise that is common around the world.</p>
        <p>''Most of the discussion so far has been on the warming of the atmosphere based on temperature readings taken around the world in instrument shelters six feet above the earth's surface,'' Dr. Teeri said. ''But the greenhouse effect will also influence soil temperatures and we are interested in to what extent this will speed up soil processes.'' Decomposition Would Rise</p>
        <p>''Most organisms in the soil are more sensitive to temperature changes than those above the soil,'' he said. ''Higher temperatures speed up the processes and activities of animals and plants. So processes like decomposition will increase. The question is how long that higher rate can be maintained due to nutrient depletion.''</p>
        <p>A few laboratory studies of the effects of increases in carbon dioxide have shown that different species respond in different ways, with some growing faster above ground and others growing faster below ground. But researchers do not know how plants in a natural state respond to such increases.</p>
        <p>''We expect to find differences in the proportion of growth above ground and below ground,'' Dr. Teeri said. ''As a result of that we anticipate that there may be changes in competitive interactions among different species of plants which could result in changes in the species composition of the forest.''</p>
