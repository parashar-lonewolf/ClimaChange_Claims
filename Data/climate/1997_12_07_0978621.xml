        <p>Sen Pete V Domenici letter notes that Nov 30 editorial questioned recent 10 percent increase in cost of insuring reliability of nuclear weapons; says US has decided to forgo nuclear testing, a gigantic change from way we previously maintained our stockpile; says it costs more without testing; contends that we now better understand this job and anticipate cost increase to $45 billion from our earlier estimate of $40 billion ur nation's security</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Price of Nuclear Preparedness'' (editorial, Nov. 30) questioned the recent 10 percent increase in the cost of insuring the reliability of nuclear weapons. The United States has decided to forgo nuclear testing, and that's a gigantic change from the way we previously maintained our stockpile. It costs more without testing. We now better understand this job and anticipate a cost increase to $45 billion from our earlier estimate of $40 billion -- still a small price to insure our nation's security.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Price of Nuclear Preparedness'' (editorial, Nov. 30) questioned the recent 10 percent increase in the cost of insuring the reliability of nuclear weapons. The United States has decided to forgo nuclear testing, and that's a gigantic change from the way we previously maintained our stockpile. It costs more without testing. We now better understand this job and anticipate a cost increase to $45 billion from our earlier estimate of $40 billion -- still a small price to insure our nation's security.</p>
        <p>We need other critical policy decisions about our uses of nuclear technologies. Senate debate on the comprehensive test ban treaty is likely next year. We must explore the revitalizing role of nuclear energy to insure future energy sources and to help address global competition for fossil fuels. Concerns about greenhouse gases further argue for re-examining nuclear energy. We must address waste disposal and proliferation.</p>
        <p>Better new options exist for energy, proliferation and waste; we should explore them. Furthermore, we should resize our stockpile based on threats. These and similar initiatives may increase costs; they also may pay immense dividends.</p>
        <p>We aren't wisely using nuclear technologies. The current anxiety-laden, fragmented state of nuclear policy debate in the country has created this situation. Irrational fears of perceived risks of nuclear technologies prevent us from actions to address real risks and optimize their use. As I've said in recent speeches at Harvard and elsewhere, it's time for a mature, scientifically based reexamination of nuclear technologies.</p>
        <p>PETE V. DOMENICI  U.S. Senator from New Mexico  Washington, Dec. 5, 1997</p>
