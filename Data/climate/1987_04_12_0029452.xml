        <p>LEAD: POLLUTION is no respecter of national frontiers. Fallout from Chernobyl was blown across a dozen countries. Toxic chemicals flushed down the Rhine in Basel wiped out river life in France, West Germany and Holland. And half the trees in the Black Forest were found damaged by sulfurous fumes, mostly from Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>POLLUTION is no respecter of national frontiers. Fallout from Chernobyl was blown across a dozen countries. Toxic chemicals flushed down the Rhine in Basel wiped out river life in France, West Germany and Holland. And half the trees in the Black Forest were found damaged by sulfurous fumes, mostly from Eastern Europe. In North America, industrial pollution from the United States causes acid rain in Canada.</p>
        <p>Dealing with such problems requires international cooperation, but conflicting interests can make the necessary alliances difficult to maintain. Last week, President Reagan announced that he would ''consider'' an acid rain agreement with Canada. But Canadian environmentalists criticized the pledge as a halfhearted attempt to placate Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Chemical emissions from American plants have been blamed by the Canadian Government for causing half of the damage done to the country's lakes and forests by acid rain. To a lesser extent, Canadian industries contribute to the problem in the Northeastern United States.</p>
        <p>Recently, however, there has been some progress in international cooperation. After optimistically declaring 1987 ''European Environment Year,'' European Governments agreed to join the United States, the Soviet Union and other industrial nations in an effort to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons. This industrial pollutant threatens to erode the ozone layer, which permits life on earth by filtering the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. The gases are also believed to contribute to the warming of the atmosphere, threatening major climatic changes.</p>
        <p>In February, at a meeting in Vienna sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program, the Europeans said that they were ready to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons by 20 percent over the next five years. This move may lead to an international agreement to phase out the gases, which are widely used to power aerosol sprays, puff up plastic foam cartons, cool refrigerators and clean computers.</p>
        <p>The European offer falls short of the 95 percent production cut demanded by the United States, which has already banned the gases in aerosols. But it means the 28 industrial countries that pledged in 1985 to protect the ozone layer probably will agree later this year to start reducing chlorofluorocarbon output.</p>
        <p>''We're very optimistic about an agreement now,'' said Adam Markham of the environmental group Friends of the Earth in London. ''It will be the first agreement to prevent an ecological disaster instead of cleaning up afterwards.'' Chemical Industry Opposition</p>
        <p>Not everyone supports the effort. The British and West German chemical industries question the need for the curbs and complain that they will unfairly benefit the United States chemical giant E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, which leads the world in developing alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>Du Pont originally opposed the controls as unnecessary. But in late 1984 it saw the writing on the wall and stepped up research on safe substitutes. Last year the company agreed that production cuts were justified and said it could provide ecologically sound alternative gases in commercial quantities in about five years. European chemical companies say that it may take them 10 to 15 years to catch up.</p>
        <p>An agreement cutting chlorofluorocarbon production would be only the second international pact aimed at reducing atmospheric pollution, although numerous agreements exist regulating the dumping of wastes into rivers and the sea. In 1985, 22 countries formed the so-called 30 Percent Club, pledging to combat acid rain by cutting power station and factory emissions of sulfur dioxide 30 percent by 1993.</p>
        <p>But compliance is spotty. The United States has stayed out of the club, arguing that it has already done more than other countries to alleviate the problem. In Russia and Eastern Europe, where widespread use of brown coal creates particularly severe air pollution, economic planners appear powerless to cure their industry of its incorrigibly dirty habits. ''In the Communist system, there is no incentive for state firms to develop anti-pollution technology,'' Mr. Markham said.</p>
        <p>In 1986 Poland declared the industrial cities of Katowice, Krakow and Gdansk ''ecological catastrophe zones,'' citing hazardous levels of air and water pollution. Communist countries are now pressing Western nations to provide them with free anti-pollution technology, admitting that they are incapable of developing it quickly enough themselves and too poor to buy it.</p>
        <p>Several Western countries have responded to the pleas out of self-interest, reasoning that unless they help the Communist world clean up its industrial act, their own forests and lakes will continue to be poisoned by fumes drifting in from Eastern Europe. West Germany is already helping neighboring East Germany and Czechoslovakia cope with smoky factories. And Sweden and Denmark, worried by contamination from Poland, favor a West European Enviromental aid program for Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, talks are faltering on reducing the nitrogen oxide that automobiles and factories pump into the atmosphere. The United States insists on catalytic converters on new cars, and West Germany plans to follow suit. But other European countries are balking, worried by new restrictions on one of the few remaining growth areas of their economies.</p>
