        <p>Heads of state from the 15 member nations of the European Union made only limited progress on plans to re-energize the faltering European economy at their two-day meeting here, overshadowed by the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>The leaders said today in a joint statement that the war would make it more difficult for the union to achieve the goal they set at a similar conference in Lisbon three years ago: creating the world's most competitive economy by 2010. They reiterated that goal today and said a revamping of labor markets was their top economic priority.</p>
        <p>In Lisbon the union set a target of 20 million new jobs by 2010. The leaders said today that ''far-reaching structural reform'' aimed at raising productivity will be needed to achieve that.</p>
        <p>The leaders called on the European Commission, the union's executive body, to set up an employment task force led by the former Dutch prime minister, Wim Kok, to study measures to improve both the quantity and the quality of jobs in the union. They repeated a pledge to make it easier for companies to hire and fire.</p>
        <p>The 15 heads of state agreed to move ahead quickly with plans to negotiate a single unionwide aviation treaty with the United States to replace individual bilateral deals, a move that the commission has said will help the ailing airline industry by allowing more cross-border mergers and competition.</p>
        <p>But the leaders made no progress on the proposed package of new tax rules meant to reduce market distortions, including a long-disputed measure that would phase out bank secrecy and would tax foreigners' savings accounts to reduce tax evasion. The last details of the plan were supposed to be ironed out by the 15 nations' finance ministers on the eve of the meeting. But Italy blocked the agreement as part of a drive to get more favorable treatment for its dairy farmers in an unrelated debate about milk quotas.</p>
        <p>''The ministers wasted 40 minutes talking about tax, while more pressing matters were at hand,'' said one diplomat who attended the meetings. ''This illustrates an embarrassing weakness in the European decision-making process.''</p>
        <p>The heads of state also failed to make any progress on the Galileo navigational satellite project, the union's ambitious plan to build a rival to the Global Positioning System network of the United States. Italy and Germany both want to be home to the Galileo project, and the union has yet to agree on how to share out the project's budget.</p>
        <p>But a breakthrough was achieved in the union's six-year effort to harmonize energy taxes across the union and to cut carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>The finance ministers, meeting in the wings at the conference of heads of state on Thursday, settled on a law meant to increase minimum excise duties on fuel by about 20 percent and to extend energy taxes to electricity, coal and natural gas for the first time.</p>
        <p>But environmental groups said the effect of the law will be minimal because most member nations already impose energy taxes well above the proposed new minimums.</p>
