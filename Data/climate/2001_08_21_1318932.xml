        <p>Democratic critics and environmental groups are stepping up pressure to halt President Bush's nomination of Ohio's top environmental regulator to be the lead enforcer for the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Critics say that the regulator, Donald Schregardus, was lax during his tenure in Ohio and that several programs for which he was responsible are under investigation by the federal agency. Mr. Schregardus also opposed lawsuits filed by the federal government during the Clinton administration against power plants, many of them in the Midwest, which emit pollution that drifts toward the Northeast. As a result, his nomination is shaping up as the latest battleground in the regional war over acid rain and other policies affecting clean air.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, today joined Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, in putting a ''hold'' on Mr. Schregardus's nomination. That effectively blocks the nomination from being voted on by the full Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer said he would keep a hold on the nomination until the Bush administration clarified its position on whether the federal government would withdraw from the lawsuits it filed in the Clinton era against power plants in the Midwest and the South. The administration is under industry pressure to drop the suits and give power plants more flexibility in meeting clean-air requirements, a move that would leave the Northeast states unable to pursue those cases on their own. The Justice Department was expected to disclose the administration's position last week but has delayed its announcement.</p>
        <p>''This man is clearly totally unsympathetic to what is probably our greatest environmental crisis in the Northeast,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schregardus did not return a call to his office seeking comment. The administration defended the nomination and said it intended to see that he was confirmed.</p>
        <p>Anne Womack, a White House spokeswoman, said: ''Confirmation should be based upon the qualifications of the nominee, not the narrow agenda of two members of the Senate. Donald Schregardus is highly experienced and more than qualified. The longer his nomination is delayed by the Senate, the longer the important work he will do at the E.P.A. must wait.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schregardus was asked only one budget-related question and nothing about clean air issues when his nomination came up at a hearing last month before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The committee approved his nomination on Aug. 1, over the objections of four of the Democratic senators on the committee -- Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, Jon Corzine of New Jersey, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Ms. Boxer.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the environmental committee, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, a Republican turned independent, supported Mr. Schregardus. Mr. Jeffords usually votes with Democrats on environmental matters, but said he generally supported the president's right to pick the team he wants. That was also the view of Senator Lincoln Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican with strong allegiance to the agenda of national environmental groups, who supported the nomination.</p>
        <p>A Republican Senate aide said the administration did not pave the way for Mr. Schregardus's nomination, failing to take him on courtesy calls to senators. Scott Milburn, a spokesman for Senator George V. Voinovich, the Ohio Republican who when he was governor had appointed Mr. Schregardus to his state job and is a member of the committee, said: ''Mr. Voinovich thinks the administration needs to reach out and do the due diligence to answer concerns that people might have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Voinovich was at odds with Christie Whitman, the administrator of the E.P.A., in 1997, when he was governor of Ohio and she was governor of New Jersey. Mr. Voinovich, like Mr. Schregardus, opposed toughening air-quality standards for power plants, which Ms. Whitman favored. She continues to argue that position, but serves an administration that has sent mixed signals about what it sees as the proper mix of enforcement and negotiation when dealing with industry.</p>
        <p>With the Democrats in control of the chamber, the two ''holds'' by Senators Boxer and Schumer could  tie up the nomination for some time. An aide to Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said that the senators' holds on the nomination ''indicates that he's a contentious nominee and indicates their willingness to filibuster, and there will be debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milburn, the spokesman for Mr. Voinovich, said that Mr. Schregardus was a ''tough administrator'' and that during his eight years as director of the E.P.A. office in Ohio in the 1990's, he tripled the amount of fines collected from Ohio polluters. He also said that during Mr. Schregardus's tenure, all 88 counties in Ohio complied with the Clean Air Act for the first time.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Schregardus has said that he helped bring the state's rivers and streams up to the Clean Water Act's ''fishable, swimmable'' standard. When he took the Ohio job, 37 percent of the state's waters met the standard, and when he stepped down more than 50 percent did. In addition, the state E.P.A. budget went up by 60 percent during his years as head of the office.</p>
        <p>But environmental groups have stepped up their opposition to Mr. Schregardus since the Senate committee's vote. The Environmental Working Group, using data provided by the states, says that under Mr. Schregardus's tenure Ohio ranked as the worst in the nation for its failure to inspect factories that met the legal definition of being ''significant violators'' of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act in 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>Thirteen of 31 major manufacturing plants in Ohio violated the Clean Air Act from January 1997 to December 1998. Mr. Schregardus's department fined two of them.</p>
        <p>Earthjustice, a nonprofit legal arm of the environmental movement, said that under Mr. Schregardus, Ohio disregarded a federal mandate calling for the reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions from utilities and violated the whistle-blower provision of seven federal statutes regarding a contaminated site in Marion, Ohio.</p>
        <p>The federal E.P.A. is investigating Ohio to determine whether it should revoke the state's authority to administer certain federal environmental programs because of its failure to enforce the rules.</p>
        <p>An official at the federal agency played down the significance of this investigation, terming it a review and saying that the agency must conduct such reviews when it is petitioned by environmental groups, as it was in this case. But the official also said that petitions had been brought in only a handful of other states and that more programs in Ohio were in question than in any other state.</p>
