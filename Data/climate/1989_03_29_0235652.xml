        <p>LEAD: Almost two decades after the Federal Government forced auto makers to begin reducing car exhaust emissions, scientists and Government regulators say that further reductions will be difficult as long as cars run on gasoline.</p>
        <p>Almost two decades after the Federal Government forced auto makers to begin reducing car exhaust emissions, scientists and Government regulators say that further reductions will be difficult as long as cars run on gasoline.</p>
        <p>The newest models from Detroit already remove up to 96 percent of the pollutants that were emitted from engines before controls were first imposed in 1972. But engineers and scientists agree that they see no way to remove the remaining traces of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. The big gains in the next decade will come from existing technology being in more cars.</p>
        <p>''Not much more can be removed from what's coming out of today's cars,'' said William Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board.</p>
        <p>Gordon Rinschler, an executive engineer for the Chrysler Corporation, said: ''Zero hydrocarbon levels are just not possible. Can we reduce emissions to lower levels? Maybe. It's not possible to go to zero.''</p>
        <p>If emissions are to keep falling beyond a certain point and eventually become a minor component of air pollution, the scientists say, vehicles will have to switch to energy sources like natural gas, electricity and fuels containing methanol. Progress Seen by 2000</p>
        <p>In the meantime, they predict that by 2000 the total number of cars employing the latest technology will have increased enough so that automobile air pollution levels will be 20 percent of what they are today, provided that the number of cars does not increase significantly and Americans do not drive more miles.</p>
        <p>The total amount of automobile pollution released into the atmosphere has been declining since early in this decade, according to studies by the Environmental Protection Agency. But the level of overall automobile pollutants has not declined as rapidly as the emission reductions in the newest cars. This is because the total number of cars has been growing in recent years, Americans are driving slightly more than they used to and emission-control systems become less efficient with age.</p>
        <p>This has led experts to warn that the Federal Government and the states must focus added attention on keeping older cars properly tuned and their emission-control systems functioning properly. As cars age, emission controls function less effectively, and some drivers fail to maintain the systems or disable them deliberately.</p>
        <p>Air pollution from cars has taken on new importance in the wake of the adoption of a preliminary plan in Southern California earlier this month that would dictate a switch to alternative fuels for 40 percent of cars within the next decade and would end the use of gasoline in all cars by 2007, technology permitting.</p>
        <p>Officials of the E.P.A., which since 1972 has applied continuous pressure on auto makers to reduce emissions, stated in recent testimony that use of alternative fuels had more promise of reducing emissions than further modification of gasoline engines and catalytic converters that treat the exhaust after it leaves the engine.</p>
        <p>If emission levels cannot be cut further, that will have important implications for Los Angeles and other cities with serious air quality problems. Those areas may have no choice but to consider eventually switching to alternative fuels, power sources like batteries or huge public transportation systems. Methanol and Methane</p>
        <p>Many environmental scientists find promise for clean air in fuels like methanol and methane, because they are chemically much simpler than gasoline and can be burned with fewer and more easily disposable byproducts. Natural gas, for example, produces mostly water and carbon dioxide. Some alternative fuels, however, present other problems. Methanol, for example, corrodes steel.</p>
        <p>''It's easier to get a big reduction switching fuels than by improving engines, but oil companies are going to lose their markets for petroleum as a result, service stations are going to have to make changes, cars are going to have to be modified,'' said Jeff Alson, the E.P.A.'s assistant director of emission controls. ''Our biggest industries will be affected.''</p>
        <p>Theoretically, if every car on the road used the most sophisticated technology available and was in good repair, the pollutants released in the air would drop substantially from current levels, the scientists say. 'More Than People Realize'</p>
        <p>''As the vehicle fleet turns over,'' said Michael J. Schwarz, manager of emission control analysis and planning for the Ford Motor Company, ''the benefits will be more than people realize.''</p>
        <p>The Federal Government has favored aggressive statewide inspection programs to make sure car emission systems are well maintained and comply with standards, but such programs have been politically controversial, said Mr. Alson of the E.P.A. The latest plan by California air quality officials would raise the maximum cost of maintenance that could be ordered by inspectors to $300 from the current $50.</p>
        <p>''Part of any improvement has to come as a commitment from the public to keep their cars in tune, to change spark plugs and to change oil,'' Mr. Schwarz said.</p>
        <p>The automobile industry has spent billions redesigning its vehicles since the early 1970's, when engines were spewing unfiltered gasoline exhaust directly into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The high level of pollutants in the exhaust resulted in part from additives like lead. Moreover, gasoline, which is actually a blend of hundreds of hydrocarbons, was not being completely burned because of a relatively imprecise and irregular mixture of fuel and air. 'Some Real Basic Things'</p>
        <p>''Doing some real basic things like taking lead out of gasoline, controlling the fuel and air ratio and perfecting spark timing got rid of a lot'' of pollution, Mr. Alson said. ''The next big advance in 1975 and 1976 was the introduction of catalytic converters.''</p>
        <p>Today, Detroit's most advanced engines are fuel-injected, and the combustion process is controlled by electronic ignitions and computer modules. Engine exhaust flows through catalytic converters, which contain platinum, palladium and rhodium -rare and expensive metals that act as catalysts to promote further burning of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen, the three main categories of pollution.</p>
        <p>The ideal byproducts of complete gasoline combustion would be carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. But several practical problems continue to confound engineers trying to perfect the combustion process. Cold Cars Pollute More</p>
        <p>Catalytic converters, for example, are effective only when they are hot. That means the vast majority of pollution from a car continues in the first few minutes of operation while the catalytic converter is relatively cool. Once the engine and the catalytic converter are hot, nearly 100 percent of pollutants are eliminated.</p>
        <p>''We have been working on catalysts that allowed the converter to get up to temperature and working faster,'' said Mr. Rinschler of Chrysler, ''but we found they weren't durable.''  NEW YORK RULES</p>
        <p>ALBANY, March 28 - Seeking to reduce smog and ozone pollution this summer, New York State announced regulations today that will require changes in the formulation of gasoline sold in the eastern part of the state from June 1 to Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Conservation Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, said the changes would substantially lower ozone concentrations and lead to a reduction in the number of days that the New York area would exceed Federal ozone standards. There were 27 such days last summer.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has indicated that it will impose similar standards for the gasoline.</p>
