        <p>LEAD: Ten years ago, Britain was the sick man of Europe, its industries crumbling, its economy paralyzed by intractable labor disputes, its political and intellectual leaders resigned to genteel but inevitable decline.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, Britain was the sick man of Europe, its industries crumbling, its economy paralyzed by intractable labor disputes, its political and intellectual leaders resigned to genteel but inevitable decline.</p>
        <p>Today, by many standards, Britain is thriving. London is bustling with new money, new construction and new pride. The country's strike rate is one of the lowest in Europe, the gross national product and productivity are up, and Britain is again being taken seriously as a force in world affairs.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, now the senior leader in the Western alliance and the longest-serving British Prime Minister in this century, came to power on May 4, 1979. Her supporters believe her policies created these changes. Her critics doubt that they mean that much, or will last that long. Admired Though Unloved</p>
        <p>Her claim to leadership in the NATO alliance still runs up against the limits of British power, as it did over the weekend when Chancellor Helmut Kohl rejected her admonitions to stand firm on accepting a new generation of American short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany, and he is not the only European colleague who finds her vision of Europe crabbed and restrictive.</p>
        <p>At home, she is admired but mostly unloved, a figure who thrives on adversity, though until recently she has not been seriously challenged by the opposition Labor Party.</p>
        <p>''It requires a leader of great determination to carry out the most difficult task of all, that of changing attitudes,'' she recently told a foreign leader she much admires, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But how much has she changed British attitudes? A New Confidence</p>
        <p>She has certainly given the British business class a new sense of confidence. ''It's in the air,'' said Peter Palumbo, a multimillionaire investment manager she recently appointed as head of the British Arts Council, in a typical comment. The expensive West End restaurants where many of the clients in the 1970's were Middle Eastern oilmen are now booked to capacity by British executives. As one of Mrs. Thatcher's advisers said recently: ''Ten years ago, they didn't have the money to spend in places like this. But their personal income tax rate has gone down to 40 percent, and that means a lot.''</p>
        <p>Not that they have nothing to worry about. Unemployment, even though falling steadily for the last year, is still at 2 million, 6.9 percent of the labor force, and it was only 1.3 million in 1979. The British trade deficit has been running at well over $2.5 billion a month this year. Her Values Dominate</p>
        <p>Retail price inflation, 10 percent a year in early 1979, is again up to 7.9 percent today, partly because the Government jacked up interest rates to keep it under control and new homeowners now have to pay interest rates of 14 percent and up in their monthly mortgage payments. A round of strikes threatens to paralyze the London Underground and British Rail's commuter services this spring, bringing back unpleasant memories of the way things were before Mrs. Thatcher.</p>
        <p>But both her admirers and her critics concede that the values of Thatcherism, with its emphasis on individual self-reliance and deregulated private enterprise, now dominate the political agenda. Welfare-state socialism, which did so from World War II to the 1970's, is often dismissed as a tired idea that has lost its vote-getting appeal.</p>
        <p>But it is far from clear that the country has actually adopted Thatcherite values as its own.</p>
        <p>The power of trade unions has declined, and their membership has gone down sharply, from 12.2 million in the Trades Union Congress in 1981 to 8.8 million at the end of last year. Partly because of new laws that make it harder for union leaders to call strikes, British industry lost only one-ninth of the number of working days in labor disputes in the last year that it lost in 1979, the year of the ''winter of discontent'' that helped bring Mrs. Thatcher to power.</p>
        <p>''I used to sit in my office every Saturday night, not knowing whether I'd be able to put out a paper the next day,'' said Andrew F. Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, which broke a long strike in the mid-1980's and ended an era of restrictive labor practices on Fleet Street. ''Mrs. Thatcher created the kind of environment that made that possible,'' he said. ''It couldn't have been done before.''</p>
        <p>She has now won three national elections in succession, a shift in voting patterns that some explain by changes in economic patterns fostered by her policies. The proportion of voters owning their own homes rose from 53 percent in 1979 to 68 percent in 1988, according to official statistics, largely because the Government sold off hundreds of thousands of state-owned subsidized housing units to their tenants, making them property owners. Issues Close to Home</p>
        <p>But recent studies on this new property class show that most of them were more likely to vote Conservative before they bought their apartments. Gary Hayes, a 32-year-old contractor who just bought his two-bedroom apartment in an East London housing project for $37,400, less than half its market price, may be typical. He and his wife, Linda, are busily installing a new kitchen and replacing the faded wallpaper, but they think their own hard work, rather than Mrs. Thatcher's largesse, got them where they are.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how I'd vote if there were an election tomorrow,'' Mr. Hayes said; he said that he admired Mrs. Thatcher for winning the Falkland War against Argentina in 1982, but that how he voted next time would depend on what was going on closer to voting day.</p>
        <p>Issues closer to home are of more concern to him than national Government policy, he said. He cited the influx of immigrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan in his neighborhood; the fear that many of their children do not speak English and will slow down the progress of his 4-year-old son Marc in the neighborhood schools, and the rundown condition of the local National Health Service hospitals. Outcry Over Health Service</p>
        <p>And if Mrs. Thatcher thought that shaking up the National Health Service through private-enterprise initiatives would be popular with ordinary voters, she was wrong. After the Government announced its intentions last winter, an extraordinary chorus of public denunciations by patients, nurses and doctors reflected anger and fear that the result would be to force Britons to pay for their health care through private insurance.</p>
        <p>''If they gave the doctors a budget to stay within, it'd change things,'' Mrs. Hayes said. ''They wouldn't prescribe medicine or proper treatment if it cost too much.''</p>
        <p>In a class-ridden society, Mrs. Thatcher's policies are often criticized for making the rich richer, and the poor poorer, not increasing social mobility by very much at all.</p>
        <p>There is more wealth around - Inland Revenue now officially lists 20,000 people as pound millionaires, compared with 5,000 five years ago. Little Change in Attitude</p>
        <p>So how much have social and political attitudes really changed under the surface? ''Precious little,'' said Robert M. Worcester, chairman of the poll-taking organization Market and Opinion Research International.</p>
        <p>In June 1988, his organization asked 2,000 people around the nation what they thought the country's values actually were, and what they would like them to be, asking them to choose from statements categorized as Thatcherist and socialist.</p>
        <p>Thatcherism was defined in such terms as ''a society where the individual is encouraged to look after himself,'' and ''a society in which the creation of wealth is more highly rewarded.'' Socialism was defined, in the same categories, as ''a society which emphasizes the social and collective provision of welfare,'' and ''a society in which the caring for others is more highly rewarded.''</p>
        <p>''On average,'' said Mr. Worcester, summarizing his findings, ''7 people in 10 thought Britain was Thatcherist, but only 4 in 10 thought it ought to be.'' In a poll he made of 1,541 voters in January, Mr. Worcester said, the proportions were about the same. ''If anything, she has made no further inroads on the values that people hold,'' he said. Old Money Prevails</p>
        <p>There are other indications that seem to bear him out. The Sunday Times, in a recent article on the country's richest 200 people, found that 57 percent of them were ''old money,'' not the ''loadsamoney'' enterprisers and opportunists that have done so well in Mrs. Thatcher's years.</p>
        <p>Indeed, to many in the traditional British social elite, Mrs. Thatcher will always be the grocer's daughter from Grantham, a heritage of which she is proud. But even in her Cabinet, graduates of the ''right'' schools - Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester - still predominate. Fourteen of 22 Cabinet members went to Oxford or Cambridge.</p>
        <p>''I've got great faith in this younger generation,'' said Edward Heath, the former Prime Minister whom Mrs. Thatcher replaced as party leader. ''They want to move, they want to change. The class structure is against it to a considerable extent. But we shan't do it just by encouraging greed.</p>
        <p>''I think the problems are going to grow, and a lot of the electorate is more and more dissatisfied over such things as health, housing, mortgage rates, basic things like that,'' he said. ''The problems are there in a big way.'' Becoming an Environmentalist</p>
        <p>Partly to pre-empt her opposition on the quality-of-life issue, partly out of curiosity piqued by her scientific training as a research chemist, and partly at the urging of her delegate to the United Nations, Sir Crispin Tickell, a climatologist, Mrs. Thatcher has made a major effort in the last six months to become an environmentalist.</p>
        <p>She convened an international conference here in March on protecting the ozone layer, and last week she invited a gathering of international scientific experts to give her Cabinet an all-day seminar on what could be done about global atmospheric warming trends caused by industrial pollution.</p>
        <p>''She was way ahead of all her ministers,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, one of those present. ''It was in the air that the market alone couldn't solve the problem, and she made clear she wanted her Cabinet to think about what the Government could do about it.''</p>
