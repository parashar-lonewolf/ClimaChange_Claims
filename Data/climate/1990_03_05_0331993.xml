        <p>LEAD: The hurricane-force winds that have ripped Western Europe three times in the last six weeks, killing more than 140 people and costing perhaps a billion dollars in damage, marked the return of a weather phenomenon that had not often been seen in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>The hurricane-force winds that have ripped Western Europe three times in the last six weeks, killing more than 140 people and costing perhaps a billion dollars in damage, marked the return of a weather phenomenon that had not often been seen in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>This time, meteorologists say, the storms were brought about by an unusual convergence of atmospheric forces that were also responsible for the mild winter weather in most of the United States in January and February.</p>
        <p>The European storms of Jan. 25, Feb. 3 and Feb. 26 battered Britain and the Continent with winds surpassing 100 miles per hour. They uprooted trees, blew roofs off and billboards down, smashed windows, overturned trucks, toppled chimneys, flattened walls, left hundreds of thousands of houses without power, blocked streets, closed roads, halted trains and ferries and damaged the House of Commons in London and Chartres Cathedral in France.</p>
        <p>''This was something that just hadn't occurred quite so much over the last 20 years, but it had happened rather more before that, so perhaps we'd just forgotten about it,'' said Barry Parker, a meteorologist with the British meteorological office.</p>
        <p>Previous Storms Were Isolated</p>
        <p>A major windstorm of similarly fearsome force and destructiveness struck Britain on Oct. 16, 1987, and perhaps the most severe storm of the century, with winds even stronger than those of this year, devastated the British isles on Jan. 2, 1976.</p>
        <p>But studies of wind speeds at Heathrow Airport suggest that to find long periods characterized by unusually high winds like those of January and February, it is necessary to go back to the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>Big storms of increasing intensity and frequency are expected by some climatologists as a result of the greenhouse effect, a warming of the earth's surface caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Storms are driven by heat, and more heat generally means more energy in the storms.</p>
        <p>But most scientists also say that the effect of global warming on weather patterns, if there is one, is not yet strong enough to be detected amid the wide range of natural variability in the weather. Nor, they say, can any particular storm or group of storms be attributed to global warming.</p>
        <p>The Greenhouse Vigil</p>
        <p>What happened in Western Europe this winter is ''an example of the kind of phenomenon we can expect to become more common as the greenhouse effect gets stronger,'' said James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, one of the experts who has most forcefully predicted a global warming.</p>
        <p>While ''you can't take a specific example and say this is caused by the greenhouse effect,'' he said, ''in the long run, I think there is a connection between the intensity of storms and the increasing greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>''My own guess is that this will begin to be apparent in the next decade or so,'' he added.</p>
        <p>This year's events can be explained by weather patterns that are long familiar to meteorologists.</p>
        <p>The contrast in temperature between the Arctic and the tropics causes movements of air as the atmosphere seeks to establish equilibrium. These movements form the Northern Hemisphere's jet stream, a band of strong winds blowing from west to east that girdles the globe in the temperate zone.</p>
        <p>Storms at the earth's surface are pushed along by this fast-moving river of air. In most years, storms that develop in the mid-Atlantic reach full intensity there, and turn far weaker by the time they approach Europe. But this year the temperatures in the Arctic were colder than usual, and temperatures in the tropics abnormally warm.</p>
        <p>Unusually Fast Jet Stream</p>
        <p>''We really don't know the basic physical causes'' of these abnormalities, said A. James Wagner, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center at Camp Springs, Md.</p>
        <p>Whatever the cause, the greater-than-normal contrast in temperatures produced a stronger jet stream: at one point it reached a velocity of 230 m.p.h. ''To my knowledge, that is about as fast as it's ever been observed in the Atlantic,'' Mr. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>What this meant is that the storms embedded in the jet stream moved more rapidly across the ocean, reaching maximum intensity just as they approached Europe. At the same time, the storms themselves were more intense than usual because the clash between the Arctic air and the subtropical air generated more energy for the storms to feed upon.</p>
        <p>Masses of Mild Air, Too</p>
        <p>The jet stream also drove masses of mild air from the Pacific Ocean all the way across the United States, producing the abnormally warm weather that persisted in most of the country in January and February.</p>
        <p>In what meteorologists call the North Atlantic oscillation, there is a tendency for the temperature difference between the Arctic and subtropics to narrow abruptly in the spring, usually in April or May. If that were to happen this year, Mr. Wagner said, it would likely bring pleasant, sunny weather to Northern Europe and wet, cool weather to Southern Europe.</p>
        <p>The pattern in the United States would be less well defined. Because the jet stream would be weaker and rainstorms would move slowly, perhaps milling around in one area for some time, the spring could bring periods of nice weather interspersed with wet, dismal spells lasting a week or so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner said it might mean cooler, wetter weather from the mid-Atlantic states southward and milder, drier, more pleasant weather in much of the Northeast. New York, in between, would be ''iffy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While there are signs that the pattern of the last two months is weakening, he said, it is too soon to tell whether it is ending, or if a reversal will in fact occur this spring.</p>
