        <p>The United States was depicted as the great polluter among rich nations today at a gathering of about 80 environment ministers, environmental campaigners and industry specialists.</p>
        <p>All industrial nations except the United States have come to the Second World Climate Conference here with freshly set targets to slow down or to reverse their output of carbon dioxide, the gas thought to be the main culprit in what could be a dangerous warming of the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>While renewed warnings from scientists, gathered here last week, set the tone for today's debate, most politicians from industrial countries said they had made their pledges because it is good business.</p>
        <p>Government representatives from Western Europe, Japan, New Zealand and Australia said that studies in the last year had shown that they could stabilize and eventually cut back carbon dioxide output at no extra cost to the overall economy. They said they could achieve their targets through new laws and regulations that would force people and industry to use energy more efficiently.  Thatcher Criticizes U.S. Approach</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who has departed from the Bush Administration's skepticism about the need for immediate action, today chided Washington at the conference by saying a clear case already existed for taking immediate precautions. "The need for more research should not be an excuse for much needed action now," she said.</p>
        <p>She seemed to express a majority view here when she argued that in any event, it was sensible to improve energy efficency and use energy prudently, to develop alternative sources of supply, to replant forests, to re-examine industrial processes and to tackle waste disposal. France's Prime Minister, Michel Rocard, and Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Topfer, made similar pleas.</p>
        <p>European officials here complained that American energy prices were too low and provided no incentive for conservation.</p>
        <p>Rather than setting back industry, Germany and Japan have argued, the new program will stimulate industry through the development of new technology.</p>
        <p>"What we are all talking about is straightforward energy policy," said Pier Vellinga, who is in charge of climate policy in the Netherlands. "It will mean redirecting investments, not building more power plants or digging more coal, and becoming less dependent on oil." All Getting Similar Findings</p>
        <p>Referring to studies on the economic impact of reducing carbon dioxide emissions made in the European Community, Scandinavia and other areas, he said, "We have all done them and we are all coming up with the same results."</p>
        <p>Under the programs to combat global warming announced in more than 20 nations in recent days, governments have committed themselves to targets ranging from slowing down emissions of carbon dioxide to reversing the rate. These nations together account for close to 19 percent of the world's carbon dioxide output, while the United States accounts for close to 22 percent.</p>
        <p>Germany has the most drastic objectives. Outlining a plan already approved in part by the German Parliament, Mr. Topfer said steps would include new laws requiring greater insulation of buildings, improvements in public transportation and making power plants more efficient. It would also mean levying taxes on most carbon dioxide emissions, including additional taxes on fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Next on the scale of cutbacks is Denmark, which hopes to produce 20 percent less carbon dioxide than it does today by the year 2005, and 50 percent less by 2030. The Netherlands intends to stabilize its output by 1994 and cut back to 5 percent of present levels by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>The United States has calculated that if present trends continue, the nation's carbon dioxide emissions will have increased 15 percent by 2000.</p>
