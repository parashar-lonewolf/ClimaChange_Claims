        <p>The banner advertisement from the Pacific Research Institute did not remain on the Web site of E/The Environmental Magazine for long. Posted a little before 9 a.m. on April 30, the notice was gone by 1:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>The reason for the abrupt disappearance is that the institute receives money from the Sarah Scaife Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation, groups whose conservative orientation is so pronounced that their names are anathema to many environmental groups. The magazine, published by the Earth Action Network, a nonprofit group, told the institute's advertising agency in an e-mail message that ''the interests of those funding P.R.I. and their environmental policies are at odd with our criteria for accepting advertising.''</p>

        <p>The banner advertisement from the Pacific Research Institute did not remain on the Web site of E/The Environmental Magazine for long. Posted a little before 9 a.m. on April 30, the notice was gone by 1:15 p.m.</p>
        <p>The reason for the abrupt disappearance is that the institute receives money from the Sarah Scaife Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation, groups whose conservative orientation is so pronounced that their names are anathema to many environmental groups. The magazine, published by the Earth Action Network, a nonprofit group, told the institute's advertising agency in an e-mail message that ''the interests of those funding P.R.I. and their environmental policies are at odd with our criteria for accepting advertising.''</p>
        <p>The online ad, and a now-canceled print advertisement scheduled for publication in the July-August edition, promoted a report sponsored by the institute and the American Enterprise Institute, another conservative organization, titled ''Index of Leading Economic Indicators.'' Jim Motavalli, the magazine's editor, who contributes articles on automobiles and travel to The New York Times, said in an interview that the advertisement's bucolic forest-and-stream imagery and its neutral title gave the impression the group was friendly to the environmental cause.</p>
        <p>E's executives objected to a section of the report that highlighted the doubts of a few scientists and economists about the pace of global warming.</p>
        <p>In a later statement, the magazine's publisher and top editors said: ''P.R.I.'s materials do not fit with our ad policy, because they suggest that green activities on behalf of the planet are unnecessary, counterproductive and a waste of time (and -- this is crucial -- supporting this conclusion with dubious science). If E were a magazine for horse lovers, we would not run ads for horse slaughterhouses, and P.R.I.'s ad and materials are similar in relation to E's environmental mission.''</p>
        <p>A statement issued Friday in the name of its president, Sally C. Pipes, said the institute sees its job as ''gathering and presenting factual information to individuals in order for them to make their own decision.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 13, 2004, Thursday  An article in Business Day on Monday about the refusal of E/The Environmental Magazine to accept advertisements from the Pacific Research Institute because of conservative policies advocated by the institute's financial supporters misstated the name of the report promoted in the ads. It is the Index of Leading Environmental Indicators, not Economic Indicators.</p>
