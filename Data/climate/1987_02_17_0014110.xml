        <p>LEAD: Climate specialists and other scientists clashed sharply today over the role scientists have played in the debate over predictions made four years ago of global freezing and possible human extinction after a nuclear war.</p>
        <p>Climate specialists and other scientists clashed sharply today over the role scientists have played in the debate over predictions made four years ago of global freezing and possible human extinction after a nuclear war.</p>
        <p>In an emotional session at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of science here, some speakers contended that the public image of science had been seriously damaged by the highly politicized debate on the predictions of global freezing, known as ''nuclear winter.''</p>
        <p>They said few recent issues had so highlighted the perils of injecting uncertain scientific conclusions into public policy debates.</p>
        <p>The nuclear winter hypothesis was based on calculations of the atomopheric effects of the torrents of smoke that would be sent skyward by burning cities and forests. Researchers argued that smoke and soot would shut out sunlight and drastically chill the earth, causing worse effects than the initial damage from blast and radiation.</p>
        <p>But new calculations have led scientists to speak instead of a ''nuclear fall,'' whose effects, some say, would be far less serious than the direct effects of the explosions.</p>
        <p>The sessions today provoked some of the most heated exchanges so far at this five-day conference.</p>
        <p>George Rathjens, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that some climate researchers had been ''totally irresponsible'' over the last four years in publicizing the dire forecasts without stressing the uncertainties.</p>
        <p>''I think in the long run it will discredit this community of which we are all a part,'' Dr. Rathjens said.</p>
        <p>The new doubts about the most extreme predictions of nuclear winter began to emerge last spring, in findings by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Their computer simulations of climate processes were far more detailed than the simple calculations on which the first nuclear winter predictions were based.</p>
        <p>As described today, the latest calculations, incorporating further refinements, show that the worst combinations of assumptions produced temperature drops in the range of 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit during the weeks immediately after a July war. For a winter war the effect would be less.</p>
        <p>Stephen H. Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said it was the extreme predictions of possible human extinction that originally gave the nuclear winter idea a special status, since it provided a compelling argument for the uselessness of most of the world's nuclear arsenal. It was a ''brilliant'' argument, he said, but the more moderate estimates no longer support it.</p>
        <p>But he said the debate has been useful in focusing attention on the many effects of nuclear war that would outlast the immediate destruction. ''Even if short of Armegeddon they could still be quite substantial,'' he said, possibly including widespread crop destruction.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rathjens argued that climate effects would be irrelevant amid the broad devastation of a war.</p>
        <p>The original hypothesis, as published in the association's journal, Science, in December 1983, transformed the public debate over nuclear policy. The authors, who included Richard P. Turco, the astronomer Carl Sagan and others, calculated that a pall could spread over the entire northern hemisphere, spreading freezing temperatures and annihiliation to countries far removed from the nuclear explosions.</p>
        <p>Because of the potential implications of a nuclear winter for such policy issues as deterrence strategy and the size of weapons stockpiles, Government agencies have spent millions of dollars since 1984 on research to assess the climatic effects of nuclear war.</p>
        <p>One physicist, S. Fred Singer of George Mason University in Virginia, went so far today as to suggest that unappreciated warming effects would overwhelm the cooling effects, leading to a net warming trend. Explosions and fires would send vast amounts of water vapor into the upper stratosphere, causing a greenhouse effect, he said, and smoke clouds would add to the heating by absorbing infrared rays.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schneider dismissed that possibility, calling it the ''infrared herring.''</p>
        <p>The authors of the original study were not present to respond to the criticism today but they have denied distorting or oversimplifying their findings. Some of the authors have acknowledged that the new research casts doubt on the worst original predictions, but they warn against minimizing the possible climate effects, given the many uncertainties that still exist.</p>
        <p>Carl Sagan, the Cornell University astronomer who has been the most passionate public proponent of the nuclear winter idea, took the brunt of the personal criticism today in his absence. He has repeatedly stood by the original paper. ''You do not need temperature declines of 15 or 20 degrees to produce a kind of global horror,'' Dr. Sagan said last year.</p>
