        <p>SIGNS OF A HOUSING BUST -- The striking swing from seller's market to buyer's market in Phoenix tells the tale of a housing bonanza turned bust. The number of unsold homes in the area has soared to almost 46,000 from just a few thousand in early 2005. And builders are pulling back as fast as they can. Around the country, sales cancellations among big builders are running as high as 40 percent, double the rate a year ago. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>HAPPY HOLIDAYS ON WALL STREET -- For a fourth consecutive year, year-end bonuses on Wall Street are forecast to be very lucrative, with the payouts rising 10 to 15 percent from 2005. [C1.]</p>
        <p>VIDEO ON THE XBOX -- Microsoft said that it would offer movies and episodes of television shows for download to its Xbox 360 game consoles, beginning Nov. 22. With the new offerings, Microsoft is joining cable giants and Internet start-ups on the long list of companies hoping to profit from video downloads. [C1.]</p>
        <p>CHINA TO PASS U.S. AS POLLUTER -- Nearly a decade ahead of previous projections, China will surpass the United States in 2009 as the biggest emitter of the main gas linked to global warming, the International Energy Agency has concluded. [C1.]</p>
        <p>BID FOR FOUR SEASONS HOTELS -- The chief executive and controlling shareholder of Four Seasons Hotels, Isadore Sharp, made a $3.7 billion buyout bid for the luxury hotel chain, with backing from investment groups led by Bill Gates of Microsoft and Prince Walid bin Talal of the Saudi royal family. [C1.]</p>
        <p>COMMITTED TO COAL -- The TXU Corporation is planning to add more than 9,000 megawatts of new coal-burning capacity, enough to power millions of homes. It is betting that it can overcome opposition to carbon emissions, placing a $10 billion wager on 11 new coal power plants that will produce copious amounts of global warming gases for decades to come. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PAYING FOR IDLE FUEL TRUCKS -- A Halliburton subsidiary charged the Iraqi government as much as $25,000 a month for each of as many as 1,800 fuel trucks that were to deliver gasoline to Iraq after the 2003 invasion, but the trucks often spent days or weeks sitting idle on the border, says a report released by an auditing agency sponsored by the United Nations. [A6.]</p>
        <p>MYSPACE GOES GLOBAL -- MySpace is aggressively trying to move into overseas markets, and is expected to announce today that it is expanding into Japan through a possible joint venture. [C3.]</p>
        <p>BUSINESS NEWS CHANNEL PICKED UP -- A business-news cable channel planned by the News Corporation has moved a step closer to reality, reaching a deal to be carried by Comcast, the nation's largest cable-television system operator. [C3.]</p>
        <p>HUMOR FOR THE HOLIDAYS -- Madison Avenue is taking a humorous tack to stimulate sales for the holidays, ranging from wry subtlety to fall-down slapstick, rather than traditionally sentimental, schmaltzy or straightforward. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C3.]</p>
        <p>OVERSTOCK.COM IN NEED OF CAPITAL -- With sales down and losses up, the Internet retailer Overstock.com warned that it might have to raise capital next year, and added that it did not expect to have its latest problems fixed before Christmas. [C3.]</p>
        <p>ABBOTT TO BUY DRUG DEVELOPER -- Abbott Laboratories said that it would acquire Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion. [C5.]</p>
        <p>LINDE SELLS DIVISION -- Linde of Germany said it was selling its forklift unit, Kion, to the equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for $5.1 billion. [C8.]</p>
        <p>GOLD PRODUCER BUYS RIVAL -- Kinross Gold, the Canadian gold producer, agreed to buy a rival, Bema Gold, for $2.55 billion in an all-stock deal. [C8.]</p>
        <p>ARCELOR'S PRESIDENT TURNED CHIEF -- Lakshmi Mittal, the president of the Arcelor Mittal steel company, tightened his control over the company, succeeding the chief executive Roland Junck. [C8.]</p>
        <p>FIRST BLACKBERRY, NOW TREO -- NTP, the patent holding company that successfully sued the maker of BlackBerry devices for infringement of wireless e-mail patents, said it was suing Palm, maker of the Treo smartphone. [C9.]</p>
        <p>DOW GAINS ON MERGERS -- Takeovers spurred the biggest stock-market rally in a month and sent the Dow Jones industrial average to its first gain in seven days. [C10.]</p>
