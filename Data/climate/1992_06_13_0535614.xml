        <p>President Bush told world leaders at the Earth Summit today that he had no apologies for his Administration's environmental record and called for a "prompt start" to carry out the accords signed here.</p>

        <p>President Bush told world leaders at the Earth Summit today that he had no apologies for his Administration's environmental record and called for a "prompt start" to carry out the accords signed here.</p>
        <p>"America's record on environmental protection is second to none, so I did not come here to apologize," Mr. Bush said, rebutting the criticism heard since the Rio summit meeting began 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>He also vigorously defended his opposition to a treaty to protect rare and endangered plants and animals, a position that put the United States outside a vast consensus of support by almost all of the 172 nations represented at the talks. Principles on Forests</p>
        <p>"That proposed agreement threatens to retard biotechnology and undermine the protection of ideas," Mr. Bush said. "It is never easy to stand alone on principle, but sometimes leadership requires that you do."  [ Excerpts, page 5. ]</p>
        <p>The President's defiant speech came as the pace of events at the talks accelerated with the arrival of dozens of world leaders, many of them offering decidedly different views of environmental issues in speeches at the conference hall.</p>
        <p>A major development of the day was an agreement among negotiators, after days of talks, to adopt a voluntary set of principles in favor of preserving the world's forests, which had been a goal of the United States and other wealthier countries.</p>
        <p>But the agreement omitted a call for a treaty to be negotiated that would make such principles binding.  [ Page 4. ] Global-Warming Treaty</p>
        <p>Other negotiators were still in session this evening, racing a Sunday deadline to try to come up with an accord on a multibillion-dollar aid package that would enable the third-world countries to preserve their environmental resources.</p>
        <p>In another arena of activities, Mr. Bush and other leaders signed the treaty intended to reduce the threat of global warming by limiting emissions of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. The treaty had long been viewed as a centerpiece of the summit talks, despite widespread criticism for its lack of specific timetables for emission curbs.</p>
        <p>In contrast to other Western leaders speaking here today, Mr. Bush did not make public any major financial initiatives, although the United States called for creation of a long-term $1.4 billion fund to monitor climate change, and for other money to help poor countries pay for preservation of their forests.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a nation widely seen to have assumed a major leadership role here, promised to increase Germany's aid for development of poor countries to 0.7 percent of its gross national product, nearly double its current level, and promised accelerated reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent to 30 percent by the year 2,005.</p>
        <p>In another move seen as upstaging President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain called for the World Bank fund that provides environmental aid to be increased from the current level of $1.3 billion to at least $3.3 billion in the next several years.</p>
        <p>In yet another pledge for aid that contrasted with the American caution on financing, the 12-nation European Community also promised $4 billion to further the Earth Summit's goals. It was unclear how much of the European money was new money or money that had already been appropriated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, trying to mend fences with environmentalists, met in the morning with a delegation of American leaders of environmental groups and in the afternoon posed for photographers in a rain forest near Rio.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether his efforts would succeed, since the many private environmental groups gathered in Rio continued to excoriate what they characterized as American inaction and even hostility to the goals of the summit talks. 'Viva Fidel!'</p>
        <p>One group, the Friends of the Earth International, said the world's leaders had "squandered an historic opportunity."</p>
        <p>Inside and outside the main conference hall, the biggest applause went for Fidel Castro, who proved his durability as a tribune for anti-American sentiments among many people in impoverished countries.</p>
        <p>"Viva Fidel! Viva Cuba!" shouted passers-by Thursday night when the Cuban leader arrived at his luxury Copacabana hotel, the Rio Palace. Seeming to take aim at President Bush in his speech today, Mr. Castro drew cheers when strode to the platform to denounce the industrialized countries as guilty of most of the world's environmental problems.</p>
        <p>"Consumer societies are fundamentally responsible for environmental destruction," said Mr. Castro, calling for what he said should be a more just distribution of wealth in the world. "The ecological debt should be paid, not the foreign debt."</p>
        <p>President Bush, who gave Mr. Castro's speech a few perfunctory hand claps, seemed to be picking up the gauntlet thrown down by one of the last Communist leaders in the world.</p>
        <p>"There are those who say that it takes state control to protect the environment," he said. "Let them go to Eastern Europe, where the poisoned bodies of children now pay for the sins of fallen dictators -- and only the new breeze of freedom is allowing for cleanup."</p>
        <p>The speeches and activities of the world leaders virtually shut down this coastal city of five million. Schools closed, supermarkets stood empty, but long-feared traffic jams never materialized, as Rio's population either left town for a four-day weekend or stayed home to watch the parade of world leaders on television. With gray skies, scattered showers and temperatures in the 60's, Rio's beaches were largely deserted.</p>
        <p>Virtually all visiting leaders were lodged in high-rise luxury hotels facing the crashing surf of Rio's southern beaches. Long lines of orange-and-white traffic cones blocked off beachfront avenues, creating high-speed access routes for motorcades carrying heads of state to Rio Central, the conference center 20 miles south of Rio's downtown.</p>
        <p>Along the routes, rifle-toting army soldiers guarded bridges and tunnels and scanned hillside shantytowns with binoculars. Adding to this resort city's militarized air, light tanks were posted below several slums and helicopters thundered up and down the beaches.</p>
        <p>Although no major incidents were reported during the day, security was not as tight as it appeared.</p>
