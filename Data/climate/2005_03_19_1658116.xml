        <p>Nicholas D. Kristof's suggestion that environmentalists have hobbled their movement by exaggerating crises is like blaming racial prejudice for the stridency of some civil rights activists ('''I Have a Nightmare,''' column, March 12).</p>
        <p>Environmentalism is a broad social movement encompassing millions of Americans and thousands of organizations. No doubt some use hyperbole. The leaders and professionals with whom I work, at groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and the Union of Concerned Scientists, are more often conservative to a fault in their scientific and economic pronouncements.</p>
        <p>Far from dead, the movement is vibrant, financially robust, with sound strategies and exploding memberships. America's negligent media are more aptly to be blamed for our failure to achieve our larger goals.</p>
        <p>Since more profits flow from entertaining than from informing, Americans know more about Michael Jackson than about global warming. That's not the fault of environmentalists.</p>

        <p>Correction:  March 22, 2005, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, a letter on Saturday from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the environmental movement reversed the meaning of an analogy in the first sentence. It should have read:</p>
