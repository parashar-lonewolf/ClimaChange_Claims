        <p>International 2-5  REBELS FAN OUT IN KABUL</p>
        <p>Thousands of Islamic guerrillas now firmly control many of the Afghan capital's sprawling neighborhoods, officials said. Afghanistan's disintegrating Government holds sway only in the city's center.  1  Six Afghan rebel factions said they had formed a governing council.  4  RUSSIA AT CAPITALIST THRESHOLD</p>
        <p>After nearly 75 years of isolation, Russia is expected to rejoin the world economy next week, when it should be accepted as a member of the International Monetary Fund. The decision comes at a critical time for President Yeltsin.  1  U.N. CHIEF BALKS OVER BOSNIA</p>
        <p>In a move that irritated France, Germany and Poland, the United Nations Secretary General told the Security Council that he could not recommend deployment of a new peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He said the fighting there was too fierce.  3  12 IDEAS ON BALKAN PEACE?</p>
        <p>The European Community's response to violence in the Balkans makes it clear that it will be hard for the community to move toward a common foreign and security policy by next year.  3  OUSTED HAITIAN WANTS BLOCKADE</p>
        <p>On a visit to Manhattan, Haiti's ousted President urged the world to step up pressure on the military junta that overthrew him by tightening an oil embargo.  4  PERU FIRES ON U.S. C-130</p>
        <p>An Air Force C-130 was hit by machine-gun fire from a Peruvian Air Force plane off the coast, the U.S. Embassy said. One American airman was reported missing and two crew members were wounded.  5  MOLTEN MONSTER VS. MARINES</p>
        <p>Zafferana Etnea Journal: In the battle between military technology and a wrathful volcano, there are no clear winners. Ask Sicilian villagers below Mount Etna.  2  National 8-11  BUSH THE REVOLUTIONARY</p>
        <p>Political Memo: In this election year everyone wants to be a reformer, and that includes the President. Indeed, as he appeals for a second term by arguing that America needs a change, he sounds more like a Vaclav Havel on the eve of revolution in Czechoslovakia than a man who has already spent 11 years in the White House.  1  Bush and Clinton engaged in a kind of opening debate.  10  In a Philadelphia suburb, a Perot candidacy is finding favor.  11  Some Weicker advisers have begun backing Perot.  10  NEW TURN IN THE HOUSE BANK CASE</p>
        <p>The Justice Department subpoenaed all financial records of every House member's transactions at the Capitol Hill bank for a 39-month period from 1988 to 1991. Speaker Foley did not indicate whether the House leadership would comply with the subpoenas. But he said he had rejected the department's informal request for most of the same records.  1  MORE BIG MOVES AT G.M.</p>
        <p>Moving swiftly after a management shake-up, General Motors announced that it would attempt the largest stock offering in American history and took another step in reorganizing its huge operations. It said the goal was to produce better-quality vehicles more quickly and at less cost.  1  CLEAN AIR AND RARE ALIGNMENTS</p>
        <p>News analysis: When a Federal court hears a case involving pollution rules, the parties are usually an angry state regulator and an industrial company seeking to have the regulations overturned. But the politics of the 1990 Clean Air Act have become so convoluted that the polluters are years away from court. Instead, in Federal District Court in Albany, states are suing the Federal Government to establish rules in the first place.  8  A new analysis backed current action on global warming.  8  EASING SALE OF PUBLIC ROADS</p>
        <p>The President will issue an executive order next week making it easier for state and local officials to sell public assets like airports, roads and bridges to private businesses.  8  SCHOOL ACTS IN ABORTION BATTLE</p>
        <p>After a year of controversy over its decision to recognize an abortion rights group, the nation's oldest Roman Catholic university, Georgetown, withdrew its financial support of the group and denied it space to meet.  9  NEW ORDER ON AIRLINE SAFETY</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. will require airlines to replace electronic devices on about 300 planes because they can send out faulty signals, confusing air controllers and enhancing the possibility of midair collisions.  11  Detroit Journal: Amid urban desolation, a gleaming-new plant.  8  Beliefs: Of Columbus, a flat Earth, and thinking old and new.  9  Metropolitan Digest, 25  LARGER ANTI-ABORTION RANKS</p>
        <p>Leaders of the national anti-abortion group Operation Rescue have called in reinforcements to aid their efforts in Buffalo. The mission is to counter defenses by abortion-rights advocates who managed to keep abortion clinics operating this week.1  WARNING ON BUDGET SURPLUS</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation demanded to know how New York City had generated a budget surplus, and warned that if the city increased the size and cost of government, it would risk losing at least $100 million in aid.  1  BROUGHT TOGETHER IN DEATH</p>
