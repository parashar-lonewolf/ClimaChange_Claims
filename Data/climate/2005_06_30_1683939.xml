Lautenberg of New Jersey, called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate a White House official's editing of reports to Congress on global warming. The two senators want an inquiry into whether the official, Philip Cooney, violated laws on falsification of documents and obstruction of Congress in revising two reports. Mr. Cooney, a former oil industry lobbyist, has left his position at the Council on Environmental Quality to join an oil company.</p>
