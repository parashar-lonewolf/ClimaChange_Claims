        <p>FOR children, spring is a time of soaring. There are the birds, of course, and baseballs, soccer balls and tennis balls. But what also soar are children's spirits, and to help keep them happily aloft a whole high-flying array of cultural activities is available. This month, for example, the Queens Symphony Orchestra is presenting a concert with a piano duo and a violin solo just for families, and the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum on Staten Island is offering Italian lessons for youngsters. May echoes with poetry. At City College's Aaron Davis Hall in Harlem, kindergartners to high schoolers will recite, sing and dance their way through Langston Hughes's works. And in the same hall in the same month, more young voices will be heard in an annual poetry festival featuring works by school-age children. Also in May, a reading of poems and prose, "For Children, by Children," at the Manhattan Theater Club will engage young literati. ALL AGES March</p>

        <p>FOR children, spring is a time of soaring. There are the birds, of course, and baseballs, soccer balls and tennis balls. But what also soar are children's spirits, and to help keep them happily aloft a whole high-flying array of cultural activities is available. This month, for example, the Queens Symphony Orchestra is presenting a concert with a piano duo and a violin solo just for families, and the Garibaldi-Meucci Museum on Staten Island is offering Italian lessons for youngsters. May echoes with poetry. At City College's Aaron Davis Hall in Harlem, kindergartners to high schoolers will recite, sing and dance their way through Langston Hughes's works. And in the same hall in the same month, more young voices will be heard in an annual poetry festival featuring works by school-age children.
