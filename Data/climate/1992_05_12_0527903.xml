        <p>International A3-11  BOSNIA COMES UNDONE</p>
        <p>In Bosnian cities, towns and villages too dangerous for most outsiders to visit, international relief agencies say hundreds of people have been killed and nearly 600,000 left homeless. A European tragedy with few precedents since World War II is unfolding, and international efforts seem unable to stop it.  A1  EUROPEANS ISOLATING BELGRADE</p>
        <p>European Community governments decided to recall their envoys from Belgrade. The foreign ministers also backed American efforts to suspend Serbia and Montenegro from the European security conference.  A10  3 LEAD FOR PHILIPPINE PRESIDENCY</p>
        <p>Early election results from the Philippines suggested that the presidential race had narrowed to three candidates -- former Defense Minister Fidel V. Ramos; Miriam Defensor Santiago, a former judge, and Eduardo Conjuangco, a cousin of President Aquino and a close ally of the late President Marcos.  A3  THAI PROTEST SUSPENDED</p>
        <p>A paralyzing Thai protest was suspended after opposition leaders agreed to back an amendment negotiated with the Government requiring a prime minister to be an elected member of Parliament.  A3  A PROMISE IN TAJIKISTAN</p>
        <p>Prodded by the killing of demonstrators, the Tajik President agreed to a coalition government with at least eight important ministries led by the opposition.  A5  ROCKET-TECHNOLOGY SANCTIONS</p>
        <p>The U.S. banned exports to a Russian arms agency and to the Indian Space Research Organization for two years because of their agreement to transfer rocket technology.  A8</p>
        <p>Soviet spy who labored on: astronaut's friend unmasked.  A11  MIDEAST TALKS QUICKLY BOG DOWN</p>
        <p>The Mideast peace talks resumed, with sessions in Washington and Brussels on regional arms control and economic development. Both sessions were marred by empty chairs and bitterness.  A6  RABIN STAKES OUT DIFFERENCES</p>
        <p>Yitzhak Rabin of Israel's opposition Labor Party said money being spent on settlements in the occupied territories should instead be used to employ and  Muizenberg Journal: Integrating schools in South Africa.  A4</p>
        <p>British woman freed in '74 Irish-related bombing case.  A6  National A12-21  A DIPLOMA BUT POOR PROSPECTS</p>
        <p>New college graduates are facing one of the toughest job markets in decades, with studies indicating that nearly one-third of the nation's entry-level jobs for new graduates have evaporated during the recession.  A1  GANG RIVALRY FADES AFTER RIOTS</p>
        <p>An astonishing sight has risen from the ashes of Los Angeles: Crips and Bloods talking and playing like brothers.  A1  INQUIRY INTO L.A.P.D. BEGINS</p>
        <p>William Webster, the former director of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence, was appointed to head the official investigation into the Los Angeles Police Department's response to the riots.  A20  BIPARTISAN AID FOR CITIES</p>
        <p>Democratic Congressional leaders pledged to work with the Bush Administration on an idea they have long dismissed: creating enterprise zones in the inner cities.  A20</p>
        <p>Atlanta Journal: The damage, real and perceived, downtown.  A12</p>
        <p>A study said cities gave more than they got from the Pentagon.  A20  PEROT VS. BUSH, THE EARLY DAYS</p>
        <p>The tension between Ross Perot and President Bush stems in part from a bruising private confrontation five years ago over Mr. Perot's effort to take command of the Government's investigation of American servicemen missing in Southeast Asia.  A1  BUSH MOVES ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH</p>
        <p>President Bush announced that the Government would begin a campaign to immunize children against preventable diseases by the age of 2. Public health experts called the proposal belated and inadequate.  A18  VERMONT'S HEALTH CARE PLAN</p>
        <p>The Governor of Vermont signed a law that is intended to give Vermont universal health care by 1995. The Governor, who is also a doctor, won support from insurers, medical associations and officials.  A12  A DEAL FOR POLLUTION RIGHTS</p>
        <p>The Tennessee Valley Authority and Wisconsin Power and Light, two utilities hundreds of miles apart, plan to announce an agreement allowing the T.V.A. to buy from Wisconsin Power the right to emit sulfur dioxide, a chemical that causes acid rain.  A1  SHOWDOWN OVER ANCIENT FORESTS</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration and Congressional Democrats are heading for a showdown over jobs and Pacific Northwest forests that could test the influence of a growing anti-environmental backlash.  A14  LOW-INCOME GROUP SWELLS</p>

        <p>Disturbances erupt in a largely Hispanic Washington district.  A12  Metropolitan Digest, B1 LIFE-SUPPORT DILEMMA</p>
        <p>New York's law on the removal of life support is both the strictest and the most nebulous in the United States: It requires "clear and convincing evidence" of what a patient would have wanted, but leaves it to each hospital to determine exactly what that is.  A1.</p>
