        <p>President Clinton and Congress reached agreement, only 16 days late and without a Government shutdown, on a $1.7 trillion budget for fiscal 1999 that is the first since the late 1960's not to include deficit spending. The deal included an industry-backed increase in visa quotas for foreign workers with technology skills, a sharp increase in military spending, aid for farmers and new money for the International Monetary Fund, but no general tax cuts. Projects to combat global warming and farm runoff won financing; so did plans to step up logging on public lands in the West and Alaska. A bankruptcy overhaul passed by Congress but disliked by the White House was omitted from the deal.</p>
