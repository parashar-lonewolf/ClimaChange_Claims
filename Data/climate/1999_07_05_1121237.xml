        <p>Scientists have documented global warming in this century, but nobody needed to tell the Texan Roger Clemens that it was panhandle hot at Yankee Stadium yesterday. Clemens returned to the Yankees' dugout after pitching another inning in the thick heat and said drolly, ''I think they just dumped a pail of water on the rocks.''</p>
        <p>Clemens's sauna analogy was appropriate. The humidity was stifling and the temperature was 89 degrees when the game started, and when the sun came out in the early innings, players and umpires baked. But even after a week of blown victories, and in the throes of a losing streak that has likely choked off their playoff aspirations, the Orioles did not wilt. B. J. Surhoff launched a grand slam off Ramiro Mendoza to cap a six-run rally in the seventh inning as the Orioles beat the Yankees, 7-3, before 37,046.</p>
        <p>Surhoff is a candidate for the American League All-Star team that will be filled out with reserves picked, in part, by Yankee Manager Joe Torre. Maybe Surhoff's All-Star chances would have been better, Torre joked later, if he had ''hit into a double play.'' Baltimore's victory was its first after 10 consecutive losses.</p>
        <p>Making his 14th start for the Yankees, Clemens returned to the air-conditioned clubhouse after each half-inning, changed his shirt and drank water and other liquids to keep himself hydrated.</p>
        <p>But when the Orioles' hitters battled him and extended the counts in the early innings, Clemens was doomed to an early departure; it was just too hot to expect anyone to last long with that workload, Torre mused later.</p>
        <p>Clemens threw 83 pitches in the first four innings, more than 20 pitches per inning. When Clemens breezed through the middle of the Baltimore lineup in the sixth while needing only seven pitches, the Yankees' coaching staff hoped Clemens might be able to pitch into the eighth.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees leading, 3-1, Jeff Conine doubled to open the Orioles' seventh, and Clemens hustled to back up third for a possible play there. Whew. Cal Ripken hit Clemens's next pitch into short-center field for another hit, and Clemens moved to back up home plate as Conine scored. Whew.</p>
        <p>Those two short sprints, coupled with his mounting pitch count, sucked the breath out of Clemens, and catcher Jorge Posada and the pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, went to the mound and lingered, giving Clemens a chance to recover.</p>
        <p>But there was not enough time. After the rookie Jerry Hairston flied to deep left, Torre replaced Clemens with Mendoza. ''The pitch count,'' Torre said, ''was as much of an issue as the heat was for me.''</p>
        <p>The first batter Mendoza faced was Mike Figga, the reserve catcher who was placed on waivers by the Yankees last month without having taken an at-bat for them this year. Mendoza's first sinkerball to Figga did not sink, and Figga banged it over the head of center fielder Bernie Williams; Ripken stopped at third.</p>
        <p>After Brady Anderson was walked intentionally, Mike Bordick singled to right, scoring Ripken with the tying run. Mendoza threw a fastball for ball one to Surhoff, then came back with a changeup, and Surhoff reached out, his weight on his front foot, and flicked his bat.</p>
        <p>Torre thought Surhoff's fly ball to right would be caught for a sacrifice fly. Mendoza was sure of this, too, as was Derek Jeter. But the ball kept going, and Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, reached for the wall and looked up -- grand slam.</p>
        <p>As Surhoff rounded the bases, the third-base umpire, Larry Barnett, moved to check on the condition of the home-plate umpire, Greg Kosc, and Barnett called for the Yankees' trainer, Gene Monahan. Kosc had been sweating a lot all day -- the front of his shirt and pants were soaked -- and early in the game he had begun curling cold towels around his neck.</p>
        <p>When Monahan reached Kosc, he waved smelling salts under the umpire's nose; Kosc's head bobbed, his eyes bulged, his face was pale, and soon Kosc's arms dangled over the shoulders of Barnett and Monahan, like a human yoke, and he was led off the field.</p>
        <p>He was hospitalized for heat exhaustion and dehydration and was replaced behind home plate by the second-base umpire, Ed Hickox.</p>
        <p>Some of the Yankees had been griping openly with Kosc on his ball-and-strike calls in the previous two innings, particularly Posada, who seethed after the game.</p>
        <p>Posada said that after he was called out on strikes by Kosc in the sixth, he turned to the umpire and told him he was being inconsistent with his strike zone. ''He hasn't called it all day, and all of a sudden, he's going to expand it because it's hot,'' said Posada, before expanding the issue.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line, the guys are not in shape,'' Posada continued, referring to umpires. ''It was hot -- I can understand it's hot. You've got to be able to go through the game. They're not prepared, they're not in shape; it's a shame. He gets hot, the zone gets bigger. One doesn't go with the other one.''</p>
        <p>The American League president, Gene Budig, who watched the game on television at his New Jersey home, said of Kosc: ''Greg passed the required physical examination. He is a weight lifter.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>SHANE SPENCER, who left Friday night's game with an irregular heartbeat, remained in the hospital yesterday, and doctors were able to restore his heartbeat to a normal level. The outfielder, placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday, will remain hospitalized for the next few days for further tests and observation. . . . CHUCK KNOBLAUCH felt a twinge in his lower back after taking a swing in the early innings, and Manager JOE TORRE checked on him to ask if he was all right. Knoblauch remained in the game. . . . JUAN GUZMAN, the Orioles' starter, gave up two runs in the first inning and a homer by CHILI DAVIS in the second inning. SCOTT KAMIENIECKI, who relieved in the seventh, got his second save.</p>
