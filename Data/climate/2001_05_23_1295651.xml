        <p>Listening to President Bush's speech on energy last week left me yearning for a straight story. His rhetoric seemed intended either to frighten or to lull one into a false sense of security. It didn't help that as he presented an energy plan -- developed with help from lobbyists for oil, coal, gas, mining and nuclear power -- the president buttoned up his speech by asking all of us to stop bickering, to set a new tone and listen to each other. Since Vice President Dick Cheney refused even to meet with environmental groups, it seems a rather curious, if not disingenuous, request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made it sound so simple. Build tens of thousands of miles of new pipelines, hundreds of oil and gas wells, and more than a thousand new power plants, and it will again be ''morning in America.'' He claims it can be done with little impact. Drilling in the Arctic, off our beaches or anywhere determined to be ''necessary'' is a harmless matter, he says, thanks to new technologies that render the whole enterprise environmentally friendly.

        <p>Listening to President Bush's speech on energy last week left me yearning for a straight story. His rhetoric seemed intended either to frighten or to lull one into a false sense of security. It didn't help that as he presented an energy plan -- developed with help from lobbyists for oil, coal, gas, mining and nuclear power -- the president buttoned up his speech by asking all of us to stop bickering, to set a new tone and listen to each other. Since Vice President Dick Cheney refused even to meet with environmental groups, it seems a rather curious, if not disingenuous, request.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made it sound so simple. Build tens of thousands of miles of new pipelines, hundreds of oil and gas wells, and more than a thousand new power plants, and it will again be ''morning in America.'' He claims it can be done with little impact. Drilling in the Arctic, off our beaches or anywhere determined to be ''necessary'' is a harmless matter, he says, thanks to new technologies that render the whole enterprise environmentally friendly. This is simply untrue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney has been making a point of telling anyone who will listen that the federal government hasn't granted a new nuclear power permit in 20 years. Nobody has applied for one. Three Mile Island served as a cautionary tale that even the most aggressive corporate energy interests could not ignore. Until now. The president's support for nuclear power is boldly presented with nary a nod to inherent risks associated with nuclear waste, nuclear weapons material or power plant accidents.</p>
        <p>A look behind the rhetoric reveals that at the heart of the Bush energy plan are proposals to weaken longstanding environmental safeguards. Americans fought hard over the last three decades for these protections. But the Bush plan holds the corporate energy lobby in higher esteem than ordinary Americans who breathe the air, drink the water and overwhelmingly support protecting our wilderness. Coal and oil companies, despite record profits, now seek enormous new taxpayer subsidies and relief from environmental safeguards as payback for their campaign support.</p>
        <p>Drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is but a piece of a plan that makes oil and gas exploration and development fair game on nearly all of our public lands, even extraordinary places that were awarded protection as national monuments by the previous administration. The Upper Missouri Breaks in Montana, Grand Staircase-Escalante monument in Utah, and Vermillion Basin in northwestern Colorado may all become subject to exploitation. It's nonsense to think new oil and gas exploration and development won't destroy these incomparable wild places.</p>
        <p>Why not tighten fuel economy standards instead? This alone could,  over the next 50 years, free up 15 times as much oil as could be produced by drilling in the Arctic, and it  would benefit consumers much faster. The administration wants merely to ''study'' this option. More study? Well, we know what that means. For electricity, simply supporting the higher air conditioner efficiency standards proposed by the previous  administration would save 13,000 megawatts during periods of peak demand in 2020, equivalent to the output of dozens of power plants.</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago, corporate America danced across the nation dumping toxic waste into our rivers, spewing chemicals into our air and ravaging pristine public lands, all in the name of progress. In response to the horrific environmental damage of the postwar era, a broad coalition of Americans began working to represent public health, safety and environmental concerns in all levels of government. Now we face an administration trying to unravel this work.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we have the examples of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the Exxon Valdez accident and innumerable studies proving pollution's ill effect on public health to demonstrate that the stakes could hardly be higher. Solid science clearly shows that global warming exists and that the administration's drill, dig and burn approach will only make it worse. I continue to hope for a reasonable dialogue that actually includes the environmental community, but the administration's posture suggests that is unlikely. If he does not make environmental concerns central to his energy policy, President Bush may well leave the next generation with nothing but ashes to stand in.</p>
