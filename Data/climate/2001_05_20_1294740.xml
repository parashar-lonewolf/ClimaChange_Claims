        <p>Talk about timing. With the nation concerned about the cost and supply of energy, the Cherry Tree Association -- a 500-member nonprofit community group in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx that promotes economic development as well as gardening, arts and cultural events -- is sponsoring an exhibit of a proposed city of the future that will use solar, wind and fuel-cell technology.</p>
        <p>The exhibit displays the drawings and futuristic designs produced for Cherry Tree by students at the New York Institute of Technology and the City College Architectural Center.</p>

        <p>Talk about timing. With the nation concerned about the cost and supply of energy, the Cherry Tree Association -- a 500-member nonprofit community group in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx that promotes economic development as well as gardening, arts and cultural events -- is sponsoring an exhibit of a proposed city of the future that will use solar, wind and fuel-cell technology.</p>
        <p>The exhibit displays the drawings and futuristic designs produced for Cherry Tree by students at the New York Institute of Technology and the City College Architectural Center.</p>
        <p>By incorporating some of those designs, Cherry Tree expects to convert its own building, Casa del Sol, a six-story, 7,000-square-foot former tenement, into a model of renewable energy production for a cleaner environment and improved quality of life.</p>
        <p>Models of the planned conversion are part of the exhibit. The project is expected to be completed in the fall of 2003.</p>
        <p>The exhibit at the Casa del Sol, at 672-674 East 136th Street, at Cypress Avenue, near the Cypress Avenue stop on the No. 6 subway line, is open Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4 p.m. through June 23. Those who wish to visit the exhibit on weekdays should telephone the Cherry Tree Association office at (718) 292-6443 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays.</p>
