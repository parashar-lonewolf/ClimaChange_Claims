        <p>Echoing her husband's 1992 presidential campaign message about the ''forgotten middle class,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton accused the Bush administration on Saturday night of turning the middle class and working families into ''invisible Americans'' whose needs have gone ignored for the last six years.</p>
        <p>Speaking before 1,000 New Hampshire Democrats, Mrs. Clinton invoked another past Democratic presidential candidate as well, John F. Kennedy, as she noted that some Americans are skeptical that a woman can win the presidency in 2008.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people said back then, 'Well, you know, America will never elect a Catholic as president,' '' she said. As for her own candidacy, she used a line that has become a trademark in her seven-week-old campaign: ''We'll never know unless we try.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who refers to her bid as being ''in it to win it,'' also sounded a more explicit note of confidence in herself as the most prepared and battle-tested contender for the Democratic nomination, even as she complimented her rivals as ''great, great candidates.''</p>
        <p>''I'm ready -- I'm ready to run against the Republicans and win, and I'm ready to govern and lead our country into the future,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It was one of the widest-ranging speeches that Mrs. Clinton has delivered this winter, and it reflected several trends in her campaign: Presenting herself as the most experienced, confident candidate in the field; tapping her husband's ideas and personal popularity; and portraying her candidacy as historic and inspiring for women and girls.</p>
        <p>Ranging across topics, she repeated her call to start withdrawing troops from Iraq now, urged the government to listen to scientists concerned about global warming, and recalled the moral authority of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in combating poverty and inequality.</p>
        <p>She also praised Americans' optimism and associated herself with the spirit -- a quality that voters tend to like in their presidents. In that vein, she made clear that she would push back forcefully against critics of the United States and anyone who questioned the nation's resolve.</p>
        <p>''It is always a mistake to bet against America,'' she said. ''We are not the world's oldest democracy by accident.''</p>
        <p>Her remarks about ''invisible Americans'' stood out as the new flourish to her standard campaign stump speech, and she cast a wide net: Rather than focus on the middle class or the working class, she included both, and singled out single mothers, children in poorly performing schools, Sept. 11 first responders, and soldiers returning from combat with disabilities, among others.</p>
        <p>''If you are a hard-working single parent who can't afford health insurance or a small business owner who worries about energy costs or a student who can't afford to continue college, you are invisible to this administration,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''For six long years, President Bush and the Washington Republicans have looked right through you.</p>
        <p>''Well, they're not invisible to us,'' she said, prompting some of her strongest applause of the night. ''They're certainly not invisible to me. And when we retake the White House, they will no longer be invisible to the president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>The divide between the haves and have-nots was a popular theme of Mrs. Clinton's husband, Bill, as a candidate for president in 1992. He spoke frequently about the ''forgotten middle class,'' and drew some of his strongest cheers when he noted that the top 1 percent of families had netted 60 percent of the economic gains during the 1980s and had accumulated more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton made an explicit nod to another campaign theme of her husband's, saying, ''We no longer have a president who puts people first; we don't even have a president who puts the future first.''</p>
        <p>Former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina hit on similar ideas during his 2004 campaign for president, focusing on the gaps between ''the two Americas,'' and has continued pressing the theme in his race against Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton spoke at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's annual 100 Club fund-raising dinner. About 1,000 tickets were sold, a few hundred more than usual, and people waited in long lines for a seat at the event at the Sheraton Nashua Hotel.</p>
