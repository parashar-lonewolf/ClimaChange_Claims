        <p>LEAD: With environmental concerns rising and the influence of the European Community growing, the nations of Western Europe have begun to take united action to curb air pollution from automobiles.</p>
        <p>With environmental concerns rising and the influence of the European Community growing, the nations of Western Europe have begun to take united action to curb air pollution from automobiles.</p>
        <p>In June, environmental ministers from the community's 12 member nations agreed to impose emission standards for new small cars in 1992 similar to those in place in the United States since 1983. In general, Europe has lagged well behind the United States in auto emissions rules.</p>
        <p>In addition, there is talk about tightening the currently lax pollution standards for trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles and imposing a communitywide speed limit. Some countries are taking or considering other actions, like tolls at the entrances to big cities, expanded rail and bus systems and restrictions on driving in congested areas.</p>
        <p>There are currently no mandatory communitywide standards for emissions from small and medium-size cars which account for 60 percent and 25 percent, respectively, of the approximately 10 million cars a year sold in Western Europe. Standards for large cars are scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1, but some countries, notably Britain, are resisting them.</p>
        <p>The attitudes of European governments toward auto emissions have varied greatly in the past. In countries like Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Greece relative indifference reigned until recently, and smaller cars with polution control systems were a rarity there.</p>
        <p>But in some countries the damage to forests and other parts of the environment by auto emissions has increased the strength of the environmental movement and encouraged stiffer regulations. These countries, including West Germany, Scandinavia, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, have encouraged the use of unleaded gasoline as a precursor to other actions to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>Since lead in gasoline poisons the catalytic converters that are essential to most pollution removal systems, the switch to unleaded fuel needs to be made before emissions standards are toughened.</p>
        <p>West Germany and the Netherlands have tax breaks and lower fees for cleaner cars. By Oct. 1, 1990, all new cars sold in Denmark will have to meet American-style emissions standards. In the last year or two, emission standards like America's have also gone into effect for all new cars in Austria, Sweden, Switzerland and Norway, which belong to the European Free Trade Association.</p>
        <p>In Britain, some auto companies are trying to make cleaner air a selling point. Both Volvo and Audi announced this summer that they would offer catalytic converters on their cars in Britain at no extra charge. Car makers have been charging as much as $1,300 extra for vehicles equipped with pollution control systems that include converters. Royalty in the Act</p>
        <p>The royal family has also gotten into the act by spending what industry executives say must have been a royal sum to retrofit its vehicles to use unleaded fuel. That example, and a tax change that widened the price advantage of unleaded over leaded, have increased unleaded's share of the market to about 25 percent from 5 percent in the spring.</p>
        <p>Motorists who stray from main highways in countries like France, Spain, Portugal and Greece may still have trouble finding unleaded fuel but industry executives expect that circumstance to change over time as the community pushes national governments to make unleaded widely available.</p>
        <p>Other governments have followed Britain's lead by using taxes to make unleaded gasoline cheaper, but it has taken some time to find out how great a differential was needed to stimulate demand. Unleaded now retails for 10 to 20 cents a gallon less than leaded in many Western European countries. Lead in the Environment</p>
        <p>Europeans are still pouring a lot of lead into the environment, compared with the United States, where removal of lead has been a national objective since the late 1960's. In the European Community, lead emissions from vehicles totaled 23,891 tons last year, according to Dr. Ian Berwick, director general of the United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association. Just 3,306 tons were emitted in the United States in 1987, compared with 123,865 tons in 1978.</p>
        <p>The impetus behind these actions is a growing public concern about the environment in Western Europe, where water and air quality is sometimes worse than in America. ''Air quality in large European cities is comparable to that of some of the worst cities in the United States, including Houston, Denver and New York City,'' said Paul M. Stolpman, director of the pollution control division of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
        <p>The growing environmental sensitivity of European public officials has been linked to the increasing power of the Green Party and similar political groups. The Greens have long been a force in West Germany and Belgium, and they amazed political analysts by winning 15 percent of the British vote in the elections for the European Parliament last June. Green Movement Strengthens</p>
        <p>''The situation has changed dramatically as the Green movement has gained force,'' said John Phelps, technical manager of the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers in Paris.</p>
        <p>Another important factor is the approach of 1992, the year that trade barriers within the community are due to be dismantled. At that time differing emissions standards may be regarded as barriers to trade. So if West Germany wants to get tough on automotive pollution, it has to persuade the rest of the community to go along, which could result in stiffer requirements all over.</p>
        <p>In addition, if one nation unilaterally takes action, it risks putting its auto industry at a competitive disadvantage, said Russell Seal, head of the British Petroleum Company's refining and marketing operations. While a catalytic converter itself costs auto makers only about $80, the cost of the fuel-injection and engine-management systems needed on cars with catalytic converters runs into hundreds of dollars.</p>
        <p>Indeed, small-car buyers may also be in for sticker shock when the community rules go into effect. Experts say catalytic converters and related engine changes will add $500 to $800 to the price of each vehicle. Debating Further Steps</p>
        <p>Even though the community's emission standards are not due to go fully into effect until 1992, government and industry officials and environmentalists are already debating further steps to cut auto pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seal of British Petroleum predicts that the European oil industry will quickly follow the lead of the Atlantic Richfield Company in the United States in offering reformulated gasoline that reduces pollution.</p>
        <p>Because of traffic congestion and concerns about global warming, there is also talk, and some action, on lowering speed limits, spending more on rail systems and buses, and increasing restrictions on car use. The European Community plans to take up the issue of a communitywide speed limit. But the Germans, who are passionate about having no speed limits on their main highways, have opposed the idea.</p>
        <p>Other efforts to reduce congestion are also under way. For instance, Oslo, the capital of Norway, plans to build a system of toll gates at approaches to the city to discourage driving. To avoid long delays, the system will be electronic, with motorists buying passes that can be read quickly at the tolls.</p>
        <p>Manchester, England, recently announced plans to build an ambitious commuter rail system. And Britain's opposition Labor Party last week proposed higher taxes for vehicle use, taxing the use of company cars, restricting car use in central cities at peak hours and improving rail, bus and subway services.</p>
