        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>San Diego has made a lamentable decision to replace good, effective street lighting with poor, energy-wasteful light fixtures. The controversy pits astronomers at Mount Palomar against City Council members who want to feel safer, even if that feeling has no justification.</p>
        <p>There are many other losers besides the astronomers. San Diego's taxpayers lose because, in addition to the $1.4 million cost to convert the lights, they must pay a higher electricity bill of about $1 million a year from now on. Electricity use usually results in a depletion of coal or oil. The extra electricity wasted causes further strip mining, if it is backed by coal, or more dependence on foreign oil. In either case we all lose because the extra use of either fossil fuel adds to global warming.</p>
        <p>We lose even more from our national lighting situation. The International Dark-Sky Association conservatively estimates a cost of more than $1 billion a year for just the upward-shining component of outdoor lighting. Simple shielding would save us this energy waste because the power consumption of bulbs could be lowered with no loss in light shining downward, where it is needed.</p>
        <p>Upward-shining light is no deterrent to crime, but its light pollution forms a major waste of money and energy. ARTHUR R. UPGREN  Middletown, Conn., Oct. 21, 1993 The writer, professor of astronomy at Wesleyan University, is an outdoor lighting consultant.</p>
