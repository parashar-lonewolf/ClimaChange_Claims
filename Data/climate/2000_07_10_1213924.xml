        <p>Electricity used to be so simple. A bill came from some faceless monopoly and the consumer wrote a check. Then came deregulation and the dizzying choice about who would provide one's allotment of kilowatts.</p>
        <p>The next wave of change may bring the most wrenching consequence of all: guilt. The Rev. Franklin Vilas, the recently retired rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in this northern New Jersey community, argues that in the new world of consumer choice, electricity has become a moral issue. ''If you buy the cheapest energy, you're killing your kids,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilas, 65, a soft-spoken clergyman known to all as Skip, is the leading intellectual force in a coalition of religious leaders who are trying to forge what they say would be a holy alliance of good works and faith, environmentalism and economics: all the churches in New Jersey, combining their power needs to buy so-called green, nonpolluting, renewable energy as a political and moral statement.</p>
        <p>Experts on the electricity industry and theologians say that though the steps have been early and small -- less than 1,000 green-energy customers, mostly households, out of more than 3.5 million energy users statewide -- the implications of the church effort are huge. Last November, New Jersey was the first state in the metropolitan region, and one of the first in the nation, to let all customers choose their power suppliers. By being drawn into the debate from the beginning, religion has given commercial green energy its first toehold in the nation's densest urban corridor.</p>
        <p>''They were a big part of the reason we came into New Jersey,'' said John Holtz, who is the regional public affairs manager for Greenmountain.com, a company based in Vermont that entered the New Jersey market four months ago, selling electricity generated mostly by wind power, water power and landfill gas. Mr. Holtz declined to provide actual numbers of customers, but said that most signed up after hearing about the company through their congregations or synagogues.</p>
        <p>Greenmountain is planning at least three nonpolluting energy plants in the state, two solar and one hydroelectric, he said; these would have been built elsewhere without church involvement.</p>
        <p>Another company, Conectiv Energy, began offering green electricity in the southern third of New Jersey last fall.</p>
        <p>Religion's connection to the environment, some historians say, goes back to St. Francis of Assisi tending to the beasts of the forest. But the members of Mr. Vilas's group, called Partners for Environmental Quality, say that utility environmentalism is a very different business.</p>
        <p>Electricity, they say, is a disembodied idea, rather like faith, that exists only by its expression. Because the delivery and generation process is far away or out of sight, it can seem harmless and clean, when in fact the power industry, especially coal-fired generation, is one of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases that are blamed for global warming and East Coast smog.</p>
        <p>The group's members say that people also have to be taught how the electrical system works so that they can be convinced that buying green makes a difference, and again it comes down to a leap of faith because green energy does not flow directly into the home. Every light and computer and television in New Jersey draws its energy from the same power grid of mixed energy sources that also supplies residents across Pennsylvania and Maryland. Green-energy users have to know in their hearts that their energy purchase has affected, in a small way, the vast, amorphous power grid itself by injecting more renewable energy into it.</p>
        <p>''People have to be educated to the fact that this is not the same kind of choice as choosing your long-distance provider; this one carries consequences,'' said Pamela Frank, the executive director of Partners for Environmental Quality.</p>
        <p>Organizing churches around the support of green power and energy consciousness is not a new idea. A group called Episcopal Power and Light has been active in Massachusetts and California for several years, and its leaders have coordinated their efforts with Mr. Vilas.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's churches moved faster, pastors and electricity experts say, simply because deregulation here moved faster. New York State, by contrast, is introducing consumer choice gradually on a region-by-region basis through next year, but for most residents there, green energy is not yet an option. Connecticut opened its market only this month.</p>
        <p>Some of the biggest commercial power-buying pools have also been formed in New Jersey over the last year, creating a niche industry of experts that the churches are drawing on to build their own pool.</p>
        <p>It can sometimes create a cozy world. Partners for Environmental Quality, for example, is working with a two-year-old Newark firm, Gibbons Consulting, that specializes in power pools. Gibbons, in turn, worked earlier this year with the Food Council of New Jersey, a statewide association of food retailers, wholesalers and distributors, helping the group create one of the largest power-buying pools in the nation. The effort was aimed primarily at cutting costs for the group's nearly 2,000 members.</p>
        <p>By coincidence, the food group's president, Jim Morford, and its leading lawyer, Jim McGuire, are active Episcopalians, and through their church work, they bumped into Mr. Vilas. The Food Council ultimately signed a contract in March with KeySpan Energy, a company based in Brooklyn that generates electricity primarily by using cleaner-burning natural gas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morford said the main reason for choosing KeySpan was financial. The Food Council expects to save about $20 million over the 14-month contract, compared with its old utility. A secondary consideration was the belief among council members that signing with a cheaper company that relied on Midwestern coal would be bad public relations. Mr. Morford stressed that his church work and his professional duties to the Food Council were kept strictly separate during the KeySpan negotiations. But he said he is now enthusiastically using what he learned to help Mr. Vilas.</p>
        <p>Partners for Environmental Quality, which is led by a multifaith board of trustees, has reached out to Roman Catholics, Protestants and Jews to talk about the practical and ethical aspects of participating in the power pool.</p>
        <p>Other church efforts have moved forward on their own tracks.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey region chapter of the United Synagogues of Conservative Judaism has formed its own energy-buying consortium separate from Partners for Environmental Quality and will present two choices to its 60 members this fall: one with a cheaper traditional energy mix, and one with a higher proportion of cleaner-burning fuels like natural gas and renewable sources.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the chapter said that synagogues would be under no pressure to choose one way or the other, but that he believed most would consider more than price. ''Before, we had no input into how energy was generated or how dirty it was, and now we do,'' said Jeff Schwartz, the secretary of the New Jersey region chapter. ''This is an opportunity that shouldn't be squandered.''</p>
        <p>But the message for cleaner energy is also raising some ethical dilemmas and implications of its own inside religious communities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilas, who grew up in the utility industry -- his father, Franklin Vilas Sr., was the chief spokesman for Consolidated Edison in New York for many years -- has argued to pastors, priests and parishioners that the cheapest available energy comes from coal-burning plants in the Midwest that are blamed for contributing to air pollution on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
        <p>The structure of deregulation mandates a choice that determines where consumers stand on that pollution issue. Mr. Vilas tells people that by simply staying with the energy company they have, they are tacitly endorsing a power grid that derives nearly 50 percent of its output from coal-fired generation. Getting the point across -- that making no decision on energy constitutes a moral statement -- requires what officials of the group call agitation.</p>
        <p>''When I say 'energy deregulation and global warming,' I see people's eyes glaze over,'' said Ms. Frank, executive director of Partners for Environmental Quality. ''But when Skip says, 'Buy cheap energy and kill your kids,' it gets people's attention -- it may be over the top, but it gets people's attention.''</p>
        <p>Renewable energy also costs about 20 percent more than the rate paid by most customers in New Jersey, and that difference threatens to separate rich churches from poor ones. For an affluent church like St. Paul's, the additional cost of about $600 to $1,000 a year was not considered a problem.</p>
        <p>In poorer parts of the state, however, churches are struggling simply to make ends meet. With electricity bills expected to increase this summer in many parts of the country, partly because of a recent surge in natural gas prices, many churches, individuals and businesses could be pushed by circumstances to go precisely the other way: toward cheaper and perhaps dirtier energy.</p>
        <p>Traditional electricity companies and some energy industry analysts say that the regional power grid is improving even without green energy, as natural gas becomes a bigger source and older, less efficient coal-fired plans are decommissioned.</p>
        <p>But there are also many small and very human implications that have emerged from the church-energy nexus, and they have less predictable results. Robert Frey, a retired mechanical engineer who attends St. Paul's, signed up with Greenmountain after company officials came to the church for Easter service, and he is now the resident green convert in his condominium complex in nearby Morris Township.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frey has persuaded the condominium board to allow him to present a plan this fall for converting the common areas of the complex to green energy. He is preparing his presentation now, and his faith is driving him.</p>
        <p>''If you're a family that wants to save 10 percent and buy the dirty energy, that's your choice,'' Mr. Frey said. ''But is it beneficial to your children and grandchildren? I think not. How can you get that message across to people without religion?''</p>
