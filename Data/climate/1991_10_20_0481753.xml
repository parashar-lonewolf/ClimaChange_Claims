        <p>This is the fall that thinks it must be spring.</p>
        <p>In September, the magnolias bloomed in the New York Botanical Garden. A few weeks later, the lilacs blossomed on Martha's Vineyard. In Washington, the rhododendrons are out.</p>
        <p>But hey, if farmers can water-ski on cornfields, as they did in Iowa in May, why can't a dogwood bloom in October?</p>
        <p>"We had rhododendrons and dogwoods and pears blooming at the National Arboretum," said Marc Cathey, a horticulturist for the Agriculture Department in Beltsville, Md. "It's like the spring of '92 is peaking in the fall of '91. It's eerie. I don't remember a season like this in over 50 years." Combination of Factors</p>
        <p>Floods and droughts. Heat waves and cold spells. This year has seen everything. Is it global warming, or the age-old vagaries of weather?</p>
        <p>"I think that some of the extremes we've seen this year are related to the greenhouse effect," said Dr. James Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "But weather is always highly variable. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to blame any particular event on a long-term trend like global warming."</p>
        <p>Strange as it seems, this fall's "spring" is a perfectly natural response to a confluence of weather events, including the past mild winter and early spring, a blast of extreme summer heat followed by rain, and the hurricane in August. Hurricane's Aftermath</p>
        <p>On Martha's Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts, Frances Tenenbaum, an editor at Houghton Mifflin, went out a couple of weeks ago to rake up the oak leaves in her yard in Gayhead -- and to pick the lilacs.</p>
        <p>"It's really bizarre," Mrs. Tenenbaum said. "I never raked leaves and picked lilacs at the same time."</p>
        <p>The island was pretty depressing after the hurricane that swept through on Aug. 19, she said. The desiccating winds turned the leaves brown and they fell off the trees before the summer ended. But a warm rainy spell followed, and voila!</p>
        <p>"All these new green leaves started showing and everything has this delicate new April look," she said.</p>
        <p>Flowering apple trees, crabapples and forsythia. Beach plum bushes with tender green leaves.</p>
        <p>"It was beautiful, but it totally disrupted our internal clocks," said Gus Ben David, the director of the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary of the Massachusetts Audubon Society on the Vineyard. Imagine bittersweet vines with orange berries and new green leaves in mid-October. "It's kind of like 'The Twilight Zone,' " Mr. David said. Buds Were Just Waiting</p>
        <p>But from a plant's point of view, it is perfectly normal.</p>
        <p>"Plants produce flower buds for next year's growth during the summer of the year before they open," said Peter Del Tredici, a biologist at the Arnold Arboretum in Boston. "The buds are in the axil of the leaf, where the leaf is joined to the stem. As long as that leaf stays in place, the bud will remain dormant, which in French means asleep."</p>
        <p>That sleeping bud is fully mature. If you were to dissect a lilac bud you would see everything there, very compressed. And under "normal" circumstances -- if there is such a thing -- the buds remain dormant during the short, cold days of winter. When spring rolls in with warmer, longer days, plants "break bud."</p>
        <p>"But the other way to break dormancy is to defoliate the plant," Dr. Del Tredici said. "The hurricane came very early, before the trees had lost their leaves and gone dormant. Then the defoliation was followed by warm weather, causing next year's buds to break."</p>
        <p>So the Massachusetts coast had apple trees and lilacs abloom.</p>
        <p>"It was a very unusual set of circumstances, but the behavior of the plants is totally natural," Dr. Del Tredici said.</p>
        <p>And spring is sure to come again next year. "There will be plenty of buds for the spring of '92," said Dr. Cathey, the Federal horticulturist in Maryland, who explained that plants go into varying levels of dormancy. "Rhododendrons are notorious for flowering in fall, but these are just the earliest form of the flowers sneaking through."</p>
        <p>Fruit trees may not do well next spring, he cautioned. It was a heavy fruiting season this summer, and trees were stressed by heat and drought, so they may need a year to recharge. Three Early Years</p>
        <p>Last winter was extremely mild, setting the stage for unusual blooming this year in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>"I had a clematis, Mrs. Cholmondeley, leaf out in February," said Nigel Rollings, who has a garden in Long Island City, Queens. "It's extraordinary, but it's getting to be normal. For three years now, things have been coming into leaf extremely early."</p>
        <p>The mild winter led into a very warm March and April, which sent plants into an avalanche of bloom.</p>
        <p>"We had tulips and daffodils flowering at the same time, which is not normal," said Michael Ruggiero, special gardens curator at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. "And the lilacs, which usually bloom in early May, flowered in early April with the daffodils."</p>
        <p>Old-fashioned roses bloomed in May instead of June. And then came the heat wave to blast the hybrid teas.</p>
        <p>"I came here about 30 years ago and this was the hottest summer I ever saw," Mr. Ruggiero said. "I'm surprised a lot more bad things didn't happen with the high humidity and heat."</p>
        <p>The good news was that the hot, dry conditions of May resulted in near-perfect pollination. The bees and butterflies had a field day, and it was a bumper crop for some things like peaches, raspberries and beach plums.</p>
        <p>Flowers bloomed like gangbusters, but out of whack.</p>
        <p>"The very high temperatures and water-stressed conditions in May set up a system of early maturation so that everything, if it was going to form flowers, formed early," Dr. Cathey said. "The chrysanthemums and sedum, which are supposed to flower in fall, were flowering here in midsummer." Fooled by August Rain</p>
        <p>The heat and drought also sent some plants into early dormancy. Then a mild rainy spell in August and September caused them to break bud, or flower, as if it were spring. Thus the jolly pear trees of Washington.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers went dormant on July 21, when the mercury hit 102 and ozone lay over the city like a suffocating pillow. They suffered through 38 days of temperatures of 90 or better. That broke the 1944 record of 37 days, according to the Weather Communications Group at Pennsylvania State University.</p>
        <p>"Last year was the warmest year on record, but 1991 may break that record," said Dr. Hansen , who has long predicted that global warming, caused by a rise in heat-trapping gases in the earth's atmosphere, would become apparent in this decade.</p>
        <p>New York was not the only hot place. Dr. Hansen of the Goddard Institute said 1990 "was the warmest year average of the world," adding, "The cherry blossoms in Washington and Tokyo both broke the records by 10 days." They bloomed in mid-March, instead of early April. That could be a signal that the planet is heating up, he said, or it may just reflect natural variability.</p>
        <p>So New York got the heat wave. And Iowa got the flood.</p>
        <p>"We had about three and a half feet of water out there on Memorial Day, so my boys and I put the boat in and went skiing," said Reuben Snow, who has a 500-acre farm near Wesley, Iowa. He usually plants his corn in early April, soybeans a little later. This year, everybody just watched the rain come down.</p>
        <p>He and other farmers might lose 30 percent of their crops this year. At least one person drowned in the flooded farm fields of Iowa. Tractors were buried in mud. Late plantings, and an early frost, resulted in severe crop reductions for many farmers in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>"It was the wettest April in 119 years of records," said Elwynn Taylor, the agricultural climatologist for Iowa State University.</p>
        <p>Iowa usually gets about 3 inches of rain in April; this year, 6 to 10 inches fell. But the easternmost part of the state had a drought, as did neighboring Illinois.</p>
        <p>"I've been at this since 1969, and I would say that since 1987 we've been seeing an increased number of these harsh events," Dr. Taylor said. "And the past three summers have been particularly strange."</p>
        <p>In early April, when the temperature usually hovers in the 50's, it soared into the 90's. Then things cooled off, and the rains came.</p>
        <p>Farmers planted late, in June instead of April. And now they have been hit by an early frost.</p>
        <p>Winters have exhibited extreme weather patterns, too, Dr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>"We're seeing six-week cycles of extreme weather, of very warm and very cold," he said. "If we have a warm period in January, people think it's going to be a mild winter, but then we might end up with a cold March."</p>
        <p>Such extremes fit Dr. Hansen's theories of global warming. "We expect a greater frequency of unusual warmth and also greater extremes in wet and dry conditions," he said. "With higher temperatures, you have more intense evaporation and therefore more rainfall, because everything that goes up has to come down someplace."</p>
        <p>In Louisiana, this has been the wettest year on record. New Orleans received about 100 inches of rain, twice the normal amount.</p>
        <p>Yet over in Raleigh, N.C., it was a perfect summer.</p>
        <p>"It was an abnormal year in that nothing went wrong," said J. C. Raulston, the director of the arboretum at North Carolina State University.</p>
        <p>"Normal in nature means a range of conditions: it's wet, it's dry, it's hot, it's cold," Dr. Raulston said. "But we tend as Americans to take a 10-minute view of the world. We have the attention span of an MTV commercial. If we get a chilling period, we're turning into an iceberg. Three weeks later, it gets hot and the earth is cooking."</p>
        <p>Dr. Vernon Kousky of the Federal Climate Analysis Center in Maryland agreed: "On any particular day, you're bound to find extremes somewhere in the world. It's part of the natural variability of our climate system, and it doesn't mark the end of the earth."</p>
        <p>So by the lights of the Kousky school, everyone can just sit back, relax and watch those beautiful sunsets filtering through the dust blown up from the Philippines by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo (which is going to cool the earth about one degree Fahrenheit, by the way). Even if gases are trapping the earth's heat, the effects may be mitigated -- for now.</p>
        <p>Still, gardeners grow uneasy when the clematis leafs out in February. And it never seems to snow anymore.</p>
        <p>"Back in the 70's, you could count on 18 inches or so of snow once or twice a year," said Mr. Rollings, who is still cutting roses in Long Island City. "Now we're lucky to get one or two inches."</p>
        <p>He recalled a particularly warm day last November, when he was out building a deck.</p>
        <p>"I was outside with my shirt off. It was 86 degrees. Totally unheard of. In my mind, winters are not what they used to be. They're becoming a thing of the past."</p>
