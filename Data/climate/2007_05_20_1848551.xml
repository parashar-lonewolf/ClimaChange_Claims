        <p>The house that I live in is an exquisitely tuned, environmentally sensitive machine -- or at least it was when it was built, back when Thomas Jefferson was president, more than two centuries ago.

        <p>The house that I live in is an exquisitely tuned, environmentally sensitive machine -- or at least it was when it was built, back when Thomas Jefferson was president, more than two centuries ago. Light, temperature and air circulation were regulated by an elaborate technology of window sashes, louvered or paneled shutters, flues, curtains and doors. A long central hallway drew breezes through, offering relief from steamy Maryland summers. Sometimes, I can still almost hear the ghosts of the original owners, offering advice born of long experience: On a hot July morning, close the front shutters, open the hall doors at both ends, raise the upstairs sashes to catch the southerly breeze. My house's walls were built of bricks fired on the spot from the same clayey soil that had been dug out to form the cellar, so that I think of it as something like a sand castle, sculptured from its surrounding earth. It is as ''organic,'' in its homely 19th-century way, as the pounded-dirt floors that are apparently all the rage now in certain parts of Mendocino County.</p>
        <p>Converting such a house to run on fossil fuels -- as I did when I bought it, several years ago -- is rather like installing an eight-cylinder engine in a horse-drawn buggy. I had to, of course; like almost everyone else of my generation, I am addicted to air-conditioning. (Besides, the 19th-century owners had half a dozen live-in servants -- in the early years, slaves -- to run around opening all those doors, closing the shutters, tending the seven fireplaces.) But still, the old house now feels to me something like a lovely musical instrument that no one remembers how to play anymore. The shutters hang on rusting hinges.</p>
        <p>Most middle-class suburban Americans today live in houses that are more or less of the same basic style as mine: what the real estate agents call ''colonial,'' which means pitched roofs, symmetrical windows, brick or clapboard walls, wooden porches. This is the style of house that goes up in the new McMansion subdivisions that are sprouting on the outskirts of many old towns, including mine. (''Home buyers' affair with modernistic design is over,'' Witold Rybczynski declares in a new book, ''Late Harvest,'' on the creation of contemporary suburbs. ''The brief fling with the rancher was an anomaly.'')</p>
        <p>In these 21st-century colonial houses, form has ceased to follow function. The McMansions on the outskirts of my town come with louvered shutters, too, but these are far too narrow for the Palladian windows that they flank, and anyway, they are made of plastic and bolted to the wall. They're not shutters at all, really -- you could never shut them -- but rather shriveled, vestigial appendages, standing in lamely for what was once useful and practical.</p>
        <p>If by ''green architecture'' we mean buildings designed to exist in harmony with environmental conditions, to conserve fuel and regulate temperature by ''natural'' means, then it is easy to forget that this did not begin with the invention of solar panels, photovoltaic cells and LEED certification. Americans have been experimenting, adapting and reshaping their architecture to suit their local environment since the very beginning.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many of the oldest houses whose remnants archaeologists have unearthed at Jamestown bore little resemblance to the structures that the settlers would have known in England. They were ''pit houses,'' half-subterranean and with their roof eaves resting directly on the ground, offering good insulation from the extreme New World winters and summers. (This design did have its drawbacks, however: lack of ventilation meant that when you lighted a fire indoors, you might die of carbon-monoxide poisoning.)</p>
        <p>Today major developers like Ryan Homes offer the identical ''colonial'' models (with Anglophile names like the Avalon and the Waverly) in Michigan that they do in South Carolina. But the original Colonial houses varied greatly from place to place. As more permanent architecture diffused itself through the new colonies, local adaptations responded to local environments and climates. The great central chimneys of New England became sidewall chimneys in milder Pennsylvania; in Maryland, the flues ran half-embedded in the walls, and in Virginia, they are wholly exterior. Thoughtful builders went still further. At Monticello, Jefferson carefully calibrated the size and placement of his windows to reflect the movements of the sun and experimented with skylights and ventilation passages.</p>
        <p>In a sense, nothing is more traditionally American than such attempts to harmonize architecture with nature. In his classic 1964 book, ''The Machine in the Garden,'' the cultural critic Leo Marx traced our society's 400-year infatuation with what he called ''the middle landscape,'' a place where civilization and the wilderness are held in perfect balance and where ''science and technology can be made to serve a rural ideal.'' (Some might call this landscape, more prosaically than Professor Marx did, ''suburbia.'')</p>
        <p>Green architecture, then, lets us have our cake and eat it too. It lets us combine the extravagant rationalism of Jefferson, whose mansion literally bankrupted him, with the crunchy romanticism of Henry David Thoreau, whose little hut at Walden cost him exactly $28.12 1/2. (The prissiness of that extra half-cent is what forever confirms my own sympathies as more Jeffersonian than Thoreauvian.) The idea of the ''organic'' as a cultural touchstone did not spring to life fully formed in the produce aisle of Whole Foods; a century ago, that word was a mantra for architects like Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
        <p>And probably, when all is said and done, the roots of this infatuation go back far beyond the birth of America. Architecture has always involved a dream of blending nature with artifice. Think of Roman column capitals, with their leaves frozen in marble, or the ziggurats of Ur and Sumer, built as brick homages to distantly remembered mountains.</p>
        <p>''Our age is retrospective,'' Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in his 1836 essay ''Nature.'' ''It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. . . . The foregoing generations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the universe?'' The best green architecture of the present day may, indeed, be an answer to Emerson's call. It is no coincidence, perhaps, that when the sage of Concord wrote those words, he had just moved out of his grandfather's old parsonage and finished construction of his own house along the Cambridge turnpike, a sedate Greek Revival structure that he would inhabit for the half-century until his death. Or that he concluded his essay with this exhortation: ''Build, therefore, your own world.''</p>
