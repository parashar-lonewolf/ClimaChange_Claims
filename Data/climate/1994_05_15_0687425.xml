        <p>INVENTING a new alternator for cars and trucks may be the last thing anyone would deliberately set out to do. For 50 years, the automobile industry has relied on the same basic technology to produce countless millions of alternators, tried-and-true gizmos that do nothing more than convert mechanical power from the engine into electricity for recharging the battery and operating the headlights, horn, radio and such.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the founders of the Ecoair Corporation never set out to re-invent the alternator. But now the tiny startup company, based here, may be on the verge of selling a new type of alternator technology to the Ford Motor Company. And other auto companies, domestic and foreign, are said to be interested.</p>
        <p>Industry executives say Ecoair's design could bolster gasoline mileage by 5 percent or more by reducing energy demands on the engine. It might also enable auto companies to install a wider range of electronic devices, and save weight in building such vital parts as power brakes and steering, making them less reliant upon heavy hydraulic systems.</p>
        <p>"It opens a lot of doors to things we would like to do and can't," said John Jelinek, a Ford engineering official in Dearborn, Mich. He said Ford is reluctant to discuss details because it is negotiating with Ecoair to license the technology.</p>
        <p>Ecoair's tale is a twist on the classic business dream of "build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door." In fact, the better mousetrap Ecoair originally designed was not an alternator but a car air conditioner -- an environmentally-benign, freon-free system that would not erode the ozone layer, which helps protect the Earth against ultraviolet radiation. While it's not clear whether the air conditioner will find buyers, the alternator seems to be on the verge of success.</p>
        <p>Ecoair was founded three years ago by Jay Powell, an engineer who specialized in turbines, and by Peter Knudsen, a businessman with broad management experience, who reunited in middle age after having roomed together at Yale in the mid-1950's. To broaden the company's technical and financial skills, they subsequently brought in a few other executives.</p>
        <p>By the time Ecoair was ready to start demonstrating its prototype air conditioner to Detroit in 1992, it knew its design required more electrical output than current auto alternators can generate. To achieve sufficient power, conventional air conditioners are now powered by mechanical energy through belts and pulleys connected to the engine. So Ecoair hired a consulting engineer, Charles Syverson, to help create a high efficiency alternator to run its air conditioner. At that point, serendipity took over.</p>
        <p>"I still remember the meeting at Ford where we showed both products together," said William J. LaVelle, 54, Ecoair's executive vice president, referring to a meeting in Detroit last fall. "When we started explaining what the alternator could do, one guy from the back of the room piped up, 'That's something we could really use right now.' That's when we realized the alternator might be a successful product in its own right."</p>
        <p>Sadly for the Ecoair executives, Jay Powell was not there to share the moment. He died of a heart attack in March 1993.</p>
        <p>Ecoair recognizes that, at idle and low speeds, today's alternators fail to generate enough power to prevent a drain on auto batteries. At best, conventional alternators deliver barely more than 25 percent of their rated power at idle speeds. This deficiency forces the use of considerably larger and heavier batteries than might otherwise be needed.</p>
        <p>BUT the futuristic electronic devices -- like road sensors, navigation systems, and collision warning devices -- would be easier to design and operate if there were sufficient electricity to run them.</p>
        <p>The limitations of current technology also impede the conversion of such equipment as power brakes and steering from hydraulic to electrical systems. Such systems would not only be lighter in weight; they might also be safer because hydraulic systems lose their power when the engine stops, making it difficult to brake and steer a car.</p>
        <p>Ecoair, which was notified this month that the patent for its alternator will be approved soon, will not disclose exactly how the device works. But the company says its prototype, which was delivered to Ford late last year for testing, produces at idle and low speeds up to three times as much power as a conventional 12-volt alternator of the same size.</p>
        <p>Ecoair officials say their product's secret involves creating a different way of magnetizing the coil. And Ecoair says its alternator should be no more expensive to manufacture than today's models.</p>
        <p>The company is also working on a dual-voltage alternator, which could further expand the range of electrical equipment used in automobiles, such as special catalytic converter heaters to reduce emissions even further and active suspension controls. These generally require 48 volts to operate, rather than the industry-standard 12 volts.</p>
        <p>There is no guarantee, of course that Ecoair will be able to turn its invention into a thriving business. But the company has its cheerleaders.</p>
        <p>Ecoair "has a very attractive project with a proprietary product that we believe has a sustainable competitive advantage," said Victor Budnick, director of investments for Connecticut Innovations Inc., a state-financed corporation that has given Ecoair $500,000 as part of Connecticut's effort to replace its shrinking military industry. "Our goal is to support businesses that will give Connecticut a high-quality workforce. Ecoair does not promise a huge number of jobs, but they offer a nice chunk of jobs in a place, the New Haven enterprise zone, where it is very difficult to lure any good, light manufacturing jobs at all."</p>
        <p>The company is located in Science Park, an inner-city business "incubator" in New Haven. The park was set up a decade ago with financing from the Olin Corporation, Yale University, and the city and state governments to revitalize a site formerly used to make Olin's Winchester rifles. Since 1991, Ecoair has received a total of $1.25 million in Federal, state and city grants, plus an additional $1 million or so from its executives and from private investors.</p>
        <p>Ecoair also has the advantage of developing a new technology at a time when Detroit seems to be abandoning its longstanding "not invented here" tradition, which served as a roadblock to upstarts.</p>
        <p>"These days, it is becoming more and more common for non-traditional suppliers to make inroads into the industry," said Mr. Jelinek at Ford.</p>
        <p>Despite its good timing and financial supporters, Ecoair executives know they cannot afford any missteps. "A small company like ours has maybe a two-year window to get its product to market," said Mr. LaVelle, the executive vice president. "If we're going to make a name for ourselves before the big firms catch up, there's no time to waste."</p>
