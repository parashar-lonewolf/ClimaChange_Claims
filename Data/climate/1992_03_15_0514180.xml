        <p>"BEWARE the Ides of March." I do. Early spring is my queasy season. The longed-for thaw gives me the willies: I don't like everything suddenly loosening up. Terra no longer so firma underfoot, I also feel an internal giving way: spring runoff in both nostrils, a gutslide of fear sucking hope into my boot tops.</p>
        <p>Whooosh.</p>
        <p>It's March malaise. Anxiety free-floating, along with dandelion fluff, in the air. And now that Mother Nature seems to suffer from Alzheimer's disease, spring is more unsettling than ever. Not only has she forgotten to blanket us with the requisite number of snows, but she has also, in one hot flash after another, forced bulbs to bloom too soon.</p>
        <p>It's hard to enjoy the warm sun and burst buds, when they appear as suddenly as democracy in Eastern Europe. While all this is technically pleasant, we could use more of a transition.</p>

        <p>"BEWARE the Ides of March." I do. Early spring is my queasy season. The longed-for thaw gives me the willies: I don't like everything suddenly loosening up. Terra no longer so firma underfoot, I also feel an internal giving way: spring runoff in both nostrils, a gutslide of fear sucking hope into my boot tops.</p>
        <p>Whooosh.</p>
        <p>It's March malaise. Anxiety free-floating, along with dandelion fluff, in the air. And now that Mother Nature seems to suffer from Alzheimer's disease, spring is more unsettling than ever. Not only has she forgotten to blanket us with the requisite number of snows, but she has also, in one hot flash after another, forced bulbs to bloom too soon.</p>
        <p>It's hard to enjoy the warm sun and burst buds, when they appear as suddenly as democracy in Eastern Europe. While all this is technically pleasant, we could use more of a transition.</p>
        <p>But I confess: I didn't need the hole in the ozone layer to widen the corresponding hollow in my soul. For me, spring has always been split, a dangerous divide between pleasure and duty. Wasn't it always a choice between sex and taxes? Spring frolic or spring cleaning? Each season, the pagan and the puritan fight it out at the first sniff of chlorophyll. Even now in March, as I still nest in my bed, buried under down, I consider the alternatives: look for love, or do the windows.</p>
        <p>Because I grew up in a 1950's pueblo, where spring cleaning was to Bronx housewives what dancing at Lughnasa is to the Irish, I lean toward washing the windows. My first response to that new slant of light streaming through my window, is critical: When did my world become so</p>
        <p>shmutsik</p>
        <p>? The glass is a cataract of grime. I can barely see outside. In the echo chamber of my skull, I can hear the oy vays of the neighborhood women of my childhood. They were housewives of the fiercest sort, more wed to the house than the man ("husband" was a verb). Every spring, these women performed painful rituals: cleaning Venetian blinds, slat by slat, with toothbrushes; using Clorox on the cords. They hung from open windows, beat rugs down to the thread count. It was a wild war against dirt, waged every year. Soil was never something to plant seeds in: it was</p>
        <p>dirt,</p>
        <p>and it had to get out of the house. Instead of inhaling sweet, scented breezes, and surrendering to hormonal tides, they spent their passion, anesthetized by ammonia, getting surfaces to "sparkle." Afterward, they would claim "I feel better now," but they had to stand grouchy guard against dust for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>But even window-washing is not entirely a safe, moral choice. If I decide to wash them myself, as I have, in death-defying sweeps, I never quite reach, and am left with semi-permanent crescents that only serve to delineate my failure as a housewife (the sort known in Yiddish as baleboosteh). Yet can it be a coincidence that each time I have called in a professional window cleaner, he has been overcome with lust in my presence? To nonlibidinous window washers, my apologies. But it happens I have encountered three window washers whose spring blood was up. "I wash</p>
        <p>backs,</p>
        <p>too" was one opener. Another leered, from his harness, into my bedroom, and displayed a very long tongue.</p>
        <p>O.K. So no windows. Draw the drapes. Just don't venture out, for my history is a string of spring disasters. I can divide them into "the accidents" and "the illnesses," all spring-related. All ecstasy-motivated. For I am not immune to the charms. At the first whiff of wild onion, I've leaped out there, looking for more "harbingers." I've skipped and whistled. I've cried out greetings to birds. And what happened? For every bucolic second, I paid with days, often weeks of agony.</p>
        <p>At the age of 5, I staged an escape from the nursery school yard. We children watched as crab grass cracked concrete, and dreamed that we, too, could be free.</p>
        <p>I vaulted over a chain-link fence, and landed right foot first in a vat of asphalt. They were peeling and picking black goo from my leg for hours; no hair yet grows on that spot.</p>
        <p>At 9, I raced down the footpaths of a forbidden city park. A practicing pagan, I already worshiped specific trees and one rock. (See? I was filled with ecstatic springy feelings once.) I knelt at my sacred spot, and sipped the waters of a new-sprung brook. It was a moment to savor and remember -- especially the next morning when I awoke with a 104-degree fever. My new brook turned out to be spring runoff, all right -- from a disconnected sewer. The diagnosis was scarlet fever, and I spent the next 10 days as a Seurat: my skin a close pattern of hot pink polka dots that from a distance gave the appearance of a solid color.</p>
        <p>When I was 17, having a miserable freshman year at an upstate college, I had one happy day: the first "spring day" when I knelt and kissed the moist earth. I contracted poison ivy, and spent the next two weeks dragging a swollen leg around campus, while cruel boys sang "roll me over in the clover" as I passed.</p>
        <p>The accidents were even worse. Thrilled at my first try at "spring skiing," I swooped, whooping, down the slope, and crashed head-on into a teen-age boy, who was also in high spirits. I broke his collar bone with my teeth. The skull fracture healed eventually.</p>
        <p>At 40, still stupid with delight, I leaped upon a 10-speed bike. Pumping merrily, I raced along taking great gulps of the perfumed air. As I admired the green, air-brushed appearance of the overhanging trees, I was struck by a white Cadillac, driven by a real-estate broker on her way to meet a man for drinks. I dented her car hood with my thigh. My thigh has a dent, too, and for a time, I had the impression of a hood ornament in my left cheek.</p>
        <p>Even the vacations were awful. I spent my one college spring break down in Florida holed up in an $8 hotel room, too frightened by the sounds of revelry to go out at night. By day, I felt threatened by date rape, beach rape, street rape and towel rape. Wild boys roamed every street. The gutters ran yellow with fraternity vomit. I flew, standby, with strep throat back home to New York.</p>
        <p>So, as I extend my hibernation to include March and maybe April, I urge you all to hold spring impulses in check. Don't run out there, crying "cherry pink and apple blossom white." Try not to breathe in too deeply; you may hyperventilate.</p>
        <p>Instead: Sleep in, then root around for tax receipts. The tiny ones, for taxi rides taken last January, are fun to find, hidden in the linings of ripped pockets and purses. This is a safe springtime preoccupation. If you want more sensual enjoyment, try some asparagus.</p>
