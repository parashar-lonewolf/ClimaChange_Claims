        <p>At Blood Falls on the Taylor Glacier, iron oxides streak down the face of a pristine ice cliff as if the glacier were bleeding from a wound. No one knows why the oxides, which are believed to leach up from a subglacial lake, appear at just this spot, but the effect is stunning, a febrile flash of color in a landscape of ice and stone.</p>
        <p>This is one of the few places on the Antarctic continent that is not covered in ice. Bare rock and dirt rule here. Utterly devoid of vegetation, this may as well be another planet.</p>
        <p>Indeed, researchers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration think the region offers clues to what Mars once looked like.</p>
        <p>Most of the moisture here comes not from the sky but from the glaciers, which cascade over the tops of the mountains. But unlike their cousins that slip into the sea, the ends of these terrestrial glaciers end abruptly in cliffs, like giant meringues.</p>
        <p>''Why is it that they don't spread out and fill the valleys?'' asks Dr. Erin Pettit, a glaciologist from the University of Washington. ''Temperate glaciers are like molasses or honey, they ooze. Polar glaciers are a lot more rigid,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pettit is trying to understand the specifics of this rigidity and how it affects the behavior of these glaciers.</p>
        <p>For six weeks in November and December, she and a team camped beneath Blood Falls, sleeping in mountain tents and trekking up the Taylor Glacier each day to bore holes in the ice in which to place instruments to measure the strains and stresses in the frozen mass.</p>
        <p>''All glaciers experience a kind of balance,'' Dr. Pettit said. ''But rarely are they perfectly in balance.'' The shapes of glaciers in the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica are formed by the interaction of the ice, the environment, the landscape and the chemicals in the ice itself. ''What I like to understand are the subtle differences in how each glacier behaves,'' she said. ''That's what really fascinates me.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pettit, her long hair braided into a mass of tiny plaits, is 33, but looks a good deal younger. In addition to her research, she has made glaciers into the centerpiece of an unusual educational program. Since 1999, she has been leading groups of high school girls on glaciology field trips in Washington, her home state.</p>
        <p>During these demanding trips, the girls, ages 16 to 18, learn the scientific method, not only how to form a hypothesis but how to test it, as well as mountaineering and wilderness skills. ''I wanted to bring these two things together,'' Dr. Pettit said, ''the intellectual challenge of trying to do science in the field and the physical challenge of living outdoors.''</p>
        <p>While many existing organizations offer excellent programs to teach young people outdoor competence and others offer training in science, Dr. Pettit knew of none that combined both activities and especially not for girls. Through her program, now called Girls on Ice, young women learn to feel at home in the wilderness and to observe nature through the lens of science.</p>
        <p>Lauren Carter, a senior at Ferndale High School north of Seattle, took part in Girls on Ice when she was a freshman. ''I've always wanted to go to Antarctica and this was about the closest I could get,'' she said by phone. ''I had never known that ice could be so interesting.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Carter, who loves science and is planning to major in zoology at Washington State, having a woman as the course instructor was particularly important. ''It made you see that women could be scientists,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For Kelsi Franzen, a senior at Coupeville High School and one of the 2002 Girls on Ice participants, the program opened the door to mountaineering. Although Ms. Franzen had plenty of experience hiking, she had never before tackled mountains. ''Now I climb volcanoes,'' she said. ''Girls on Ice was really the beginning of that.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pettit started the program, which was originally open to all students, at the University of Washington while she was working on her doctorate. The first year, however, only girls applied, despite the program's arduous schedule.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pettit had chosen to take the group to the South Cascade Glacier, one of two glaciers the United States Geological Survey has been studying continuously for half a century.</p>
        <p>Just getting there required a two-day hike on primitive trails; each girl carried her own gear and provisions. ''That single-sex experience was so positive,'' Dr. Pettit said, ''after that I knew I had to find an organization that would let me do it just for them.'' As a public institution the university could not offer a program exclusively for one sex.</p>
        <p>Since 2000 Dr. Pettit has been running the program through the North Cascades Institute, an educational partner of the North Cascades National Park, along with a co-instructor, Michele Koppes, a University of Washington graduate student in glacial geology.</p>
        <p>For many of the program's participants the experience of being just with other women has been crucial to its success. ''If boys were there I think there would have been more of a distraction instead of focusing on the glaciers,'' Ms. Franzen said. ''Having all women definitely allowed us to concentrate on the science.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Franzen, an adventurous young woman, is volunteering this summer on a research voyage to the Seychelles to assist in a study of marine turtles and is considering a double major in environmental studies and journalism when she starts college this year.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Carter, the absence of boys was less important than the presence of women as role models in science. ''They let us design our own experiments and did not tell us what the answers should be. We had to find out for ourselves.''</p>
        <p>In one experiment her group used dye to measure the different layers in the glacier. In another they put flags in the ice so they could observe how the glacier moved in the course of a week.</p>
        <p>One of Dr. Pettit's tasks on the Taylor Glacier is also to determine precisely how the ice is moving. Although she uses Global Positioning System, or G.P.S., readings and a surveyor's theodolite, she also measures crude motion with flags.</p>
        <p>Near the edge of the 30-meter Antarctic ice cliff is a line of black flags planted last year by her colleagues. By next year, Dr. Pettit said, several of them will have fallen over the precipice because the ice migrates continually from the center to the edge.</p>
        <p>Despite that motion, the position of the ice cliff remains much the same as when Robert F. Scott explored the region a century ago. The reason is that as the ice moves toward the edge it is periodically sheared off, or calved. Dr. Pettit will use her data to build a computer model of how and under what conditions such calving occurs.</p>
        <p>Although the glaciers of the Dry Valleys are unique, understanding how they behave has consequences beyond this corner of Antarctica.</p>
        <p>''If they can really nail down how these ice cliffs form it will add to our knowledge of glacial dynamics as a whole,'' said Dr. Karl Kreutz of the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine.</p>
        <p>In Alaska, for example, marine glaciers can also terminate in ice cliffs but are much more unstable and dangerous and cannot be studied so directly. Calving from Alaskan glaciers produces enormous pieces of ice that endanger ships. Dr. Pettit said she hoped her research on calving in the Dry Valleys would shed light on those larger processes.</p>
        <p>Her work on glacial ice cliffs may also add to the understanding of how rock cliffs form, said Dr. Bernard Hallet, a glaciologist who supervises Dr. Pettit's postdoctoral research at the University of Washington.</p>
        <p>''With ice you can study things without having to wait for geological time scales,'' he said. ''What determines the stability of a cliff? How is it that some cliff is 5 meters high and not 30 meters, or 100?'' Dr. Hallet asked.</p>
        <p>The Dry Valley glaciers, he said, provide ''a neat natural experiment to try to determine the kinds of stresses that are going on.''</p>
        <p>''Many of us are geologists by heart, but glaciologists by practice,'' he added, philosophically.</p>
        <p>At an age when many young researchers are focused exclusively on publishing papers and getting academic tenure, Dr. Pettit sees her role as a scientist in a broader social context. ''I love the research, but I also love this kind of teaching,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the managers of the North Cascades Institute realized last year that they could not afford the insurance to continue the Girls on Ice program and are looking for another organization that will be a partner. ''They very much want to resolve the problem, and so do I,'' Dr. Pettit said.</p>
        <p>At the end of the year she will return to the Taylor Glacier to retrieve her data and reset her instruments. Meanwhile, she will spend the summer visiting other science education programs in Alaska. ''For me, it's the balance,'' she said. ''Both the science and the teaching. If I had to do just one of those things, I'd burn out more quickly.''</p>
