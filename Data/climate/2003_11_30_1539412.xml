      <block class="full_text">
        <p>From the first days after Sept. 11, 2001, the fears and unknowns about health and air quality in Lower Manhattan were compounded by the politics that swirl, as always, around the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>An arm of the federal government that is second-guessed and distrusted as perhaps no other had been put in charge of the environmental response. What was in the air and what people in Washington and New York believed about the E.P.A. were immediately intertwined.</p>
        <p>That volatile mixture resurfaced this fall when the E.P.A. inspector general's office released its report on the agency's handling of the crisis. The report described an agency that struggled mightily to meet a challenge it had never been intended to face, using tools and standards that were sometimes inadequate to the task.</p>
        <p>But the inspector general, Nikki L. Tinsley, also directly addressed what has become an even more grave crisis for the agency -- gnawing public cynicism and doubt about its performance after the attack. She concluded that administrators, at a crucial moment on Sept. 18, 2001, went beyond what they knew about the effects of the World Trade Center towers' collapse.</p>
        <p>On the basis of tests for asbestos, which had been mostly reassuring, they made a blanket pronouncement that the air was safe to breathe. And the White House, the report said, at least indirectly influenced the wording of some of that statement and others by removing cautionary language from agency news releases. Later, broader tests for things like PCB's and dioxins largely validated the statement of air safety, the report said. But for the E.P.A. and its relationship with New Yorkers, many of whom had mistrusted the first reassurances, it was too late. A corrosion of trust had begun.</p>
        <p>Congressman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat whose district includes ground zero, said after the report came out that people would die because of what he saw as collusion between the E.P.A. and the White House. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, also a Democrat, said she suspected a conspiracy to withhold the truth from New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>But an examination of the inspector general's report, along with interviews with its authors and the scientists in and out of government who contributed to its conclusions, shows it to be a much more complex and moderate document than either critics or supporters would portray it. Like so much else in the still unfolding environmental story of 9/11, the report is part of a fabric of things, some of which can be determined and many more that remain, two years out, deeply ambiguous or unknown.</p>
        <p>The report, in fact, does not conclude that the E.P.A. was wrong in saying, one week after the attack, that the air in Lower Manhattan was ''safe to breathe,'' but only that the scientific underpinning was inadequate, at that moment, for such a broad generalization. Nonetheless, former and current E.P.A. officials and independent scientists now say the declaration was a failure that could have lasting consequences in the next crisis, when health and safety information might save or cost lives.</p>
        <p>The report suggests that the E.P.A. should take on a greater role in dealing with indoor air -- a huge issue in Lower Manhattan then and now -- but it omits much discussion of the fact that the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was considered the lead government agency on New York's indoor spaces and was at the forefront of instructing residents how to clean up their apartments, homes and businesses.</p>
        <p>White House influence might not, in the end, have been that meaningful, given the surge of televised interviews, radio announcements and other efforts undertaken over those days, mostly from the E.P.A.'s New York office. White House coordination in environmental communications was also standard procedure, long predating the Bush administration, and some squabbles that did erupt during the crisis were compounded by personality conflicts among mid-level public information officers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tinsley, the inspector general, said in an interview that too much attention had been paid to the report's criticisms and not enough to the constructive suggestions that she says are its main thrust.</p>
        <p>''We looked at a lot of things and we only came up with those very few things that we talked about -- and what that says is that the E.P.A. did a really good job,'' she said. ''I don't think you can read five pages in that report without us talking about the fact that it was an unprecedented thing.''</p>
        <p>Senator Clinton -- who used Ms. Tinsley's report as justification to put a temporary hold on the appointment of former Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah as the new E.P.A. administrator -- also appears to have moderated her stand. She said in an interview that the quality of judgment during the crisis was the real issue and that one need not impute evil motives to find fault. Other elected officials, including Mr. Nadler, have not backed down.</p>
        <p>One thing, though, is agreed upon across the political spectrum: the public was ready and willing to believe the worst. Surveys show that New Yorkers do not think they were told the whole truth. Some people say the pressure to reopen Wall Street and get the city back on its feet created a desire -- perhaps deliberate and overt, perhaps in other ways inadvertent and subconscious -- to deliver reassurance.</p>
        <p>Other scientists and government officials say the breakdown of credibility is another consequence of the fiercely partisan fighting that has flourished in the Bush administration, where environmentalists and industry advocates battle over every clause and semicolon of regulation.</p>
        <p>After two years, much is known about the effects of 9/11. People under pressure did make mistakes in a time of chaos and fundamental ambiguity. Thousands of people who worked or volunteered at ground zero are still sick with respiratory ailments, though the personal decision by many not to wear respirators, physicians say, must be considered the prime factor.</p>
        <p>And much remains unknown, a fact crystallized this fall by the opening of the World Trade Center Health Registry, which is only now beginning a multiyear effort to compile information about health exposures and long-term consequences.</p>
        <p>One Moment of Reassurance</p>
        <p>Much of the furor over the E.P.A. centers on the declaration on Sept. 18, 2001, by Christie Whitman, then the administrator of the E.P.A., that the ''air is safe to breathe.''</p>
        <p>The inspector general concluded that the statement had arisen through an interpretation of data coordinated outside the E.P.A. by an executive-branch information agency, the Council on Environmental Quality. Some cautionary language and scientific caveats were edited out of E.P.A. news releases, the inspector general said.</p>
        <p>But the E.P.A. was also an active participant in formulating the ''safe to breathe'' statement long before the final wording was settled on in cooperation with the White House. And some people have regrets about that.</p>
        <p>''In hindsight, we should have qualified the statements by saying that this was our best judgment given the data that we had,'' said Linda J. Fisher, who was deputy administrator at the time and has since left the agency. ''We didn't think of adding those words, but it wasn't that they were taken out by anybody -- people wanted to know what E.P.A. thought about air quality. We looked at the data, and we gave them our best sense, and our best sense has proven true.''</p>
        <p>But there is ample evidence of confusion. Air pollution has traditionally been assessed for its effects over long periods of time, not for short bursts. So, according to the report and E.P.A. scientists, the government improvised -- using occupational safety standards at first, later switching to E.P.A. standards that were more strict.</p>
        <p>And often, because of the limits of those standards, E.P.A. scientists had to make leaps of intuition. If the pollution being measured was so low that it would be deemed safe for someone breathing it for a long time, the scientists reasoned, then it must be safe for shorter periods even if no exact standards were in place to prove that scientifically.</p>
        <p>An analysis of news media coverage during the weeks after the attack also suggests that many of those nuanced scientific wrinkles were being openly discussed by the E.P.A. The inspector general's report focused on several news releases. But there was a flood of information being made public.</p>
        <p>Between Sept. 13 and early October 2001, according to an examination of newspaper reports, E.P.A. officials were quoted almost daily going far beyond Mrs. Whitman's simple statement. The tests beyond ground zero were favorable, they said, but workers at ground zero should wear protection. Some asbestos had been found in bulk samples on the ground, but very little in the air. People with special health concerns should be cautious.</p>
        <p>And the reassuring voices were not solely from the federal government.</p>
        <p>''We have found no levels of asbestos or any pollutants that raise concern,'' a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection said on Sept. 16.</p>
        <p>But the E.P.A.'s words, some health experts say, did have consequences. ''I have patients who went back to work because their employers said they had to, and the basis of that was that the E.P.A. said the air was safe,'' said Dr. Stephen M. Levin, medical director of the Irving J. Selikoff Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>''The statement as it appeared was a blanket statement -- that, I think, was a real failure when it comes to communicating acute conditions to the public, and it had consequences.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Levin, who has treated more 9/11 patients than probably any other physician, said he still did not think there would be many long-term health consequences. But the short-term ones are nasty and lingering, and at least a few of those cases, he said, are a result of what people heard, or thought they heard, from the E.P.A. Mount Sinai has examined more than 8,000 people, many of whom still have persistent health problems like asthma, sinusitis and reactive airway disease, which makes sufferers hypersensitive to irritants in the air.</p>
        <p>Whether to Test Apartments</p>
        <p>How much dust and debris from the World Trade Center blew into nearby offices and apartment buildings is one of the most persistent questions of 9/11's aftermath. Some politicians and health experts say the E.P.A.'s decision not to institute a widespread indoor testing program means that hard answers remain unknowable.</p>
        <p>Other health experts, including New York City's health commissioner, Thomas R. Frieden, say that the evidence of any remaining indoor contamination in New York is minuscule, and that continuing calls for a widespread professional cleanup program constitute a ''disservice to the public.''</p>
        <p>The inspector general herself concluded only that the E.P.A. could have done more. The agency violated no procedures and complied with the applicable laws and regulations, she concluded.</p>
        <p>But the E.P.A.'s public message about indoor spaces, the inspector general said, was subject to influence from outside the agency. A draft news release contained the suggestion that New Yorkers with dust-contaminated homes should have their apartments professionally cleaned, but in the final version that language was gone.</p>
        <p>White House and E.P.A. officials concede that the sentence was deleted. But news releases were hardly the only source of information. E.P.A. officials in New York, for example, were quoted during that same period saying that people with lots of dust probably should get a professional cleaning.</p>
        <p>Officials at the city health department, by contrast, were going out of their way to say it was probably not necessary to hire a professional. Wet-mopping and vacuuming would suffice, they said.</p>
        <p>Behind the Message</p>
        <p>The health department has been largely spared attack for giving that advice. And Dr. Frieden -- who took over as health commissioner in 2002 -- said that the city's message had been right. Ordinary residents, he said, including some senior health department officials who cleaned up their own apartments downtown, had all the tools to do what a professional would have.</p>
        <p>''Testing of apartments found no high levels of contamination in the air and in almost all found no high levels of asbestos,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other scientists and health experts say the focus on indoor air takes the focus off what some believe will ultimately emerge as the real scandal of 9/11, the fact that wearing a respirator at ground zero was voluntary.</p>
        <p>At the Pentagon, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration took an enforcement role in protecting workers. In New York, OSHA was only in advisory mode, which meant that even in October and November, when the rescue efforts were long over, no one could walk through the site and kick people out for not wearing respiratory protection. Thousands of people became ill from working at the site.</p>
        <p>Coordination of the government's environmental message -- whether on routine news or in a crisis -- is nothing new. But the inspector general's report and interviews with scientists and politicians reveal little evidence that the coordination after 9/11 went very high up in the Bush White House.</p>
        <p>News releases were coordinated by the Council on Environmental Quality, an obscure office housed in a row house a block off Pennsylvania Avenue. And within the council, much of the debate over news release language, according to the report and supporting documents released by the inspector general, centered on two mid-level public information officers, neither of whom had been at his or her job longer than six months.</p>
        <p>That relationship, between Tina Kreisher, then an associate administrator and chief spokeswoman at the E.P.A., and Sam Thernstrom, then the council's communications director, became a factor in how the information flowed during the crisis, according to documents and interviews.</p>
        <p>Things were strained from the beginning, according to the inspector general's inquiry. One senior E.P.A. official, according to the inspector general's documents, said that discussions about news releases blew up into ''screaming telephone calls'' between Ms. Kreisher and Mr. Thernstrom.</p>
        <p>But here, too, things are perhaps not so black and white as either side would portray them.</p>
        <p>In Albany, where Mr. Thernstrom worked in Gov. George E. Pataki's administration as a public information officer for the Department of Environmental Conservation before going to Washington, he had a reputation as an aggressive and sometimes abrasive advocate. But some people who worked with him also described him as a team player who generally did not act without authorization from superiors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thernstrom, who now works at the American Enterprise Institute as an environmental scholar and researcher, would not be interviewed. Ms. Kreisher, now a speechwriter at the Department of the Interior, declined to be interviewed in detail.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, James L. Connaughton, said that 9/11 was different primarily in that a larger and more diverse group of people was contributing information. Daily conference calls, which ultimately led to the E.P.A.'s news releases, often included outside scientists, other federal agency representatives and New York City environmental and health officials. He said the additional contributions perhaps elevated, at least at first, the council's role as an information clearinghouse for news releases.</p>
        <p>Other past and present environmental regulators say that the E.P.A. has generally had the last word in its own news releases. The inspector general's report quotes several E.P.A. officials saying that they felt they'd lost ''ownership'' of news statements during the crisis.</p>
        <p>But recent history also played a part in how that role was perceived.</p>
        <p>Long before 9/11, according to former and present E.P.A. officials and independent public health experts, the Bush White House had developed a reputation for second-guessing its own environmental appointees, notably Mrs. Whitman.</p>
        <p>Since the Bush administration took office, E.P.A. employees have complained about political interference. Just this past June, for example, E.P.A. employees leaked a memo showing how the White House had tried to play down scientific consensus on global warming.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. employees also say the White House has interfered with the regulatory process of determining the amount of mercury that can be released by power plants, by editing lines into reports and testimony de-emphasizing power plants as a source of mercury in the environment.</p>
