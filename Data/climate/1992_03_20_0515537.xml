        <p>In the end it was not enough to win, but Paul E. Tsongas deserves to be remembered for a remarkable achievement in the television age. He based a political campaign on a book that he wrote himself.</p>
        <p>Few voters read it, of course, but the mere existence of "A Call to Economic Arms" gave Mr. Tsongas credibility and helped inspire a battle of the books. He and Gov.

        <p>In the end it was not enough to win, but Paul E. Tsongas deserves to be remembered for a remarkable achievement in the television age. He based a political campaign on a book that he wrote himself.</p>
        <p>Few voters read it, of course, but the mere existence of "A Call to Economic Arms" gave Mr. Tsongas credibility and helped inspire a battle of the books. He and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas took their campaigns to the reference desk of local libraries in New Hampshire, where voters could compare Mr. Tsongas's work with Mr. Clinton's "A Plan for America's Future."</p>
        <p>Both he and Mr. Clinton addressed a classic literary theme, the American dream, with similar plots: Nation gets dream, nation loses dream, nation gets five-point plan to get back dream. Both introduced heroic figures: Mr. Clinton's New Covenant, Mr. Tsongas' New American Mandate. But Mr. Tsongas was more thorough in character development -- maybe too thorough. A reader could come away with a good idea of why his campaign went the way it did.</p>
        <p>There was no mistaking his sincerity and moral conviction, the qualities that initially appealed to many voters. Mr. Tsongas admirably discussed unpopular ideas like higher gasoline taxes or lower Social Security benefits for the wealthy.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, unpopular ideas that sound reasonable in a book do not fare well on 30-second commercials. Mr. Clinton demonstrated this in commercials showing a copy of "A Call to Economic Arms" and flipping through its pages. Underlined words appeared on the screen, complete with page citations, a rare and apparently successful use of footnotes on television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tsongas might have benefited if voters had bothered to read both candidates' books, because they would have seen Mr. Clinton's penchant for urging bold action without actually offending anyone. But they would have noticed another difference, too. If Mr. Clinton at his worst was an unprincipled glad-hander, Mr. Tsongas was a messianic pedant.</p>
        <p>This preachy side of Mr. Tsongas was probably one of the chief reasons that his campaign eventually faltered. It came out only gradually on television, but it was obvious long ago to anyone who read the 86-page book.  Orders of Narrator</p>
        <p>The omniscient narrator incessantly issued orders ("must" was a favorite word) and proclaimed sweeping truths. He knew everything from the most beautiful place on earth (Alaska) to the greatest mystery in climatology (his discussion of global warming began, "The issues here are well known.").</p>
        <p>His plan for reorganizing American business was particularly revealing. There was nothing unusual about Mr. Tsongas's enthusiasm for a national industrial policy -- although he and the other Democratic candidates had trouble planning their own schedules more than a day in advance, none of them shied from plotting the course of entire industries through the end of the century. But Mr. Tsongas' attitude was singularly confident.</p>
        <p>"Take a deep breath," Mr. Tsongas warned the believers in laissez-faire economics. "It's a brave new world out there. Adam Smith was a marvelous man but he wouldn't know a superconductor or memory chip if he tripped over one."</p>
        <p>For an economic planner to dismiss Adam Smith in one sentence is a little like a rocket engineer casually pooh-poohing the laws of gravity because Isaac Newton would not know a solid-fuel booster if it landed on his head. Mr. Tsongas elevated this year's political discourse, but his own discourse might have benefited from a touch of self-doubt. "The Wealth of Nations" is going to stay in print a lot longer than "A Call to Economic Arms."</p>
