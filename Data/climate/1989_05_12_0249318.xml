        <p>LEAD: In an important switch, the White House told American negotiators in Geneva tonight to lead the way toward an international treaty to control global warming.</p>
        <p>In an important switch, the White House told American negotiators in Geneva tonight to lead the way toward an international treaty to control global warming.</p>
        <p>The development followed widely published reports that the White House staff, concerned about the treaty's costs and technological requirements, was resisting calls from the State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency that the United States take such a lead.</p>
        <p>In an interview tonight John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, denied that there had been resistance to the idea. But a Bush Administration official acknowledged that the initial instructions to the American delegation at Geneva, where a United Nations conference on global warming is under way, had made no reference to any Washington initiative.</p>
        <p>The fresh instructions came in a telegram from Mr. Sununu calling for a ''global warming workshop'' to be held in the United States this fall.</p>
        <p>The workshop would prepare analyses of legal, scientific, economic and social issues that must be resolved to reach agreement on a treaty to deal with a growing scientific consensus: that gases resulting from industrial and other human activity are trapping heat from the sun and will cause the earth's surface to warm by 3 to 9 degrees by the middle of the next century. This so-called greenhouse effect, many scientists believe, portends immense environmental consequences.</p>
        <p>In his telegram Mr. Sununu directed the American delegation to take a leading role in planning the workshop, whose studies would be used to develop ''full international consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formal treaty negotiating process.''</p>
        <p>In the interview tonight, Mr. Sununu said President Bush was optimistic that an agreement on the workshop would be reached Friday and was prepared to send congratulations to participants at the Geneva meeting.</p>
        <p>''This is the thing we were hoping to get,'' the chief of staff said, but he added, ''It is important that we make sure we deal with the problem in a reasoned scientific and technical way.'' Reasons for the Switch</p>
        <p>There were two reasons for the turnaround by the White House, an Administration official said. One was that the progress of the Geneva meeting had been so encouraging that the delegation thought more could be accomplished with a greater American role.</p>
        <p>The other reason, the official said, was this week's Congressional and public criticism that Mr. Bush was failing to exercise the leadership on global warming that he promised in his Presidential campaign last year.</p>
        <p>That criticism followed a call Monday by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain for a convention on climate changes that might be caused by global warming, a proposal to which the United States had no specific response. It also followed published reports that the White House staff was insisting on a go-slow approach. Only Monday, a scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration testified that the White House budget office had softened his testimony prepared for Congress on the problems of the greenhouse effect. Warning by Sununu</p>
        <p>In his telegram to the delegation, which is headed by Assistant Secretary of State Frederick Bernthal, Mr. Sununu urged ''strongest efforts'' to persuade other nations to attend the workship in the United States this fall. ''The scope and importance of this issue are so great that it is essential for the U.S. to exercise a leadership role,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he warned that because ''the size of the potential problem is so large, improper or ill-advised actions could have enormous unintended environmental, economic and social consequences.'' It was concern about these consequences that had led the White House staff to its position on the treaty, against the urging of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Sununu told the delegation that preparations for a treaty had to take the interests of developing countries into account.</p>
        <p>Economists have pointed out that countries just beginning the industrialization process cannot afford, and do not have the technical capability to develop, the kind of pollution control measures that would be required to come to grips with global warming. There is thus wide agreement that the industrialized nations will have to transfer the necessary technology to the developing nations if they are to be enlisted in the effort.</p>
