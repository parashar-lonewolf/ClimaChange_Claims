        <p>LEAD: WHEN President Bush steps up to a green marble podium here Monday to address the United Nations General Assembly, his audience will be listening attentively for signs that the United States now wholeheartedly backs a stronger role for the organization in maintaining peace and resolving problems in the world.</p>
        <p>WHEN President Bush steps up to a green marble podium here Monday to address the United Nations General Assembly, his audience will be listening attentively for signs that the United States now wholeheartedly backs a stronger role for the organization in maintaining peace and resolving problems in the world.</p>
        <p>The 44th General Assembly is convening in an atmosphere of optimism, with many delegates saying that the easing in East-West tensions has finally created the conditions needed for the United Nations to become something close to what its founders envisaged.</p>
        <p>But peace is expensive, and economic conditions may not be so favorable. An important question will be how firm a commitment President Bush can give that the United States, under severe budgetary restraints, will pay its share of peacekeeping and other operations.</p>
        <p>A major reason for believing the time is ripe for the United Nations to become more effective is the change in Moscow's attitude toward the organization over the last couple of years. In that period, as other members have bowed to Western pressure to resist using conflicts to further their own ideological ends, the Soviet Union has revealed a new willingness to work with the United States and the other permanent Security Council members to resolve conflicts and develop joint approaches to common problems like global warming.</p>
        <p>The change has strengthened the ability of the United Nations to help resolve bitter conflicts in Afghanistan, Namibia, the Persian Gulf and Central America. In none of these conflicts is a full settlement in place. But United Nations negotiators played critical roles in helping the Soviet Union withdraw from Afghanistan and in bringing about a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. They are trying to help Namibia move toward independence and Central America carry out regional peace accords. Efforts are also being made to help extinguish conflicts in Cambodia, the Western Sahara, the Sudan and Ethiopia.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, the number of blue-helmeted United Nations peacekeeping soldiers has risen by one-third, to about 14,000, as new forces were dispatched to Afghanistan, the gulf war zone, Namibia and are now planned for Central America. Meanwhile, the cost of such operations has nearly tripled, to an estimated $700 million this year, with the United States being assessed 30 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>If forces are sent to Cambodia and other areas in the next few years, the peace bill could be higher still.</p>
        <p>''The assistance of the organization is being sought as never before in its history,'' Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in his latest report on the organization's activities. ''There is weariness of wars and there is recognition of their futility.''</p>
        <p>Money is not the only limitation on the peacemaking powers of the United Nations. The organization has had its greatest influence in places where antagonists were looking for a face-saving way out and the great powers could bring influence to bear, as in Afghanistan, Central America and Namibia. Civil wars in Cambodia, Ethiopia, the Sudan and the Western Sahara, where strong ethnic tensions are at play, are proving more difficult to resolve.</p>
        <p>When he spoke before the General Assembly last year, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed ways to strengthen the organization in the 1990's, including an increased role in environmental protection and more diplomacy by the Security Council to nip disputes in the bud. Prof. Thomas M. Franck of New York University Law School, an expert on the United Nations, said the Soviet proposals represented ''an exceptional opportunity that could give the United Nations a new lease of life'' if the detente continues.</p>
        <p>United Nations delegates hope that President Bush expresses renewed American faith in the United Nations in his speech tomorrow.</p>
        <p>In the Reagan years, United States antagonism grew toward the United Nations, viewed as a place where radicals sought to promote their statist views of the world and trample on personal freedoms. By encouraging Congress to withhold financing from the United Nations, the Reagan Administration turned the United States into the organization's biggest debtor, while still seeking to exercise its control.</p>
        <p>But now President Bush has signaled a change of tack, asking Congress to pay the full American share this year and start repaying arrears. But while Congress is expected to fulfill his first request, there is little chance it will repay any debt.</p>
        <p>Today the United States owes the United Nations $491 million in unpaid regular budget contributions, or two-thirds of all outstanding dues, as well as $254 million for peacekeeping operations to which it gave political support but failed to find the money for when the bills came in. For years, Washington scolded Moscow for its failure to pay, but the Soviet Union is now paying its back dues, furthering pressure on the United States.</p>
        <p>There are serious doubts whether the United Nations can begin any new peacekeeping operations without some guarantee of stronger American financial support, even though the need for them is likely to increase. President Bush's speech could give some clues on how likely those prospects are.</p>
