        <p>For the recent immigrants studying English at Liberty High School in Chelsea, new vocabulary words might include ''oxygen deprivation'' and ''emergency evacuation.'' Over the last two years, students have been hustled out of the school 10 times when toxic fumes or high temperatures made the five-story building at 18th Street and Eighth Avenue unbearable.</p>
        <p>Liberty has 475 students whose limited English skills prevent them from enrolling in the system's regular high schools. It has been undergoing a $9 million modernization over the last five years, with most of the work being done while classes are in session. While students and teachers say that noisy, dusty construction work has made learning difficult, the faulty ventilation system is the most intolerable problem.</p>

        <p>For the recent immigrants studying English at Liberty High School in Chelsea, new vocabulary words might include ''oxygen deprivation'' and ''emergency evacuation.'' Over the last two years, students have been hustled out of the school 10 times when toxic fumes or high temperatures made the five-story building at 18th Street and Eighth Avenue unbearable.</p>
        <p>Liberty has 475 students whose limited English skills prevent them from enrolling in the system's regular high schools. It has been undergoing a $9 million modernization over the last five years, with most of the work being done while classes are in session. While students and teachers say that noisy, dusty construction work has made learning difficult, the faulty ventilation system is the most intolerable problem.</p>
        <p>''Many of our kids complain of headaches, fatigue and respiratory problems,'' said Bruce Schnur, principal of the school, which was built as a stable in the 19th century and later converted into a factory. ''I, for one, have always had a phenomenal attendance record, but last year I was out three times with throat problems.''</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday, three dozen teachers and union officials, some wearing gas masks, rallied in front of the school to dramatize what they say is the School Construction Authority's inability to correct ventilation problems that leave some rooms too hot, some too cold and others with elevated levels of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''If you put 15 kids in a room, you can really feel the lack of oxygen,'' said Andrew Pearl, an English teacher. ''It gets pretty ripe-smelling in there.''</p>
        <p>Chris Proctor, an industrial hygienist retained by the teachers union, says that air containing dangerously high levels of carbon dioxide is recirculated through many of the school's windowless interior rooms. In other rooms, she added, total air flow is just 10 percent of the industry standard.</p>
        <p>Union officials say the School Construction Authority has repeatedly botched the renovation work and has failed to meet deadlines on the project. But Earl Brown, a spokesman for the authority, says that while the union's frustrations are valid, its accusations of mismanagement are not.</p>
        <p>He conceded that some of the air-conditioning problems occurred after contractors dropped a huge chilling unit during installation, but said that the entire system should be repaired within the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>As school let out last Tuesday afternoon, a dozen students stood on the sidewalk looking awestruck as their teachers waved placards and chanted slogans like, ''Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to suffocate.''</p>
        <p>Ruducha Krzysztof, a 15-year-old from Poland, eyed the demonstration with amusement. Asked whether the school's ventilation system made learning difficult, Ruducha sighed. ''Air is not problem,'' he said. ''English language is bigger problem.''</p>
