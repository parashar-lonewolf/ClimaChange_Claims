        <p>Amid the rolling hills of northeastern Wyoming, a towering five-story plant is using heat and pressure to turn the low-grade coal that abounds here in the 9,700-square-mile Powder River Basin into high-quality fuel -- and, in the process, make that coal less a hazard to the environment.</p>
        <p>The $60 million experiment by KFx Inc., a small company that has received  help and money from some giants of the energy industry, is in the forefront of a broad effort to extend the life span of one of the world's first, most widely used fuels.</p>
        <p>In the debates over pollution and global warming, coal has been labeled a prime villain. Coal has long been under assault as a leading contributor to smog and acid rain.  And it could be dealt a severe blow if the proposals to cut carbon dioxide emissions made at the recent talks on global warming in Kyoto, Japan, are eventually adopted.</p>
        <p>Even in the face of all that, though, some in the coal industry remain decidedly bullish. Coal, they argue, is too deeply entrenched to allow any quick, drastic changes. After all, coal-fired plants produce fully 57 percent of this nation's electricity.</p>
        <p>And on the pollution front, coal is rapidly cleaning up its act. Many plants have been upgraded with expensive pollution controls, and new processes -- like those KFx is using -- promise to cut pollution further. And part of the process has the potential to cut carbon dioxide as well.</p>
        <p>In other words, the world may be stuck with coal at least for a while, but that may not be the disaster it might appear.</p>
        <p>Many utilities regard coal plants as their crown jewels. As the cheapest, most reliable source of electricity, these plants, which now often run far below capacity, are expected to play a sizable role in bringing rates down as the industry deregulates.</p>
        <p>Coal-fired plants could, in theory, be converted to use some other fuel, but that would be prohibitively expensive. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents most of the nation's investor-owned utilities, has estimated that it would cost close to $30 billion to convert coal plants to use natural gas, which produces less pollution and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Cleaner fuels, like natural gas, will surely make inroads, but even if utilities are forced to stop using coal, it is doubtful that enough natural gas could be brought into production to displace coal in the near future.</p>
        <p>In addition, any big shift would cost tens of thousands of jobs, a possibility that seems remote any time soon, considering the political influence of the highly unionized coal industry. Britain learned this lesson recently, putting a halt to issuing new permits for natural-gas-fired plants, whose construction was surging, while it determines the impact on its battered coal industry.</p>
        <p>In developing countries, coal's future seems even more solid. Coal is expected to merely hold its own in the United States, with the Energy Department predicting 1 percent annual growth through 2015. But China and India, knowing that their own coal is cheap and plentiful enough to last for centuries, plan to build hundreds of coal-fired plants.</p>
        <p>In the developing world, the Energy Department predicts, coal use will rise about 3.3 percent a year though 2015, nearly doubling the 2.2 billion tons those nations burned in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Coal is going to be used especially by countries that have lots of it,'' said Robert H. Gentile, an Assistant Energy Secretary in the Bush Administration and now an executive with KFx.</p>
        <p>Nations like China, India and Pakistan argued in Kyoto that they should not have their coal use limited because it represents the cheapest way to supply their rapidly growing demand for energy.</p>
        <p>They want nations like the United States, which has just 4 percent of the world's population but produces about a fifth of its carbon dioxide, to take the first steps to cut emissions.</p>
        <p>Under the Kyoto agreement, industrialized nations would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. The United States would be required to cut them 7 percent from 2008 through 2012.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the coal and utility industries do not have their heads in the sand. They fully understand that concern over global warming is bound to intensify.</p>
        <p>That is why KFx and similar ventures are trying to go beyond cutting pollution to try to address concerns on global warming.</p>
        <p>After some setbacks, KFx restarted its plant several weeks ago, taking coal from the local mines here and heating it to about 725 degrees under intense pressure to remove almost all the water. This process upgrades the coal, enabling utilities to burn about half as much to get the same amount of electricity -- and cut pollution and carbon dioxide emissions in the process.</p>
        <p>The plant, built at a cost of $40 million, is expected to process 500,000 tons a year of this coal, which the company calls K-fuel.</p>
        <p>The effort is the brainchild of a group of entrepreneurs led by Ted Venners and his brother John. After making a small fortune in Powder River Basin coal in the 1970's, they decided to risk everything and invest $20 million in the 1980's in this process, developed by an inventor named Edward Koppelman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koppelman, who also developed the mechanism that de-ices airplanes, found after years of trial and error that by careful control of time, heat and pressure, the efficiency of coal could be increased.</p>
        <p>The Venners stand to profit handsomely if their gamble pays off -- if, that is, they can convince utilities in the East and Midwest that they can cut pollution and carbon dioxide and increase plant efficiency by paying top dollar for KFx's upgraded coal.</p>
        <p>KFx's coal matches the quality of the higher-grade coal mined in the East. But the higher-sulfur Eastern coal, which has a considerably greater energy output in terms of B.T.U.'s, sells for $18 to $25 a ton, while Powder River Basin coal sells for as little as $3. After KFx processes it, it hopes to sell its fuel for as much as the Eastern coal.</p>
        <p>The KFx process, though, reduces nitrogen oxides by about half and sulfur by up to 20 percent, making it attractive to utilities, which are under pressure to cut these emissions.  Powder River Basin coal is already a low-sulfur coal, but the KFx process reduces the sulfur even more, making it far cleaner than Eastern coal.</p>
        <p>It can also have an impact, though a more limited one, on global warming. The process has the potential to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about 6 percent, even allowing for the coal used to create the upgraded fuel, since less coal is needed to produce the same amount of energy.</p>
        <p>The initial investors in KFx persuaded the Thermo Ecotek Corporation, a unit of Thermo Electron, a  Waltham, Mass., company that specializes in bringing new technology to market, to invest $60 million.</p>
        <p>Also, the Kennecott Energy and Coal Company, a unit of the RTZ-CRA Group of Britain that has become a leading producer of coal, spending about $1 billion since 1990 to buy up reserves in the United States, has provided technical aid.</p>
        <p>Kennecott will also help finance the building of plants using the KFx process if it proves viable.</p>
        <p>Customers are starting to appear. American Electric Power, a big coal-burning utility that serves 2.9 million customers in seven states in the East and Midwest, has committed itself to buy 167,000 tons a year from KFx.</p>
        <p>For American Electric, that is a drop in the coal bucket. As the nation's largest purchaser of coal, it buys about 58 million tons annually. Of that, about 10 million tons is lower-grade coal from the Powder River Basin and other mines in the West, and it wants to see if it would be economical to use the KFx fuel and to what extent it would cut pollution and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Even if controls are put on carbon dioxide, said Charles A. Ebotino Jr., the utility's senior vice president for fuel supply, ''coal is going to be a large piece of the action.''</p>
        <p>At the KFx plant, things did not start off smoothly. A fire a year ago forced it to shut for repairs. An error by an engineer led to months of further delay and added cost.</p>
        <p>The Venners, however, remain undaunted, convinced that the utility and coal industries will have to try out new technology.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a mixed bag of solutions,'' said Ted Venners, KFx's chairman. KFx's method for cleaning up coal before it is burned is only one of four basic approaches.</p>
        <p>One process now becoming widespread is to suspend crushed coal on a jet of air and mix it with limestone; this cuts emissions of sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain. This method also means the fuel burns more efficiently, reducing overall emissions.</p>
        <p>The most common approach, though, is to treat the emissions after the coal is burned with expensive scrubbers to cut down on sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions.</p>
        <p>There have also been efforts at coal gasification, in which coal is turned into a gas similar to natural gas. This gas is then used to run power plants. So far, however, the output of electricity is very small. Such approaches should increasingly come into play as utilities do all they can to keep their coal-fired capacity.</p>
        <p>Just a few miles from the KFx plant is the Wyodak power plant, a prime example of why utilities are reluctant to phase out coal.</p>
        <p>About 90 tons of coal, extracted from a strip mine next to the plant, are burned hourly to produce some of the nation's cheapest electricity.</p>
        <p>The coal, often selling for less than $3 a ton and easily mined by huge power shovels, is expected to remain the backbone of many of the nation's power plants for decades to come.</p>
        <p>The Wyodak plant is one of many owned by Pacificorp, a huge utility in Portland, Ore., that transmits power throughout the Northwest.</p>
        <p>Pacificorp has $4.6 billion invested in its coal-fired plants. They produce power at an average of about 1.5 cents a kilowatt hour, one of the lowest levels in the nation.</p>
        <p>''We work very hard to keep our costs low,'' said William Edmonds, a regional affairs administrator for the utility. ''We operate our coal-fired plants at high capacity.''</p>
        <p>With deregulation opening major markets like California to competition, Pacificorp has geared up to be a big supplier of low-cost power. And coal is a vital part of its strategy.</p>
        <p>It is such powerful forces that give Ted Venners the will to persevere in an industry that some perceive as on the way to extinction.</p>
        <p>Driving his big Chevrolet truck along the highway on the way to the plant, he pointed to the rolling hills and said: ''There's enough coal there for 200 to 300 years. It's so cheap to take it out of the ground.''</p>
