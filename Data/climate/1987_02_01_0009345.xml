        <p>LEAD: AS major snowstorms slammed into Long Island late last month, many Long Islanders were probably asking themselves, ''Why me?'' The answer is not in our stars, but in our geography.</p>
        <p>AS major snowstorms slammed into Long Island late last month, many Long Islanders were probably asking themselves, ''Why me?'' The answer is not in our stars, but in our geography.</p>
        <p>Long Island is in the middle of the path of the classic nor'easter, winter storms originating in the Gulf of Mexico that surge northeast up the coast. When looking at the weather pattern for Long Island, said Roberto Tirado, weatherman for Cablevision News 12, ''You're really looking at a New England forecast.''</p>
        <p>The water surrounding Long Island is a mixed blessing in weather. It acts as a moderating influence because its constant temperature of 35 to 40 degrees warms up any Arctic blasts that might be sliding by. However, a storm mass hugging the coast as it moves up from the Gulf to New York also accumulates moisture from ocean water vapor, increasing the amount of potential rain or snow that may get dumped on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Another disadvantage of being surrounded by water is that it can add to a storm's wallop. Dr. Donald L. Gilman, who heads the weather prediction section of the National Weather Services Climate Analysis Center in Washington, said in a telephone interview that ''because the water off the coast is warm, there's a kind of water battleground, where you're getting water vapor pumped into the air over the warm water, and cold air coming out over the warm water and getting heated quite rapidly and destabilized.''</p>
        <p>''That helps give an extra kick to the storms, makes them more energetic in general, windier,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If the storm pattern that shook the Island had moved farther east over the ocean, that would have dissipated its impact. However, the storm paths that gave Long Islanders last week's memories hugged the coast, putting the Island directly in its way and nearby inland regions safely out on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>According to Bob Stalker, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service post in Rockefeller Plaza, when Long Island was being dumped on last Monday by six inches of snow, ''If you went into northwest New Jersey, you barely had a trace of snow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stalker said that, on the average, Long Islanders actually experience more pleasant weather than do inland neighbors, since ocean warmth melts many potential blizzards into less bothersome rain.</p>
        <p>''Along the coast generally you get these snow-rain mixes, so you're cutting down on your snow amount,'' he said, adding that, though precipitation is higher along the coast, ''you can get one inch of rain along the coast, one inch of precipitation, if it falls in the form of snow inland, is the equivalent of 10 inches of snow.''</p>
        <p>The hurricanes that buffet Long Island in the summer originate in the tropics. Snowstorms, Mr. Stalker said, ''can originate in the tropics but they can originate literally anyplace else.''</p>
        <p>The Jan. 22 and Jan. 26 storms were currents moving in from Texas that picked up moisture in the Gulf area and turned northeast to flow up the coast. Having once passed Long Island, such storms continue up the coastal water of Maine to the Canadian maritimes.</p>
        <p>''It really doesn't become a real major storm until it gets up the Canadian Maritimes,'' Mr. Stalker said. There, ''you get major, major snow, two feet of snow, winds where you simply can't walk outside during a storm.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, he said, the nor'easter heads out over the North Atlantic, where it may exhaust itself. If the storm clouds reach a high enough altitude to avoid warmer currents, say 20,000 to 30,000 feet up, and meet strong easterly winds, they are sometimes pushed into Europe, to drop more snow.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has experienced the mild weather of the West Coast, where snow is uncommon even as far north as British Columbia, may wonder why the East gets socked with snow while the West gets rain. Said Dr. Gilman: ''Most West Coast weather comes directly in from the Pacific, and, while that may give them storms, it tends to make it very difficult to snow, or to get really severe cold waves. That's not impossible, but you have to have a shifting of upper-level winds to bring the weather more straight in from the north.''</p>
        <p>He said that the Rocky Mountains act as a barrier to shield the West from the worst of the Arctic flow, and as a funnel that encourages the flow to slide southeast to the Gulf so that the East Coast has ''a much more easy tapping of the Arctic winter air.''</p>
        <p>Microgeography also plays a part in local weather, Dr. Gilman said. The towering buildings of Manhattan form canyons that create wind tunnels, making city winds more turbulent than suburban ones. The buildings' heating during the winter and the radiant heat they absorb from the sun in the summer to release at night can result in as much as a five-degree difference between city temperature and outlying temperatures, something called ''the hot island effect.''</p>
        <p>This is a popular month for speculation about winters having long-term cycles of mildness and severity that stretch over years. Dr. Gilman, whose center draws up generalized 30- to 90-day weather predictions based partly on records dating back to just after World War II, said that such cycles have not been found.</p>
        <p>''Our job would be a lot easier if there was some periodic cycle,'' he said. Instead, ''there are sometimes apparent cycles, something seems to be recurring several times, and as soon as you start to think, 'Oh ho, there's something regular to this,' it disappears. It's pretty much a will-o-the-wisp.''</p>
        <p>Another popular speculation is that the world is entering a new ''mini Ice Age,'' a theory that survivors of the great snowstorm of 1978 and of last month's traumas may not dispute. The counterpart comes during sizzling summer days, when amateur meteorologists say that the earth is experiencing a warming ''greenhouse effect'' caused by atmospheric pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stalker has little patience for such theories. ''No, you've had mild winters and you've had some cold winters,'' he said. ''We're not going into an ice age, and we're not going into global warming yet.''</p>
