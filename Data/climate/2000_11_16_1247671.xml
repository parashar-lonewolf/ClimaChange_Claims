        <p>As critical talks on a treaty to fight global warming entered a third day here, the Department of Energy issued a study that addresses a main point of contention: whether the United States could do more to reduce its addiction to fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>In the study, Energy Department analysts say that fairly simple, inexpensive changes in American energy policies -- some already embraced by both presidential aspirants -- could go a long way toward cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>The analysts conclude with three ways that energy use, and thus emissions of carbon dioxide, could be substantially reduced, with almost no harm to the economy: raising standards for energy and fuel efficiency; increasing spending on government and private energy research; and adopting a national trading scheme for carbon dioxide cuts that gives companies a financial incentive to surpass required reductions.</p>
        <p>The payoff would come not only in reducing greenhouse gases, said a chief author, Dr. Marilyn A. Brown, but also in lower energy bills, less dependence on imported oil and a reduction in power plant and car emissions, which contribute to smog and acid rain. Dr. Brown is deputy director of the energy efficiency and renewable energy program of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>She added, ''There are lots of low-cost and no-cost opportunities that are a great investment.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Brown was planning to present the work on Thursday for negotiators gathered to debate a proposed international treaty to curtail global warming. But word of the study was already out; the focus was on its contrasts with the negotiating position of the American delegation.</p>
        <p>Under the treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, by 2012 industrialized countries would cut combined emissions of greenhouse gases more than 5 percent below emissions measured in 1990. So far more than 100 countries have signed the treaty, but no industrialized countries have ratified it.</p>
        <p>Many countries and environmental groups have complained that the United States has strongly resisted commitment to a gas reductions goal on its home turf. Instead, American negotiators have pressed for industrialized countries to get credit toward emissions targets in exchange for investments made wherever in the world the biggest reductions can be found for the least cost.</p>
        <p>The United States has felt growing pressure to commit to reductions at home because it is widely perceived as the 800-pound gorilla in the global greenhouse. With 4 percent of the world's population, the United States produces nearly 25 percent of heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department study seemed to offer evidence that plenty could be accomplished at home, negotiators and observers here said.</p>
        <p>''This shows us that there are huge opportunities to achieve real domestic pollution reductions,'' said Dr. Daniel A. Lashof, a senior scientist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group in New York. ''It shows us there's no reason for the United States to demand loopholes as part of these negotiations.''</p>
        <p>He added that momentum was building for a core component of the Energy Department proposal: a national system for requiring cuts in carbon dioxide and letting companies that surpass those targets sell the excess credits.</p>
        <p>This is the same kind of trading system that has sharply -- and without great cost -- lowered emissions of sulfur pollution from power plants over the last decade.</p>
        <p>Referring to the two combatants still locked in the presidential race, Dr. Lashof said, ''Both Bush and Gore have supported limits on carbon dioxide from power plants with emissions trading.''</p>
        <p>The analysis, Scenarios for a Clean Energy Future, offered several ways the United States could reduce pollution from fossil fuels. For example, it could encourage utilities to produce at least a small percentage of their electricity with nonpolluting technologies like wind power -- in the way that California now requires car manufacturers to sell some models that produce nearly no pollution.</p>
        <p>American negotiators said here today that they were all for aggressively cutting greenhouse emissions domestically. But any treaty that forced countries to achieve most cuts at home ''would only increase costs, reduce incentives for innovation and substantially complicate efforts to move forward,'' said David B. Sandalow, an assistant secretary of state for environmental affairs.</p>
        <p>Still, some American environmental experts thought the United States would pursue domestic cuts.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine the United States Congress sending huge amounts of money to Russia or elsewhere to buy emission reductions when there are cost-effective reductions at home,'' said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Climate Change, based in Washington. ''It only makes sense to do those things first.''</p>
