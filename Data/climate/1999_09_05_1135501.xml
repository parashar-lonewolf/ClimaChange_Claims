        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree with Mr. Shere that it is time to return Pacifica stations to the communities that paid for them, and that the Pacifica board should step down. But much of the rest of Mr. Shere's thinking is inconsistent, politically naive and contemptuous of the very communities he refers to.</p>
        <p>He writes that ''the powerful transmitter at the commercial frequency of 94.1 megahertz is wasted on Pacifica as it now operates, and they would be right to sell it and use the money to encourage the development of a number of smaller stations, locally programmed, locally responsible, locally administered.''</p>
        <p>I am all for the development of small, locally administered stations, but I reject the assumption embedded in Mr. Shere's statement that local communities do not deserve, and should not administrate, a powerful transmitter.</p>
        <p>Currently, 99.9 percent of the nation's powerful transmitters are given over to corporate propaganda, commercial pandering, religious indoctrination, unquestioned government pronouncements, context-less ahistorical soundbite news and ill-informed loudmouth talk show hosts. And all of it floats in a sea of musical offerings from media conglomerates that serve the mission of increasing their owners' wealth and influence. That's the real waste!</p>
        <p>To think that small local stations alone can adequately grapple with the issues of our time is to ignore what has happened to the world since the 1960's. There are few purely local issues anymore. Globalization of the economy and transnational corporate domination of media and politics force local communities to make common cause across borders just to maintain their autonomy. Residents of a town in rural America are likely to find themselves in a struggle to prevent their home from being turned into a repository for another state's, or another country's, nuclear waste. Farmers in the United States must engage in dialogue with farmers in Britain and India to prevent the contamination of their crops by the products of transnational biotech firms. And residents of a tiny Pacific island will see their homeland submerged unless they can stop countries thousands of miles away from disgorging greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Far from being a waste, Pacifica radio is an antidote to the alienation and passivity fostered by the way mainstream media present news. Recent events have shown that only open, accountable administration of this national treasure can guard against its seizure for corrupt or self-serving purposes.</p>
