        <p>North and South Meet</p>
        <p>North is north, and south is south, and never the twain shall meet. That (with apologies to Rudyard Kipling) has been the general thinking about species isolation in Arctic and Antarctic waters. A cold-water-loving species in the north is separated from the same species in the south by thousands of miles of warmer ocean, and thus might be expected to evolve differently.</p>
        <p>But a new study by scientists in Britain has shown that for several plankton species, at least, that is not the case. Studying three types of foraminifera, single-celled organisms that make up much of the world's plankton, the scientists have discovered that northern and southern specimens of the same species display some identical genetic variation.</p>

        <p>North and South Meet</p>
        <p>North is north, and south is south, and never the twain shall meet. That (with apologies to Rudyard Kipling) has been the general thinking about species isolation in Arctic and Antarctic waters. A cold-water-loving species in the north is separated from the same species in the south by thousands of miles of warmer ocean, and thus might be expected to evolve differently.</p>
        <p>But a new study by scientists in Britain has shown that for several plankton species, at least, that is not the case. Studying three types of foraminifera, single-celled organisms that make up much of the world's plankton, the scientists have discovered that northern and southern specimens of the same species display some identical genetic variation.</p>
        <p>This, the researchers write in Nature, is evidence that the creatures somehow stay in touch enough to allow for genetic mixing.</p>
        <p>Different species of forams, as the organisms are known, show a distinct preference for warm- or cold-water zones. These zones were essentially established 8 million to 16 million years ago, so the cold-water species in north and south should have had plenty of time to develop genetic differences. But the researchers, studying ribosomal DNA, found the same DNA sequences in both Arctic and Antarctic populations of the same species.</p>
        <p>Exactly how this mixing might occur is unclear. But the researchers suggest that because the forams would be unlikely to survive transit across warmer surface waters, the organisms might be being submerged to deeper, cooler levels for their travels through the tropics.</p>
        <p>El Nino's Effects</p>
        <p>Even a warm-water organism can run into trouble sometimes, if the water gets too hot. That's apparently what happened off Belize during the El Nino winter of 1997-98. The dominant coral species in the central lagoon of Belize was almost completely destroyed as water temperatures reached 90 degrees, the highest sea surface temperature ever recorded.</p>
        <p>When corals are stressed by high temperatures or other environmental conditions, they expel the symbiotic algae that are the source of most of their food. If the algae do not return, the corals can die. The phenomenon is known as coral bleaching because the loss of the photosynthesizing algae makes the corals appear white.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama studied the destruction in Belize caused by the heat, which has been attributed both to El Nino and global warming. Until now, the researchers wrote in Nature, coral reefs in the Caribbean that had been bleached eventually recovered. The Belize case, they say, is the first in which coral mortality has passed the point of no return.</p>
        <p>The researchers also took core samples from the reef and determined that nothing like the bleaching had occurred in Belize's lagoonal reefs in at least 3,000 years. Their results, they say, show that concerns about the impact of climate change on reef ecosystems is justified.</p>
        <p>Tricky Survival Technique</p>
        <p>Birds do it, bees do it. The larvae of blister beetles don't do it, but, being parasites, they are glad that others do (particularly the bees).</p>
        <p>Scientists at San Francisco State University have discovered a remarkable way in which blister beetle larvae get into the nests of bees, allowing them to survive in harsh desert conditions like those in the Mojave in California. The larvae, known as triungulins, clump together into a mass that makes a male bee swoon.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the researchers report in Nature, a male bee mistakes a clump of triungulins for a female bee (using both visual and olfactory cues), and tries to mate with it. The triungulins respond by latching onto the male. Then, when the male eventually finds and mates with a real female, the triungulins are transferred to the female, who carries them to the nest. There they grow fat and happy, living on pollen provided by the bees.</p>
