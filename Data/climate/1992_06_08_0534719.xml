        <p>Fearing demonstrations against President Bush, the United Nations has drawn up plans to close the Earth Summit conference center to representatives of private environmental groups and to sharply reduce credentials for official delegations, United Nations officials said today.</p>
        <p>Starting Thursday, the day before President Bush and as many as 110 heads of state and government are to meet here, a new credential system will bar virtually all private sector environmentalists from the center and will limit official missions to four delegates from each country, a United Nations official who attended an emergency security meeting on Friday said.</p>

        <p>Fearing demonstrations against President Bush, the United Nations has drawn up plans to close the Earth Summit conference center to representatives of private environmental groups and to sharply reduce credentials for official delegations, United Nations officials said today.</p>
        <p>Starting Thursday, the day before President Bush and as many as 110 heads of state and government are to meet here, a new credential system will bar virtually all private sector environmentalists from the center and will limit official missions to four delegates from each country, a United Nations official who attended an emergency security meeting on Friday said.</p>
        <p>The official said he expected that press credentials would also be restricted. United Nations credentials have been issued to about 1,500 environmentalists and to about 5,000 journalists. 150 Protest U.S. Policy</p>
        <p>Today, about 150 Americans marched down Copacabana Beach in the first public protest here against the Bush Administration's environmental policies.</p>
        <p>"George Bush, you are embarrassing us," read one banner raised by American environmentalists protesting the President's announced refusal to sign a treaty to protect plants and animals.</p>
        <p>Chip Barber, one of the protest organizers, said, "We are here to show Brazilians that we are ashamed that our country is acting like a ball and chain at the Earth Summit."</p>
        <p>The anti-Bush mood in Rio was summed up Friday by a front-page headline in an English language newspaper here: "U.S. Singled Out as Eco Bad Guy."</p>
        <p>Some of the Americans here say the Bush-bashing is not justified. Leftist Ties Seen</p>
        <p>Senator Larry Pressler, Republican of South Dakota, complained today that the Earth Summit reminded him of "a meeting of the international left."</p>
        <p>"I don't think people give the U.S. proper credit on environmental protection," he said.</p>
        <p>Hoping to ease American "isolation" at the Earth Summit, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, a spokesman for the European Community, cautioned Saturday at a press conference: "We don't want a slugging match of everybody against the United States."</p>
        <p>There were new reports today that the United States would continue its a tough approach to a second treaty to be signed here, one to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases believed capable of warming the earth's temperature. U.S. Opposing Timetables</p>
        <p>During treaty talks in April and May, the United States succeeded in removing from the treaty any targets or timetables for the reduction of gases. The United States has said that it opposes timetables, arguing that they could be costly and could hurt economic activity.</p>
        <p>Last week, three European countries -- Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands -- started an initiative to commit signers to stabilize emissions immediately. In a separate move, Germany and other European nations are working to gain support for the rapid adoption of a treaty protocol to impose targets and timetables.</p>
        <p>Fighting back, the United States sent a "threatening" letter to the Austrian Government in Vienna last week, according to one Austrian delegate here. He declined to give details of the letter.</p>
        <p>In addition, William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said here over the weekend that the United States will move to block the German initiative. A Different U.S. View</p>
        <p>Senator Albert Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who is leading a Congressional delegation here, said today, "I find it incomprehensible that we would object to other countries declaring that they want to meet targets and timetables."</p>
        <p>More dissatisfaction with the Earth Summit came today from a group called Earth Parliament, a congress representing 220 groups from around the globe.</p>
        <p>"At this moment governments of the rich nations are discussing how to exert even more control over the less favored nations," read a statement adopted by the assembly. "In doing so, they continue to ignore our unique knowledge and technical skill which have been perfected over millennia in our special relationship with the eco-systems which we inhabit."</p>
        <p>But the relationship of one Brazilian Indian to his environment caused environmentalists to wince today.</p>
        <p>Mario Juruna, a 49-year-old member of the Xavante ethnic group, displayed for sale at the Global Forum, an environmental fair here, the skin of a spotted jaguar, an endangered species.</p>
        <p>"When Indians are free, we are going to sell snakes, caymans, and jaguars," Mr. Juruna, said to the dismay of assembled naturalists.</p>
