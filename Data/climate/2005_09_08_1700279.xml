        <p>Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, the Swiss architectural team, designed the new de Young Museum -- opening in San Francisco on Oct. 15 -- to fit into its Golden Gate Park setting and also to invite it inside. A copper shell is perforated and embossed with circles to mimic dappled light. Depending on the time of day, it looks solid or translucent. The ocean air will change the shell's color over time, to pick up the browns, oranges, purples and especially the greenish grays in the park, said Ascan Mergenthaler, a partner at Herzog &amp; de Meuron, which worked with Fong &amp; Chan Architects. (In Europe, he pointed out, copper typically turns dark brown because of acid rain.)</p>
        <p>A nine-story tower, top left, mainly dedicated to classrooms and research, has an observation deck (no admission fee) with views of the park, the city and the coastline. Depending on the angle, ''sometimes it's slim and pointy, sometimes it's flat,'' Mr. Mergenthaler said.</p>

        <p>Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, the Swiss architectural team, designed the new de Young Museum -- opening in San Francisco on Oct. 15 -- to fit into its Golden Gate Park setting and also to invite it inside. A copper shell is perforated and embossed with circles to mimic dappled light. Depending on the time of day, it looks solid or translucent. The ocean air will change the shell's color over time, to pick up the browns, oranges, purples and especially the greenish grays in the park, said Ascan Mergenthaler, a partner at Herzog &amp; de Meuron, which worked with Fong &amp; Chan Architects. (In Europe, he pointed out, copper typically turns dark brown because of acid rain.)</p>
        <p>A nine-story tower, top left, mainly dedicated to classrooms and research, has an observation deck (no admission fee) with views of the park, the city and the coastline. Depending on the angle, ''sometimes it's slim and pointy, sometimes it's flat,'' Mr. Mergenthaler said.</p>
        <p>The museum, built at a cost of $202 million, pulls visitors along corridors, offering glimpses of galleries (top right, ''Zig V'' by David Smith) and of nature. The Fern Garden, by the landscape architect Walter Hood, is sandwiched between soaring glass (above right) and the copper facade. It is one of several gardens tucked inside the structure. ''You see a finger of the park going deep into the tissue of the museum,'' Mr. Mergenthaler said.</p>
        <p>A 1989 earthquake that damaged the original de Young museum (torn down three years ago) inspired ''Drawn Stone,'' by Andy Goldsworthy. A quarter-inch crack, it leads 200 yards up the main walkway and into a courtyard (above left), where it deepens, slicing boulders that double as seating.
