        <p>JUST LIKE BEAUTY</p>
        <p>By Lisa Lerner.</p>
        <p>279 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $24.</p>
        <p>In the Feminine Woman of Conscience beauty pageant, girls perform oral sex on rubber blowup men and sacrifice rabbits they've raised as pets. The winner goes home with a shiny gold headdress and a wad of cash; she can look forward to ''product sponsorship opportunities and entr√©e into a world peopled with Hollywood celebrities, high-ranking politicians and European counts.'' The pageant takes place in suburban Deansville, a futuristic town where food has been replaced with ''Just Like'' food products, mutant grasshoppers grow to the size of cats and global warming causes spring to arrive in January.</p>
        <p>Down in the family nook, 14-year-old Edie Stein prepares for the pageant and is coached by her mother, who competed and lost in the same ridiculous contest when she was a girl. She shows Edie exactly how to arouse the blowup man, although she can't get her own husband to kiss her and often sobs into her pillow. Edie feels sorry for her mother and wants her to smile; she tries to entertain her by putting on favorite songs and dancing, or expertly reciting rules from the Feminine Woman of Conscience Handbook. Still her mother can't cheer up and needs her pills, her little helpers; she cleans the house obsessively, as if the shining surfaces will redeem her. Edie's afraid the cleaning chemicals will take their toll and ''a great black truffled tumor'' will grow on her brain, the result of ''my mother's love for Just Like Lemon Fresh Spray Wax.''</p>
        <p>Edie is the narrator of Lisa Lerner's captivating first novel, ''Just Like Beauty,'' a work of striking lyricism and jittery energy. The story takes place in the months leading up to the pageant -- the pageant dictates the form of the narrative just as it dictates the lives of the girls living in anticipation of it. Edie wonders, ''Without Pageant, what do you have to mark the difference between one day and the next?'' In Edie's social milieu, being crowned queen is considered the only worthwhile dream for girls. Yet even as Edie diligently rehearses for Needlework Odyssey, Poise and Cookery and Better Person Skills, she knows in the back of her mind she's not a Feminine Woman of Conscience, and she won't be able to kill her adorable bunny when the time comes.</p>
        <p>One girl in town represents escape from the pageant fate. She's Lana Grimaldi, and Edie's secretly in love with her. Lana smokes cigars and kisses Edie on the mouth. She has a constantly ringing cellphone in her pocket, and a way of mysteriously disappearing for days at a time. She warns Edie about the dangers of the corrupted world they inhabit, where everything is made of a synthetic material called ''polystroob'' and kids' ears grow abnormally large when pregnant mothers feast on Diet-ora Nips. Lana gives Edie speeches that bear traces of Rachel Carson: ''There are 3,000 new chemicals on the market for household use each year. Did you know that? And nobody has time to check out what happens when certain compounds are in the vicinity of other compounds. Forget other countries blowing us away with their bioweapons, we're blowing ourselves away!''</p>
        <p>As Lana explains the apocalypse, Edie stares at her mouth, dreaming of more kisses. If Lana is focused and determined, Edie's lovesick and fickle. She's so flaky that she tests the reader's faith -- as with most teenage girls, half the time it's hard to know what's motivating her. Her voice itself can be exasperating, although it's always engaging. One day she wants to be queen of the pageant, the next she wants to join the Happy Endings cult and commit suicide. When her mother sighs ''I just don't get you,'' it's hard not to sympathize.</p>
        <p>Hovering around the borders of Deansville are a group of greasy-haired boys called Blow Torchers, who terrorize girls. They're the scariest figures in this nightmare -- swatting their victims with a ''steel-pinned vampire glove,'' tying them up and urinating on their heads. Whenever they approach, the girls run, but often they don't get away. Like the menacing crew of thugs in ''A Clockwork Orange,'' these brutal boys rampage through the dystopian landscape, burning with a demented rage that seems like a logical outgrowth of their blighted environment.</p>
        <p>The suspense of ''Just Like Beauty'' lies in the question of Edie's strength. Will she have the muscles to outrun the Blow Torchers? Will she summon the energy to move out from under the pageant's spell? Or will she give in to her death wish and join Happy Endings? She's in many ways a weak, confused girl, the type high school counselors worry about. She considers herself someone ''whose mother almost didn't push hard enough to get her out of the uterus,'' and who therefore ''doesn't know which way to go.'' Sometimes she thinks she'd be better off living on a submarine, vanishing into the silence below the ocean. As the story progresses, Edie's dream of living underwater becomes a simple but gripping metaphor for both her death wish and her submerged homosexual desire.</p>
        <p>At times ''Just Like Beauty'' brings to mind another recent novel about gloomy teenage girls stuck in a suburban wasteland: ''The Quick and the Dead,'' by Joy Williams. Like Williams, Lerner envisions an inhospitable planet where human damage has irretrievably disrupted the natural order. And like Williams, Lerner writes in a prose style that's intricate, poetic and full of surprises: the red of a woman's lipstick ''makes her look like she's been shot in the mouth.'' On pageant day, Mrs. Horner, the president of the Virtue Club, is described this way, ''What's left of her nose after a record number of operations is lost on her hectic face, everything about Mrs. Horner is jumping unless it has been surgically fixed down, and she burbles instructions like a cartoon bird.''</p>
        <p>Lerner has written for women's magazines, and one of her novel's most memorable elements is its depiction of femininity as an absurd belief system into which unsuspecting girls are indoctrinated like sacrificial rabbits. The closer Edie gets to womanhood, the more ludicrous her life becomes. In pursuit of the pageant crown, the girls of Deansville endure all manner of torture and humiliation. They totter around on high heels and seduce rubber men, going through the motions of pleasure like robots, making spectacles of themselves. They're as unnatural as the processed foods consumed by the residents of Deansville. In a lesser writer's hands, such an exaggerated view of womanhood might have seemed silly or unbelievable. But Lerner has the gifts to make it all work -- the girls seem real, and you want them to escape.</p>
