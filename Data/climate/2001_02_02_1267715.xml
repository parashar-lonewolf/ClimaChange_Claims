        <p>Re ''President Offers Plan to Promote Oil Exploration'' (front page, Jan. 30):</p>
        <p>That President Bush would despoil a remarkable piece of American wilderness to gain a limited amount of oil demonstrates his lack of commitment to effecting long-term solutions for our country's energy woes. Instead, he hopes that tying his proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the California electricity crisis will be seen as some kind of solution.</p>

        <p>In reality, it is a thinly veiled attempt to reward the oil constituency, which has done so much for him through the years. I hope that President Bush realizes that the presidential thing to do would be to look  at energy problems as a way to move the country beyond our dependency on fossil fuels and to formulate a truly permanent solution to the crisis.</p>
