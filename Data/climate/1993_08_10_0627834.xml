        <p>SUDDEN infant death syndrome, which affects 1 of every 1,000 infants born in this country, and many more worldwide, has long baffled scientists and researchers. Recently, mounting evidence has indicated that babies who sleep face down are at greater risk than those who sleep on their backs or sides.</p>
        <p>In addition, in several areas where health officials have urged parents to avoid putting babies face down, the incidence of the syndrome has dropped.</p>
        <p>Last week a report from Australia offered further support for this connection and refined earlier findings by identifying four factors that significantly raise the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, also known as crib death, among babies who sleep face down. The report, in The New England Journal of Medicine, said the risk was higher forinfants who do these things:</p>
        <p>*Sleep on a soft mattress.</p>
        <p>*Sleep while swaddled in a sheet or blanket.</p>
        <p>*Have a cold or other infection.</p>
        <p>*Sleep while they are dressed too warmly, relative to the temperature of the room, or in a room that is heated over 57 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Each of these factors proved significantly more dangerous only when a baby slept face down, in the prone position. Babies on their backs also die of sudden infant death syndrome, of course, and crib death has long been known to be a problem even though until lately, most babies have slept on their backs.</p>
        <p>Crib death is usually defined as an unexplained and unexpected sudden death of an infant or young child; autopsies cannot determine a cause in such cases. In this country, it is second to birth defects as the leading cause of death in infants. At least 16 studies have shown that sleeping prone increased the risk for crib death, and no study has shown an increased risk for babies sleeping on their sides or backs. Maternal smoking has also been identified as a risk factor for crib death.</p>
        <p>But the evidence for the prone sleeping position as a risk for crib death is not conclusive because it does not explain how it can kill a baby.</p>
        <p>Experts say that the cause is not suffocation. Healthy infants will not suffocate on ordinary, smooth bedding, they say; even face-down healthy infants can turn their heads to obtain access to fresh air. Infants will suffocate only if they cannot turn their heads, or if their faces are covered or if they are having difficulty breathing. Nevertheless, there are scant data on an infant's ability to defend its airway while asleep. Call for Research</p>
        <p>Dr. Anne-Louise Ponsonby, the chief author of the new study, said she hoped that the accumulating data would stimulate laboratory scientists to undertake research to explain the sequence of events linking the prone position to crib death.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ponsonby's epidemiological study was conducted in Hobart, Tasmania, an island state of Australia, where the documented incidence of crib death was twice that of other areas of Australia. After a campaign warning parents against putting infants to sleep in the prone position, the incidence dropped to 1.7 per 1,000 live births in 1991 from a rate of 3.6 deaths that was recorded 10 years earlier. About the same time, a survey found that the number of Tasmanian babies sleeping face down had dropped to fewer than 8 percent from 33 percent, Dr. Ponsonby said.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere as well, dropping rates of crib death seem related to campaigns against putting infants face down.</p>
        <p>In Britain, the incidence of crib death was halved in 1992, the year following a campaign led by Anne Diamond, a television personality who lost a baby to crib death. In that year, the incidence fell to 456 cases, from 912 in 1991. However, critics caution against concluding that the campaign led to the drop in deaths because the rates had already been dropping. Britain had 1,079 cases of crib death in 1990, and 1,190 in 1989.</p>
        <p>Declines have followed similar educational programs in the Netherlands, as well as in Tasmania and in New Zealand, where crib-death rates were among the highest in the world, Dr. Ponsonby said in an interview.</p>
        <p>In the United States, most babies sleep face down. Last year the American Academy of Pediatrics found the evidence convincing enough to recommend that parents put healthy babies to bed on their sides or backs, not prone. The academy put no upper age limit on its recommendation. Australian officials had made a similar recommendation in 1991.</p>
        <p>Last year's American recommendation is controversial among the pediatricians who believe that the prone position helps reduce the risk of inhaling stomach fluid. Also, because most evidence pointing to the dangers of an infant sleeping prone come from foreign areas where the incidence of crib death is higher than in the United States, critics say the findings might not apply to the United States, where medical and cultural practices differ. Mysterious Variations</p>
        <p>Among the many mysteries of crib death is why it occurs with varying frequencies throughout the world, striking most often in the winter. Another puzzle is why the rates have increased in Finland, France, Norway and Sweden in recent years but have dropped in other countries. In Sweden, the advice to parents was changed in 1976 to advise that infants sleep prone, and that may be related to the rise in the incidence of crib death. But no explanation is apparent for the other countries.</p>
        <p>As early as the mid-19th century, pioneering sociological studies clearly described crib death in Norway and defined it as a major health problem, comparable to those caused by alcohol, pauperism and illegitimacy.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's pediatricians began recommending that infants be placed face down for sleeping. The prevailing explanation for the change is that around that time, doctors noted that premature babies seemed to breathe more easily when placed face down, so pediatricians in many countries extrapolated from those findings to advise the same for healthy full-term babies. Many pediatricians, including Dr. Benjamin Spock, advised that babies seemed to sleep better face down and ran less risk of inhaling vomit.</p>
        <p>Precisely what led pediatricians in so many areas of the world at that time to go against the traditional motherly advice by recommending a switch in sleeping position for babies needs to be studied, Dr. Sarah Stewart-Brown wrote last year in The British Medical Journal. Dr. Stewart-Brown, a public health expert, wrote that she had failed to follow her mother's practice and had lost a baby to crib death. She said: "The medical profession should accept collective responsibility for what happened" because "it is wrong to extrapolate the results of studies on small sick subsets of the population to formulate policy for improving health in the population as a whole."</p>
        <p>A link between the prone sleeping position and crib death was first suspected about the same time, but the link did not become firm until more recent studies. Still, the findings have been controversial, in part because they come from studies in which the data was collected in interviews with bereaved parents after their babies had died. Under such conditions, parents might have been unintentionally biased in recalling the events surrounding a child's death.</p>
        <p>Concern about such recall bias and a desire to sort out the factors by which the prone position raised the risk for crib death led researchers at the Menzies Center for Population Health Research to undertake several studies at the University of Tasmania. In one, they followed several thousand healthy infants from birth to try to identify the factors that distinguished those who died from crib death from the rest.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to know: Are there some situations in which prone position is much worse than other situations?" Dr. Ponsonby said. Results in Tasmania</p>
        <p>The Tasmanian team's latest study found a 20-fold increase in the risk for crib death for infants who usually slept prone on soft, fluffy mattresses filled with natural substances like ti-tree bark and kapok. Infants who slept prone on ordinary mattresses had triple the risk of infants who slept on their backs or sides.</p>
        <p>Ti-tree bark is easily peeled from trees in Tasmania and the loose chips are packed inside a cotton cover to form a mattress. Similar soft mattresses are made from the long silky fibers of kapok, which covers the seeds of the ceiba tree.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ponsonby said scientists now needed to learn whether infants suffocate because they rebreathe carbon dioxide while sleeping prone or whether ti-tree bark, kapok and other materials may harm infants directly or through allergic reactions.</p>
        <p>The Tasmanian team also found that the risk of crib death was 12 times higher for infants who slept face down and who were swaddled in some kind of bedding. The authors suggested that the child's inability to change position might have been a factor. The risk was tripled for those who slept prone but not swaddled.</p>
        <p>The risk was 10 times higher for infants who slept prone and who had nasal congestion, cough, chest noises, fever, vomiting or diarrhea on the day of death or the day before.</p>
        <p>The risk increased 15 times when babies slept prone in heated rooms, which were defined as being more than 57 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ponsonby said her team had concluded that "healthy infants should not be placed prone to sleep" because "it is easier to change a baby's position than it is to make sure that all the other sleeping conditions are O.K."</p>
        <p>An editorial in the same journal underscored the problem of scientific ignorance about crib death. In the editorial, Dr. Christian F. Poets of Children's Hospital in Hanover, Germany, and Dr. David P. Southall of the University of Keele in Stoke-on-Trent, England, wrote that the data "cannot explain why thousands of babies sleep face down on soft mattresses in overheated rooms and do not die, whereas some who sleep on their backs on hard mattresses in cool rooms die nevertheless."</p>
