        <p>"TIME is but the stream I go a-fishing in," Henry David Thoreau wrote in the famous account of his two-year experiment in thinking, living and studying nature at Walden Pond.</p>
        <p>Now, taking up where Thoreau's nature studies left off and using intellectual tools unavailable in his time, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin has dipped more deeply into the stream of time at Walden than Thoreau could ever have hoped to do. By analyzing frozen core samples of pond sediments that embody a 600-year-old ecological record, Dr. Marjorie Winkler has come up with a fascinating profile of the pond's history. Her samples record changes that took place over the past six centuries in the pond and its environment, showing how they have continuously been altered by humans, including Thoreau himself.</p>
        <p>By the time Thoreau took up his semi-reclusive life on Walden's shore from July 1845 to September 1847, Dr. Winkler found, people already had greatly rearranged the mixture of wild plants and trees around the pond. They had also discharged several substances into the water, changing its chemistry and the composition of its microscopic food web. Already far from pristine, the pond of Thoreau's day contained clay, sand and gravel from shoreline digging; charcoal from the trains that ran along its edge, and brush burned by the railroad. Thoreau contributed by throwing burning logs from his campfires into the pond and by accidentally setting a fire near Walden Woods in 1855.</p>
        <p>The arrival of Europeans in Massachusetts is signaled in the Walden core by a surge in ragweed pollen, an unfailing fingerprint of colonization. Ragweed is a native plant that runs riot in areas disturbed by human settlement. And the extinction of the native chestnut trees around Walden -- Thoreau wrote of gathering chestnuts on the shoreline -- is sharply reflected in a disappearance of chestnut pollen in the top layers of the core.</p>
        <p>Analysis of changing algae and plant species contained in the core showed that the pond in recent times has become more eutrophic, meaning that it contains a higher concentration of nutrients and algae than before and is therefore less clear. Taken to its end, the trend would cause the pond to stagnate gradually, fill in with weeds and disappear over thousands of years. The algae also show the pond to be more acid than it was, probably, Dr. Winkler said, because of acid rain.</p>
        <p>No core samples are needed to discern some of the present-day pressures on the Walden ecosystem. Preservationists last year bought out a proposed condominium development in Walden Woods and are engaged now in a contentious negotiation to acquire the site of a second proposed development there, this time an office park. The high-profile preservation effort includes a phenomenon leagues removed from contemplation and science: a series of fund-raising rock concerts at Madison Square Garden later this month.</p>
        <p>Thoreau, as far as is known, was the first American naturalist to study a lake ecosystem. His main purpose at Walden, outside Concord, Mass., was to live the simple life, to strip away the trappings of the industrial society then emerging in America, and get down to the essential, irreducible realities of existence. He did odd jobs, but mostly used his time for contemplation and study. The result was his masterwork, "Walden; or, a Life in the Woods."</p>
        <p>While at Walden, he chose to submit to arrest and be jailed briefly rather than pay a poll tax.  He said he would not support a government that was fighting a war against Mexico to extend slavery. The experience figured in a later essay, "Civil Disobedience," that inspired the passive-resistance tactics adopted by Mohandas K. Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
        <p>It is for all of this that he is perhaps best known. But as the book makes clear, he spent much of his time at Walden studying the pond and its environment. He called it "a clear and deep green well" that some thought bottomless. Thoreau disproved this by making soundings through the ice and producing a chart whose accuracy holds up to this day. He observed and described the pond's wildlife, tracked the rise and fall of its water level, measured its temperature at various depths and calculated how the temperature differences affected the biology of the pond. He brought up pieces of aquatic vegetation and tried to identify them. He was fascinated by the ice, the color of the water, the fish.</p>
        <p>"As he was questioning authority, he was also questioning the natural world," said Dr. Winkler. "He asked questions that people who are fairly sophisticated ecologists ask, and he answered them by observation."</p>
        <p>Dr. Winkler, a scientist who studies ancient environments, has also investigated other small southern New England lakes of the Walden type. Called kettle ponds, Walden and its kind were probably formed 12,000 to 14,000 years ago by the melting of blocks of ice left behind by a retreating Ice Age glacier.</p>
        <p>Dr. Winkler says she was introduced to "Walden" while working on Cape Cod, and that she subsequently decided that Walden Pond "might be a good candidate to do some paleoecology" and to look at the post-settlement history of the pond and its environs.</p>
        <p>The remains of the past are well preserved in pond and lake sediments as pollen, charcoal, seeds and the remains of microscopic plants and animals are deposited layer on layer. The layers were revealed at Walden by lowering a tube filled with dry ice into the bottom sediments. The sediments stick to the tube, are frozen in place and then kept frozen for later analysis.</p>
        <p>In 1979, Dr. Winkler and her associates were able to recover a core nearly 33 inches in length, containing 600 years' worth of sediment. Since then she and colleagues in Madison have been painstakingly analyzing the core. She first reported on the results at a scientific meeting held in conjunction with a Thoreau Society celebration at Concord in July.</p>
        <p>By extrapolating from the results of longer cores obtained from similar ponds nearby, Dr. Winkler determined, on the basis of pollen residues, that just before 12,000 years ago the region consisted of tundra and sparse spruce trees.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, it changed to a forest of spruce, jack pine and green alder. By 9,500 years ago, during a warm, dry period, pitch pine replaced jack pine, and an oak and pine savanna was established on the dry, sandy soils of what is now Walden Woods. Succeeding millennia saw the appearance of hemlock, white cedar, beech, maple, ash, chestnut, hickory, birch and white pine.</p>
        <p>The Walden core, with its record reaching back to the 14th century, contains pollen evidence for an edible herb, called rumex, that may have been cultivated by Indians. The amount of pollen appears to rise shortly before the English settlers arrived in the 17th century. "It may be evidence that there was some kind of selective agriculture" practiced by the Indians, said Dr. Winkler. There were some changes in algae concentrations just before European settlement, she said, "showing that some activities in or near the pond or in the drainage basin have impacted the water." Ragweed Is a Giveaway</p>
        <p>But if the imprint of the original Americans on the environment appears faint, that of the European settlers registers vividly.</p>
        <p>One of the signs is more white pines and fewer pitch pines. Pollen in the cores produces "definite documentation of this switch in pine species," said Dr. Winkler. One reason, she said, may be that white pine is more vulnerable to fire than pitch pine, and the settlers tended to put out fires. Also, she said, they valued white pines as masts for ships. Because of their value, the pines were called the King's Trees. The settlers used pitch pine for home heating. A cooler climate, suggested by increased spruce pollen, could also have contributed to the species switch, she said.</p>
        <p>Tree pollen generally decreases with settlement, she said, while ragweed and grass pollen increase. "The ragweed pollen rise," she said, "is used as</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>time marker of European settlement." It appears in the Walden sediments about 300 years ago.</p>
        <p>The railroad came to Walden the year before Thoreau moved into his cabin on the pond, and this is reflected by a sharp jump in the amount of charcoal in the sediments. "The railroad is right alongside the lake, directly adjacent to it," said Dr. Winkler, "and the railroad had this policy of setting fires to clear weeds from the tracks. They also used logs for fuel for the engines and sparks from the trains would set fires."</p>
        <p>The sediments date the disappearance of chestnut trees around Concord about 1913. Previously, the pollen record indicates, the forest floor in the fall was covered with chestnut leaves and burrs. Chestnuts were killed by a fungus that spread throughout the great tree's range. The fungus was introduced by humans through wood imported from abroad. Laden With Chemicals</p>
        <p>In the pond itself, the remains of microscopic plants contained in the cores document a long-term drop in water quality, Dr. Winkler said. Various species of diatoms, silica-walled algae that leave their skeletons behind when they die, display different tolerances to acid. The diatoms from Walden indicate a shift toward those that dwell in more acid conditions, leading Dr. Winkler to believe that the pond has been affected by acid rain.</p>
        <p>The remains of diatoms and other organisms also reveal that in recent years the pond must have become laden with nitrogen and phosphates. These chemicals promote excessive growth of algae that can cloud a lake and eventually choke its animal life.</p>
        <p>"You can tell people didn't really worry about what was leaching into the soil," said Dr. Winkler. The organic matter and the nutrients could come from leaky outdoor toilets, farm wastes or any of a number of sources.</p>
        <p>"All these changes show that there has been a decline in the water quality at Walden Pond due to modification of the drainage basin by people," she said in her presentation.</p>
        <p>But, she says, the pond is very deep and should be able to recover naturally from eutrophication if sewage is adequately treated and removed from the beach area, if shoreline modifications cease and if development is limited in the pond's drainage area.</p>
