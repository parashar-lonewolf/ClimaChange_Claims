        <p>Top officials at the Environmental Protection Agency are putting the final touches on what they call their first comprehensive statement of long-term goals, even as Congress prepares budget cuts that the officials say will make it impossible to achieve them.</p>
        <p>The agency's statement defines broad goals that largely conform to mainstream environmental objectives. They would establish concrete measures of success in the nation's effort to clean up the air in cities, the water in rivers, the emissions from automobiles and the poison in industrial toxic dumps. Some of these goals have been codified in laws like the Clean Water Act or in treaties like the one on global climate signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</p>

        <p>Top officials at the Environmental Protection Agency are putting the final touches on what they call their first comprehensive statement of long-term goals, even as Congress prepares budget cuts that the officials say will make it impossible to achieve them.</p>
        <p>The agency's statement defines broad goals that largely conform to mainstream environmental objectives. They would establish concrete measures of success in the nation's effort to clean up the air in cities, the water in rivers, the emissions from automobiles and the poison in industrial toxic dumps. Some of these goals have been codified in laws like the Clean Water Act or in treaties like the one on global climate signed in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</p>
        <p>The report is being prepared as demoralized officials at the agency, under the threat of the budget cuts, are preparing to lay off employees and curtail some programs.</p>
        <p>"What is so sad to me," Carol M. Browner, the agency's Administrator, said in a recent interview, "is that after taking all the time and effort to produce a work plan for the future, one that does not just say the water should be pure and the air should be clean, but that actually helps us measure performance, we are not going to be able to deliver on it."</p>
        <p>Republican leaders who proposed the cuts say they are intended to shift more responsibility to the states and give industry more flexibility in meeting environmental goals -- not necessarily to move the goal posts.</p>
        <p>The Senate is about to open debate on an Appropriations Committee bill that would cut $1 billion from the $6.6 billion the agency is spending in the current fiscal year. The House voted earlier to limit the agency to $4.9 billion in the fiscal year 1996, which begins on Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration, which had sought an increase in environmental spending, has threatened to veto legislation similar to either bill.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Browner and her senior planners say that they know the agency cannot escape with less than a 10 percent budget cut this year, and that it could be at least twice that. They also expect another large cut next year.</p>
        <p>Agency officials released their draft strategy statement partly in an effort to gain public support for their objectives.</p>
        <p>"This will be felt for a very long time," Ms. Browner said, referring to the budget cuts. "I want to make sure that people in Congress understand the magnitude of what they are doing."</p>
        <p>The report, "Proposed Environmental Goals for America with Milestones for 2005," is under review by the White House and other agencies.</p>
        <p>The report addresses what experts on both sides of the environmental debate call a glaring problem with existing programs. Although a few environmental laws contain explicit goals -- including many deadlines that were missed long ago -- for the most part the agency is driven by laws that demand regulations and expenditures, not results that can be objectively measured.</p>
        <p>Each of the targets was supposed to be what the agency's managers called "ambitious but realistic," the report says. They were developed last year in nine public meetings with business and environmental groups, state and local officials and citizens.</p>
        <p>For example, the draft calls for reducing the number of cities that do not comply with air quality standards to 6 in 2005, from about 60 now.</p>
        <p>The agency wants the percentage of rivers where water is judged safe for swimming to increase to 85 percent in the year 2000 and to 90 percent in 2005, from 82 percent in 1994.</p>
        <p>By 2005, the agency wants 90 percent of the nation's estuaries to be safe for harvesting shellfish; the figure in 1994 was 74 percent. And the agency's 2005 goal calls for reducing the annual discharge of pollutants from sewer overflows, water treatment plants and industrial sources by 2.4 billion pounds, or 14 percent, from 1992.</p>
        <p>The plan also calls for the agency to complete the main cleanup work at 910 toxic waste dumps, or 70 percent of the 1,300 sites, by 2005. The main work has been completed at about 300 of the sites.</p>
        <p>In addition to prohibiting the agency from meeting those goals, the officials say, the legislation before Congress would have these effects:</p>
        <p>*Eliminate money for the Administration's "climate action plan," a set of energy conservation measures meant to help the nation meet its Rio de Janeiro treaty commitment to reduce emissions of gases thought to cause global warming, to the 1990 level by 2000.</p>
        <p>*Cut hundreds of millions of dollars a year from programs that help states pay for water and sewage treatment plants, preventing attainment of several clean-water milestones.</p>
        <p>*Prevent the agency from carrying out programs to reduce automobile commuting and increase fuel efficiency, or otherwise counter the increasing consumption of gasoline. Agency officials said the cumulative effect would be like putting 22 million extra cars on the road.</p>
        <p>Congress also has plans to cut spending for the Superfund, which helps pay to clean up the toxic waste dumps. The proposed cut would give the program $1 billion, about two-thirds what the Administration requested.</p>
        <p>In addition, Congress is considering whether to repeal parts of the law that make polluters pay for cleaning up many toxic waste dumps, further complicating the outlook for the Superfund.</p>
