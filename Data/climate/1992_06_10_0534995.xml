        <p>Earth Summit negotiators sought today to bridge their differences on forest preservation and other contentious environmental issues, but officials warned that they might not reach agreement in time for world leaders to sign them on Friday, the day they all plan to attend.</p>
        <p>To speed up the negotiating process, summit coordinators planned to adopt streamlined parliamentary procedures on Wednesday. Celso Lafer, the Foreign Minister of Brazil, worked behind the scenes to pressure the various delegations to compromise.</p>
        <p>United States officials began to sound a note of frustration and irritation at what the Bush Administration regards as unwarranted criticism by both developing nations and European countries of Washington's environmental positions. The developing countries, for example, oppose a United States-backed treaty on forest preservations as an intrusion on their autonomy.</p>
        <p>"Certain countries are determined to sink this in an effort to embarrass the U.S.," one American official said after leaving talks on a declaration of principles for forestry use. "Every time the U.S. says something, India pops up and says the opposite." An Initiative That Wasn't New</p>
        <p>Countering his criticism, Kamal Nath, the Indian Minister of Environment and Forests, rejected charges that India and developing nations are blocking progress toward compromises. Referring to President Bush's offer last week to increase United States aid for forest protection, Mr. Nath said, "It was neither new, nor was it an initiative."</p>
        <p>Today, the mood among delegates ranged from gloom to patience in Rio Central, the conference center.</p>
        <p>"This conference is revolving more around politics and economics than around protection of the environment," a Jordanian delegate said, referring to slow progress on Agenda 21, the global action plan that is to be adopted before the end of the summit.</p>
        <p>But a few cubicles away, in a vast hall that looks like a miniature world's fair, a delegate from the Philippines, Delfin Ganapin, said that international conferences often hit lulls before the clock takes hold on negotiators.</p>
        <p>"The delegates are willing to make all efforts, even if it means we don't sleep at night, just to finish the documents," Mr. Ganapin said. Just Like Capitol Hill</p>
        <p>Senator Tim Wirth, Democratic of Colorado, compared the process to amending legislation in committee session on Capitol Hill. "It's just like a Senate markup," he said. "The negotiating goes until 3 A.M.</p>
        <p>But Michael Young, deputy chief of the United States delegation, seemed to have little confidence that a consensus could be reached on a declaration of principles on forestry management, which is the centerpiece of what Mr. Bush wants to achieve.</p>
        <p>The United States also said it was not yet prepared to sign the Rio Declaration, a statement of principles to guide nations in the pursuit of economic development while safeguarding the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said that some provisions of the declaration were "problematic." For example, he said, it would accord all countries the "right to develop." In the past, he said, some countries have used the right to develop as an argument to justify human rights violations.</p>
        <p>The United States also objects to language referring to occupied territories and a paragraph that puts primary responsibility for environmental degradation on industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said that Washington was keeping its options open "until we see what the total package looks like" on all issues under consideration.</p>
        <p>In another break with the United States, the European Community adopted a joint statement setting targets and timetables for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>And Britain's Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Howard, formally announced today that Britain would sign a treaty to protect plant and animal species that the United States has said it will not sign. U.S. Tops 'Worst' List</p>
        <p>Anti-American feelings remained high around the Earth Summit 48 hours before the President Bush is expected to arrive Thursday evening.</p>
        <p>On Monday, representatives of 150 private environmental groups voted to place the United States at the top of their list of "worst" nations on environmental policy. Saudi Arabia, in second place, was criticized for attempting to remove from treaties all language referring to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Japan was criticized for presenting itself as "an ecological superpower" while "silently supporting the United States."</p>
        <p>Terraviva, one of three English-language newspapers circulating among the 35,000 Earth Summit participants, published an editorial cartoon today depicting President Bush as a devil with horns and a forked tail. In addition, a small protest took place outside the Rio Central conference hall.</p>
