        <p>Coral reefs off the Florida Keys, part of the world's third-largest barrier reef ecosystem, will be protected from damage by large ships under a new international agreement, the Bush administration said today.</p>
        <p>The body of water stretching from Biscayne National Park to the Tortugas, 3,000 square nautical miles, is the first area designated in the United States to protect the reefs from anchoring, grounding and collisions from passing ships, officials from the Commerce Department said.</p>
        <p>The protected region, in the Florida Straits, includes the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which Congress and President George Bush created in 1990.</p>
        <p>Starting on Dec. 1, captains of ships longer than 164 feet will have to avoid certain areas in the protected zone and will be prohibited from anchoring in some other places. Nautical charts produced throughout the world will show the protected zone and reflect its requirements. Violators will face fines up to $100,000 per violation per day.</p>
        <p>Samuel W. Bodman, deputy commerce secretary, called the agreement a triumph of cooperation between federal officials, the shipping industry and the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations group that regulates the shipping industry.</p>
        <p>''This rare international form of protection now awarded to fragile Florida Keys coral reefs is an example of how federal resource managers can work closely with industry to protect vulnerable natural resources while simultaneously supporting shipping and economic growth,'' Mr. Bodman said. ''Both ship trade and the tourism tied to the Keys coral reefs have vital economic significance to the state and region.''</p>
        <p>The proposal has been supported by the Coast Guard, the State Department and environmental groups in Florida.</p>
        <p>More than 40 percent of the world's commerce passes through the Florida Straits each year, officials said. Ships have damaged the reef ecosystem through anchoring, groundings, collisions and the discharge of harmful substances. Ten large ships have grounded in the now-protected zone since 1984.</p>
        <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said coral reefs are threatened by pollution, overfishing and coastal development. A study on the health of 7,600 square miles of coral reefs within waters controlled by the United States and its territories, released last month by the agency, found that global warming also caused significant long-term damage to the reefs.</p>
        <p>There are four other protected areas like the one announced today: the Great Barrier Reef off Australia; the Sabana-Camag√ºey Archipelago in Cuba; Malpelo Island in Colombia; and the Wadden Zee in the Netherlands .</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 16, 2002, Saturday  An article on Thursday about an international agreement to protect coral reefs in the Florida Straits from damage by large ships cited an incorrect figure from the Department of Commerce on the amount of cargo that passes through the straits each year. It is 40 percent of the world's shipping commerce, not of all commerce.</p>
