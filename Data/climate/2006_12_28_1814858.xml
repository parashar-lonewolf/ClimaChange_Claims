        <p>THE TROUBLE WITH WIND -- Wind power is turning out to have complications. Engineers have cut the price of electricity derived from wind by about 80 percent in the last 20 years, but for all its promise, wind is unpredictable; it often fails to blow when electricity is most needed. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>HOPE FOR THE HOUSING MARKET -- Builders sold new homes at a faster rate last month than they did in October, shrinking the backlog of unsold homes on the market, the Commerce Department reported. But many economists said the report, rather than foreshadowing a quick rebound, suggested that the downturn now rattling the housing market had not yet run its course. [C1.]</p>
        <p>EARTHQUAKE DISRUPTS DATA -- Telecommunications across Asia were disrupted after an earthquake off Taiwan damaged undersea cables, jamming Internet services as voice and data traffic vied for space on smaller cables and slower satellite links. [C1.]</p>
        <p>THE DAY THE PIXELS FROZE -- People throughout Asia awoke yesterday to find themselves without e-mail or the Internet and, in some cases, without telephone connections after an earthquake ruptured undersea cables that are part of a communications fabric that circles the globe. [C5.]</p>
        <p>KIDNEY DIALYSIS IN DEMAND -- Tens of thousands of people across the country, their kidneys ruined by Type 2 diabetes, have been forced into the grim routine of dialysis care, and in New York, those patients routinely receive some of the worst treatment, government records show. [A1.]</p>
        <p>MOSCOW LINKS POISONING TO YUKOS -- The prosecutor general of Russia produced a startling new twist in the investigation of the killing of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer who died in London in November of radiation poisoning. It announced that it was investigating the possible involvement of former executives of Yukos Oil, the company dismantled by a prosecutorial assault last year. [A3.]</p>
        <p>GAZPROM THREATENS A CUTOFF -- Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, warned that gas supplies to European countries could be affected if Belarus makes good on a threat to disrupt pipeline transmission in response to a price increase. [A18.]</p>
        <p>NEW YORK'S FASHION WARS -- In Manhattan, a rivalry between the Scoop and Intermix clothing stores is becoming more visible as the two try to reach more young urban women who are able to afford luxury goods, at least occasionally. [G1.]</p>
        <p>OPTIMISM OVER STENTS -- Wall Street's fears of a steep decline in the $6 billion stent business seem to have evaporated after an inconclusive federal regulatory review of coronary stent safety this month, but the optimism may be premature. Market Place. [C3.]</p>
        <p>PROFITING FROM GREEN -- Even though it may be at least 2010 before the federal government imposes limits on the production of greenhouse gases, a growing number of American companies are already preparing for what they think will be a booming market after such rules are approved. [C4.]</p>
        <p>U.S. DELAYS VIRGIN AMERICA -- The federal government put a roadblock in the path of the start-up airline Virgin America, ruling that the company must change its ownership and corporate structure before it can receive an operating certificate. [C4.]</p>
        <p>THE DARK SIDE OF DOG BREEDING -- Rare dogs are highly prized in Japan and can set buyers back more than $10,000. But the real problem is what often arrives in the same litter: genetically defective sister and brother puppies born with missing paws or faces lacking eyes and a nose. [C1.]</p>
        <p>ADS FOR CLEAN AIR -- Nonprofit environmental organizations, many of which rely heavily on pro bono work filtered through the Advertising Council, say they are increasingly hiring small ad firms for special projects. Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>SETTLEMENT IN PAYOLA SUIT -- Entercom Communications, the radio broadcaster, has agreed to pay $4.25 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, over kickbacks paid for radio airtime. [C6.]</p>
        <p>DOW SETS RECORD -- The Dow Jones industrials surged past 12,500 for the first time as year-end bargain hunters picked up stocks across a variety of sectors. [C13.]</p>
        <p>ONLINE</p>
        <p>MANAGING GLOBALIZATION -- Daniel Altman, the International Herald Tribune's global economics correspondent, offers a look at the day's news on his blog at blogs.iht.com.</p>
        <p>ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- In a series of articles, a team of Times reporters has described how the world is, and is not, moving toward a more secure, and less environmentally damaging, relationship with energy. Several of them will respond to questions and comments today. You can post a question at nytimes.com/business.</p>
        <p>MEDICINE THEN AND NOW -- Technology and treatments have come a long way, but the gains have led to new challenges. A five-part series of columns by Lawrence K. Altman, looking back at developments in medicine over the last few decades, is at nytimes.com/health.</p>
