        <p>U.S. Reviews Russian Aid In Light of Security Issues  A Bush administration review of American assistance to Russia concluded that most of the programs aimed at helping Russia stop the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are vital to American security and should be continued, and some even expanded, an administration official said.</p>

        <p>Push for Energy Plan Starts But Prices Are Going Down  The Bush administration is starting a campaign-style push to drum up support for its energy plan this week, but the sense of crisis that had propelled the plan forward has receded while energy shortages ease and fuel prices fall. Gasoline prices have been going down for six weeks straight and now average $1.47 a gallon, compared with $1.71 a gallon when the administration unveiled its energy strategy in May.</p>

        <p>Fired Sunbeam Chief's Secret  Albert J. Dunlap wowed Wall Street when he was the chief executive of Sunbeam. His memoir became a best seller. Then, in 1998, he was fired and confronted with fraud allegations. Neither Sunbeam nor the Securities and Exchange Commission, both of which claim he acted fraudulently, knew that a quarter of a century ago Mr. Dunlap had faced similar accusations. They are detailed in court records obtained from the National Archives, where they had been stored for years.</p>

        <p>Fugitive in Carnegie Case Arrested at Miami Shelter  The authorities arrested the man wanted in the execution-style killing of three people in a drug robbery above the Carnegie Deli, tracking him to a Miami homeless shelter based on calls to the ''America's Most Wanted'' television show. The arrest of the fugitive, Joseph Sean Salley of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, put behind bars the second of two suspects in the May 10 killings, which turned the teeming Midtown theater district into a crime scene. The brutality of the crime, in which police say five people were shot in the head despite offering no resistance, jolted many New Yorkers after years of declining murder rates. The man accused of being Mr. Salley's accomplice, Andre S. Smith, 31, of Irvington, was arrested on May 22.</p>

        <p>Sex and the Ex-Soviets  A film about immigrant life in Brooklyn written, produced and acted by New York-area immigrants from the former Soviet Union has roiled the city's Russian-speaking community. Its producer, who is negotiating with Russian television stations and hopes to turn the film into a series, describes its plot as a cross between ''The Sopranos'' and ''Sex and the City.''</p>

        <p>Town Hit by Layoffs  The bottom has dropped out of an economic boom in Corning, N.Y., with Corning Inc. laying off about 1,000 people in the town of 11,000 after one of the businesses in the company's high-tech transformation fell apart. The company has stopped paying dividends to shareholders for the first time since 1945.</p>

        <p>Leonard's List  The prolific American novelist Elmore Leonard offers a Top 10 list of rules for writers and sums them up with one more: If it sounds like writing, rewrite it. And, drawing on John Steinbeck, he sounds a warning against losing readers by indulging in ''a bunch of hooptedoodle.''</p>

        <p>What the Moves Mean  Like other performing arts, dance is sharpening its marketing skills. In the meantime no dance seems to go unexplained. The needs of the most grizzled dancegoers are now attended to with everything from pre- and post-performance talks to lively information-age Web sites complete with dance-related games. The education of audiences has become an industry.</p>

CBS said its background check had found no record of assault arrests.</p>
