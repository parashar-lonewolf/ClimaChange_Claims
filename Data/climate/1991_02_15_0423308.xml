        <p>Fulfilling a promise it made almost two weeks ago, the United States said today that it would negotiate limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases thought by scientists to cause global warming.</p>
        <p>The United States also said it would consider providing financial and technical assistance to less developed nations that will be asked to halt the cutting of their rain forests and take other actions to curb the threat from rising temperatures around the world. Some of the actions could harm their economies.</p>
        <p>The United States position, agreed to by the White House in the final hours of an international conference here, set the stage for delegates from more than 100 nations to ratify a pact that establishes guidelines for negotiating a treaty to respond to the threat from global warming.</p>
        <p>"The meeting was a substantial step forward in that 100 countries agreed to established a framework by which to deal with the question of global climate change over the course of the next 16 months," said Michael R. Deland, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality.  U.S. Stand Criticized</p>
        <p>Leaders of environmental groups criticized the United States delegation, saying that American negotiators under the direction of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, had sought since the start of the conference on Feb. 4 to prevent more substantive discussion of potential solutions for global warming.</p>
        <p>David D. Doniger, a senior lawyer in Washington for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group said: "The largest problem that remains is that the United States is still not committed to targets or a timetable for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide."</p>
        <p>The international conference was the first of four to be held around the world before a meeting to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 to consider a treaty to reduce the threat from global warming.</p>
        <p>Many of the delegates meeting here said they had hoped to quickly establish the guidelines for the negotiations and then use the rest of their time in the United States to write a preliminary draft of the final treaty. Their plans were stymied by the American delegation's refusal to consider anything other than procedural issues.  U.S. Is Isolated</p>
        <p>The negotiating tactics put the United States at odds with almost every other nation represented here, including its closest allies. For instance, early in the conference Canada said it "enthusiastically supported the development" of a treaty that contained specific limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases, and welcomed schedules for meeting those limits.</p>
        <p>Officials in the American delegation said privately that they believed that the United States should take a more prominent position in negotiating an aggressive treaty for combating global warming but were being overruled by the White House, which was in touch with American negotiators throughout the conference.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said Mr. Sununu was skeptical of models that predict severe climatic change as carbon dioxide and several other gases were trapping heat in the atmosphere like the glass panes of a greenhouse. Mr. Sununu, said the officials, believes that without more conclusive scientific evidence, the United States should not commit itself to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide because such reductions are tantamount to reducing the use of oil and other fossil fuels and could lead to economic stagnation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sununu directed the American negotiators here to pursue an agreement only to establish guidelines for negotiating a treaty while preventing substantive discussions on the treaty itself, the officials said. Such negotiating tactics exasperated delegates who worried that there would not be enough time to write a final global warming treaty by June 1992. Efforts to reach Mr. Sununu today were unsuccessful. Text of Guidelines</p>
        <p>The text of the guidelines that were being discussed tonight call for establishing two principal working groups for negotiating a final treaty.</p>
        <p>The first group will prepare a draft of the final treaty that looks at "appropriate commitments" for limiting or reducing net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The group would consider measures to protect forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, from clear-cutting. And the group will negotiate measures needed to compensate and provide technological assistance for less developed nations that could be economically harmed by reductions of the greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The second working group will draft the legal language of a final treaty to counter the effects of global climate changes.</p>
