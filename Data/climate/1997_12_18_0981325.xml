        <p>Although he acknowledged that work remained to be done, President Clinton gave a remarkably upbeat assessment of his Administration's foreign-policy achievements at his news conference on Tuesday, a kind of sneak preview of his 1998 State of the Union Message.</p>
        <p>The picture was all but unrecognizable to many in Washington foreign-policy circles, including a number of senior Administration officials. Asked what he made of it, one such official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, rolled his eyes and replied, ''The President was just having a little political fun.''</p>
        <p>What puzzled many people about Mr. Clinton's words was not their partisan nature but the breadth of the claims he made at a time when the consensus among Western diplomats based here is that American foreign relations have hit a bad patch. They blame not just Mr. Clinton but the intractability of certain problems and the difficulty of formulating policy in an ambiguous era with severely limited agreement on goals, not only across party lines but also within parties.</p>
        <p>After a period of relative success in places like Bosnia, where American diplomacy stanched the blood-letting, and Mexico, where a bold American intervention helped solve a financial crisis, the tide seems to many to have slowly turned. United States relations with Russia and China, a pair of insecure giants, remain relatively stable, if full of unresolved questions. But elsewhere, the picture is not nearly so reassuring, diplomats say.</p>
        <p>In Iraq, the United States maintains that it has yielded nothing to Saddam Hussein to ease the latest crisis there; indeed, Mr. Clinton said Tuesday that ''we stood strong against a rogue regime in Iraq'' and insisted that United States allies were less likely than ever to press for easing sanctions.</p>
        <p>Yet in the behind-the-scenes maneuvering only Britain among the members of the Persian Gulf war coalition remains steadfast behind the American position, with France, Russia, Germany and most Arab countries favoring a softening of United Nations penalties. If another confrontation with President Hussein develops, furthermore, it appears likely that any military response will be left by the others to the United States and possibly Britain.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has agreed in principle to allowing Iraq to sell more oil so that it can use the revenues to buy food. The President suggested that this had been an American idea from the start; the Europeans say that Mr. Clinton has given way only in the face of strong European pressure.</p>
        <p>In a way, the two pictures of the situation in Iraq are reminiscent of the conflicting portrayals of the war in Vietnam in the 1960's, by President Lyndon B. Johnson on the one hand and anti-war campaigners on the other.</p>
        <p>There were other striking examples of rose-colored glasses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that ''under the Vice President's leadership'' conferees in Kyoto this month had taken ''an important step'' toward protecting the global environment from the climate-warming gases produced by burning fossil fuels. But Vice President Al Gore spent less than a day in Kyoto, and the United States agreed to a last-minute compromise on ''greenhouse'' gas emissions that was rendered more or less meaningless when Mr. Clinton made it clear that he would not submit the treaty to the Senate unless developing nations made concessions they had refused to make at the conference.</p>
        <p>Again, in the Middle East, even the forceful intervention of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has failed to get peace efforts back on course. Domestic politics in Israel make the necessary concessions difficult to grant, and Arab terrorist attacks strengthen the hand of the hard-liners. Mr. Clinton declined to meet the Israeli President, Benjamin Netanyahu, when he was in the United States recently, an action that many, including Mr. Netanyahu, interpreted as a snub.</p>
        <p>The President waved that idea aside with the comment that he had met Mr. Netanyahu five times and would meet with him next year. He said he would never insult Israel or the Israeli people; careful listeners may have noticed that he did not say he would never snub Mr. Netanyahu personally.</p>
        <p>On Bosnia, he ducked the question of extending the stay of American troops beyond next year's deadline, apparently because of squabbles on the issue within the Administration. But he said he would state his policy before leaving on a Christmas trip to Bosnia in only three days, and it became evident less than 24 hours after the news conference that he had decided to press for some sort of extension of the American commitment.</p>
        <p>Although long accustomed to a Washington policy-making process that is more haphazard than those typical in Europe and Japan, largely because of the divisions of power built into the Constitution, the European and Asian allies of the United States appear bewildered by what is going on now.</p>
        <p>''What is the structure? What is the goal?'' asked a Western European foreign minister in a conversation this month. ''The United States does not seem as deeply engaged as before, and where it is engaged, it seems unsure.''</p>
        <p>A European diplomat based in Washington commented that even though the United States possessed unmatched military and economic power, neither Congress nor Mr. Clinton seemed clear on exactly how it should be deployed in such places as Iraq and Bosnia. The preference, he said, seemed to be for ''second-guessing each other rather than acting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has exhibited great reluctance to commit United States forces abroad, which is not surprising given the Pentagon's considerable skepticism about armed interventions. A case in point has been the attitude of Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, who has only belatedly and reluctantly moved toward accepting the view that American troops should remain in Bosnia after a June 1998 withdrawal deadline.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright has taken a much more aggressive line, pressing within Administration councils and in a major speech at Harvard University for a more activist policy, both diplomatically and militarily. On Bosnia, she appears to be prevailing, but the Administration remains guarded in other areas.</p>
        <p>Arguably, the expansion of free trade -- and its corollary, the expansion of the number of market-economy democracies -- has been the most consistent theme in American policy in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Clinton's notable successes were the negotiation and approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and American approval of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He had hoped to build on those successes in his second term, but he was handed a bitter defeat by Congress when he sought added authority to conclude future deals.</p>
        <p>In some senses, Congress has been the largest impediment to the development of a coherent foreign policy in the period following the cold war, where there is no organizing principle comparable to the long struggle to stem Communist expansion. A majority of House members and 40 percent of the Senators have been elected since the fall of the Berlin wall. A third of all members of Congress are said to lack passports.</p>
