        <p>You're standing in the market, a half-gallon of organic milk in your hand. Your purchase is informed by the collective buzz -- a research study you've read somewhere, dinner table chat, the lyric prose on the carton (''A choice that leaves you feeling good inside and out'') and its cartoon happy cow. There's the urge to do the right thing. You feel a tad smug as you put the carton into the cart.</p>
        <p>Not so fast, say the Princeton bioethicist Peter Singer and his co-author, Jim Mason, a lawyer, in ''The Way We Eat.'' The demand for organic milk is increasing 20 percent a year. Pressure for growth means some organic producers are achieving corporate scale, replicating the problems of pollution and disease that plague the overcrowded feedlots of factory farms, and require yet more land to raise more organic grain. There's an incongruous global warming factor: through burping and flatulence, ''cattle may be responsible for close to half of the world's methane emissions.'' As for the dairy industry's claims that milk is a health drink, Marion Nestle in ''What to Eat'' is skeptical: ''Well, yes, but sometimes a food is just a food.''</p>
        <p>More than similar titles and accident of publication date unite Singer and Mason's and Nestle's books. Singer and Mason see food through the lens of animal suffering and environmental degradation; for Nestle, it's health, safety and the food industry. Taken together these important books represent a call to action for the state of the soul of American food.</p>
        <p>Singer and Mason, authors of the break-through book ''Animal Factories'' (1980), ask this question: Are inhumane farming practices too high a price to pay for cheap food? Their conceit is to follow the food; they visit three American families, eat with them, shop with them, then trace the content of their meals back to their origins in farms and factories. They begin in Mabelvale, Ark., with a family of four who eat a meat-and-potatoes Standard American Diet (a k a SAD). Grocery shopping at the family's local Wal-Mart sends the authors directly to a factory chicken farm. Their report on the horrors committed in the name of cheap meat could persuade you never to buy an industrial chicken again. They even hire themselves out to a turkey farm as artificial inseminators. That experience could cause you to rethink Thanksgiving: ''It was the hardest, fastest, dirtiest, most disgusting, worst-paid work we have ever done.'' During the pages on their visit to a beef factory farm, we realize we should worry less about whether to eat that hamburger and more about what the hamburger has eaten, which may include chicken litter that contains ''fecal matter, dead birds, chicken feathers and spilled feed,'' not to mention beef and bone meal. Theirs are not new stories. We know how veal is raised, yet we tend to forget in the soft glow of our favorite Italian restaurant. A baby male calf, ripped from its mother, faces ''16 weeks of confinement in semi-darkness, in a bare wooden crate too narrow to turn around.'' The authors, mindful of the moral weight of this accretion of information, are wise enough to maintain a restrained tone, rarely becoming judgmental or resorting to cheap shots. With facts like these, they don't need a wagging finger.</p>
        <p>The second family Singer and Mason visit, in Fairfield, Conn., call themselves ''caring carnivores.'' The authors ultimately prefer the term ''conscientious omnivore,'' and though both labels may make you wince in recognition, many of us will identify with them. The family members here are given to saying things like: ''Well, bacon's so wrong on so many levels.'' Yet that doesn't keep them from buying naturally raised Niman Ranch bacon from Trader Joe's, or Applegate Farms' uncured, antibiotic-free Genoa salami. Like the rest of us, they try to shop locally. They take stands, abandon them, feel guilty and just do the best they can. When we follow the bacon to a Niman Ranch pig farm in North Carolina, we behold a happy sow, ranging free. ''That single sow has as much space as a typical factory allocates to 700 sows confined in gestation crates,'' the authors report.</p>
        <p>Following salmon to a fish farm leaves us less sanguine. Raising salmon, as we've suspected, has a lot in common with raising chickens. When the authors call a mini-chapter ''Do Fish Feel It?,'' their affirmative answer includes disconcerting examples of how octopuses and squid can learn to open jars, and how endangered sea turtles are killed in the process of harvesting shrimp. Here's their moral absolute: ''If there is uncertainty about whether what we do will cause serious harm, we should give the benefit of the doubt to the being whom we might harm.'' We're relieved when they declare the risk of causing suffering to oysters, clams and scallops to be ''vanishingly slight.'' I come from the cooking end of the spectrum, where food in all its rituals and tradition of preparation matter, and I panic as I read on. From their unassailable perch on the moral high ground, what have Singer and Mason left me to make for dinner?</p>
        <p>When the authors drop in on their third family, vegans in Olathe, Kan., we observe parents and two daughters committed to ethical eating. Their diet features the family favorite: ''brown and wild rice stir-fried with tofu and red cabbage,'' plus soy, soy, soy, masquerading as everything from roast turkey to Häagen-Dazs. The wife has written a book on vegan parenting. Though Singer and Mason make a serious case for vegans (it takes 13 pounds of grain to produce a single pound of beef), they're realistic enough to admit this will probably never be a popular option. ''Personal purity,'' they write, ''isn't really the issue. Not supporting animal abuse . . . is.''</p>
        <p>Their search for an ethical food chain illuminates the food world. Yet as the authors pile the moral baggage on our shoulders, we begin to sag under its weight. All those jar-opening squid, all that non-fair-trade chocolate made by African kids who've never been to school, the ''irresolvable tension'' of jet-shipping strawberries out of season. There's a slyness in their presentation; they know the answers, but let us make discoveries for ourselves. They build their cases slowly, like the philosopher and lawyer they are. Because their arguments belong not to the lofty air of the philosophy classroom but to the warm hum of our kitchens, their work is vital, urgent and disturbing.</p>
        <p>For Singer and Mason, the loveliest phrase in the English language may be ''family farm.'' For Marion Nestle, the most unsavory would probably be ''processed foods.'' For her this means ''adding value'' through clever (and expensive) marketing, tricky packaging and the employment of harmful salt and sugar. If you find the supermarket increasingly alien, that's because it is. A bewildering 20,000 new products appear on grocery shelves each year. Take Whole Grain Cocoa Puffs, for example. Even sweetened with Splenda (Nestle is not a believer) and with its scant one gram of fiber, this so-called healthy cereal still has the same calorie count of the original. Deep into the more than 600 dense pages of ''What to Eat'' is a chart showing how added value works: a raw Idaho potato costs $.79 a pound; Terra Yukon Gold chips, $10.21. But Nestle is not the food police. This professor of nutrition and public health at New York University and well-known author of ''Food Politics,'' likes her potato chips just fine. With a calculator in hand and a scientist's skepticism, Nestle shoots straight though food industry hype. She pulls no punches: ''The science is complicated,'' she admits. Then she parses that same science for us with good-humored common sense backed up by file drawers of research. She shakes her head over the American diet: ''One third of all vegetables consumed in the United States come from just three sources: french fries, potato chips and iceberg lettuce.''</p>
        <p>Her book is radiant with maxims to live by: ''All margarines are basically the same,'' she reports, ''mixtures of soybean oil and food additives. Everything else is theater and greasepaint.'' She prefers a bit of butter. She's dismayed that there are more than 400 kinds of yogurt, a product she calls ''a fast-selling dairy dessert with the aura of a health food.'' Most flavored varieties are loaded with sugar. Nutritionally, she finds ''the focus on protein is silly -- Americans are anything but protein deficient.'' On chicken: ''if you eat the skin, you might as well be eating a hamburger.''</p>
        <p>Despite their decidedly dark view of where we stand, in terms of eating well, both books give reason for hope. Both see the environmental baby steps taken by McDonald's as steps, nonetheless. If Singer and Mason's stories of animal abuse make you weep -- and they will -- they also might make you reconsider your position on sirloin. The food world is fraught with ethical choices. As Nestle puts it, ''you cast your vote for your choice of food environment every time you put something in your shopping cart or order off a menu. If enough people vote with you, changes will happen.''</p>
