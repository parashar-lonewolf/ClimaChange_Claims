        <p>Overheard at a Macaroni Grill near the State Capitol one recent night: a diner telling her companions that Gov. Charlie Crist, barely past his 100th day in office, was as popular as John Lennon.</p>
        <p>Overstatement? Maybe not, at least in these early days of the Crist administration, marked by flexibility and more earnestness than has been seen since Mr. Rogers was on television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crist called himself a ''Jeb Bush Republican'' on the campaign trail last year, but he is proving a far different leader than his highly ideological predecessor Mr. Bush. Some of his biggest proposals -- to abandon touch-screen voting machines, for example, and let most felons easily regain voting rights after prison -- are almost like a finger in Mr. Bush's eye. Republicans have not complained -- publicly, at least, nor have Democrats found much to protest.</p>
        <p>Is this really Florida, where partisan division so vividly defined the presidential recount in 2000, the Terri Schiavo case in 2005 and Mr. Bush's efforts to end racial preferences in state college admissions?</p>
        <p>It is a different Florida, for now, led by a man who addresses every citizen he meets as ''my boss'' and gives his cellphone number to Democratic lawmakers who could not get Mr. Bush to return their calls. In an interview, Mr. Crist said he was not trying to remake the state as a bastion of centrism, but to carry out the will of its people, who he insists are not so politically divided after all.</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to lead with my heart,'' he said, ''and where I believe the people in Florida want us to go, after having listened to them. There's no grand plan.''</p>
        <p>A Quinnipiac University poll last month found that 73 percent of Florida voters -- including 71 percent of Democrats -- approve of the job Mr. Crist is doing. Mr. Bush was widely respected, but his highest approval rating in a Quinnipiac poll was 62 percent, during the brutal hurricane season of 2004.</p>
        <p>''His numbers are phenomenal, especially his opposition party numbers,'' Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, said of Mr. Crist. ''Whether they'll stand up is the $64,000 question.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crist has committed to fighting global warming -- looking into solar panels for the Governor's Mansion, among other things -- and expanding stem cell research in Florida. He created an Office of Open Government and urged the Legislature to give $5 million to the family of Martin Lee Anderson, a teenager who died after being beaten by guards at a county-run boot camp. He is also championing a black lawmaker's quest to retire the state song, ''Old Folks at Home,'' on grounds that its lyrics are racist.</p>
        <p>In his quest to please everyone, Mr. Crist is even considering a request by fans of Jim Morrison, the long-dead singer from the Doors, to pardon his convictions in 1970 for indecent exposure and profanity at a concert in Miami.</p>
        <p>But he warned not to confuse his affability with weakness, venturing to bring up an incident last fall that other Republicans might rather bury. President Bush had flown to Florida to rally support for Republicans the day before the election, and Mr. Crist had declined to join him, drawing snippy comments from Karl Rove, the president's top political adviser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crist said that former Gov. Reubin Askew, a Democrat, had pointed to the incident as proof that Mr. Crist was not just a pleaser.</p>
        <p>''You said no to the most powerful man on the planet,'' he recalled Mr. Askew telling him.</p>
        <p>While the Legislature has lauded Mr. Crist so far -- and he has treated it respectfully -- two weeks remain in the current session, and there are hints that he will not get everything he wants. The Legislature has not signed off on spending the $28 million to trade touch-screen voting machines for optical scanners, which leave a paper trail. Nor have they agreed to spend $37 million to stockpile bird flu medicine or $20 million for stem cell research, priorities for Mr. Crist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crist said he was growing ''concerned'' about the voting machine proposal.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to find anything more fundamental than ensuring the integrity of our elections,'' he said. ''I don't want my state to be embarrassed again.''</p>
        <p>Former Governor Bush, the president's younger brother, generally defended touch-screen voting and said skeptics had fallen prey to ''conspiracy theories.'' More Democrats than Republicans have advocated paper voting records nationally, and Mr. Crist said he feared that some Republican lawmakers were resisting on partisan grounds.</p>
        <p>More important to many voters are two other goals: lowering home insurance rates, which soared after several bad hurricane seasons, and property tax rates, driven up in many regions by a real estate boom. Mr. Crist has promised to ease the burden, and, if he fails, opinions of him may well go south.</p>
        <p>Known during his six years in the State Senate as a headline-seeker -- particularly for proposing that Florida bring back chain gangs for prison inmates -- Mr. Crist said he now preferred attainable goals to bold ones. He supports embryonic stem cell research, but he has endorsed a plan to finance only adult stem cell research, backed by the House of Representatives, which is more conservative than Mr. Crist and the Senate.</p>
        <p>And although Mr. Crist said he would have liked to help all felons except murderers and sex criminals regain their voting rights, he proposed speeding the process only for nonviolent felons to win over a skeptical member of the clemency board.</p>
        <p>''I want to move the ball down the field,'' he said. ''I have to live in the practical world here, and I understand that it's important to do what you can, instead of put out a marker and just make a political statement.''</p>
        <p>Former Governor Bush's thoughts on the Crist administration are not known; he has kept a low profile in Miami since leaving office and did not respond to e-mail seeking comment. In the interview, Mr. Crist mentioned recent discussions with two Democratic predecessors, Mr. Askew and Bob Graham, but spoke of former Governor Bush only when asked.</p>
        <p>''Big shoes to fill,'' he said, adding that he shared Mr. Bush's fervor for tax cuts and accountability in public education. ''But obviously we have a different style about how to achieve those things. It would be weird if we were monolithic.''</p>
        <p>His own style, Mr. Crist said, was shaped by advice from his mother.</p>
        <p>''You get a lot more with honey than you do with vinegar,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Time will tell.</p>
        <p>Florida Tax Swap</p>
        <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 18 (AP) -- The Florida House on Wednesday passed a proposed amendment to the State Constitution that would swap homeowner property taxes for higher sales taxes. If the proposal is passed by the Senate, it will appear on the ballot in November 2008. If approved, it could make Florida the only state without a personal income tax or property taxes on primary homes and would raise the statewide sales tax to as much as 8.5 percent from 6 percent.</p>
