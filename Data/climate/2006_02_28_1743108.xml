        <p>The cellphone was invented for men like Sir John Franklin. Pity that he was born about two centuries too early to make use of it.</p>
        <p>Franklin, the 19th-century explorer and the subject of half of ''Arctic Passage'' tonight on PBS, apparently had an excess of derring-do. These days, when men and women like him bite off more than they can chew and find themselves stranded on a cliffside or a back-country ski trail, they can pull out the trusty Nokia and summon a chopper. But back in 1845, when Franklin's elaborate, arrogant expedition in search of the Northwest Passage ran into trouble, the British government didn't even think of becoming alarmed until two winters had passed with no word from the group.</p>
        <p>''Arctic Passage,'' part of the ''Nova'' series, contrasts the harrowing tale of Franklin's vanished expedition with an account of another, successful effort led by the Norwegian adventurer Roald Amundsen 58 years later. The presentation is standard-issue television history, part re-enactment and part talking heads, but the two explorers' stories are fascinating.</p>
        <p>The Franklin expedition was a bold, well-financed effort by the British government to find a shorter sea route to Asia. Others had tried and failed, but the Franklin venture was confident, with two modified warships and 134 men. The program makes some educated guesses about what happened to them, based on artifacts and the accounts of a journalist who interviewed inhabitants of the region not long after. There is also embedded in the tale an amazing testament to human tenacity: Inuits may have sighted a few survivors a full six years after the expedition set out, on foot and still trying to find their way out of the endless Arctic expanse.</p>
        <p>The Amundsen outing took a much different approach -- fewer men, one small boat -- and ultimately succeeded. Often in science and exploration, as with the space shuttle disasters, for instance, pat-sounding testimonials are heard about one generation's failed heroics being a springboard for new discoveries, but the Amundsen expedition offers evidence that these are not platitudes after all. It succeeded in part because of maps made years earlier by those who had gone out to search for Franklin.</p>
        <p>The expeditions chronicled in ''Arctic Passage'' have a suicidal courage to them that's hard to fathom in our cellphone-packing age. And, as the program suggests in its final moments, the risks of Amundsen and Franklin now seem a bit quixotic as well. Global warming appears to be costing the Arctic much of its ice; northwest passages are easier to find every day.</p>
