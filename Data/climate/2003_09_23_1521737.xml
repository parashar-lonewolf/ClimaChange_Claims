        <p>Built-In Eyeshades</p>
        <p>Like most fashion accessories, eyeshades have evolved over the years. The old-fashioned green variety once worn by bankers and newspaper editors has long since given way to the modern cloth visor that professional golfers favor (particularly when they can get paid for wearing one emblazoned with the Nike logo across the front).</p>
        <p>But eyeshade evolution goes back much further, apparently. Scientists from Oxford University and the University of Alberta in Canada have found them on a trilobite that lived hundreds of millions of years ago.</p>
        <p>Trilobites are a class of hard-shelled creatures that were among the first arthropods, existing during the Paleozoic era, which lasted from 550 million to 250 million years ago. Fossilized remains have shown that some of these organisms had rather sophisticated eyes, much more complex than other species from the same era.</p>
        <p>The researchers studied a trilobite, Erbenochile erbeni, that lived on the sea floor in what is now Morocco some 400 million years ago. Its eyes are unusual, consisting of stacked layers of lenses that rise like two small towers above its head. (This arrangement, they note in describing the trilobite in a paper in the journal Science, gave it a 360-degree panoramic view.)</p>
        <p>At the top of each eye is an even more unusual feature: a lobe that juts out from the tower. This lobe, the researchers note, offers the stacked lenses protection from stray light from above that might affect its ability to see horizontally across the sea floor. Modern arthropods have avoided this problem by evolving different lens and photoreceptor systems. But for the ancient trilobite, the researchers note, this special eyeshade was the answer.</p>
        <p>On Moving Day</p>
        <p>The Paleozoic era was not just about trilobites with odd headgear. Among other things, it was when plants made the transition from water to land.</p>
        <p>Exactly when that occurred has been a subject of some controversy. The earliest hints come from the finding of tiny spores in 475-million-year-old rocks, placing them in the Ordovician period, a part of the Paleozoic. Although many scientists are certain that the spores came from land-based plants -- perhaps ancestors of the liverworts -- others theorize that they could have come from aquatic vegetation like algae.</p>
        <p>Now, researchers from the University of Sheffield in England and Petroleum Development Oman have gone a long way to resolving the debate. Working with Ordovician rocks from a borehole in Oman, they have found spore-containing structures that the researchers are convinced are fragments of land plants.</p>
        <p>The structures, called sporangia, were found by crushing fossil-bearing samples and sieving them through a fine mesh. Some are nearly complete, and though they are small, shorter than half a millimeter, they contain thousands of spores.</p>
        <p>The sporangia share qualities with those of later land plants, and the spores they contain are identical to other Ordovician spores. All this, the researchers say in describing their findings in the journal Nature, is compelling evidence that land plants existed 475 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Killer Whales' New Food</p>
        <p>Populations of sea lions, otters and seals in the North Pacific have declined precipitously for several decades. The common wisdom has been that a lack of food, caused by competition from fisheries or climate change, is responsible.</p>
        <p>But a team of researchers from the University of Alaska and other institutions and agencies has a different theory for the declines. Commercial whaling, they say, is to blame.</p>
        <p>Their hypothesis, described in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is that whaling wiped out large whales that were a chief food of killer whales. So the killer whales turned to smaller prey.</p>
