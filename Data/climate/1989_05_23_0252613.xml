        <p>LEAD: THE Finns, who have lived a careful life of political neutrality for more than four decades, are now confidently offering criticism and advice to their big neighbor to the east on a problem they did not even suspect until last year: damage to northern Finnish wilderness areas from Soviet air pollution.</p>
        <p>THE Finns, who have lived a careful life of political neutrality for more than four decades, are now confidently offering criticism and advice to their big neighbor to the east on a problem they did not even suspect until last year: damage to northern Finnish wilderness areas from Soviet air pollution.</p>
        <p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ''glasnost,'' or openness, led to a disclosure last October that several hundred thousand tons of air pollution from the Soviet Union was threatening the forests in the far north.</p>
        <p>''We first saw dramatic effects during the past summer, with areas of hundreds of hectares of coniferous forest undergoing severe defoliation,'' said Alec Estlander, head of the air pollution division in the Ministry of the Environment.</p>
        <p>''We weren't absolutely sure pollution was the cause,'' he said. ''But last October we visited the Kola Peninsula as guests of the Soviets, and they provided us with the figures. The emissions from two big smelters alone, up in the far north, were greater than from all sources in Finland.''</p>
        <p>The prevailing wind in Finland is from the southwest rather than from the Soviet Union. And pollution from Western Europe, Poland, East Germany and local sources has damaged trees and lakes far more severely than anything the Soviet sources have contributed, conceded Dr. Pekka Kauppi, leader of a research project for the environment ministry. But Finnish scientists had thought the thinly populated marsh and forest areas of Lapland were so far away they were safe. Exchanges Are Routine</p>
        <p>Environmentalists on the Soviet side of the border have been among the most vociferous people taking advantage of Mr. Gorbachev's call for public debate about the country's problems. They have denounced the large-scale desecration of natural resources, particularly in Estonia, 60 miles across the Gulf of Finland from Helsinki. The Estonians speak a language closely related to Finnish and are seeking political and economic autonomy.</p>
        <p>A trade union delegation from the Soviet Union came here last month to discuss environmental problems, and regular exchanges of information have become routine.</p>
        <p>''There has been a big change over there, and we want to work with them and try to get them to adopt solutions,'' said Markku Wallin, environmental secretary of the Finnish central trade union organization.</p>
        <p>The Finnish paperworkers union is especially interested in damage to the Finnish forests because forest products are a major industry here.</p>
        <p>''We didn't know there was a problem at all five years ago,'' Dr. Kauppi said. ''Now, we think the Soviets may have actually exaggerated the real extent of it.''</p>
        <p>The Finns, with the Environment Minister, Kaj Barlund, at the head of the delegation, went to Murmansk, Apatity and Monchegorsk in the Kola Peninsula as the guest of Fyodor T. Morgun, chairman of the Soviet state committee for protection of the environment. 'Forests Are Dying'</p>
        <p>There they were told that in 1987 two nickel smelters in Monchegorsk and Zapolyarny alone blasted 561,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air a few miles east of the Finnish border. The Soviet authorities said that by 1993 they hoped to reduce the annual figure to 290,000 tons.</p>
        <p>Those were the two worst single sites, but there were more, from paper pulp plants in Karelia and power plants in Estonia to factories in Leningrad. Together they produced 1.3 million tons of sulfur dioxide in 1987, which may be reduced to 850,000 tons annually by 1993. Besides sulfur dioxide, which is a major contributor to acid rain, there was pollution by heavy metal, mainly nickel and iron.</p>
        <p>''They are very worried on the Soviet side, as well,'' said Johanna Haavio-Mannila, a journalist who has traveled to the area. ''The forests are really dying. There is canker on the pines, and the needles turn yellow.'</p>
        <p>Finland exports more than $4 billion of such products as elevators, furniture and paper to the Soviet Union every year. In return, it gets about the same amount of raw materials, fuel and pulp.</p>
        <p>With any luck, Mr. Kauppi said, ''we may be able to halt the damage to the northern forests before it is too late.</p>
        <p>''In the south, we have clearly changed the ecosystem, particularly with lichens,'' he said. ''Older people notice that we don't have long beard lichens in southern Finland at all any more, and there have been fish kills in acidified lakes in southern Sweden and Norway. At least we have gotten early warning about the problems of the north.''</p>
