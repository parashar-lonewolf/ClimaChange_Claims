        <p>Correction of Sept 14 review of AMC documentary program R-Rated: Republicans in Hollywood, regarding spelling of one actor's name</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A television review on Tuesday about ''R-Rated: Republicans in Hollywood,'' an AMC documentary about politics and the movie industry, referred incorrectly to the box office performance of ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' a feature film with a global warming theme. Its domestic receipts totaled $186.4 million, and its worldwide sales $540.4 million, according to Variety.com; it was not a flop.</p>
        <p>The review also misspelled the given name of the actor who was a lone gun spokesman in the pre-Reagan days. He is Charlton Heston, not Charleton.</p>
