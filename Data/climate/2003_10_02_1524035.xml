        <p>Sens John McCain and Joseph I Lieberman, sponsors of bill to fight global warming, say they will soften bill to gain support; modified bill will still call for bringing carbon dioxide emissions down to year 2000 level by 2010, but will drop call for 1990 levels by 2016; Massachusetts Institute of Technology study says new plan will cost families $10 to $20 per year; both plans are far less aggressive than limits in Kyoto Protocol, international treaty rejected by Pres Bush (M)</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The two senators who are sponsoring legislation to fight global warming announced on Wednesday that they would soften the bill to gain support for a vote expected this month.</p>
        <p>''By modifying the bill, we expect to build additional momentum for the measure in the Senate,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said at a Senate hearing on climate change.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, have proposed limits for greenhouse gases from the industrial, utility, commercial and transportation sections of the economy, which together produce nearly 80 percent of American global warming emissions. Households, agriculture and smaller businesses would be exempt.</p>
        <p>The modified bill would, as the original did, try to bring carbon dioxide emissions down to the levels of the year 2000, starting in 2010, but it drops a follow-up phase calling for 1990 levels starting in 2016.</p>
        <p>To ease the impact of these constraints, the bill sets up a framework for companies to buy and sell the rights to emit carbon dioxide, similar to the highly successful 1990 acid rain program. Opponents of carbon dioxide regulation call their legislation the equivalent of an ''energy tax'' since the gas is a product of the use of coal and oil.</p>
        <p>A study of the new proposal by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that the costs to be passed on to consumers would be $10 to $20 per family per year; the original plan, with its lengthy timetable, could have cost $30 per family annually in the early years, growing to as much as $400 per family by 2020.</p>
        <p>The original plan and the revised version are far less aggressive than the limits in the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty rejected by President Bush, which would require industrialized countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by 2012. This would be the first Senate vote on a global-warming issue since 1997 when it adopted a resolution, 95 to 0, that said the United States should not sign any international agreement on climate change that would seriously harm the American economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman and Mr. McCain have tried to bring their proposal to the floor for two years but have been stymied, by the opposition of the White House, which prefers voluntary controls, and by Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Senate environment committee.</p>
        <p>The hearing on Wednesday and the coming Senate vote are the byproduct of the July negotiations over the energy bill, to which the senators tried to attach their proposal as an amendment. Instead, Senator McCain gained an agreement with Senate leaders for a vote on their proposal as a stand-alone bill this fall, with six hours of debate and no unexpected amendments.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups have unified to lobby for the bill, which has some bipartisan support, including that of a few northeastern Republican senators. But the bill is unlikely to win enough support to pass.</p>
        <p>Still, environmental groups say the vote remains a milestone for fighting global warming because the simplified measures essentially make this a yes or no vote on whether carbon dioxide regulation is needed.</p>
        <p>''It's not about the specifics or mechanics of the program,'' said Jeremy Symons, the climate change director for the National Wildlife Federation. ''It's about whether or not you think something should be done or if you think it should be researched indefinitely.''</p>
