        <p>Over the last few years, some scientists have begun quietly wondering whether the huge effort to reduce nitrogen pollution in Long Island Sound will really be the magic bullet that delivers a long-beleaguered estuary to ruddy health.</p>
        <p>New information concerning climate change and water temperature has raised questions about the scope of the sound's problems. And studies have shown that the low level of oxygen in the water, which nitrogen reduction was supposed to correct, is a more complicated issue than previously thought.</p>
        <p>Now, New York City's Department of Environmental Protection is charging into the thick of those questions, hoping to save $1 billion for the city's battered budget and lead what the department's commissioner, Christopher O. Ward, hopes will be a sweeping re-evaluation -- if not a small revolution -- in communities around the sound about how nitrogen pollutes the waters and how to remove it most efficiently.</p>
        <p>''We just think there's a way to do it potentially smarter and better, and we hope the other participants in the sound would adopt that strategy,'' Mr. Ward said.</p>
        <p>Officials at the department, which is bound by a consent agreement with the State of New York to refit four East River sewage treatment plants with nitrogen-reducing technology at a cost of $1.3 billion, say they believe they can achieve the same results for only about $300 million over the next 10 years by using more efficient technologies that have been recently developed and in some cases are already in use in Europe. Agency officials, who are scheduled to present their budget plans to the City Council today, said they had begun negotiations with the state about amending the consent order.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ward said he wanted to have a broader debate as well about what exactly is being achieved by the nitrogen-cutting efforts in New York and Connecticut. He said that while he did not question the need to reduce nitrogen as a means of increasing the levels of oxygen, the ways and means definitely should be challenged.</p>
        <p>''Do you know you will solve the dissolved oxygen problem if you build?'' he said. ''The answer is less certain than it was.''</p>
        <p>He added that with city finances in crisis, his agency had also been forced to shift resources to where they are most urgently needed in the next few years -- to the city's watershed and reservoir system upstate.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen, whether it comes as runoff from backyard gardens, treated sewage or out of the sky from smokestacks and tailpipes, pollutes the sound by being what it is: a fertilizer. It stimulates the growth of microscopic plants and animals that decompose on the bottom when they die, and it is the decomposition process that robs the water of oxygen that fish and lobsters and other creatures need.</p>
        <p>Conversely, the nitrogen is reduced in sewage by having bacteria eat it under controlled conditions -- in a treatment plant's holding tanks. The new processes envisioned by the city would be cheaper than the traditional method, officials say, primarily because less land and fewer tanks are needed. One plan under consideration, for example, developed by a company in the Netherlands, also uses a heating process that speeds up the bacterial activity.</p>
        <p>Because full details of the city's plan have not been issued, environmentalists and government regulators said they would need more time before they could comment.</p>
        <p>The federal Environmental Protection Agency's regional administrator, Jane M. Kenny, said in a statement that the agency remained firmly committed to seeing that the nitrogen reduction targets identified for the sound are met in New York City and throughout the region.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' the statement continued, ''we are always open to hearing about possible ways to achieve those reductions more quickly and at less cost.''</p>
        <p>But the proposal's real impact, and most responsive constituency, is likely to be found among the many fiscally stressed communities around the sound, where most estimates of the nitrogen program's total cost easily top $2 billion. Last month, for example, the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, sent a letter to local businesses and environmental groups saying that the county, while still committed to the nitrogen program, would need major government assistance to avoid sewer tax increases that could amount to 300 percent or more. He asked the letter's recipients to begin thinking about how to help.</p>
        <p>Several scientists who specialize in the sound said they thought a broad new discussion of the issue would be healthy for the spirit of research as well.</p>
        <p>''Nitrogen reduction is not based on very strong science,'' said Hans Dam, an associate professor of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut. ''We know that reducing it is a good thing -- there's no question about that. The question is, how do we balance the expenditures on nitrogen reductions with what we want to get out of it, and the answer is that we're really on shaky ground when it comes to that.''</p>
