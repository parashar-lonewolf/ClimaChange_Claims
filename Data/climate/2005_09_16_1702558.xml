        <p>The City Council passed legislation yesterday that would require any major building construction or renovation paid for with city capital funds to adhere to "green standards," which include using renewable energy sources and conserving materials. Council leaders said the law would affect $12 billion in planned construction projects, including $5 billion for new schools. The Council also passed a law to increase fines on stores that lock workers in against their will as a way to prevent thefts, and another one that strengthens human rights protections for city residents.
