        <p>IN THE BEGINNING After COBE and Before the Big Bang. By John Gribbin. 274 pp. Boston:  Little, Brown &amp; Company. $22.95. EQUATIONS OF ETERNITY Speculations on Consciousness, Meaning, and the Mathematical Rules That Orchestrate the Cosmos. By David Darling. 190 pp. New York:  Hyperion. $19.95.</p>
        <p>WHAT came before the big bang? Augustine, in a sense, asked the question first, and, anticipating Einstein, reported that since time was an attribute of the universe God could not have been doing anything before He made the universe. Before time there was eternity. Today "God" or "eternity" are as logical as any answers available from science. But the recent successes of the big-bang theory and modern particle physics in supplying a consistent and at least semi-believable account of the evolution of the universe from its first fraction of a second have emboldened would-be metaphysicians who would like to speculate about the larger picture, and attempt to construct what we might call cosmic mythology.</p>
        <p>I don't know if John Gribbin and David Darling are drinking buddies but "In the Beginning" and "Equations of Eternity" could have been hatched over drinks in some Cambridge pub one night. Both authors are British astrophysicists with popular books to their credit (Mr. Gribbin's include "In Search of Schrodinger's Cat"; Mr. Darling is the author of "Deep Time"). Both have acquainted themselves admirably with a broad swath of knowledge outside their own fields, which they relate ably and eloquently. Both tell the same stories and agree on most scientific issues, even to the point of repeating the same quotations from the British renegade astronomer Fred Hoyle. That they wind up with opposite conclusions about the meaning of the big bang, life and the universe only serves as a reminder that on the quest for meaning, metaphor and courage (perhaps recklessness) are staunch allies.</p>
        <p>For John Gribbin the metaphor of choice is Darwinian evolution. And his main point is that applied to astrophysical systems it is no metaphor: rather, Earth (Gaia), the Milky Way galaxy and even the universe itself -- not just its parts -- are actually alive, breeding baby universes in the dark dense innards of black holes, which can in turn breed new black holes, new universes and so on, each with its own slightly different set of physical laws. This may be a runaway metaphor but it is entertaining. Leaping nimbly from the synthesis of organic molecules in deep space to the mechanics of DNA, genetics and evolution on Earth to global warming, stellar nucleosynthesis and particle physics, Mr. Gribbin strings together enough controversial statements to keep experts in a dozen different fields heatedly engaged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gribbin makes much out of what he calls the "Goldilocks principle" -- various features of nature, like the values of physical constants, which in principle could have any value but instead seem mysteriously tuned to propitious values. "Like Baby Bear's porridge," Mr. Gribbin writes, "the universe seems to be 'just right' for us." If the so-called "strong force" that binds atomic nuclei were slightly stronger or weaker, for example, no elements heavier than helium would be made and the universe would be barren.</p>
        <p>Does this mean, as some have suggested, that the universe was designed with us in mind? Mr. Gribbin is more hardheaded than that. He argues that life is simply a happy byproduct of the universe's main purpose, which is to produce more black holes and thus more universes. Only a universe whose laws permit the formation of massive stars that can burn out and collapse to form black holes, for example, can succeed in reproducing itself. Along the way, however, these same stars produce carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, the elements essential for life. The universe does what is right for the universe; life is just along for the ride.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darling, on the other hand, would put life and, more specifically, mind at the center of the cosmos. Indeed for him the mind is the cosmos. Tracing its development from strands of biological wire carrying flight-or-fight messages to the bulging, layered modern brain with its holistic right side and analytical left side complementing each other, the better to cope with that shadowy thing on the other side of the senses we call reality, he quotes Sir Arthur Eddington: "Mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience. All else is remote inference -- inference either intuitive or deliberate."</p>
        <p>Of all the dainty relationships in nature, Mr. Darling suggests, none may be more significant than that suggested between the mind and reality by quantum theory. At the heart of this richly disturbing and paradoxical set of rules that seem to describe how nature behaves on the smallest scales is the notion, embedded in the famous uncertainty principle, that a subatomic particle like an electron is not quite real and does not have definite properties or location until it is actually measured. The observer is a participant in what he observes. "In a sense," writes Mr. Darling, "this is genesis at work, here and now: the making of the real from the unreal, the breathing of fire into the equations that underpin the world."</p>
        <p>Mr. Darling provides one of the clearest and most eloquent expositions of the quantum conundrum and its philosophical and metaphysical implications that I have read recently. He can turn a phrase well enough to pull perhaps more than a few readers, whose good judgment might normally dictate otherwise, with him as he gracefully swan dives completely off into the deep end of cosmic speculation.</p>
        <p>Following the lead of, among others, John Wheeler, the legendary physicist who named black holes, Mr. Darling suggests that the quantum principle is a prescription for a sort of participatory cosmology, in which we are all (including alien races under foreign suns) engaged in making the universe real through a hodgepodge of billions upon billions of little quantum observations. In effect the universe bootstraps itself into existence. The process is just beginning. While we are busy coaxing a few electrons into reality, we are ourselves being "watched" into reality by the nearly infinite intelligence in which our sprawling, networked society will eventually culminate: the watcher at the end of time. The universe, Mr. Darling says, will have become its own God. "Then, as the cosmic mind thinks, its substance -- which ultimately may include all the substance of the universe -- will spontaneously reorganize itself. Our dreams and ideas and abstractions will manifest themselves immediately in reality."</p>
        <p>Augustine would be amused, I think, but perhaps not convinced. WHAT GOOD IS AWARENESS?</p>
        <p>The universe did not set out to be aware. During the first few chaotic microseconds, when all the matter and energy there would ever be was erupting from the primeval fireball, there was no great plan to make conscious minds. Nature is congenitally blind. Evolution is not, and never was, a steady march toward a certain type of order, or life, or consciousness. There is no way of knowing in advance what forms nature will take, no favorites, no movement toward a predetermined goal.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it is hard to believe that we are here by chance. Why are we aware? Why has self-consciousness come about? The most banal (but not the least pertinent) reply is that if it had not, the question could never be asked. But that is hardly satisfying. At least in principle, we can envisage all sorts of possible universes in which there were no brains, no intelligence, no life of any kind. Why does the only universe we know happen to be capable of knowing itself?</p>
        <p>In contemplating this puzzle, we are inevitably drawn to others. What purpose do brains and awareness serve? . . . How did consciousness ever get off the ground? . . . How does awareness -- and, in particular, self-awareness -- work? How can the universe simultaneously exist and in some corner of itself (our heads) form a self-reflexive, self-aware model of itself?
