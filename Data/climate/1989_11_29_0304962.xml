        <p>LEAD: Kris Beck is a political science major at the University of Chicago who plans to become President of the United States. That's why he signed up for Natural Science 104.</p>
        <p>Kris Beck is a political science major at the University of Chicago who plans to become President of the United States. That's why he signed up for Natural Science 104.</p>
        <p>''Knowing about science will be a big help,'' he said. ''George Bush talks about agreements on acid rain and so forth, but he doesn't really get the big picture.''</p>
        <p>Natural Science 104, dealing with biological evolution, is one piece of Chicago's answer to the question: What should the educated nonscientist know about science?</p>
        <p>''As voters, our students will be making scientific judgments on everything from the ozone layer to nuclear radiation,'' said Michael LaBarbera, a professor of biology who coordinates the program. ''They need to be able to evaluate arguments, and to do this they need to understand how science works.''</p>
        <p>The question is an important one -although one that has generated few satisfactory answers.</p>
        <p>The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching estimates that 85 percent of American colleges and universities require undergraduates to fulfill a science requirement, usually in one of two ways.</p>
        <p>Some run everyone through ''baby'' or introductory-level courses in disciplines like geology or biology. Others offer special math-free courses for nonscientists with familiar nicknames like ''physics for poets'' or ''rocks for jocks.''</p>
        <p>Neither approach works well, college administrators say. ''The introductory courses are fine for teaching basic knowledge to future majors,'' said Susan Resneck Parr, dean of the college of arts and sciences at the University of Tulsa. ''But regular students with science anxiety don't need this kind of specialization.''</p>
        <p>S. Frederick Starr, the president of Oberlin College in Ohio, rejects special courses as bonbons for nonscientists that ''reek of condescension.''</p>
        <p>Many introductory courses require hands-on laboratory experience, though not necessarily the sort that a working scientist would recognize. Instead of exploring open-ended questions, students are judged on how well they follow directions to predetermined conclusions. ''It's like using a cookbook,'' Mr. Starr said.</p>
        <p>As alternatives, a growing number of colleges have begun to devise creative means of teaching what Mr. LaBarbera calls ''the scientific analog of cultural literacy.'' The goal is usually twofold: to show students how scientists pose and answer questions, and to demonstrate how science crosses disciplinary lines.</p>
        <p>Columbia University offers the science equivalent of the ''great books'' approach. In the course ''The Theory and Practice of Science,'' students study enough mathematics, crystallography and other technical material to wend their way through scientific works like James D. Watson's and Francis Crick's classic paper, ''Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids,'' which laid out the chemical basis of heredity.</p>
        <p>''We want them to understand that the impulse to ask scientific questions is the same impulse that causes a musician to write music or a poet to write poetry,'' said Robert E. Pollack, a professor of biological sciences, who designed the course.</p>
        <p>At the University of Chicago about 15 percent of students elect a two-year, six-course sequence titled ''Evolution of the Natural World.'' It starts with the origins of the physical universe and runs through biological evolution and contemporary environmental issues, showing how concepts like radiation are relevant to animals as well as the physical universe.</p>
        <p>''We cover a lot of sexy issues like the Big Bang theory and how much of Florida will be under water if a major ice floe melts,'' Mr. LaBarbera said. ''When we deal with the origins of the universe everyone starts writing poetry.''</p>
        <p>Central to the Chicago sequence is laboratory work in which students must choose a problem to study, formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment and collect and criticize their data. Last year one student, Robert Kramer, explored the most efficient body size for burrowing earthworms. Other topics have included the eating habits of shrimp and the effect of hand shadows on clams.</p>
        <p>How far the Chicago approach could be expanded is unclear. Laboratory time is expensive, and the usual faculty reward system does not encourage professors to devote time and effort to such programs.</p>
        <p>''Most universities give more credibility to getting research grants than to developing new courses,'' said M. Patricia Morse, a biologist who is president of Sigma Xi, the honorary scientific society.</p>
        <p>Some faculty members, though, think that developing scientific literacy among nonscientists is becoming just as urgent as turning out professional scientists.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaBarbera, of the University of Chicago, says he likes the challenge of broadening horizons. ''Most of our students are urban, and the only animals they know are dogs, cats, rats and cockroaches,'' he said. ''Except for cockroaches, they are all vertebrates.''</p>
