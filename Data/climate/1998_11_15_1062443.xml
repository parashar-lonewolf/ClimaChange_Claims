        <p>After an all-night session in Buenos Aires, negotiators from more than 150 countries early yesterday set a deadline of two years for adopting operational rules for cutting emissions of waste industrial gases that are believed to cause global warming.</p>
        <p>With that, proponents of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty under which the reductions are to be made, declared victory in the two-week round of talks.</p>
        <p>Expectations were low going in: United Nations officials, American diplomats and environmentalists said at the outset that they would consider the Buenos Aires meeting a success if it adopted a work program for fleshing out the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
        <p>That was done. But beyond that, the treaty's backers said the conference revealed a shift in the worldwide debate on how to deal with the possibility of disruptive climate change brought about by emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of oil, coal, wood and natural gas.</p>
        <p>Buenos Aires made clear, they said, that both industry and developing countries were becoming more engaged in the effort to control emissions and in trying to make the Kyoto Protocol eventually work.</p>
        <p>Under the protocol, negotiated last December in Japan, industrialized countries agreed to accept legally binding reductions in greenhouse gases averaging about 5 percent below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012.</p>
        <p>The protocol set up a number of mechanisms that was said to achieve the cuts most effectively and at least cost. Chief among them was a plan to allow countries to trade in emission rights, and another plan, called the clean development mechanism, to allow rich countries to invest in emissions-reducing enterprises in developing nations.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, Argentina became the first developing country to announce that it would assume binding targets and timetables for controlling emissions. Kazakhstan followed. Honduras led a Latin American proposal to speed up introduction of the advent of the clean development mechanism. Some African nations expressed interest in becoming more involved.</p>
        <p>All of this led Stuart Eizenstat, the chief American negotiator, to declare a ''sea change in attitude'' after the talks concluded.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, many businesses have abandoned a posture of hard opposition to emissions reduction in favor of being actively constructive. A number of big companies, including General Motors, Monsanto, Shell and British Petroleum, have recently adopted such a stance, and Mr. Eizenstat said yesterday that their representatives seemed to outnumber fossil-fuel industry hard-liners in Buenos Aires.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Eizenstat pointed out there was still considerable opposition to the Kyoto Protocol in the ranks of industry. The two biggest and most influential developing countries, China and India, continued to take a hard line against any sort of specific emissions reduction targets for poor nations until rich ones are actually reducing theirs.</p>
        <p>And not everyone agreed with the Eizenstat assessment. ''I don't think the business community is split,'' William F. O'Keefe, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said this week. While a number of companies are indeed taking a constructive course, he said, few support the Kyoto Protocol as the way to deal with the problem.</p>
        <p>In general, the fossil-fuel industry and conservative American politicians continue to portray the protocol as a misbegotten instrument that will not work and will be too costly to the American economy.</p>
        <p>Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said in Buenos Aires, as he has for the last year, that the protocol will never be ratified by the  Senate. Under the rules of ratification adopted in Kyoto, the protocol cannot go into effect if the United States does not approve it. Senator Hagel also minimized the significance of the actions by Argentina and Kazakhstan, noting that there were 132 other developing countries.</p>
        <p>Now that countries are coming to grips with what was decided in Kyoto, he said, ''the cold stone wall of fact and reality has set in, and I think from here on it gets pretty tough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eizenstat agreed. ''There are still very, very daunting challenges,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, proponents hailed the modest achievements of Buenos Aires. The agreement on a deadline for fleshing out the protocol ''insures that the nations of the world will continue moving forward against the threat of global warming,'' Vice President Al Gore said.</p>
        <p>Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the talks had resulted in ''forward progress'' and ''major strides.'' He said the talks marked the start of ''a whole new phase'' in which people are beginning to understand the value of market mechanisms in reducing emissions.</p>
