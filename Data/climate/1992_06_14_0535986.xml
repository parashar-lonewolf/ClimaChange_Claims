        <p>THE awkward interplay between election-year maneuvering and environmental concerns received plenty of attention last week as President Bush took a hang-tough, us-against-the-world approach toward the Earth Summit. At the same time, a factor that played a huge role behind the scenes was largely ignored. That factor was economics.</p>
        <p>The Administration demanded and won a weakened version of a treaty on climate change on the grounds that accepting tough new rules to limit carbon dioxide emissions would hurt economic growth. Similarly, Mr. Bush said he would not sign the biological diversity treaty, which aims to conserve millions of plant and animal species, because the Administration feared it would damage one of the economy's fastest growing sectors: the biotechnology industry.</p>
        <p>The United States was the only major country to reject the biodiversity treaty, helping turn Mr. Bush into the Darth Vader of the Rio meeting, which was attended by more than 100 heads of state. The United States also found itself isolated when it refused to join Germany's call to strengthen the climate change treaty by requiring nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Many scientists believe the buildup of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere is contributing to the earth's warming. No Apologies</p>
        <p>In Rio, President Bush proclaimed to the other assembled heads of state: "America's position on environmental protection is second to none, so I did not come here to apologize." But nothing about this trip, it seemed, was auspicious -- certainly not its beginning in Panama, where the stench of tear gas and the echo of gunfire from a nearby demonstration forced the President to flee a pro-American rally before he could address it.</p>
        <p>Once he arrived at the summit, a lot of what Mr. Bush said and did was focused on the domestic American economy for domestic political reasons. But in seeming so openly to be carrying water for American industries that seek protection from new environmental restrictions, he ran the risk of unflattering comparisons to his trip to Japan, which turned into an effort to sell American autos and auto parts to a clientele that thinks them inferior.</p>
        <p>This was particularly evident when the Americans in Rio tried to paint the Germans and Japanese as Johnny-come-latelies on the environment. In fact, in some areas, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, the Germans have been working for some time to make their industries and those of their neighbors environmentally efficient.</p>
        <p>Over the last few months lobbyists from a variety of industries have sent a barrage of letters to President Bush and conveyed their views to Vice President Dan Quayle's Council on Competitiveness, which many critics of the Administration say is calling the shots on environmental policy in this Presidential election year. The German environmental minister, Klaus Topfer, said in an interview in Rio that he hoped the cold war was not being replaced by a North-South rivalry on environmental issues. "I am afraid," he said, "that conservatives in the United States are picking 'ecologism' as their new enemy."  Focusing on Growth</p>
        <p>Many American business executives and economists, meanwhile, argue that after the initial costs of investing in new technology are absorbed, reducing emissions would lead to greater energy efficiency and, perhaps, higher profits. The Administration's failure to come to grips with this, say many environmentalists, is typical of the live-for-today approach that marks its policies toward oil consumption, forests and other finite resources.</p>
        <p>But at home, Mr. Bush has been lambasted far less for his positions on the environment than for overseeing the slowest three and a half years of growth of any postwar Presidential term. So it did not seem a coincidence that Mr. Bush put his accent on economic growth at the summit.</p>
        <p>In rejecting the biodiversity treaty, he said it could weaken patent protections for biotechnology companies and thus discourage research and innovation. "Remove incentives and we will see fewer of the technological advances that help us protect our planet," he said. This approach has a welcome audience in most pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which say that the treaty would hamper efforts to test and use organisms from the third world for new products, and that its ambiguous language would make them share patents with developing countries.</p>
        <p>Many scientists backed the treaty, however, fearing that one-fourth of the planet's species could disappear over 50 years. The treaty aims to get developing countries to do more, like protecting forests, to help species survive. To compensate them, it says countries that provide species used in products shall be provided technology under "most favorable terms."</p>
        <p>Sounding the alarm for industry, G. Kirk Raab, president of Genentech, a leading biotechnology company, wrote a letter to President Bush saying, "The vague language relating to 'technology transfer' and equitable sharing appear to be code words for compulsory licensing and other forms of property expropriation."</p>
        <p>Pharmaceutical companies regularly screen thousands of tropical plants in search of a cure for cancer and a means of crippling the virus that causes AIDS, for example. Industry officials admit that they cannot quantify how much the treaty might add to costs and reduce research, but they argue that developing new drugs is an uncertain process already, and new costs would only put more pressure on it.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say such opposition is overblown. They interpret the treaty as saying companies do not have to turn over technologies or pay royalties unless they agree to.  And they argue that if the Administration really cared about Rio, it could have easily negotiated a few changes in the treaty, or accepted the ambiguous document and negotiated more satisfactory implementing documents in future years.</p>
        <p>As for the climate change treaty, the Administration argued that it would be wrong to accept strict regulations to reduce carbon dioxide, noting that many scientists say no one has definitively proved that greenhouse gases are warming the globe. Administration officials also cite studies showing that a program to cut carbon dioxide emissions, perhaps through a tax on fossil fuels, would reduce output. Environmentalists, though, say there is enough evidence linking carbon dioxide to global warming to warrant acting now, and they cite studies showing that cutting carbon emissions could create jobs overall by creating a need for new technology. The Checkbook</p>
        <p>The Administration also expressed some reservations about Agenda 21, the summit's overarching, non-binding, moral document, which sets a blueprint for global environmental protection. But in the end, Mr. Bush signed it. Agenda 21 calls on industrialized countries to vastly increase their aid to the developing world, especially to protect its environment. Mr. Bush said "the day of the open checkbook is over," but he nevertheless pledged $1.4 billion for research on climate change and $150 million to preserve the world's forests, which absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>While it blocked a tougher climate treaty, the Administration boasts that the United States is one of the few countries with an action plan on carbon emissions -- a plan it says will limit the growth of emissions but will not cut them to 1990 levels. "A serious longer-term commitment is going to require a full public policy sea change," said William Cline, an economist for the Institute for International Economics.</p>
        <p>A CLOSER LOOK  Correction:  June 21, 1992, Sunday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on June 14 about logging in the national forests misstated acreages involved in a bill before Congress. The bill would perserve about two million acres of the Montana Rockies as wilderness and release about four millin acres to the Forest Service, which could open it to logging, mining, grazing and other uses.</p>
