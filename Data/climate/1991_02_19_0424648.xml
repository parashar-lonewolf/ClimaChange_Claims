        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Leslie Gelb takes John Sununu, White House chief of staff, to task for the Administration's position on the global-warming hypothesis ("Sununu vs. Scientists," column, Feb. 10). In suggesting that Mr. Sununu is in opposition to the scientific community, Mr. Gelb ignores germane facts.</p>
        <p>To start with, John Sununu is not exactly a stranger to the scientific community. In contrast to William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is a lawyer, Mr. Sununu holds a Doctor of Science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and spent many years teaching and doing research in engineering science. I can think of no previous White House chief of staff as capable of deeply understanding scientific issues.</p>
        <p>On global climate change, it should be noted that the number of professional scientists involved in research in this area is very small. Claims that hundreds of scientists from dozens of countries unanimously support the validity of the global-warming hypothesis are suspect from the start. As concerns the Chantilly conference, the delegates are overwhelmingly diplomats and politicians -- not scientists at all.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gelb finally turns to the old saw that regardless of the scientific validity of the global-warming hypothesis, the actions proposed are worth undertaking anyway. I will not dwell on the obvious dishonesty of this position. However, Mr. Gelb brings to bear an argument that I had not previously encountered, namely that "carbon dioxide fouls the air."</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is a natural constituent of the atmosphere. It is an inevitable product of breathing, and it demonstrably increases plant productivity. Levels that are normally found in homes greatly exceed the concentrations expected in the atmosphere under any scenario. Most life, moreover, emerged during periods when the earth's atmosphere is believed to have been far richer in carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>It is with a certain satisfaction that I note that an M.I.T. education has left John Sununu particularly resilient to the kind of scientific wisdom that Mr. Gelb promotes. I should add that many oceanographers and atmospheric scientists working on climate share the view that the present global-warming hypothesis is a largely political issue without scientific basis.
