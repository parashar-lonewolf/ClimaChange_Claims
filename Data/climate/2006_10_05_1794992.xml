        <p>Summers in New York and the rest of the Northeast could be as hot as those in South Carolina by the end of the century if heat-trapping emissions are not reduced, according to a study released yesterday by the Union of Concerned Scientists. Average temperatures are projected to rise by as much as 12.5 degrees, while the number of days when the temperature exceeds 90 degrees could increase fourfold to 60 or more days a year. There could be less snow in the winters, and more rain, the study found. An industry trade group for electricity-generating companies questioned the accuracy of the study's assumptions and said the study had failed to account for the economic costs of measures to reduce emissions.</p>
