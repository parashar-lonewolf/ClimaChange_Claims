        <p>President Bush, in some of his most expansive statements on the Middle East since assuming office, said today that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, should hear ''loud and clear'' that the United States wanted him ''to stop the violence.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at the second news conference of his presidency, Mr. Bush urged Israel to exercise restraint in its military actions but reserved his most pointed language for the Palestinian leader, stressing: ''The signal I'm sending to the Palestinians is stop the violence. And I can't make it any more clear. And I hope that Chairman Arafat hears it loud and clear.''</p>

        <p>President Bush, in some of his most expansive statements on the Middle East since assuming office, said today that the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, should hear ''loud and clear'' that the United States wanted him ''to stop the violence.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at the second news conference of his presidency, Mr. Bush urged Israel to exercise restraint in its military actions but reserved his most pointed language for the Palestinian leader, stressing: ''The signal I'm sending to the Palestinians is stop the violence. And I can't make it any more clear. And I hope that Chairman Arafat hears it loud and clear.''</p>
        <p>After the escalation of Palestinian attacks against Israelis this week and Israel's bombardment of Palestinian bases, Mr. Bush, who had said he would be less involved in the Middle East than his predecessor, spent much of his news conference describing how his administration is dealing with the conflict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he had instructed Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to call Mr. Arafat to reiterate the message on halting the violence, so that the Palestinian would ''hear it again on the telephone today.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the strong words about Mr. Arafat and renewed frustration with him also stemmed in part from his demands for a vote Tuesday night on a Security Council resolution seeking a United Nations observer force in the Israeli occupied territories. The United States vetoed the move.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Bush's news conference, the senior State Department official dealing with the Middle East, Assistant Secretary of State Edward R. Walker Jr., told a Congressional hearing in blunt terms that Mr. Arafat had not called for an end to violence but rather for the ''continuation of the intifada.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker contrasted what he termed the efforts by the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, to allow the movement of goods and people between the Palestinian territories and Israel with the intransigence of Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>''We've seen absolutely no response from Arafat to our urgings to him to help bring the violence to a stop,'' Mr. Walker said.</p>
        <p>In another effort to persuade Mr. Arafat to restore calm, Mr. Bush said that he would be enlisting the support of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and King Abdullah of Jordan during their upcoming visits to the White House. They could try to persuade Mr. Arafat to ''speak out against violence in a language that the Palestinians can understand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush ducked answering directly why he had not invited Mr. Arafat to the White House, saying he had ''quite a crowded calendar of leaders'' coming to see him.</p>
        <p>In contrast to President Clinton, who invited Mr. Arafat to the White House on more than a dozen occasions, the Bush administration has made clear that it has no intention of inviting Mr. Arafat any time soon.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on the Middle East came just before Mr. Bush held meetings at the White House with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, at which the two leaders agreed to disagree on a treaty to combat global climate change but concurred on formation of a European rapid deployment force.</p>
        <p>In a lengthy communiqué entitled ''A Transatlantic Vision for the 21st Century,'' the two governments said, ''We openly note that we differ on the best way to protect the earth's climate.''</p>
        <p>Reiterating familiar positions, the statement said that the United States opposes the so-called Kyoto Protocol -- which would reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide by 5.2 percent by 2012 from 1990 levels -- because it would cause ''serious harm to the American economy'' and exempted many countries.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the communiqué said Germany believed that the targeted reductions were ''indispensable to combat global climate change effectively.''</p>
        <p>Despite the marked difference on such a major issue, the White House went out of its way to not only stress the confluences on other matters but to describe the unusually buoyant atmosphere surrounding the two leaders. ''This was not a hideously boring meeting,'' said a senior administration official who took part in the discussions. There were no set speeches or ''laborious reading from notes.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Bush told reporters that he was looking forward to sitting down with Mr. Schröder and telling him ''exactly where the United States is coming from.''</p>
        <p>In keeping with his administration's early emphasis on treating old allies well and reinforcing traditional alliances, Mr. Bush said the United States was a ''steadfast'' friend but ''a friend is somebody who's willing to tell the truth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he told Mr. Schröder that his administration would consult with Germany on missile defense, an initiative that Germany says it has questions about. Germany did take the lead among European nations in telling Russia last month that the United States was serious about missile defense and that Europe could not be peeled away from the United States on the issue.</p>
        <p>During a brief give-and-take with reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Schröder, with Mr. Bush beside him, posed some of his concerns about missile defense: ''The threat scenario that is behind the whole system; is it technologically feasible? Can we truly implement it? Who is going to be covered under the shelter? Who's going to be invited to be included by the shelter that we're going to build.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schröder then added that he was reassured by Mr. Bush's pledge to continue an open discussion on missile defense.</p>
        <p>According to the communiqué, the Bush administration said it welcomed the European Union's plan for a rapid reaction force, stressing it must be ''fully coordinated, compatible and transparent with NATO.''</p>
        <p>European officials were dismayed last month when Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said that the European force made him ''nervous'' because it might serve to undermine the purpose of NATO.</p>
        <p>On Russia, the communiqué referred to the ''important contribution'' Moscow could make in ''maintaining peace and stability in Europe,'' which contrasted with the tough language of late from the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush confirmed today that his administration is reviewing aid programs to Russia intended to halt the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons in order to make sure money ''is being spent in an effective way.''</p>
        <p>''And so we're putting a full review on the programs,'' he said. ''And we fully intend to continue to cooperate with the Russians. It's in our nation's best interests to dismantle -- work with Russia to dismantle -- its nuclear arsenal.''</p>
        <p>Even though he dwelled to a large extent on the Middle East, Mr. Bush reiterated that it was up to the Israelis and the Palestinians to make peace possible.</p>
        <p>''We will facilitate a peace settlement,'' he said. ''It requires two willing parties to come to the table to enact a peace treaty that will last. And this administration won't try to force peace on the parties.''</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing just on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Mr. Bush attempted to portray his administration as laying a ''broad foundation for peace.''</p>
        <p>''That means we've got to have good, strong relations with the Egyptians and the Jordanians and the Saudis,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush met at the White House earlier this month with Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, who was a frequent visitor during the first Bush presidency but had a more distant relationship with the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>The president also reminded reporters that General Powell had met with the new Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus, another effort, Mr. Bush said, to build peace.</p>
