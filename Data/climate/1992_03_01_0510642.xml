        <p>You're sitting at a restaurant, about to order linguine with garlic and fresh tomatoes, when the waiter says: "Forget it. Go with the marinara sauce -- much blander."

        <p>You're sitting at a restaurant, about to order linguine with garlic and fresh tomatoes, when the waiter says: "Forget it. Go with the marinara sauce -- much blander." This is usually a clear signal to say you just remembered an important appointment and head for the nearest exit. Unless, of course, you're dining outwith children. In that case, stay put -- the waiter's no fool. On the contrary, you are in the presence of genius.</p>
        <p>One thing every parent who survives an offspring's first three years learns is that the child automatically rejects anything the parent suggests. Nothing personal, you understand, it's reflexive. So when it comes to a successful dining-out experience with the dear little ones -- a successful experience defined as one in which they do not demand to go to Burger King before the breadsticks arrive or wander off to tug on tablecloths just as the entree is served -- the waiter is key. Him they might listen to.</p>
        <p>Another sad lesson for parents is that the budding little culinary adventurer they thought they were raising as a toddler, who would eagerly try the most exotic dish and once in a while even like it, has become just another pack followerafter a few months in nursery school. By then, peer pressure and the urge to make a face at any out-of-the-ordinary edible have taken over.</p>
        <p>Thus, the advice we got that night to order marinara was right on the money. It came from a waiter at Carmine's, a large, boisterous restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and our daughters, a little awed by their surroundings and the waiter's forthright but good-humored manner, nodded wide-eyed. When the linguine, which wasn't bland at all, was placed before them, they ate it, or most of it, then asked for the rest to be put in a container to take home. My wife and I looked at each other in amazement. "Are these our kids?"</p>
        <p>Carmine's, it turns out, is one of those uninhibited, child-friendly places where the atmosphere is fun and the menu diverse enough to please anyone, regardless of age. Because we really do enjoy dining out en famille, and because our tolerance of fast food has its limits, we've become collectors of such restaurants; in fact, like which PG-13 movies it's really O.K. to take a 9-year-old to, they've become a regular topic in conversations with other parents.</p>
        <p>Besides Carmine's, where the amount of garlic in the Caesar salad is probably responsible for the hole in the ozone layer and the veal cutlet will make you forget all the shoe leather you've chewed at those faux trattorias, another sure pleaser in our crowd is a 50's-style eatery on lower Broadway called Ed Debevic's.</p>
        <p>At Ed's, the hamburgers are bigger than many of the younger customers, the signs on the walls say things like "Our coffee is so good we drink it ourselves" and the staff is gum-snapping wiseacres (one night, our waiter said with a straight face that I'd have to wait for a receipt until the bartender returned from Tower Records, where he'd gone with my credit card). Outside, there are green neon letters that spell "BURP." You get the picture. Subtlety is not the long suit here, but the chicken pot pie is terrific, as is the thin-crusted pizza -- a favorite with kids that's offered Thursday through Sunday -- and almost any of the desserts, especially the banana-cream and Oreo chocolate pies.</p>
        <p>If Ed Debevic's has a polar opposite, it might be Serendipity 3, a narrow, two-story restaurant and tchotchke shop on a chic block in the East 60's. With its plants, large windows, tile floors and white bentwood chairs, Serendipity probably has more appeal for little girls than little boys, though it's hard to imagine a youngster of either gender refusing the frozen hot chocolate, or any of the half-dozen or so other confections that come in schooners of Queen Mary-like dimension.</p>
        <p>Serendipity's menu has some range to it, so while your children are warming up for dessert with a footlong hot dog, you can choose from a lively selection of vegetarian dishes, fancy omelettes, French toast made with challah (also popular with kids), a pretty fair chicken curry and an appetizer of sour cream and caviar in potato skins called "Cleopatra's Barge." But for man and child alike, it's hard to beat the meatloaf and mashed potatoes, which are appropriately homely and lovable, especially when smothered with mushroom gravy. On Tuesdays, they come as part of a $9.95 blue-plate special with carrots and peas, Jell-O for dessert and June and Ward Cleaver at the next table.</p>
        <p>For brunch or lunch, we like a spot called the Boulevard, a few blocks south of Carmine's on upper Broadway. The Boulevard has a special child's menu that strikes me as a bit cloying -- "Sketties and Red Gravy" turns out to be spaghetti with tomato sauce, and there's grilled cheese on Wonder bread -- but the choices have never drawn any strong complaints from children of mine. They're usually too busy redecorating the paper tablecloth with crayons (a resturant gimmick that by now has become a cliche but nonetheless works) or checking out the wall mural, a New York streetscape with Simpsonesque figures.</p>
        <p>The Boulevard's specialty is barbecue, which is offered in a variety of forms, including "Rascal's Ribs" for kids. But what I find most appealing are the sandwiches aimed at adults, especially a serious, Dagwood-sized affair constructed of grilled chicken, avocado, Swiss cheese, bacon, red onion and Russian dressing. That, followed by a slice of four-berry pie, a slow walk home and a little nap, constitutes an ideal weekend afternoon. After all, parents need to conserve their energy.</p>
        <p>The take-home recipes that follow allow kids to get in on the action; experience shows that if children help to fix meals, they might even eat them. All are G-rated, with the exception of the Caesar salad, which because of the copious quantity of garlic and the inclusion of anchovies is rated PG-13. MEATLOAF (ADAPTED FROM SERENDIPITY 3, NEW YORK)  1 extra-large egg  1 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder  2 teaspoons dry rosemary leaves  1/2 cup finely chopped parsley  2 tablespoons Dijon mustard  1/2 cup ketchup  2 cups canned beef bouillon  1 cup finely chopped celery  1 large yellow onion, finely chopped  3/4 cup grated Cheddar cheese 2 1/2 pounds ground beef (round or sirloin), broken into pieces  1 large sweet red pepper, finely chopped  1 cup dry bread crumbs.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. In a large bowl, beat the egg lightly. Add the salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, parsley, mustard, ketchup and bouillon and mix until well blended. Add the celery, onion and cheese and mix again. Add the ground beef, red pepper and bread crumbs and mix thoroughly.</p>
        <p>3. Shape the mixture into a loaf approximately 14 inches long and 3 inches high. Slide the loaf onto a jellyroll pan and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until brown and a crust forms on the outside.</p>
        <p>4. Remove from the oven and cut into thick slices.</p>
        <p>Yield: Six to eight servings.</p>
        <p>MARINARA SAUCE (FROM CARMINE'S, NEW YORK)  3/4 cup olive oil  3 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced (see note)  1/4 cup chopped parsley  1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves  1 35-ounce can Italian plum tomatoes  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and brown lightly. Stir in the parsley and basil. Add the tomatoes and crush coarsely with the back of a fork. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>Yield: Enough sauce for 1 pound of dried pasta; serves 3 to 4.</p>
        <p>Note: Carmine's has a liberal hand with garlic. (The restaurant provides dispensers of breath freshener in its restrooms.) You might want to go easier on the garlic, depending on your audience. CAESAR SALAD (ADAPTED FROM CARMINE'S) The croutons:  1 cup cubed French bread pieces  Olive oil The dressing:  2 ounces anchovy fillets  1 egg yolk (see note)  1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley  1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic (or less to taste)  1 cup extra-virgin olive oil  1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese  1/4 cup red-wine vinegar The lettuce:  1 head romaine lettuce, cut, washed and drained.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Spread the bread on a baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and bake 4 to 5 minutes, stirring once or twice, until golden. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a stainless-steel bowl, crush the anchovy fillets with a fork until they are well mashed. Add the egg yolk and stir with a wire whisk for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the parsley and garlic. Slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream while whisking to incorporate. Add the vinegar and 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan and stir briskly with the whisk.</p>
        <p>3. In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with the dressing and the croutons. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top.</p>
        <p>Yield: Six to eight servings.  Note: Because of concern over salmonella contamination in raw eggs, some cooks may choose to substitute 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard for the egg yolk. CHICKEN POT PIE (ADAPTED FROM ED DEBEVIC'S, NEW YORK)  8 tablespoons butter  1 teaspoon chopped garlic  1 cup diced onion  1 cup diced celery  1 cup diced carrots  1/4 pound mushrooms, sliced  1 teaspoon dry thyme leaves 1 1/2 teaspoons dry sage  2/3 cup flour  4 cups chicken broth, homemade or canned  1 cup frozen peas  1 cup frozen corn kernels  2 cups shredded cooked chicken, skin removed  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  Baked puff-pastry circles, made from frozen puff-pastry leaves, cut to fit serving bowls as lids.</p>
        <p>1. In a large saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. When the butter is hot, add the garlic and saute for 1 minute or until it is golden. Add the onion, celery, carrots, mushrooms, thyme and sage and saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are wilted. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In another saucepan, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter over low heat. Add the flour and mix well. Cook over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes, or until pale golden. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring with a wire whisk until smooth. Bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes, then add to the vegetable mixture, along with the peas, corn and chicken. Return to a boil, remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>3. To serve the pies, fill heated bowls with the chicken mixture and top with puff-pastry lids. To eat, place the puff pastry on a heated plate, punch in the center with the back of a large spoon and pour the contents of the bowl over the puff pastry.</p>
        <p>Yield: Four to five servings. OREO CHOCOLATE PIE (ADAPTED FROM ED DEBEVIC'S) The crust:  8 ounces chocolate cookie crumbs  6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted The filling:  3 cups milk  1/3 plus 1/2 cup sugar  1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract  5 large egg yolks  5 tablespoons cornstarch  1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped  1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  2 cups finely chopped Oreo cookies  1 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks  Oreo cookies for decorating.</p>
        <p>1. For the crust, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix the chocolate cookie crumbs and the melted butter thoroughly. Press the mixture into a 10-inch pie plate, packing well. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven and let it cool.</p>
        <p>2. For the filling, combine 2 cups of the milk, 1/3 cup of sugar, the vanilla extract and the egg yolks in a mixing bowl and whisk together well. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. In a large saucepan, combine the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar with the cornstarch and stir in the remaining cup of milk. Bring to a boil, stirring, over medium-high heat. Whisk in the egg-yolk mixture and continue cooking and whisking until it returns to a boil. Whisk for 20 seconds longer, until it begins to thicken.</p>
        <p>4. Transfer the cooked cream to a mixing bowl. Add the unsweetened chocolate, chocolate chips and butter and whisk until melted. Stir in the chopped Oreo cookies and mix well. Pour the filling into the pie crust and cover directly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, spread whipping cream over the top. Cut into slices and decorate each slice with an Oreo.</p>
        <p>Yield: Eight to 10 servings.</p>
