        <p>Just in time for International Earth Week, CBS is broadcasting "The Fire Next Time" on Sunday and Tuesday, both nights at 9. The four-hour movie follows the odyssey of a family trying to escape the accelerating horrors of global warming. The time is given as "sometime soon," about 25 years from now.</p>
        <p>Drew Morgan (Craig T. Nelson), a shrimper on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, finds his business disappearing because of shifting weather conditions linked to decades of environmental neglect. Long heat spells have destroyed the shrimp in local waters. Skin cancers are commonplace. Air-conditioning is rationed. Drew still thinks a solution can be found.

        <p>Just in time for International Earth Week, CBS is broadcasting "The Fire Next Time" on Sunday and Tuesday, both nights at 9. The four-hour movie follows the odyssey of a family trying to escape the accelerating horrors of global warming. The time is given as "sometime soon," about 25 years from now.</p>
        <p>Drew Morgan (Craig T. Nelson), a shrimper on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, finds his business disappearing because of shifting weather conditions linked to decades of environmental neglect. Long heat spells have destroyed the shrimp in local waters. Skin cancers are commonplace. Air-conditioning is rationed. Drew still thinks a solution can be found. His estranged wife, Suzanne (Bonnie Bedelia), a science teacher, disagrees.</p>
        <p>A destructive hurricane (some real scenes from Hurricane Andrew are used) ends the argument as the family loses just about everything. Drew and Suzanne, tentatively reconciled, with their three children and Drew's sick father (Richard Farnsworth), set out on a journey that will take them to upstate New York and finally to Nova Scotia.</p>
        <p>"The Fire Next Time" is clearly determined to use environmental destruction the way "The Day After" on ABC in 1983 warned of nuclear disaster. Dr. Stephen Schneider, a Stanford University professor and a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, is not only a consultant on the film but also a member of the cast, playing himself in a brief scene.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schneider, the author of "Global Warming: Are We Entering the Greenhouse Century?" (Sierra Club Books, 1989), explained during an interview with the producers, "I wanted to make sure that the science James Henerson was dramatizing in the script was plausible." He noted wryly that after he had wondered whether the script's hurricane was too devastating, Hurricane Andrew "swept through southern Florida and our Louisiana film location and did as much, if not more, damage than the fictional storm we had agonized over."</p>
        <p>After the hurricane in the film, the Morgan family trudges on against a backdrop of spreading environmental horrors, from drought and fires to floods and malaria. Alaska is voting on secession. Canada is trying to keep refugees out. On its travels, the family runs into cultists who believe that the world is doomed and any fight for survival is pointless, as well as eco-survivalists who believe that the only way to survive is to grab whatever they can, by any means necessary.</p>
        <p>There's enough plot here to stock a 13-part mini-series, and the story takes several odd, not to say outlandish, turns. But with Robert Halmi Jr.  and Mr. Henerson as executive producers, the film manages to be remarkably effective. Getting as far away as possible from his weekly role on "Coach," Mr. Nelson gives the kind of powerfully intense performance that can single-handedly make the improbable totally convincing. The generally strong cast also includes Jurgen Prochnow, Louise Fletcher, Marla Gibbs, Sal Lopez and, as the Morgan children, Justin Whalin, Ashley Jones and Shawn Toovey.</p>
        <p>For the Morgans, there is something of a happy ending. But at the very last moment, the camera sweeps up to catch a shot of the sun, hanging menacingly in the sky. Earth Week will be hard put to find a more chilling image. 'The Sea Wolf' TNT, Sunday at 8 P.M.</p>
        <p>Having gone through at least six film adaptations, the best being the one in 1942 starring Edward G. Robinson and Ida Lupino, this Jack London tale is getting still another go-round, with Charles Bronson as the ruthless Captain Wolf Larsen. Unwilling passengers on his seal-hunting ship are the snobbish theater critic Humphrey Van Weyden (Christopher Reeve) and a scam artist, Flaxen Brewster (Catherine Mary Stewart), both rescued by Larsen from the wreckage of a capsized ferry. The self-educated Darwinian captain argues for survival of the fittest. ("It is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.") Humanistic Humph is concerned for others. The production is handsome but curiously lifeless, thanks in large part to Mr. Bronson's insistent monotone. Best bit: Clive Revill's chewing-the-scenery rendition of Cookie, the sniveling galley tyrant.
