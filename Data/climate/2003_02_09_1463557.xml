        <p>I USED to make fun of people who liked to go to Florida in the winter, but now I have become one of them. I love that blast of humidity that hits you when you walk off the plane, that first glimpse of the palm trees blowing against the blue sky.</p>

        <p>I USED to make fun of people who liked to go to Florida in the winter, but now I have become one of them. I love that blast of humidity that hits you when you walk off the plane, that first glimpse of the palm trees blowing against the blue sky.</p>
        <p>And now, back at my farm in Maryland, I am joining that oddball group of gardeners who like to grow a hardy palm in some protected corner of the backyard or a border of palmettos in the vegetable garden.</p>
        <p>It's an inclination related to my fondness for hardy banana plants. I have already killed one Musa basjoo, vowing to try another one, this time with proper watering during droughts and mulching for the winter. The Musa basjoo's root is supposed to be hardy to minus 10 degrees, so you can simply cut it down to the base after a hard freeze and mulch with about eight inches of wood chips, and new shoots will come up in spring.</p>
        <p>Or you can wait until the freeze kills the tops of the leaves, then wrap the stem with straw, plastic and burlap, and put an old bucket over the top. In spring, shoots will sprout from the stem, and by May you should have a leafy banana plant.</p>
        <p>For 10 years, Dennis Schrader and Bill White, the owners of Landcraft Environments, a wholesale nursery in Mattituck, N.Y., have been growing windmill palms like Trachycarpus takil, which is native to the Himalayas and can survive temperatures of minus 5 degrees.</p>
        <p>Windmill palms are slow-growing: a two-year-old seedling's trunk might be only one foot high, but in a few years it will inch skyward, developing a crown of 20 or so leaves shaped like windmills. The oldest palms at Landcraft Environments are about 12 feet tall.</p>
        <p>So come spring, I will try a windmill palm, along with another Musa basjoo. I picture it in a vegetable garden already devoted, after all, to exotics (things like tomatoes, potatoes and hot peppers).</p>
        <p>I've been encouraged in this pursuit by Dr. David A. Francko, author of the new book ''Palms Won't Grow Here and Other Myths: Warm-Climate Plants for Cooler Areas'' (Timber Press, $28). ''A lot of palms are native to the United States, and the fossil evidence indicates that they used to grow much farther north,'' Dr. Francko said. ''But when the glacier came down last time, it wiped out the northern plants, and the only refuge for palms was Florida.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Francko, chairman of the department of botany at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, has been growing hardy palms with Dr. Kenneth Wilson, a plant geneticist, for about seven years. They grow about 200 palms, including 30 windmill palms, on campus, where winter temperatures hover around 8 degrees. Dr. Francko also grows a number at his home outside town. Situated in a low swale, his yard has temperatures that fall to around minus 5; during the cold snap last week, the mercury dropped to minus 13. Not only are the two palm lovers dispelling myths about what can't grow in southern Ohio, but they are also finding out how plants protect themselves in winter. It turns out they produce antifreeze -- compounds that lower their cellular freezing points.</p>
        <p>In recent years hardy plants like the needle palm, Rhapidophyllum hystrix, have been re-establishing themselves up the Georgia coast. Needle palms have dark green palmate leaves two to five feet across, with petioles, or leaf stems, about two feet long. The trunks are short, less than a foot, and black spines enclose the base of each leaf.</p>
        <p>Gardeners in the central Tennessee and Kentucky swatch of the Cumberland Plateau report that the native dwarf palmetto, too, is coming back. The dwarf palmetto, Sabal minor, ranges from eastern Texas to southeastern Oklahoma and southeastern Virginia. It has a clumping habit, with leaves as wide as three feet on petioles three feet long.</p>
        <p>IN his book, Dr. Francko offers tips on growing everything from southern magnolias to crape myrtles and live oaks. He recommends searching the yard for relatively warm microclimates, near the protective corners of buildings and courtyards or on the leeward side of wind breaks like a row of cedars or a hedge.</p>
        <p>What's crucial is getting a young plant well established and keeping it well watered during the growing season. In late fall, Dr. Francko mulches his palms heavily with leaves so the roots don't freeze. He also stacks about a foot of leaves over the canopyto ensure that icy water doesn't drip into the crown. It's the freeze-thaw cycles that injure tissues, opening them up to fungal diseases and causing crown rot.</p>
        <p>By working with warmer microclimates, gardeners can push the envelope, growing needle palms and dwarf palmettos in Zone 6, he said. A windmill palm, marginally hardy to Zone 6B, might do well in Zone 6A, where temperatures can drop to 10 below zero.</p>
        <p>Dr. Francko has been watching temperatures long enough to call global warming a fact. ''The average global temperature is almost certainly rising and probably has been doing so for at least a few decades,'' he writes. Many scientists predict that mean temperatures will increase a couple of degrees in the next 30 or 40 years, climbing as much as 6 degrees by 2100.</p>
        <p>This means windmill palms may someday have a better chance in Dr. Francko's part of the world than the Alberta spruce, a favorite of developers. ''It's a beautiful tree, but its southern-most range is Zone 6, so a generation from now it's not going to perform very well,'' he said.</p>
