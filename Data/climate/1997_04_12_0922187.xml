        <p>U.S. and Europe Agree To Agree on Cuba  The European Union and the United States agreed on a plan to resolve their dispute over sanctions against Cuba. A European complaint that was to have gone before the World Trade Organization on Monday will be suspended pending negotiations. The Clinton Administration agreed to seek a change in the Helms-Burton sanctions law; its prospects in Congress were unclear.</p>

        <p>Iran Shunned, but Not by Russia  Russia warmly welcomed the head of Iran's parliament and vowed to improve ties with Iran. His visit came a day after a German court said the Iranian Government had ordered the assassination of exiled dissidents, a ruling that prompted most European Union countries to recall their ambassadors from Teheran. Russia's courting of Iran was seen as an effort to placate anti-Western Russian nationalists.</p>

        <p>Clinton Urges Broad U.S. Role  President Clinton urged Congress to approve a treaty banning chemical weapons and to give him broader authority to reach a trade agreement with Chile.

        <p>Indian Government Falls  India's coalition Government was defeated in a parliamentary confidence vote, leaving three major political groups contending for power. If they fail to agree on a new Government within the next few days, a general election is likely to be held in the summer. Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda is likely to lose office under any outcome.</p>

        <p>Japan Votes to Keep U.S. Bases  The lower house of Japan's Parliament voted overwhelmingly to let Japan continue to provide land for American military bases. Opposition to the bases has been strongest on Okinawa, where residents associate them with noise and crime. But Japan's Prime Minister sought the measure to bolster its alliance with the United States.</p>

        <p>Moldova and Separatists Agree  The former Soviet republic of Moldova agreed on a peaceful settlement with the breakaway Trans-Dniester region. Trans-Dniester, which is dominated by ethnic Slavs, will get a special status within the existing borders of Moldova, whose population is largely Romanian; details will be worked out later. The 5,000 Russian troops in Trans-Dniester are to be pulled out as part of the deal.</p>

        <p>Croatians Celebrate Fascism  Five hundred black-shirted supporters of Croatia's neo-fascist Party of Rights gave stiff-armed salutes at a rally marking the 57th anniversary of the Nazi puppet regime that ruled Croatia during World War II. The party is a close ally of President Franjo Tudjman, who has sought to rehabilitate the wartime fighters as patriots and precursors of the modern Croatian state.</p>

        <p>Missing Pilot Appeared To Have Been in Control  Mystified Air Force officials said a fighter pilot who disappeared during a training mission over the Arizona desert last week appeared to have been in control of the craft to the very end of its 90-minute, 800-mile flight. Everything about the flight appeared consistent with a deliberate, if irrational, act, they said. Pilot and plane remained missing.</p>

        <p>Frantic Efforts Keep Fargo Dry  The Red River crested without spilling over the 40-foot wall of sandbags protecting Fargo, N.D. Disaster was averted largely because of the efforts of local residents, including high school students, who were dismissed from class to help.</p>

Laurel Accepts the Poor  A 26-year legal battle over housing for the poor in Mount Laurel, N.J., ended with the township's approval of a complex of 140 town houses for low- and moderate-income people. The project will be named for Ethel Lawrence, who brought the original complaint that made the township a national symbol of suburbs that use zoning laws to exclude the poor.</p>
