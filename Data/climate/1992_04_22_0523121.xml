        <p>The Age of Missing Information  By Bill McKibben 261 pages. Random House. $20.</p>
        <p>In a highly personal and original study of television viewing in America, Bill McKibben goes beyond Marshall McLuhan's theory that the medium is the message. In "The Age of Missing Information," Mr. McKibben maintains that there's no message in the medium.</p>
        <p>Well, not quite. He concedes that there are some good programs, especially on public television. But when everything is run together -- the news bites, the commercial interruptions, the constant reruns, the channel-to-channel repetitions, the plate-passing of the omnipresent television evangelists -- it all adds up to chop suey for the mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKibben, a former New Yorker staff writer and author of "The End of Nature," a warning about the greenhouse effect, subjected himself to a punishing experiment for his study. He collected more than a thousand hours on videotape of all the programs that were shown during a 24-hour period in 1990 on the 93 cable stations in Fairfax, Va.</p>
        <p>The large Fairfax cable system is a harbinger of the increasing number of channels that will be available in other communities around the country. In addition to the three networks and the Public Broadcasting Service, Mr. McKibben was able to see five Christian channels, four shopping channels, two country-music video channels, six pay-per-view first-run movie channels, two comedy channels, nine public-access and government channels, a national and a local sports channel, two weather channels and (as the newscasters promise) much, much more.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKibben is not simply saying that most of the programs on television are terrible. He admits to watching certain programs while growing up; of later being glued to CNN during major news events. But then he mentions an unnamed professor from the State University of New York telling a television audience: "My students know the Brady Bunch better than their own parents' birth dates."</p>
        <p>What missing information or misinformation does "The Brady Bunch" household avoid or convey? Mr. McKibben says that the show's viewers "know a life where no work is done, usually not even by the maid, because there are appliances in every corner. They know a life where everything happens in a big and isolated suburban home. Where parents are mostly pals, where money flows in, where food appears. We can make fun of it, laugh at it, but all of us who grew up with it (which means nearly everyone born since it went on the air) are affected by it. Very few of us can afford to live like the Bradys."</p>
        <p>In his channel roundelay, Mr. McKibben deplores the television evangelists. He writes that "everyone knows about the TV preachers. They are greedy hypocrites. They get volume discounts at hot-sheet hotels.  They rob their flocks and they cheat the I.R.S. They are unctuous and self-righteous, oozing greenish smarm the way decent folks sweat."</p>
        <p>But "The Age of Missing Information" isn't a book of criticism about particular television programs; rather, it's about what people don't learn about the global village at their doorstep and beyond by incessant watching.</p>
        <p>In the area of Presidential campaigning on the tube, Mr. McKibben cites the fact that the average sound bite is getting smaller and smaller. During the last 20 years it has gone down from about 42 seconds to 10 seconds, just enough time to shock the senses with a charged electronic bolt without affecting the thought processes.</p>
        <p>"Perhaps the greatest distortion of TV news," the author says, "comes from the very fact of its seeming comprehensiveness. Each day it fills its allotted hours no matter what, and each day it fills them with crackling urgency. A newspaper comes out every day too, but a newspaper has a variety of ways of letting you know whether an event is important or not."</p>
        <p>Mr. McKibben writes that the relentless flood of information doesn't necessarily impart reality. The principal boast of televised communication is speed but, he points out, speed doesn't help to grasp and understand facts. Writing as a naturalist, the author says it doesn't matter if you learn about the greenhouse effect this week or next month: "What matters is that when you do hear about it you understand it so deeply and thoroughly that you begin to question the way you live."</p>
        <p>Here the reader encounters the author in his role as a minor-league Thoreau. By way of contrast to watching television around the clock, Mr. McKibben shares a second experiment in his book: spending a day and night on a mountaintop, above his home in the Adirondacks, and absorbing what he considers to be more lasting information.</p>
        <p>For someone who is a city or suburban dweller by necessity or choice, meaning most Americans, the author's dreamy alternatives seem idealistic but impractical: camping out on some remote aerie; riding a bicycle instead of driving a car; turning off the electricity and lighting candles a few times a week.</p>
        <p>Despite his felicitous language, Mr. McKibben is far more convincing about the effects of television's shivarees than about nature's lessons. Of his two experiments, he writes: "Our society is moving steadily from natural sources of information toward electronic ones, from the mountain and the field toward the television; this great transition is very nearly complete. And so we need to understand the two extremes. One is the target of our drift. The other an anchor that might tug us gently back, a source of information that once spoke clearly to us and now hardly even whispers."</p>
        <p>Mr. McKibben's contrasting experiments don't necessarily work together. A newsworthy broadcast or a challenging book -- say, "The Age of Missing Information" -- may well deliver more practical information than a night spent communing with the stars. Nevertheless, the ideas here about television's effects do offer thoughtful new insights before the screen goes dark.</p>
