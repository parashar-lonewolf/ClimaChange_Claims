        <p>A recent letter [March 10] criticizing LIPA's expenditure of $1 billion for fossil fuels and our Clean Energy Program must be answered.</p>
        <p>LIPA must supply at least 5,000 megawatts of electricity to our customers on some of the hottest days of the year in order to keep the lights on. The $1 billion that we are spending to purchase oil, natural gas and imported power cannot be replaced without turning out all the lights on Long Island.</p>

        <p>A recent letter [March 10] criticizing LIPA's expenditure of $1 billion for fossil fuels and our Clean Energy Program must be answered.</p>
        <p>LIPA must supply at least 5,000 megawatts of electricity to our customers on some of the hottest days of the year in order to keep the lights on. The $1 billion that we are spending to purchase oil, natural gas and imported power cannot be replaced without turning out all the lights on Long Island.</p>
        <p>It is simply preposterous to think that LIPA should somehow reduce or eliminate its spending on fossil fuels and replace Long Island's power plants with windmills and solar panels. Long Island needs every megawatt from these power plants.</p>
        <p>Having said this, however, LIPA is completely committed to energy efficiency and new technology. The letter writer conveniently uses numbers from the first two years of LIPA's operations when we had just taken over Lilco and had to create energy efficiencey programs from scratch. What the writer fails to mention is that LIPA spent $37 million on energy efficiency last year and will spend at least the same amount this year.</p>
        <p>LIPA's record of supporting energy efficiency and new technologies speaks for itself. We are currently spending more than any retail utility in the state on energy efficiency and will continue to do so. Our fuel cell project in West Babylon, in which 75 fuel cell units are hooked directly into the electric grid, is the first of its kind in the world. Our joint effort with the Long Island Farm Bureau to install windmills on the East End and our proposed offshore wind farm will bring wind energy to reality here on Long Island, possibly as soon as this summer.</p>
        <p>And LIPA's solar program will provide an additional 50 solar roofs, free of charge, to customers recently chosen in a lottery. These solar roofs are in additon to 30 roofs that we installed over a year ago. And by doubling our solar rebate, we are encouraging the expansion of the solar industry here on Long Island like no other utility that I know of here in New York.</p>
