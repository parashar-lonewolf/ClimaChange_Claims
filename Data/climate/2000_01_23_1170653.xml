        <p>PLOTTING a measured retreat from further development of its shorelines, the Town of East Hampton is considering severe restrictions on seawalls and other shoreline erosion control structures that it says imperil public beaches, dunes and bluffs.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which would become the major erosion control component of the town's Local Waterfront Revitalization Program, cites global warming, rising sea level and storm damage as reasons why development in coastal areas should be barred from pressing too near the water.</p>
        <p>But in an underpinning that has broad support among environmentalists and many coastal experts, it also finds that individual erosion control efforts by property owners as well as larger, publicly financed projects can disrupt the natural drift of sand along the shores, obliterate public beaches and strip the shoreline of its natural ability to rebuild itself.</p>
        <p>The proposal is the culmination of 10 years of study of coastal erosion in the town, where beaches, shoreline development and wealthy second-home owners are essential to the local economy.</p>
        <p>If it is enacted, the new town law would be among the most far-reaching responses to coastal erosion undertaken by any of the Island's 13 towns, and a possible model for other municipalities on Long Island and beyond. The Village of Quogue, which is in the Town of Southampton, has also restricted shoreline hardening. Some states, including North Carolina, have banned seawalls.</p>
        <p>While the East Hampton erosion plan would allow property owners to maintain beach armoring in most areas where it already exists -- predominantly on the northern or bay side of the town -- it would prohibit its spread along the town's ocean shores and on bay shores that currently have little or no armoring.</p>
        <p>The new coastal erosion regime would also shift authority for issuing permits for repairing or building armoring from the state to the town, which would be guided by its own erosion plan. The plan would create four zones ranging from an oceanfront zone where hardening would be strictly forbidden to a bayside zone where owners would be allowed to maintain existing shore armoring.</p>
        <p>In a concession some regard as critical, property owners whose houses or land were in imminent peril of being swept away unless they erected or repaired sea walls or other protections would be able to apply for variances.</p>
        <p>Some supporters of the plan said the loophole made the plan viable by assuring that it would not result in a taking of private land without compensation, a red flag for judges who might hear challenges to the plan. Robert S. DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork in Bridgehampton, said the taking issue could not arise as long as owners had recourse to variances.</p>
        <p>''Simply not getting exactly what you want is unlikely to be construed as a taking of your land,'' he said. ''What's important is that this proposal fundamentally changes the approach to coastal management from coastal fortification to coastal retreat. It tells property owners it's best and easiest to move development back from the shoreline rather than to fortify.''</p>
        <p>But critics said variances would only be available after owners had suffered possibly irreversible erosion damage. They said the proposal would lead to a rout for owners who built where the town had allowed them to.</p>
        <p>''This purports to be a shoreline preservation law when in fact it is a shoreline destruction law,'' said Aram V. Terchunian, a coastal geologist often employed by property owners and the president of First Coastal Corporation, an environmental consulting firm in Westhampton Beach.</p>
        <p>''The bluffs would be consumed, the dunes would be consumed, and the variance part undoes the whole law,'' Mr. Terchunian said. ''They say in an extreme situation where you have placed your house as far inland as possible and erosion continues, only at that point would they let you put up a seawall. That's pretty extreme. Your house has to be about to fall in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Terchunian said the proposal erred in concentrating on coastal structures parallel to the shore. ''Every responsible coastal geologist will tell you the primary causes of erosion in East Hampton are the inlets, and they are shore-perpendicular,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said that sand trapped by the inlets, when dredged, was frequently not returned to the beaches but instead placed in upland areas, depriving the shoreline of the sand. ''Proper sand management is what is needed,'' he said. ''Instead, the town is gong to place a tremendous burden on hundreds of property owners.''</p>
        <p>Gerard Stoddard, a spokesman for coastal property owners and the president of the Fire Island Association, said he saw limits in local initiatives like East Hampton's. ''What is needed,'' he said, ''is a long-term coastal policy on a system-wide basis that provides the sand and the beaches needed to provide this protection.''</p>
        <p>But even the future of the East Hampton measure is unclear. Richard E. Whalen, a deputy town attorney, said it was difficult to predict when the town board would vote on the measure, which would amend local zoning. ''I don't know where this law is going to go,'' he said. ''I'm not sure we'll see it any time in the near future.''</p>
        <p>Part of the uncertainty followed the defeat in November of the incumbent town supervisor, Catherine Lester, a Democrat who supported the proposal. The town's newly elected Republican supervisor, Jay Schneiderman, has agreed with the premise of the proposal and has said that shoreline protection will be a goal of his administration. But he said the needs of shorefront homeowners and businesses must also be considered.</p>
        <p>Another uncertainty involves the town's decision not to do an environmental impact statement on the possible effects of the proposal, which courts could construe as an omission.</p>
        <p>Other problems could occur if the Town of Southampton, which is currently compiling an environmental study of its ocean shores, concludes that the East Hampton plan could have impacts on Southampton. The littoral drift, or prevailing movement of sand, is from east to west on ocean beaches on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Since the colonial era, East Hampton has opened coastal areas and resources to all town residents. Most beaches are owned by the town trustees under colonial patents.</p>
        <p>A narrative accompanying the proposal said that coastal development in the past ''often failed to take into account potential damage from flooding, erosion, and coastal storms.''</p>
        <p>''Following major storms, homeowners recognizing their precarious predicament built so-called erosion protection structures to protect their property,'' it said. ''However, groins, bulkheads and other hard structures have had detrimental effects on adjoining beaches or neighboring property and have often aggravated the erosion problems that they were designed to prevent.''</p>
        <p>Their legacy, the narrative said, was ''a disappearance of sandy beaches in many locations, a significant loss for a town whose way of life and resort economy depend on public access to unspoiled beaches.''</p>
        <p>Larry Penny, the East Hampton Town Director of Natural Resources, said that erosion problems were growing worse in many areas of town. ''Erosion is speeding up,'' he said. ''We are not Holland, but it it's hard to know what to do. Obviously when you put in hardened structures in one spot, the spot next door takes a beating. So the next person puts up a structure and then you have a domino effect.''</p>
        <p>''On the other hand,'' he said, ''sometimes it's impractical for people to move their houses back or bring in sand and pile it in front. So it is a conundrum.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penny said that town surveys using aerial photographs and maps showed ocean shore recession from Montauk Point to the Village of Montauk averaged two feet a year. He said Gardiners Island, the largest privately owned island on the East Coast, appeared to be shrinking by up to 2.5 feet a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penny said a generally accepted figure for sea level rise over the past 100 years was six to eight inches. An international debate among scientists and governments continues over whether global warming is occurring and will accelerate sea-level rise.</p>
        <p>Jay Tanski, a coastal geologist for the New York Sea Grant Program, said it was difficult to take the long-term effects of rising sea level into account when making coastal erosion policies.</p>
        <p>''Sea level has been rising and it appears it will maintain that trend or even increase because of global warming,'' Mr. Tanski said. But to say that therefore no steps should be taken to combat coastal erosion would be ''like saying we should not go to doctors because we are all going to die sometime,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tanski said he opposed an outright ban on any approach to coastal erosion control. ''It's not the best way because you eliminate approaches you might want to use in certain circumstances,'' he said. ''What you want to do is look on a site-by-site, case-by-case basis and then make your best decision on the best approach.''</p>
