        <p>LEAD: At dinner the restless 13-year-old girl volunteered what was troubling her. ''I have such anger!'' she blurted out, talking loudly and very fast. ''I am so mad at my teachers, all of them ignorant party hacks; at the police, who are still training their video cameras at us when we march in demonstrations.</p>
        <p>At dinner the restless 13-year-old girl volunteered what was troubling her. ''I have such anger!'' she blurted out, talking loudly and very fast. ''I am so mad at my teachers, all of them ignorant party hacks; at the police, who are still training their video cameras at us when we march in demonstrations.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this morning, the restless schoolgirl marched for an hour along the inner-city ring road protesting, among other things, the six-day school week. She and her girlfriend carried a handmade banner that proclaimed: ''Learning Is a Duty, but Not on Saturdays!''</p>
        <p>Her indignation and her protest were not at all unusual in this city where the mass movement began that led to the removal of Erich Honecker as East German Communist Party leader. The girl's father said that she had been ''completely politicized since a week ago.''</p>
        <p>Her political passions reflect how deep has been the impact here of the cumulative protests, and they help explain why the East German mass movement for change developed here and still remains largely centered in Leipzig.</p>
        <p>The mass demonstrations against the former Honecker leadership, which spread to every other East German city, started here on Oct. 2 with 20,000 citizens marching. On Oct. 9, about 50,000 demonstrators braved clubbing by police riot squads. On Oct. 16, the size of the demonstration was 120,000. No Letup</p>
        <p>Mr. Honecker and two of his top aides resigned their posts. A week later, about 200,000 Leipzig residents marched again to keep up the pressure for a basic change in this country's government system. On Nov. 6, the demonstrators numbered 480,000 - well over half the population.</p>
        <p>The first demonstrators were mainly young dissidents who had found sanctuary in Leipzig's St. Thomas and St. Nikolai Churches. Subsequent marches broadened -joined by factory workers, nurses and doctors, professors, transport workers, shop assistants, some of them members of the Communist Party.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, the participation has been spontaneous in quality, and the shifting emphasis of the throngs has been mirrored in the slogans painted on the banners. Early on, they called for democracy and pluralism, but in recent days, new slogans began to appear for and against unification of East Germany with the West.</p>
        <p>Leipzig, the heart of Saxony for most of its 824-year history, is covered with a thick layer of grime from industrial smokestacks and the exhaust of two-stroke automobile engines that are so common here.</p>
        <p>Unlike Berlin and other cities, there has been no significant new construction here for two decades and older buildings have been allowed to deteriorate.</p>
        <p>The Baroque statues that line the courtyard of the huge Grassi Museum, home to one of the world's great folklore collections, are now black with soot. It seems that acid rain is eating away their features.</p>
        <p>''It is not just the pollution,'' said the middle-aged woman who signs in visitors to Leipzig's old university, renamed for Karl Marx. ''It is everything that is wrong here - the food shortage, the housing shortage, the politics.''</p>
        <p>Asked to explain why the protests started here, Prof. Wolfgang Kleinwachter, who has lived and taught here for two decades, said there were no simple answers.'' Chronology of Ferment</p>
        <p>Historically, Dr. Kleinwachter noted, Leipzig was where Ulrich von Hutten, an early figure in the Protestant Reformation, wrote his pamphlets against the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Martin Luther preached here in 1519 against the doctrine of church infallibility, and five years later, Thomas Muntzer acted as the tribune of the Peasants Rebellion that spread through central Germany.</p>
        <p>Leipzig was again a hotbed of revolutionary activity in 1848 and once more in 1923, in a workers' uprising that was crushed by the German Army.</p>
        <p>''Leipzig always had a free spirit,'' Dr. Kleinwachter said. ''I don't think that is something that was consciously on the minds of 100,000 demonstrators. But it is there.''</p>
        <p>''A second dimension,'' he said, ''is the student demonstrations that took place here in 1968 against the demolition of the university church and in sympathy with the Prague Spring of Alexander Dubcek. The church, which was late Gothic, had been damaged in the war. But it had great symbolic value, and the Communists simply tore it down.</p>
        <p>''The students were the hippie generation,'' he recalled. ''I was one of them. I'm 41. Those who were 20 then are 40 now. In 1989, we said to ourselves that if we don't pull it off now, it's all done with.''</p>
