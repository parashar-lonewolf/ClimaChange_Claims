        <p>Re ''Science Panel Says Global Warming Is 'Unequivocal' '' (front page, Feb. 3):</p>
        <p>The evidence is in, and it is incontrovertible. If we don't stop burning fossil fuels, we will destroy our habitat. Even if we manage to suppress all coal and gas emissions tomorrow, that will only slow the damage, not halt it.</p>
        <p>If the earth is to survive, human beings must summon the collective will to stop doing what they have been doing and start doing something else. For starters, all municipal regions with mass transit in place need to phase out and ban the use of gasoline-powered automobiles.</p>
        <p>Global warming deserves top priority from now on. The ball is now in everyone's court, as suggested by Richard B. Alley, one of the lead authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.</p>
        <p>Carol Haskill  San Francisco, Feb. 3, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Feb. 3 front-page article and ''At Humanity's Doorstep'' (editorial, Feb. 4):</p>
        <p>Speaking about United States policy in light of the latest climate change findings, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said, ''The U.S. economy is not something to be experimented with.'' But the climate of our only planet is?</p>
        <p>For a second, I thought he might have been kidding. Then I just wished he was. Talk about missing the biosphere for the trees.</p>
        <p>Apparently, we need to remind the Bush administration of something obvious: Neither the economy nor the people and living things that drive it exist independently of the planet's climate.</p>
        <p>Dan Carsen  Birmingham, Ala., Feb. 4, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As usual, the fashionable view eventually becomes tyrannical and will no longer permit debate. It looks now as if the momentum of the global-warming evangelists is unstoppable.</p>
        <p>You state in your Feb. 3 front-page article that the United States accounts for 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's emissions. Somewhere between consuming and emitting fossil fuels is that thing called United States economic growth, which continues to be a boon to the world -- for 2006, a sparkling 3.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Some say they don't want their children to have to cope with the alleged nightmare of climate change, but I am far sadder that my children will have to cope with the reduced richness of opportunity that will exist at every socioeconomic level in an economy crippled by restricted access to the energy that powers it.</p>
        <p>It will be a sad sight to watch the spectacular American private-sector engine and the optimistic innovativeness that has always been its hallmark diminished for want of fuel.</p>
        <p>Margaret McGirr  Greenwich, Conn., Feb. 3, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report ''expressly avoided recommending courses of action.'' A number of state legislatures (and cities), noting the total absence of a national policy on global warming, are developing state (and city) policies to comply with the Kyoto accord.</p>
        <p>With luck, some will repeal the sales tax and collect the equivalent revenue by taxing the sale of fossil electricity, natural gas and petrol.</p>
        <p>Wilfred Candler  Annapolis, Md., Feb. 3, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is now surely high time to call the premier crisis facing human civilization by its right name: global ''heating'' or ''overheating.''</p>
        <p>''Warming'' may have fit in earlier stages, but the word's friendly connotations do not convey the urgency with which humankind must now address the danger that in the short span of a mere two centuries it has created not only for itself but also for all life on planet Earth.</p>
        <p>Howard Charles Yourow  Bronx, Feb. 3, 2007</p>
