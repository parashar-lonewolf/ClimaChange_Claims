        <p>PETER MARKOW is ahead of his time -- perhaps too far. Concerned about damage to the environment from American dependence on fossil fuels, he had a contractor install 48 100-watt 2-by-5-foot solar panels in the backyard of his home in Tolland in 2003.</p>
        <p>When the switch was flipped on the 4.8-kilowatt network, it was one of the largest residential solar electricity systems in the state. Its cost? About $50,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markow, the chairman of the chemistry department at St. Joseph College in West Hartford, believed that the project made a statement: that the need for renewable, clean energy was even more important than the $800 a year it saved in electricity bills. The photovoltaic panels provided nearly all the power needed to run the 1,800-square-foot home.</p>
        <p>''But the timing wasn't so great,'' he conceded.</p>
        <p>The project was one of the last residential solar electric systems built in the state before the General Assembly passed a bill several months later that would have paid for half the cost. In addition, Congress passed a law last August that grants a federal tax credit up to $2,000 for such residential solar projects.</p>
        <p>The generous subsidies came too late for some, but marked a new beginning for others: The combined state and federal efforts have electrical contractors busier than they have been in years.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's subsidy of residential solar energy continues a push toward renewable energy sources that began in the 1990's, when the state deregulated electricity. That was when lawmakers added fees to the utility bills of United Illuminating and Connecticut Light and Power ratepayers to help pay to increase sources of nonpolluting power. The average ratepayer is charged 70 cents a month for this purpose, which goes into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund. The fund pays for solar electric initiatives.</p>
        <p>The solar program started in October 2004 when legislators authorized a payment of $5 per watt, up to a maximum of $25,000, to help defray the cost of installing a home solar electric system.</p>
        <p>Workers install photovoltaic panels for such a system either on a roof or within 200 feet of a home. The panels must face south for the most efficient use of the sun. Between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the sun is strongest and the most power is generated, unused electricity is sent into the grid and the customer is credited; after sunset, the grid provides power as it would in a nonsolar system.</p>
        <p>''People replace between 20 percent and 80 percent of their electricity'' when they turn to solar power, said Charlie Moret, spokesman for Connecticut Innovations, which runs the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund.</p>
        <p>Interest in solar electricity soared when C.L.&amp;P. announced a 22 percent rate increase late last year. Traffic on the fund's Web site, www.ctcleanenergy.com, increased 50 percent in January as more people searched for alternatives.</p>
        <p>But does it make any difference? Not a significant one, at least not yet. In the last year, contractors have completed about 40 residential systems, and the state has authorized about 50 more for rebates. But there is still a long way to go for the program to reduce the polluting fossil fuels that electrical generators use.</p>
        <p>Consider: It would take 200 to 250 5-kilowatt solar power systems, which produce 5,000 watts each, to make just one megawatt of power, or 1 million watts. Connecticut uses about 6,000 megawatts a year.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Moret is hopeful.</p>
        <p>''The numbers are moving in the right direction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>State residents use 5 megawatts of power from renewable energy, which includes wind power and power from fuel cells, and an additional 34 megawatts are planned by 2008. The average residential project can provide about 4.4 kilowatts of power, Mr. Moret said, and costs about $45,000, to install, but it would provide about half the 700 kilowatts of power a month that a typical residential ratepayer uses. The state's subsidy of $22,000 on a project of this size, combined with a federal tax credit of $2,000, would lower the cost of the system to about $21,000 and save about another $720 a year in electric bills.</p>
        <p>Yet the prospect of saving money is such a long-term proposition, even with government subsidies, that many residents said it was not the deciding factor in their decisions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Douglas Smith, a renal specialist who lives in Killingworth, was spurred by concerns about the future of the planet. Workers finished installing a six-kilowatt solar-electric system for his home last week. ''Taking care of the environment begins at home,'' Dr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Markow, who teaches environmental science and takes his students on field trips to view renewable energy projects, .said that he put in a solar system because it was the right thing to do.</p>
        <p>''If we don't get off imported oil,'' he said, ''we'll be in deep trouble in this country.''</p>
