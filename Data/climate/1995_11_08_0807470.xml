        <p>Scientists working in Brazil have found the first proof that undisturbed tropical rain forests soak up huge amounts of the carbon dioxide that people produce by burning fuels.</p>
        <p>The measurements, published on Friday in the journal Science, show that each  year, each hectare (2.47 acres) of the southwestern Amazon rain forest absorbs a ton of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Virgin forest sequesters carbon from the atmosphere," wrote John Grace of the University of Edinburgh, who led a team of British, Australian and Brazilian ecologists. "The whole of tropical South America may act as a carbon sink."</p>
        <p>If the measurements are extended globally, the world's remaining tracts of tropical rain forests could be absorbing a billion tons of carbon dioxide every  year, one-sixth of the amount produced by burning fuels, said Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>He added that "it's clear the forests are helping us" balance the so-called greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>The carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has been rising slowly for decades and today is 30 percent higher than at the turn of the century, Mr. Tans said. Much of this increase is attributed to burning fuels and slash-and-burn farming.</p>
        <p>Many scientists are convinced that increased carbon dioxide could cause a global temperature increase.</p>
        <p>The oceans are the largest absorber of carbon dioxide, and Mr. Tans discovered last summer that new forests in the Northern Hemisphere also act as large carbon sinks, where plants take in carbon dioxide and use the gas in photosynthesis.</p>
