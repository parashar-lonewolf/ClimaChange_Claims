        <p>When Japan was chosen as the site of this year's conference on climate change, it relished the chance to play host to a landmark meeting to help save the planet from global warming.</p>
        <p>The meeting, to be held in the ancient capital of Kyoto Dec. 1 to 10, was supposed to demonstrate Japanese leadership and to show that Japan is ready to achieve its dream of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. But these days, some officials worry that the meeting will turn out to be not a triumph but a fiasco.</p>
        <p>''I'm very worried about it,'' said Kazuo Aichi, a former Cabinet minister who is now a pro-environment member of Parliament. ''This will be a test not only of the environment but also of Japanese diplomacy.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that the Kyoto conference was intended to be a historic convention that would commit countries to cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which mainstream scientists believe are linked to global warming. But now that the time for sacrifice is approaching, some countries are losing their enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>There is even some possibility that Japan will preside over a conference that simply falls apart.</p>
        <p>''There is that possibility, but we would like to make utmost efforts to avoid the chance that we have no agreement at all,'' said a senior Japanese Government official involved in preparations for the meeting.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto is caught in a double crossfire on this issue.</p>
        <p>One is the international battle over whether to require sharp cuts in emissions and if so, to whom to apply them. Any agreement that mandates sharp restrictions or places them only on industrialized countries may be torpedoed by Washington, while one that places a significant burden on poor countries may not get their backing.</p>
        <p>The other crossfire is taking place among Japanese bureaucrats, who, as usual, are telling the country's leaders what positions to adopt. The environmental agency is insisting on steep cuts in emissions, while the Ministry of International Trade and Industry says that is preposterous.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hashimoto seems to be leaning toward a compromise that would require industrialized countries to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2010 to 5 percent below their 1990 level. That is much weaker than the European proposal -- for a 15 percent cut below the 1990 level -- but it may still be tougher than the United States is willing to accept.</p>
        <p>President Clinton is convening a major conference on the issue Monday and is expected to decide on the American position later this month. Some Japanese are demanding that their Government do more to influence the United States now.</p>
        <p>''The Kyoto conference will not succeed if Japan simply watches America's reaction and follows it,'' the Asahi Shimbun, probably Japan's most influential newspaper, declared in an editorial. ''The Government should change its thinking so that it can set a higher target and lead America.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Hashimoto knows that the final treaty needs America's backing to be effective. The United States produces 22 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, far more than any other country.</p>
        <p>''Without the United States, we cannot make it,'' the senior official warned. ''The U.S. is vital to this negotiation, and we have to find a solution that is acceptable to it as well.''</p>
        <p>The Japanese plan that is emerging would adhere to some American suggestions that would effectively ease the burden of the cuts. For example, the treaty would allow trade in emission rights and permit developed countries to get credit for reductions that they help bring about in developing nations.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister has yet to decide who will be the chairman of the conference, largely because of skirmishing within the bureaucracy. In the meantime, the dispute has left a vacuum in Japanese preparations.</p>
        <p>Japan saw this forum as ideal for displaying its leadership. Japan's  ''peace constitution'' rules out military leadership but Tokyo has had a long-time interest in the environment. Now, though, as the Kyoto meeting looms as a far greater challenge than was expected, it raises the risk that it will harm Japan's chance to win a seat on the Security Council.</p>
        <p>The Asahi Shimbun quoted an unnamed Cabinet minister as reflecting, ''It was from the beginning a mistake for us to take on the host nation's role.''</p>
