        <p>LEAD: Once they were known as ''Atari Democrats,'' young moderates who saw investment and high technology as the contemporary answer to the New Deal. Today, they are the Democrats' Greens, politicians who see issues like clean air, clean water and global warming as the key to future victories for their party.</p>
        <p>Once they were known as ''Atari Democrats,'' young moderates who saw investment and high technology as the contemporary answer to the New Deal. Today, they are the Democrats' Greens, politicians who see issues like clean air, clean water and global warming as the key to future victories for their party.</p>
        <p>Like all political fashions, the transformation is rooted in more than cold calculation. The Greening of the Democratic Party, a process that can be dated to the first Earth Day in 1970, has taken root in soil that is equal parts idealism, generational politics and economic prosperity.</p>
        <p>''Moderate Republicans, upper-class voters, are with us on the environment,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat. ''It cuts across the old class divisions. If you're a Democrat, especially in a middle-class district or on the West Coast, it is a great issue with the new voters. It is an issue with no downside.''</p>
        <p>No one is more aware of the political potential of environmentalism for the Democrats than the Republicans. That is one reason President Bush went out of his way to satisfy many concerns of the environmentalists in the clean air plan he announced Monday, said Brooks Yeager, legislative director for the Audubon Society. Lure of Environmental Cause</p>
        <p>Environmentalists were ecstatic, not because the Bush plan met all their demands but because the bows in their direction demonstrated once again the bipartisan lure of their cause. Democrats note that this is not the first time Republicans have tried to neutralize the environmental issue.</p>
        <p>In fact, anyone who wants to hear Democrats say nice things about Richard M. Nixon should ask them about the former President's environmental record. It included the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the first Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>''Richard Nixon, he's the guy who put all this stuff on the books,'' said Senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat who is a leading Congressional environmentalist.</p>
        <p>According to Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who has won the sobriquet Mr. Global Warming for his concerned commentary on that ecological threat, Mr. Nixon's strong environmental record was a direct response to the initiatives of former Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine. In 1971, Mr. Muskie seemed likely to be the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1972 and had made the environment a centerpiece of his campaign.</p>
        <p>''Nixon,'' said Mr. Gore, ''moved to co-opt the issue.''</p>
        <p>The Green Democrats bristle at suggestions that there might be at least a whiff of political calculation in their own environmentalism. Mr. Gore recalls that when he sought to make environmentalism an issue in his unsuccessful 1988 Presidential campaign, political analysts scoffed at what they regarded as his naivete. Now, he said with a laugh, some of the same political analysts are scoffing that he is simply jumping on a popular issue.</p>
        <p>Not opportunity but biography is what Democratic environmentalists talk about in explaining their commitments.</p>
        <p>''As I was entering high school, my mother was reading 'Silent Spring' and the dinner table conversation was about pesticides and the environment,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The year I graduated from college the momentum was building for Earth Day. After Vietnam, as I was entering divinity school, the Club of Rome report came out and the limits to growth was a main issue.'' Search for New Issues</p>
        <p>Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who was elected to the Senate at the age of 34 in the Democratic landslide of 1974, said ''post-Depression-era Democrats'' were naturally inclined to search for new issues.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the things Democrats had fought for before - education and health care, for example - we thought we could take for granted,'' he said. ''We were younger. We tended to be more future-oriented. We escaped World War II. We were aware of technological changes and some of the price paid by technological changes.''</p>
        <p>When the ''Atari Democrats'' first emerged in the early Reagan years, their commitments to free markets and investment won them much criticism from older liberals, who considered their neo-liberalism as warmed-over Reaganism. Mr. Leahy, who combines his environmentalism with an old-fashioned commitment to social programs, argues that the cutbacks of the Reagan years suggested that it had been a mistake for members of his Congressional class to take the old programs for granted.</p>
        <p>But some of the Atari Democrats argue that their commitment to innovative uses of markets and to the environment are complementary. Mr. Wirth, for example, has sought to bring his two passions together by arguing that market forces can be harnessed to protect the environment and work better than ''command-and-control regulations.'' A Right to Pollute</p>
        <p>In a report co-written with Senator John Heinz, a Pennsylvania Republican, Mr. Wirth argued that by strictly limiting the amount of chemical pollutants that all companies would be permitted to emit and then allowing companies to buy and sell permits for the right to pollute, the Government could let the market encourage the most efficient ways of reducing pollution. President Bush's new clean air plan includes such an approach.</p>
        <p>If all this sounds very popular, environmental Democrats like Mr. Wirth and Mr. Gore argue that there are also real political costs to their positions. Mr. Wirth noted that real-estate agents, who tend to favor rapid growth, and auto companies, who fear the impact of anti-pollution regulations on profits, have supported his opponents in election campaigns.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore said an economic downturn could threaten the progress that the environmental cause has made. ''At some point, when environmental protection shuts down an existing business, even if it creates two new businesses, the transition is painful enough to give politicians' pause,'' Mr. Gore said. ''What looks like a risk-free issue is certainly not.''</p>
        <p>For the moment, though, the nation is prospering, and so are the Green Democrats.</p>
