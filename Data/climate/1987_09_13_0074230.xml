        <p>LEAD: FOR the short run, increased pipeline capacity in the Middle East has eased worries of a possible cut-off of supplies coming through the Persian Gulf and a consequent series of price shocks that would stagger the economy.

        <p>FOR the short run, increased pipeline capacity in the Middle East has eased worries of a possible cut-off of supplies coming through the Persian Gulf and a consequent series of price shocks that would stagger the economy. Indeed, at midweek, after a report from the International Energy Agency that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's pivotal member, had exceeded its quota last month, oil prices dipped below $19 a barrel on the world markets.</p>
        <p>For the longer run, however, concern about the country's dependence on imported oil has far from abated. According to an Administration study, dropping domestic production could mean that by 1995, 50 percent of the nation's energy will come from foreign sources; during the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo, the figure was 33 percent. Oil imports accounted for 86 percent of the jump in July's trade deficit, reported Friday, though that rate of increase is not expected to continue.</p>
        <p>As for the domestic oil industry, as long as oil prices remain around $18 a barrel, many analysts say American companies will be raising exploration budgets that were drastically curtailed after last year's price collapse. The oil-patch states continue to lobby for production incentives, with remedies ranging from repeal of the so-called windfall profits tax to an oil import fee. But it is increasingly clear that oil is not the only answer to the country's energy needs. The stories that follow explore the status of other energy sources.</p>
        <p>IF supply were all, coal would be king. By most calculations, enough coal runs in seams beneath the land to last the United States for the next 400 years, at current rates of consumption. Coal now provides the country with more than 55 percent of its electrical generating power. But the nation's most abundant energy source has also proved one of its dirtiest. Sulfur and other emissions were a source of controversy and regulation for more than a decade before acid rain became a national issue.</p>
        <p>The coal industry tries mightily to keep on the books laws designed to inhibit production and use of other fuels. At the same time, it advances proposals to promote coal use by ending moratoriums on the leasing of Federally owned land, making it easier to build coal slurry pipelines, and providing subsidies for converting coal to methanol and other alternative fuels. Proponents argue that such development is in the national interest, and the more coal that is dug, the cheaper it is. Opponents call that false economy, saying it is too expensive to burn more coal cleanly enough to prevent acid rain.</p>
        <p>As industry and government researchers work on cleaning up coal - Washington is providing $750 million for studies - measures to control emissions are now before Congress. They include such steps as the installation of so-called tall stacks on coal-burning plants; utilities have said, however, that the changes could mean a 25 pecent rate increase.</p>
