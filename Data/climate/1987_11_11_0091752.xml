        <p>LEAD: MORE than a decade after the last order was placed in this country for a commercial nuclear plant, some engineers and utility analysts think it is time to start developing a second generation of reactors that would be meltdown-proof. Their hope is that these reactors would be available when the demand for power picks up and when cost or environmental impact makes fossil fuels unattractive.</p>
        <p>MORE than a decade after the last order was placed in this country for a commercial nuclear plant, some engineers and utility analysts think it is time to start developing a second generation of reactors that would be meltdown-proof. Their hope is that these reactors would be available when the demand for power picks up and when cost or environmental impact makes fossil fuels unattractive.</p>
        <p>A step toward a new reactor technology could come in the next few weeks as the Department of Energy entertains proposals for a new reactor to produce bomb fuel. Proponents of gas-graphite, technology largely bypassed in this country, are hoping that the Government will construct a graphite plant that could be a model for a new generation of civilian reactors.</p>
        <p>Graphite has had a bad name since the April 1986 accident at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant. There, the burning graphite core sent radioactive contaminants into the upper atmosphere, and around the world. But the reactor being proposed for the Department of Energy has a different design, which the manufacturer, GA Technologies Inc., said would not permit the melting of nuclear fuel.</p>
        <p>The company says the plant ''does not depend on active engineered safety features or human actions for safety of the public or the investment,'' and that passive features make a melting of the nuclear fuel impossible even if the operators make errors and all the mechanical safety equipment fails.</p>
        <p>The reason is the substitution of graphite, which withstands extreme heat, for water, which heat drives off, and for metal, which heat will melt.</p>
        <p>In all nuclear reactors, atoms of uranium or plutonium are struck by neutrons and split. This process generates heat and releases more neutrons, which split other atoms, continuing the chain reaction.</p>
        <p>To slow the neutrons to the speed at which they are most likely to cause another atom to split, reactors use a medium called a moderator. Civilian reactors in this country, with one exception, use ordinary water (called light water) as the moderator.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union and a few other nations use graphite. The Department of Energy operates one graphite plant, the N-Reactor, in Hanford, Wash., to produce plutonium for bombs.</p>
        <p>The design by GA, formerly General Atomics, differs markedly from the ones at Hanford and Chernobyl. A major difference from the Chernobyl plant is that as temperature rises, it tends to choke off the nuclear reaction. At Chernobyl, the opposite was true.</p>
        <p>Unlike either the Chernobyl design or the N-Reactor, the GA design does not use metal to encase the nuclear fuel. Instead, GA uses a multilayered ceramic and carbon pellet, little bigger than a grain of sand. Linden Blue, GA's vice chairman, describes these pellets as pressure vessels - the term that in light-water plants is used to describe the multi-ton steel containers in which the water is heated to 600 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>The pellets are formed into cylinders about the size of a crayon, and the cylinders are placed into blocks of graphite a little bigger than a coffee table.</p>
        <p>As the uranium in the pellets is split, the heat and the neutrons flow out of the pellets. But the ''daughter atoms'' created by the fission, which are the main source of radioactivity, are trapped inside.</p>
        <p>The graphite holds the fuel in place and moderates the neutrons' speed. In normal operation, the graphite blocks absorb the heat of the reaction and give it off to the helium gas that is used as a coolant. The gas is then used to boil water into steam to make electricity.</p>
        <p>In an accident, the graphite can withstand very high temperatures without damage, even if the helium ceases to circulate. In contrast, in a light-water reactor, the water that functions as a moderator and coolant can boil away, and the metal used to hold the fuel in place can melt.</p>
        <p>The graphite reactor is meltdown-proof, according to the designers, because it cannot reach 3,272 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature at which the fuel pellets could break open and allow the radiation to escape.</p>
        <p>The reactor is designed to be buried in a silo, and even if the helium stops circulating, and if back-up heat-removal systems fail, heat will radiate to the silo walls and into the soil, holding temperatures to a maximum of 2,912 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>GA's proposal for a military reactor differs little in design from its civilian plant. The plan primarily adds ''target elements'' of lithium-six, a type of lithium that turns to tritium when it absorbs a neutron. The tritium is a type of hydrogen that is the fuel of H-bombs.</p>
        <p>One commercial demonstration graphite plant was built: Fort St. Vrain, in the Colorado town of the same name. The plant is not a good advertisement for the technology, having produced only about 10 percent of the power that would have resulted if it could have run around the clock at 100 percent of capacity. GA says that Fort St. Vrain demonstrated the high quality of the fuel, and the benefits of using helium as the coolant instead of water. But the helium circulator was an untried design, and broke down frequently.</p>
        <p>For a new plant, GA says it would use a design proved in Europe, where several graphite-moderated, helium-cooled reactors are operating successfully.</p>
        <p>GA is competing with some well-established vendors. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which designs light water reactors, and Bechtel, the architect-engineering concern that has built many of them, have signed an agreement to bid for the construction of a light-water reactor or a heavy-water reactor, whichever the Department of Energy chooses.</p>
