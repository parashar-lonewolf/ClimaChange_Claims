        <p>LEAD: WITH evidence mounting that the earth is becoming a hotter place to live, the United States and many other nations are beginning to plan for climatic change caused by what environmentalists call the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>WITH evidence mounting that the earth is becoming a hotter place to live, the United States and many other nations are beginning to plan for climatic change caused by what environmentalists call the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Once dismissed as the stuff of science fiction, the greenhouse effect is now being taken so seriously that some economists are predicting that it will eventually cost tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars a year to cut down on the gaseous emissions that are thought to be raising the surface temperature of the planet and to deal with the consequences. Even if the trend can be slowed, many scientists consider serious environmental and economic damage a foregone conclusion.</p>
        <p>While the worst problems are not expected until early in the next century, scientists at a Senate hearing last week suggested that the greenhouse effect might conceivably be contributing to the current drought, which has parched farmlands from New Mexico to Pennsylvania and from Idaho to South Carolina. Amid record-breaking temperatures, 40 percent of the counties in the United States have been declared disaster areas, and the Agriculture Department predicted that shortages could cause food prices to rise an extra 1 percent this year. ''It is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here,'' said Dr. James E. Hansen, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Institute for Space Studies. It is impossible to link a particular heat wave to climatic change. But according to Dr. Hansen's estimates, the hottest four years since the 1880's occurred during this decade. Average global temperatures for 1988 are the highest on record, he said, and heat waves and droughts in the Southeastern and Midwestern sections of the United States will become more frequent.</p>
        <p>In other areas, such as Canada and the Soviet Union, warmer temperatures could lead to richer grain harvests, though some scientists believe that temperatures will increase so quickly that it will be difficult for any country to reap economic benefits. ''There will be no winners,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, atmospheric physicist for the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
        <p>The greenhouse effect has been a subject of international concern for some time. At their recent summit meeting, President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a project to plan for a changing climate. Beginning tomorrow, government officials from every continent will meet with scientists and environmentalists in Toronto for a ''World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere.'' The United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization are forming a panel to gather data. Strategic Engineering</p>
        <p>In the United States, planning for the greenhouse effect is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency. Dennis Tirpak, head of strategic studies for the E.P.A., said that many roads, dams, water supply systems and storm drains will have to be designed with the possibility of drastically changed weather patterns in mind. E.P.A. officials noted, for example, that in planning for a new storm sewer system, officials of Charleston, S.C., are taking into account the possibility that melting polar ice and thermal expansion will cause the ocean to rise. James Titus, an E.P.A. economist, said that it would cost $10 billion to $50 billion to replace beaches washed away by rising tides. Coastal cities, he said, can be guarded by levees and pumps. But hundreds of thousands of acres of Louisiana lowland might be inundated, he said, and the port of New Orleans might have to be moved.</p>
        <p>The greenhouse effect is caused by gases that concentrate in the atmosphere and, like a greenhouse, trap heat from the sun. Until recent decades, excess carbon dioxide, created mostly by the burning of coal, oil and wood, was considered the biggest problem. But other gases are now believed to be rapidly accumulating, including chlorofluorocarbons from aerosol sprays and other sources, nitrous oxides from fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers, and methane from organic matter.</p>
        <p>If the current rate of buildup continues, then sometime between the years 2025 and 2050, the temperature of the earth's surface could have increased by an average of 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit. This could cause the sea level to rise by one to four feet. Evaporation is expected to cause inland waters such as the Great Lakes to recede.</p>
        <p>Many scientists believe that it is the rate rather than the magnitude of the change that poses the greatest challenge. ''We may be moving through an entire geological epoch in a single century,'' said Dr. John S. Hoffman, director of the global atmosphere program of the E.P.A.'s Office of Air and Radiation. ''We are talking about changing the entire fabric of nature.'' Dr. Irving R. Mintzer, a senior scientist for the World Resources Institute, an environmental group in Washington, said that a 9-degree change over several decades would exceed any that has occurred during the last 10 million years. Some scientists also predict desiccated mid-continents, dying forests, violent storms and other catastrophes. There could also be beneficial changes; the Arctic Ocean, for example, could be navigable throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mintzer said that a first step to diminishing global warming would be to ratify and implement a protocol, agreed to by 40 nations in Montreal last September, which would freeze and then cut back the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons. So far, only the United States and Mexico have ratified the pact. But many scientists believe that it will also be necessary to sharply reduce the combustion of coal, oil and gasoline. Environmental groups recommend conservation and solar and other renewable sources of energy, but concern about the greenhouse effect could also revive interest in nuclear power. Since trees absorb carbon dioxide, through the process of photosynthesis, restoring forest areas might also help. According to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, deforestation continues at a rate of 27 million acres a year. Mitigating Effects</p>
        <p>Joseph Mullan, senior vice president for environmental issues at the National Coal Association, an industry group, contended that the role played by coal in contributing to atmospheric carbon dioxide is still unknown. He noted that some scientists believe that the earth is moving toward a new ice age that would cancel out the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lester B. Lave, a professor of economics at Carnegie-Mellon University who has examined the implications of global warming, argued that while a change in climate is fairly likely, it is hard to know much more than that. In the meantime, he said, ''there is no way to justify spending tens of billions of dollars a year to prevent the greenhouse effect.'' The higher temperatures of the 1980's could be the result of natural climatic variation.</p>
        <p>Several scientists suggested that policy makers start preparing ''strategic hedges'' against possible disruptions of the food supply. But such long-range strategies are likely to be of little comfort to farmers stricken by the current drought. Late last week, the National Weather Service predicted that whatever its cause, hot and dry weather would continue in the Plains and Middle West for the rest of the month.</p>
