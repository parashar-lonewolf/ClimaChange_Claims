        <p>THE moment should strike sometime around midday on Wednesday. It will dawn on someone -- perhaps the president-elect himself -- that despite all that rosy campaign-trail optimism about how this is America's moment of glory, the next four years could get really, really nasty.</p>
        <p>While America remains strong and prosperous, there's a palpable nervousness that a lot of problems are ready to become uncorked. The next war in the Middle East may have already started. The same goes for the next economic slowdown at home. Who knows what use India or Pakistan will make of their nuclear toys? Or whether North Korea is really ready to auction off its missiles? Southeast Asia's giant, Indonesia, appears to be fracturing, and scientists are pretty worried that Al Gore wasn't crazy to think that global warming is already under way. And those are just the specters everybody already knows about.</p>
        <p>Maybe, just maybe, America is on the kind of roll that both presidential candidates have taken for granted.  Maybe its military competitors are so far behind, its global businesses so far ahead, its friends in Europe and Asia so secure that, no matter who gives the victory speech on Tuesday night, his biggest challenge will be to manage good times.</p>
        <p>But maybe not.</p>
        <p>''Times have been so good for so long that you have to think the next four years are going to be comparatively ugly,'' one of President Clinton's top advisers said recently. ''Just look at all the bullets we ducked'' -- a near-nuclear exchange in South Asia, near blowups in Korea and the Taiwan Strait, financial near-disasters. Even the optimist-in-chief, Bill Clinton, has remarked to his staff about the huge gulf between what the candidates have been talking about (prescription drugs, tax cuts, secure retirement) and the kind of issues consuming him in his last days in office (terror attacks, a Middle East blowup, Balkan hatreds).</p>
        <p>So what could make Tuesday's victor wish, in a few months or a few years, that the other guy had won?</p>
        <p>Start with the perennial problem-in-waiting: an economy that's been running on eight cylinders for longer than any in history. It could begin running on, say, just four. Or, as one of President Clinton's former top economic officials puts it: ''Not a recession. Just something that, after all this prosperity, feels like a recession.''</p>
        <p>The signs are already there. The stock market's fall to Earth has made free-spending consumers feel a little less wealthy. Out here on the frontier of the new economy, a lot of E-entrepreneurs are suddenly sending resumes to old-line companies that compensate their employees with a regular salary, not stock options. Detroit is sitting on car inventories so big that eight of the country's 55 auto plants are taking a weeklong holiday.</p>
        <p>NONE of that spells doom; it may just be a much-needed pause. Still, those surpluses Mr. Gore and George W. Bush argued about all year could dissolve overnight if Congress comes under pressure to spur the economy.</p>
        <p>And that's just the start. Once the American economy slows, international investors are likely to think about putting their money elsewhere. That money is financing a record trade deficit that few care about as long as jobs are plentiful.</p>
        <p>What if unemployment rises? (Where else can it go?)  That benign trade deficit will look like it's stealing jobs.  Just ask the other George Bush, who was ushered out of the Oval Office partly because of a national perception that such economic issues bored him.</p>
        <p>Then there is a long list of less familiar frights. Mr. Clinton's former national security adviser, Anthony Lake, has just published a guidebook to future calamities -- ''Six Nightmares'' (Little, Brown &amp; Co.) -- in which he describes wandering through Washington's MCI Center, just blocks from the White House, to see how vulnerable the indoor stadium might be to biological attack. Big surprise: no one challenged him.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Pentagon quietly ran an experiment a few years ago to see how much damage some medium-skilled hackers could inflict on the country's infrastructure. Plenty, it found.</p>
        <p>While there has been lots of talk in the campaign of keeping America strong, perhaps the most complex set of new threats involve the weakness, rather than strength, of other countries. That was the lesson of the Soviet breakup, the Mexican and Asian economic crises, the fracturing of Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>It may be the lesson of the Middle East, where the economic disparity between Israel and the Palestinians only fuels the ethnic and territorial tensions. The Arab states have failed to build strong democracies, legal institutions and economies, the combination usually associated with stability and security. Along with its peace brokering, the Clinton administration has made some modest efforts to close the economic gap, figuring that once young Arabs have an economic stake in peace and stability, they are less likely to lob rocks or worse. It's a nice theory, but so far it hasn't taken hold.</p>
        <p>Weakness and fear are clearly at the heart of the India-Pakistan dispute; why else would two nations battling so much poverty, corruption and population growth divert their scarce cash into building nuclear weapons? The Bomb, indeed, has become the poor nation's equalizer, the way to make the world deal with them.</p>
        <p>''Half the foreign and defense policy establishment fears, legitimately, that the Big Terrible Thing is coming, whether in India-Pakistan, or in Asia or in lower Manhattan,'' Peggy Noonan, the Ronald Reagan loyalist who is supporting Mr. Bush, wrote last week. Yet the Bush campaign has said lots about national defense, and far less about preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore talks about preventive diplomacy but can be equally vague. Indonesia has been fracturing since the ouster of its strongman, President Suharto, more than two years ago, threatening a crackup of the world's fourth most populous nation. Yet when asked in a recent interview how he would approach Indonesia's problems, the vice president allowed that maybe it was near time to assemble some experts on the subject.</p>
        <p>WHO can blame these guys? Promising to strengthen America is one thing, but it's a rare politician who dares to run on a platform of using America's money or military to prop up weak nations.</p>
        <p>It's no way to get elected president. It probably never will be. Whether it's a way to secure America's place in the world is a different question -- one the next president can start thinking about on Wednesday.</p>
