        <p>Opens today in Manhattan  Directed by Michael Taylor  Not rated; 85 minutes</p>
        <p>''The Great Warming,'' a straightforward, quietly persuasive primer on the climate-change crisis, provides both an abridged history and science lesson (delivered through the narration of Keanu Reeves and Alanis Morissette and some clunky computer graphics) and a vital briefing on where we stand today.</p>
        <p>Stemming from a three-part series originally shown on Canadian television in 2004, this documentary, directed by Michael Taylor, travels four continents and encounters a wide assortment of ''real people'' -- ranging from scientists and professors to farmers and fishermen to architects and youth activists -- whose everyday lives are increasingly influenced by the effects of global warming. There certainly isn't a skeptic in the lot.</p>
        <p>Without undermining the urgency of the situation, the film radiates optimism that the human race can seriously explore its role in keeping Earth a habitable planet, and has already begun to do so. As long as the political leaders who hold the power to implement a larger plan of action remain in ''climate denial'' (in the words of Stephen Schneider, a biologist from Stanford University), ''The Great Warming,'' along with ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the other widely released documentary to address climate change this year, should be required viewing by all. Future generations' lives, and maybe even ours, depend on it.</p>
