        <p>SEASON'S greetings! Time to tickle another sacred cow.</p>
        <p>The MetLife (formerly Pan Am) Building at the foot of Park Avenue is one of the worst disasters ever to befall the New York cityscape. All New Yorkers acknowledge the universal truth of this belief. None would dare challenge it, unless they are stupid, desperate for attention or completely out of their minds.</p>
        <p>But Kivi Sotamaa, a young Finnish architect who is not mad, dumb or sensationalistic, likes the MetLife Building very much. Mr. Sotamaa may hesitate before saying so. He is 28, polite and lives in Helsinki. He understands that the dreadfulness of the building is an article of local faith. But on a recent evening, as we were walking down Park Avenue, we looked up the gray cliff of MetLife's concrete northern facade, and I found myself looking at the architecture through his eyes. Att-r-r-ractive brute!</p>
        <p>Mr. Sotamaa, a finalist in the competition held earlier this year to design a time capsule for The New York Times, admires the proportions of the three-dimensional facade and the rhythm of its windows. He likes the procession through the lobby to the escalators that descend to the main concourse at Grand Central Terminal. Most startling of all, Mr. Sotamaa appreciates the closure that the building brings to the southern end of Park Avenue, and to the grand boulevard of International Style office towers leading toward it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sotamaa's view will not be applauded by those who have long considered this stretch of Park Avenue a sorry display of the skinny glass boxes that began to take over the skyline in the postwar decades. But to him, and to a surprising number of other architects and city-lovers, the so-called Park Avenue Corridor is the architectural heart of the 20th century. The corridor is the crystallization of the New York myth, the soaring city of work and ambition, where the sky is the limit and dreams are fulfilled. It symbolizes New York's displacement of Paris as the century's most vibrant City of Light.</p>
        <p>The corridor contains several individual buildings of distinction from the 1950's to 60's, including the Seagram Building, Lever House, 500 Park Avenue (originally the Pepsi-Cola Building) and the Chase Building (originally the Union Carbide Building), the last three designed by the New York firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, and Philip Johnson's Russell Sage Foundation (originally Asia House). James Ingo Freed's Park Tower, completed in 1981, is a somber late addition to the group, while Frank Lloyd Wright's 1958 Mercedes-Benz (originally Jaguar) Showroom offers a quirky footnote to the ramp of the Guggenheim Museum's rotunda.</p>
        <p>But much of the corridor's power lies in the aggregate, in the mix of lesser buildings with well-known landmarks. At the century's outset, long before the first curtain wall was actually hung, architects used to dream about the gleaming cities that glass would enable them to build.  Here, the dream was realized. It looks particularly misty at this time of year, when the sun sets early and the street shimmers with holiday sparkle. Like towering ice palaces, the buildings glint with silver, white and gold.</p>
        <p>The term International Style was coined by Philip Johnson and Henry Russell Hitchcock for an exhibition in 1932 at the Museum of Modern Art. Though the show included a few United States buildings and established Mr. Johnson as an arbiter of American architectural taste, the term became mainly linked to the work of European modernists like J. J. P. Oud, Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto. In the postwar decades, the International Style became shorthand for the steel and glass towers like the Seagram Building, the supreme example of the genre, designed by Mies and Johnson in 1957-58.</p>
        <p>Mies described his own aesthetic as one of ''almost nothing,'' a paring down of form to the discreet articulation of construction and enclosure.  Walls were reduced to the transparent membrane of the glass curtain wall. Structure was expressed on the exterior by the application of non structural I-beams. This approach exemplified the architect's belief that less is more. It enlarged the artistic significance of proportion, scale, quality of materials and refinement of detail.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, it was said that these buildings represented a rejection of history. In fact, modern architects merely declined to use historical period styles. No movement has ever set down roots into deeper historical soil. Mies himself was strongly influenced by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the exemplar of neo-Classicism in 19th-century Berlin. The rationalism associated with the style harked back to the ideal of scientific objectivity promoted by the 18th-century Enlightenment. From the 19th-century realist movement came such modernist beliefs as truth to materials and the rejection of showy display. Above all, the International Style was grounded in 19th-century historicism: the view that each epoch should produce a distinctive architectural style.</p>
        <p>The Will of an Epoch</p>
        <p>According to this linear view (restated by plaster casts in countless turn-of-the-century museums), Egyptians, Romans and the medieval French had each produced a style. Therefore, the modern, industrial age should have its own manner of building. As Mies famously said, architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space. As an embodiment of this belief, the International Style can be seen as the 19th century's last gasp. Though it became a symbol of the 20th-century metropolis, in fact it represented an aestheticized version of the train sheds, factories, bridges and other engineering marvels of the 19th-century industrial city. Far from rejecting history, in other words, the architects of the Park Avenue Corridor were actually behind the times. They developed the perfect vernacular for an era in urban history that had already begun to wane by the time their buildings arose.</p>
        <p>Interest in the International Style has been building in the last decade. In 1992, Terence Riley, now chief curator of the Modern's architecture and design department, remounted the museum's 1932 show at Columbia University. The same year, Hani Rashid, a professor at Columbia's architecture school, chose the Park Avenue Corridor as one of three Manhattan sites for a design project in his studio. This past term, Michael Maltzen, an architect based in Los Angeles, led a group of students at Harvard's Graduate School of Design in a similar project based on Craig Ellwood's classic Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.</p>
        <p>Most of the Park Avenue Corridor's buildings have reached the age when they qualify for landmark designation, which would afford them the protection of the city's preservation laws. This is a moment of irony: those laws were enacted partly to curtail the proliferation of modernist buildings and the loss of the fine old masonry edifices that they replaced.  Like them or not, however, the historic and aesthetic value of these buildings must now be reckoned with. Interpretations of their meaning must be rethought.</p>
        <p>Is it really true, for example, that the International Style contradicted public taste? This has been one of the hoary myths on which preservationists and postmodernists have relied since the 1970's. But in the early 1960's, the International Style was a symbol of urban sophistication in many Hollywood movies, as accurate a barometer as we have of popular desires. In ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' ''The Best of Everything'' and even several Doris Day comedies, the glass tower epitomized worldly aspiration and success.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is the collision between preservation and the International Style more apparent than in the space that once served as the lobby for 500 Park Avenue. Originally designed for Pepsi-Cola, now PepsiCo, which subsequently sold it to Olivetti, it is a paragon of excellence in corporate design. Furnished simply with a reception desk, the lobby was a rectangular bubble of space on which the entire building seemed to float.  Two years ago, the gorgeous space was chopped in two to house a pair of retail establishments. (Lever House is more fortunate. The building's owners have hired David Childs of Skidmore, Owings, &amp; Merrill to restore the exterior and to design new office interiors in keeping with Gordon Bunshaft's original design.)</p>
        <p>The desecration of 500 Park raises the issue of how effectively landmark laws can protect glass buildings. Since the main effect of the glass is to dissolve the boundary between inside and outside, it makes little sense to preserve only exteriors. But interiors, which are usually bland as well as subject to the changing needs of owners and tenants, scarcely seem worth designation. At the same time, when office lighting fixtures are replaced without sensitivity, the effect on the facade can be ruinous.</p>
        <p>Landmark experts face the same question that the Museum of Modern Art has had to tackle. Does modernism refer to a finite historical period, or to an ongoing tradition of innovation? In its plans for expanding the museum, the Modern has more or less dodged the issue by hiring an architect (Yoshio Taniguchi) whose work, while contemporary, is rooted in Miesian ideas. This approach makes sense for an institution that wishes to show that it is both receptive to the present moment and respectful of its past. But it won't be of much use to preservationists who hope that the period could be historically bracketed, any more than terms like Late Modern or neo-Modern accurately describe architects like Mr. Freed, Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey or Rafael Vinoly, whose work extends what they themselves regard as an unbroken line of historical development.</p>
        <p>Essence Over Style</p>
        <p>In fact, if the modern movement was historicism's last gasp, then the whole concept of identifying works by period and period styles has become fairly pointless. A curatorial conceit, the term International Style never meant much to the architects who were chosen for the Modern's 1932 show. To most of them, for that matter, modernism was not to be seen as a style, but rather the rejection of style in favor of essence. Mies, in fact, described his work as building art (Baukunst); to him, the word architecture was overly freighted with superfluous connotations.</p>
        <p>My view of this work is partly nostalgic, partly polemical. At 52, I'm old enough to recall New York as the city where, in the 1960's, the most creatively ambitious work in the world was happening. Today, I'd like to see the city rescued from the suburban rage for safety that post modernism ushered in.</p>
        <p>I can't see the MetLife Building with any pretense of impartiality.  Much of the meaning it held for me evaporated when they banned helicopter flights from the roof and later when Pan Am itself shriveled away.  The airline conferred on the building a unique set of relationships between it, the city and the rest of the world.  To many young baby boomers, Pan Am signified the idea that United States hegemony in the postwar world was essentially benign. The airline's blue and white globe logo represented freedom -- the power to go anywhere, be anyone, lose oneself in the clouds.</p>
        <p>You could arrive at the building by subway, train, taxi or on foot, take the escalator from Grand Central's concourse up to the lobby, ride the elevator to the roof, grab a helicopter to Kennedy Airport and board a jet clipper overseas. This sequence was the closest the city ever came to realizing the 1920's dream of airships moored to the tops of skyscrapers. The connection to Grand Central was critical: a pylon to the glory of 20th-century travel soared above a triumphal monument to the earthbound transport of an earlier day. The building implicitly enlarged the meaning of Grand Central to include the place of New York in the nation and the place of the nation in the world.</p>
        <p>Today, air travel is not something to look forward to, flight attendants have lost their glamour, the depleted ozone layer has been identified as carcinogenic and United States global dominance sometimes calls forth images of exploited third world workers. Yet the MetLife Building nonetheless retains intrinsic merits.  For a start, it bears the signature straightforwardness of the Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius, one of three architects who collaborated on the design. Gropius preferred collaboration to individual artistic statement.  Even Miesian elegance was superfluous to him. Japanese vernacular architecture was his aesthetic ideal. It is expressed here in the uniform prefabricated spandrels, the ribbon windows and the exposed concrete.</p>
        <p>Like Gio Ponti's Pirelli Tower in Milan (another transportation landmark), the lozenge form of the floor plan expresses the service core at the center, containing the elevators that make tall buildings possible. The plan also created a faceted facade that diminished the impression of bulk. Compared to the Pirelli Tower, the MetLife Building lacks finesse. In compensation, the building offered public access: to its generous lobby spaces, the rooftop heliport, and the Sky Club restaurant on the penthouse floor.</p>
        <p>The lobbies were destroyed in 1987 by Warren Platner's remodeling: a parade of golden headdresses, earrings, ferns and limp hankies evidently conceived to evoke a floor-show version of an Aztec wedding festival at a fifth-rate Las Vegas casino. The building's true core, however, is ethical and remains intact. It is the surrender of the individual voice to a collective cultural expression.</p>
        <p>A Different Angle</p>
        <p>Architects younger than I am -- like Mr. Sotamaa, Lindy Roy, Mr. Rashid, Lise Anne Couture, Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto, who were joined by the critic Jeffrey Kipnis at a recent meeting with Philip Johnson at the Seagram Building -- see the slice of architecture along Park Avenue from a slightly different angle. They weren't around when buildings like the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Museum, the CBS Building and Lever House were new.  They can't recall a time before the distinction had broken down between art and art history, and the city was more inclined to accept Whitehead's idea that the business of the future is to be dangerous.</p>
        <p>At the same time, they've managed to remain insulated from the hostility that International Style buildings still arouse. Most of them teach in schools where the work of Eero Saarinen, Mies and Mr. Bunshaft is studied and venerated. They are able to see well beyond the glass box surface into deeper levels of meaning and value. None of these architects are reworking the International Style. If they're united by any aesthetic, it is the polymorphous one still being forged with the aid of computer software. But they appreciate the intellectual rigor that animates this work and the solidarity among the architects who produced it.</p>
        <p>Many young designers have learned to look at Manhattan through the lens ground and polished by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. In his 1978 book ''Delirious New York'' and other writings, Mr. Koolhaas resisted the standard, simplistic pro or con: rational on the one hand, sterile on the other. Instead, he showed that in pursuit of a rational city modern architects had brought forth a highly surrealistic one. In the reflections of the crystal canyon, the world of external reality merges with the subjective realm of ambition, fantasy and desire.</p>
        <p>No design in recent years has given firmer shape to this idea than Christian de Portzamparc's LVMH Tower at 19-21 East 57th Street. Described by Mr. Portzamparc as an homage to the city of glass, the 23-story tower features a faceted glass skin that unfolds like a crystal flower. While the tower can't possibly be mistaken for an International Style skyscraper, LVMH responds to the context of the mythical New York where modernity took root. And it is the first blossom that this root has sent forth in many years.</p>
        <p>So here's my holiday toast to our great city. Architecture is back. May it stick around a while.</p>
