        <p>LEAD: As industrial nations move toward a ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons - the refrigerant used in air-conditioners and refrigerators -by 2000, another problem looms: the likely replacement, although an improvement, also harms the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>As industrial nations move toward a ban on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons - the refrigerant used in air-conditioners and refrigerators -by 2000, another problem looms: the likely replacement, although an improvement, also harms the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The problem grows out of the Montreal Protocol, an agreement signed by most of the developed nations in 1987, pledging to cut by half the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's for short, by 1998 to preserve the earth's protective ozone layer. This summer, chemical industry officials and environmental groups predict, the agreement will likely be strengthened to a complete ban on production by 2000.</p>
        <p>The issue now being debated is how long the likely replacement for CFC's will be used. Environmental advocates are pushing for an early phase-out date for the best available replacement - hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFC's - as a means of spurring research to find alternatives that do not damage the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But chemical companies reply that moving quickly to phase out the replacement for CFC's could result in a critical shortage of refrigeration fluids that will be essential to preserve food and drug supplies later in the decade. The chemical producers explain that unless they are assured enough production time to recoup their investments, they will not build factories to make the replacement.</p>
        <p>The chemical companies contend that they need assurances of up to 60 years of production of the replacements to justify making multibillion-dollar investments in new factories to meet the projected demand.</p>
        <p>Difficult Trade-Off</p>
        <p>The result is a public policy debate that pits environmentalists against chemical makers led by the Du Pont Company. And the dispute illustrates the kind of difficult trade-off that will increasingly be encountered as the global drive to protect the environment runs into economic and practical obstacles.</p>
        <p>Shortages of refrigerants, should they occur, would be more than an inconvenience. Some 75 percent of the nation's food supply depends on chilling at some point along the processing and distribution chain, while blood supplies and many medicines also need to be continuously chilled.</p>
        <p>More than two billion pounds a year of CFC's are used worldwide, about a third of that total in the United States; the uses include not only refrigeration but fields like insulation and electronics.</p>
        <p>When released to the air, the CFC's and other chlorine-containing gases rise to the upper atmosphere and break into their constituent elements by solar radiation. The chlorine released is widely believed to attack the layer of ozone that shields the earth's surface from harmful solar waves. CFC's are estimated to constitute almost 60 percent of the man-made ozone-depleting elements that enter the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Substitutes for CFC's that are not hazardous have been found for many applications. But the best replacements in cooling equipment, refrigerant producers say, are hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Yet HCFC's contain ozone-depleting chlorine, too, although at a much lower level than CFC's.</p>
        <p>''HCFC's represent a significant improvement,'' said F. Anthony Vogelsberg, environmental manager for Du Pont's Freon Products division. ''They have one-tenth the lifetime and one-tenth to one-twentieth the ozone-depletion potential. But they do not represent zero risk.''</p>
        <p>Most big chemical companies insist that HCFC's are the best replacement until a new generation of compounds can be developed that do not contain chlorine. But environmental groups, seeking to force the pace of technological development, are urging that an early date be set for elimination of HCFC's as well.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Clark, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said CFC makers did little to develop non-chlorine replacements after CFC's were removed from aerosol cans in this country in 1978 because of concerns about the atmosphere. ''There ought to be a lot more research on refrigerants,'' he said. ''There certainly was not much done in the 1970's.''</p>
        <p>Research 'Hiatus' Feared</p>
        <p>David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has pushed for the CFC ban, has similar concerns. He said development of HCFC's, as well as the chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbons, was placed ''on the back burner'' in 1980. ''We lost six to eight years of research,'' he said. ''We do not want another hiatus in development.''</p>
        <p>Other materials can be used as refrigerants, but are either unproved or have known drawbacks. Ammonia, widely used before CFC's were developed, is toxic. Other potential candidates are flammable, corrosive or need to operate at pressures too high to be practical for home appliances.</p>
        <p>A provision to ban HCFC production by 2010 is expected to be introduced in the Senate this year when legislation to renew the Clean Air Act comes up for debate.</p>
        <p>Some companies, including Du Pont, which produces half the CFC's used in this country, are balking at building plants to produce HCFC's unless they see a way to recover their costs. ''We need a 20-year life cycle to pay for these investments,'' Mr. Vogelsberg said. ''So if you say, 'Phase out by 2010,' that means do not build after 1990.'' Du Pont favors using the materials until sometime between 2030 and 2050.</p>
        <p>Estimated Cost in Billions</p>
        <p>Mr. Vogelsberg said the company would have to invest about $1 billion over the next decade to have enough HCFC production to supply its share of the current CFC market. Worldwide, he said, $4 billion to $6 billion will have to be spent to produce substitutes to CFC's.</p>
        <p>Du Pont has built several pilot plants to make HCFC's in small quantities, but is holding back on large operations until the deadlines for phasing out HCFC's are clarified. Other chemical producers are going ahead with production plants, but with misgivings.</p>
        <p>William M. Corcoran, an official of Allied-Signal Inc,, said the company believes its HCFC investments represent a ''great risk.'' Officials of ICI Americas Inc. have said that if the United States attempts to impose more stringent standards than other countries, the whole movement to phase out CFC's may be thrown into confusion.</p>
        <p>Users of refrigerants are also concerned. Most are still trying to figure out how to adapt their designs to use HCFC's, which have less lubricating ability than CFC's, in equipment that customers expect to run for 15 to 20 years without maintenance. Industry officials say there is $135 billion worth of cooling devices in operation in the United States that are dependent on CFC's.</p>
        <p>'A Wrench in Planning'</p>
        <p>''Talking about putting time limits on HCFC's throws a wrench in corporate planning,'' said Kevin Fay, director of the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, an industry group. ''These are products they expect to be still selling in 2010.''</p>
        <p>But it is equally unrealistic to decide now to permit HCFC's until 2050, argues Mr. Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, since the effect of chlorine on the atmosphere is still not fully understood. ''It does not make any sense to talk about dates beyond 2020, because it is beyond the planning horizon of businessmen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said Congressional sponsors of proposals to put time limits on HCFC's might compromise on when the phasing out would begin, giving the producers more time to recover investments. ''This is a very important moment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As supplies of CFC's dwindle, they will also become more expensive, if only because of a special tax imposed by Congress last year. The producer price of CFC had been averaging about $1 a pound. But starting this year, the most commonly used compounds will be taxed at $1.37 a pound, and the tax is to increase to almost $5 a pound by the end of the century. The average refrigerator needs a few pounds of the material.</p>
