        <p>LEAD: All homeowners will pay to heat their houses this winter, but some will pay more than they should.</p>
        <p>All homeowners will pay to heat their houses this winter, but some will pay more than they should.</p>
        <p>Often the biggest way to save energy is to replace an old oil or gas furnace with a new one that uses fuel more efficiently, but that is a job best left for warm weather. A very old furnace may deliver only 60 percent of the potential heat in a gallon of fuel oil or a therm of gas; a new one may deliver 80 percent. But the initial price is high, starting at about $1,000 for an oil burner and $1,500 for a gas furnace.</p>
        <p>An easier way to save energy right now is to install an automatic setback thermostat, which adjusts the temperature by time of day. It can, for example, be set to turn the heat down by 5 degrees or 10 degrees at bedtime, and back up again in the morning. You could do the same manually every night, but you'd have to get out of bed in a cold house to turn the heat up again. Another of the automatic thermostat's advantages is that its microchip is less prone to forget than you are.</p>
        <p>If the house is empty during working hours, the setback thermostat can also be programmed to turn the heat down then, too, and to warm the house again before you return home at night. Many models have settings for different days - Saturdays, Sundays and weekdays - to fit the heating cycles to your living schedule.</p>
        <p>If you have central air-conditioning, buy a thermostat that will also serve your needs in summer, reducing energy use when everyone is sleeping or away from home.</p>
        <p>According to the Federal Energy Department, an 8-hour setback of 10 degrees will cut a heating bill by 12 percent in a climate like New York's and by 15 percent in a climate like Atlanta's. Prices start at about $50 but are higher for units that can vary the temperature several times a day and know the difference between weekdays and weekends. If you have to have the unit installed by a professional, the price will be substantially higher. (New York City requires that the work be done by a licensed electrician, although most areas do not.) Thermostats are available at hardware and discount stores, but before you go shopping, jot down the brand and model number of the thermostat you are replacing. Many of the new thermostats specify what types they will replace. Also, gas furnaces that run without pilot lights may need special equipment.</p>
        <p>Some homeowners try to save money by turning their thermostats way down and then heating a single room with a portable electric heater. The amount of savings - or loss - depends on what you pay for energy. In most parts of the country, electricity is substantially more expensive than oil or gas, so using a space heater in this way is like using steak to stretch your supply of hamburger.</p>
        <p>In New York City, for example, electricity costs about 13 cents a kilowatt-hour, so a penny would buy about 260 British thermal units. With No. 2 fuel oil at 90 cents a gallon, a penny would buy about 4 times as much heat, or about 1,200 B.T.U.'s. And with gas at 72 cents a therm, a penny would buy about 1,160 B.T.U.'s.</p>
        <p>A better solution, conservation experts say, is to close radiator valves or hot-air ducts in unused rooms.</p>
        <p>Turning the thermostat down and then up again when you feel cold is not economical, either, since you won't really start saving money until the house has been at a lower temperature for several hours.</p>
        <p>For vacationers, or those who stay away from second homes for long periods, the best way to save money is to set the thermostat at 55 degrees, but no lower. If the outdoor temperature gets very cold, pipes in the walls can freeze if the interior air is not in the 50's.</p>
        <p>Windows and insulation are important in keeping heat indoors. Even now, well into the heating season, it is not too late tighten up your home, making changes that will save money winter after winter and summer after summer, too, if the house is air-conditioned.</p>
        <p>Which steps will save the most money for the least cost? The easy way to find out is to call in an expert, and most electric and gas utilities will survey your home at no charge or for a modest fee.</p>
        <p>Another good source is the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service, sponsored by the Energy Department. The service will mail you free literature on a variety of energy-saving steps; call 800-523-2929.</p>
        <p>The first place most experts will look is the attic, because heat rises and then escapes through the ceilings. Adequate insulation can save 30 to 50 percent on fuel bills.</p>
        <p>Double- or triple-pane windows will keep more heat inside in cold weather and will keep your home cooler during hot weather, too.</p>
        <p>Something new on the market is low-emissivity glass, known as ''low-e,'' which does not interfere with visible light but blocks infrared light from radiating out of the house. It also blocks infrared light from entering, which reduces the cooling load in summer but may interfere with solar heating in winter.</p>
