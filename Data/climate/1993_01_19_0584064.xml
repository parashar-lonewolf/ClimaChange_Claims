        <p>IT'S more demanding than special interests. It's more pious than political correctness. It's more evangelical than any rainbow coalition.</p>
        <p>The painfully sincere tone and rigidly mandated diversity of this week's inaugural events constitute a frightening new movement in American politics: the Religious Left.</p>
        <p>The new movement was christened by Fran Lebowitz, the writer, who found herself "out of my mind, on a new planet of fury" as she sat in her Manhattan apartment watching the televised Hopi/Cherokee/Hispanic/ African-American/college student festival of ring-a-ding-ding-a-long that ended the Lincoln Memorial gala on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>"I kept asking myself, 'What do you call these people?' " she said. "And I realized, this is the Religious Left. We now have a President who believes in a place called Wish. I expected Lincoln to leap out of his chair and say, 'Who are you talking to?' "</p>
        <p>The sachems of the Religious Left took swift action yesterday to condemn some of the most blatant transgressors. These included Aretha Franklin, who lost the sachems' respect by wearing a capacious mink coat on stage and traveling with an entourage of fur-bearing women; Oprah Winfrey, who also performed swaddled in the skins of dead animals, and James Carville, the Clinton campaign strategist who presided over a Union Station party in his honor where each buffet had a huge alligator skull and chafing dishes full of spicy alligator sausage. To add insult to injury, the chefs flapped alligator jaws in the faces of diners as they approached the spread.</p>
        <p>Steven Simmons, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said the Lincoln Memorial incident was "the first indication we've had that Aretha Franklin's a fur-wearer."</p>
        <p>"We are planning on contacting her for sending out that callous message," he warned.</p>
        <p>Of the Carville party, Mr. Simmons would say only, "Exotic meats are a little extreme, a little beyond defensible by taste or culture."</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons's organization will be holding the only vegetarian event of the inauguration, an Animals Ball honoring Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Christie Brinkley and other Hollywood animal rights advocates.</p>
        <p>"Our cocktail servers and bartenders will be wearing only aprons saying 'We'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur,' " Mr. Simmons said.  "We're introducing the new line dance craze, Socks Hop, in honor of the First Cat."</p>
        <p>Mr. Carville, the Ragin' Cajun, or Agin' Cajun, as he now refers to himself, was deeply unapologetic. To the Democratic Religious Left, he sent this message: "Eating alligators is better than being eaten by them. If it makes the P.C. people mad, then it makes me happy. Tell them to meet me at the Palm for a steak."</p>
        <p>There was also a lot of muttering among the Religious Left Hollywood chapter about possible leather and limousine infractions among the faithful this week. Macaulay Culkin, the most powerful person in Hollywood under voting age, was sighted bouncing through the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel here in a black leather jacket.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Bergman, the Oscar-winning songwriter of Barbra Streisand hits who helps run the Hollywood Women's Political Committee and who helped write the populist Lincoln Memorial gala beamed only to pay-cable subscribers, said she and many other celebrities were forsaking limousines in Washington to do their bit to preserve fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>But one visiting Hollywood publicist, whose fear of the Religious Left required him to remain anomymous, pointed out that many of the film industry's most fanatical eco-centrics used their corporate jets to ferry stars and executives to the inauguration. "And one of those jets uses more gas than a thousand limousines," he whispered.</p>
        <p>At a party at the National Museum of American Art, Alec Baldwin said that his girlfriend, Ms. Basinger, had educated him on animal rights and that they watched tapes of animal torture together. "Kim says a nation is only as strong as it treats its animals," he said. "She's quoting Gandhi, I think."</p>
        <p>Asked if he was wearing leather shoes, the tuxedo-clad heartthrob looked down and shrugged, "Yeah." And G. Gordon Liddy Is There as Elvis</p>
        <p>Wretched Excess Watch:</p>
        <p>Quincy Jones, impresario of the "American Reunion" entertainment at the inauguration, is registered at the Watergate Hotel under a pseudonym -- Alexander Pushkin. Bet Frank Zappa Couldn't Shoot Like This</p>
        <p>Motherwell, Kline, Hopper and Tipper:</p>
        <p>A low point in the relationship between artists and government in the Bush era was the flap over financing the exhibition of erotic Robert Mapplethorpe photographs at the Corcoran Gallery. At the Arts Caucus party at the National Museum of American Art yesterday, cultural figures found that photographic exhibitions of a less artistically controversial nature would be enthusiastically welcomed in the Clinton era.</p>
        <p>"Campaign Close-Up," a new show of color photographs by Tipper Gore, commanded prime space in the museum, a few feet from its major works.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gore, who offended show-business Democrats with her campaign against dirty rock lyrics, won't have to worry about Mapplethorpe-style censorship problems with this exhibition, which offers a less-than-candid camera's view of the Presidential campaign. Her husband is always wearing a shoeshine and a smile.  Know How to Whistle; Know How to Grumble</p>
        <p>Two competing views of the inauguration from tough-minded New York women who voted for Bill Clinton:</p>
        <p>Lauren Bacall, making her first appearance ever at a Presidential inaugural celebration, at the Lincoln Memorial gala, was enchanted when the Vice President-elect, whom she introduced, twice offered her his coat to protect her from the cold. Hillary Clinton reached out a gloved hand to draw Ms. Bacall into the singalong of "We Are the World."</p>
        <p>"I was thrilled by their generosity," Ms. Bacall said. "I'd become very disenchanted in this country in many areas, but now I have a sense of hope. I used to say, 'Oh, I'll go live in England or France,' but I thought, 'No, damn it, I'll stay right here.' "</p>
        <p>Ms. Lebowitz, who was watching the inauguration events on television at home, had a markedly different take:</p>
        <p>"If you're switching back and forth between the inaugural and the war, you think, where would you rather be less? And you find yourself thinking, 'Well, it's not that bad in Baghdad. They didn't hit the targets.'</p>
        <p>"It's like having to watch 'Cats' for five days. It's like having Andrew Lloyd Webber for President. He has the soul and mind of Andrew Lloyd Webber and he's one Haagen Dazs bar away from having the body."</p>
