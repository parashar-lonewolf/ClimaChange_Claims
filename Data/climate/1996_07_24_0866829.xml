        <p>All water is not created equal, nor are the taste buds of the people who drink it. For every S.

        <p>In the United States alone, more than 500 domestic and imported bottled waters are now available, and business is booming.

        <p>All water is not created equal, nor are the taste buds of the people who drink it. For every S. Pellegrino lover, there is a Perrier person; for every jogging Bill Clinton cradling a bottle of Mountain Valley, there is a Princess of Wales exiting her gym clutching Evian. And for every municipality with ready  access to crystal clear, cryptosporidium-free water, there is another city with  its water literally going down the drain.</p>
        <p>In the United States alone, more than 500 domestic and imported bottled waters are now available, and business is booming. Last year, consumption was almost 2.7 million gallons, double what it was 10 years ago, according to the International Association of Bottled Waters in Alexandria, Va., a trade group.</p>
        <p>Invariably, the flaws in municipal water systems are cited as one reason for the sales increase. The healthy body syndrome has also had an impact: who does not at least try to dring eight glasses of water a day - and more in hot weather?</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration recently tightened regulations to assure the purity of domestic and imported bottled water. In addition to the leading brands, a variety of new sparkling and still waters are being exported to the United States, and their tastes vary depending on their source and mineral content.</p>
        <p>"I drink Poland Springs or a supermarket brank all day, and then, at night,  I sometimes treat myself with some Gerolsteiner or Fiuggi," said Geraldine Fenton, a financial analyst who lives in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Like many other New Yorkers, she travels the streets of Manhattan armed with a bottle of stil spring water. By dark, though, she is ready for the heady, rich taste of a sparkling mineral water, which substitutes for an alcoholic cocktail. "Like Champagne, mineral water jazzes me up and makes me feel better,' Ms Fenton said.</p>
        <p>In 1995, California was the leader in bottled water consumption, at 788.2 million gallons and 29.3 percent of the market share. Next were Florida, 176.6 million gallons; Texas, 173.3 million, and New York, 165 million. According to the Beverage Marketing Corporation, consultants to the beverage industry that compile figures on bottled water consumption, these states are among the 15 that consume 75 percent of the bottled water.</p>
        <p>The corporation also estimated that total sales of bottled water reached $2.5 billion last year. (One-and-a-half-liter bottles range in price from $1.39 to more than $2.)</p>
        <p>"It's the big, hot dry states that have traditionally been the big water consumers," said Jennifer Levine of the International Bottled Water Association. "Most people drink their regional water, as they always have. Mountain Valley water from Hot Springs, Ark., for example, is about to celebrate its 125th anniversary."</p>
        <p>Water supplies nationwide have come under scrutiny as increasing cases of bacteria contamination have invaded public water systems. Cryptosporidium, a single-cell, disease-causing parasite, is one such contaminant. In people with healthy immune systems, it can cause severe, flu-like symptoms; for those with weakened immune systems, it can be fatal. In 1993, cryptosporidium in Milwaukee's water supply was believed to have led to 400,000 cases of illness and 100 deaths.</p>
        <p>New York City tap water, once considered "the Champagne of waters," is no longer a golden given. Water piped from three upstate reservoirs can vary in quality and change again when it reaches the city. Corroding copper and lead from pipes in plumbing systems in buildings can leach into tap water.</p>
        <p>For those who choose to avoid the cost of bottled water, there are both simple and elaborate home water filtration systems, ranging in cost from $20 to  several thousand dollars. Simple ones, like the ubiquitous Brita plastic pitcher and replaceable filter, reduce the taste of chlorine and remove most lead and copper. The Brita does not kill bacteria, however, which is the promise of many  more expensive home water filtration systems, which are connected to the main water supply or to the faucet.</p>
        <p>Most bottled water consumed in the United States is still; less than 7 percent of the market is sparkling or mineral water. And while sparkling water may seem like just the latest affectation at trendy restaurants, some do offer small doses of some needed minerals.</p>
        <p>Imported from the Italian Alps, where it is bottled from three springs, S. Pellegrino (universally called "San Pellegrino") is a naturally sparkling water  with a heavy mineral taste.</p>
        <p>An eight-ounce glass contains about 50 milligrams of calcium. (The recommended daily dose is 800 to 1,200 milligrams. Eight ounces of milk has 291  milligrams.) It also has 15 grams of magnesium, as well as chloride, fluoride, potassium, nitrates, sodium, sulfates and bicarbonates -- an aid to digestion.</p>
        <p>Since the early 17th century, Europeans have been flocking to mineral water spas to cure everything from kidney disease to gout to overweight.</p>
        <p>But S. Pellegrino is looking to more than health benefits to perk up the United States sales of sparkling water. San Pellegrino U.S.A. is promoting the distinct taste and palate-pleasing abilities of its product.</p>
        <p>"We see mineral water as a complement to wine and spirits, not a substitute," said William J. O'Donnell, the president of the American subsidiary of San Pellegrino.</p>
        <p>To this end, the company has hired Dr. Susan Schiffman of Duke University, a  taste and sensory expert, to conduct food and mineral water tastings in restaurants and at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>There is lots of competition, though, and it is increasing. "We offer S. Pellegrino but the majority of my customers prefer Lurisia, an Italian mineral water that has a lighter, rounder taste," said Jeremy Marshall, an owner and the chef of Aquagrill, at Avenue of the Americas and Spring Street.</p>
        <p>And a French restaurateur said that he preferred other European mineral waters but that shipments are erratic. His favorite is Badoit (pronounced bah-DWAH), from France, which is so sought after that supplies are limited. He refused to be named for fear of being besieged, and added that he was harboring  one bottle of Badoit "for an extraordinary occasion."</p>
        <p>As for the price, it does pay to ask.  Of all the stories about bottled water bills that have circulated, this one, overheard recently at a stylish downtown Italian restaurant, might be the most memorable. A well-dressed woman calls over the maitre d'hotel upon receipt of her check. She has just finished an appealing meal of risotto and osso buco accompanied by Sole, an Italian mineral water, and a very good Barolo.</p>
        <p>"This says two orders of sole, at $12 apiece," she said. "But we didn't have  fish."</p>
        <p>"Madam, that item is for your two bottles of mineral water. If you had been so fortunate as to have our sole, the charge would have been $48."</p>
        <p>Caveat emptor.</p>
        <p>Beyond H2 O</p>
        <p>N EW Food and Drug Administration regulations governing bottled water, which  went into effect in May, define the various kinds of water and list 38 contaminants and additives that cannot be included or must be restricted. (Chlorine cannot be added.) It is now a requirement to have the standard nutritional information on the bottle, but mineral content does not have to be listed. Except in a few states, dating the bottles is not required.</p>
        <p>For specific queries about individual brands, contact the manufacturer or call the International Bottled Water Association, at (800) 928-3711.</p>
        <p>These are the current definitions: STILL WATER has no natural or added effervescence.</p>
        <p>SPARKLING WATER is carbonated naturally, from carbon dioxide in the earth, or from added natural or man-made carbon dioxide gas. Seltzer and club soda are created by adding carbon dioxide to purified still water.  Seltzer generally has no added salt or other minerals; club soda contains minerals and mineral salts.</p>
        <p>ARTESIAN WATER is well water from a confined underground source. Unlike spring water, which flows naturally to the surface, artesian water can be pumped to the surface.</p>
        <p>SPRING WATER is defined as "that which flows naturally from an underground formation to the surface of the earth."</p>
        <p>NATURAL WATER, from a protected underground source like a spring or well, can be labeled "natural" as long as it is obtained without processing. After extraction, it can then be filtered or purified.</p>
        <p>MINERAL WATER In varying amounts, all water naturally contains essential minerals, like calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates and chlorides. The minerals collect naturally as water flows through geological formations to a water source. When the minerals dissolve in water, they form a measurable solution called "total dissolved solids." The F.D.A. specifies that mineral water must contain between 250 and 1,500 milligrams of total dissolved solids per liter.</p>
        <p>DISTILLED WATER has had all its dissolved substances removed by evaporation and condensation. Essentially, it is water that contains no minerals.</p>
        <p>Thirsty California</p>
        <p>T HREE of the top 10 biggest-selling imported and domestic brands of bottled  water in the United States are bottled and marketed only in California. Some brands are sold only in their own state or region. Figures, which are in millions of dollars, are based on annual sales for 1995 and have been compiled by the Beverage Marketing Corporation in Manhattan.</p>
