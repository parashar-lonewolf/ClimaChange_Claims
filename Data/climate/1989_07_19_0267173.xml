        <p>LEAD: AMERICANS are drinking less wine these days, but more of what they are drinking is made in the United States. Wine imports plunged by 16 percent in 1988, to 81 million gallons, the Wine Institute has reported.</p>
        <p>AMERICANS are drinking less wine these days, but more of what they are drinking is made in the United States. Wine imports plunged by 16 percent in 1988, to 81 million gallons, the Wine Institute has reported.</p>
        <p>California wines now account for 72 percent of United States wine sales. Imports make up 15 percent, and wines from states other than California the remaining 13 percent, said the Wine Institute, the promotional arm of the California wine industry.</p>
        <p>Exports of California wines, while still relatively small, rose by more than 40 percent in 1988, to 17 million gallons from 12 million gallons in 1987. What makes the growth of exports significant is that the domestic market has been shrinking since the early 1980's. Sales of California wines last year to all markets, domestic and foreign, dropped by almost 3 percent, to 412.5 million gallons.</p>
        <p>The reduction in imports, which is expected to continue through this year, is attributed mostly to currency fluctuations. In 1988 the dollar was worth little more than half what it was in 1985.</p>
        <p>In 1984 imports accounted for almost 30 percent of sales of table wines in the United States; last year imported table wines (a category that excludes such wines as sherries and sparkling wines, and such wine products as wine coolers) made up only 17.4 percent, according to Impact, a trade publication. Impact's figures show that imports of table wine climbed from 37 million nine-liter cases in 1980 to almost 50 million in 1984, then plunged to just over 25 million last year.</p>
        <p>Hardest hit by shrinking American demand were West Germany and Portugal, followed by Italy, Australia, Spain and France. Imports from both West Germany and Portugal in 1988 were down by almost 16 percent from 1987, from Italy by 13.5 percent, from Australia by 11.1 percent, from Spain by 9.4 percent and from France by 3.5 percent, according to Impact.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that fine wines are less subject to these market fluctuations than inexpensive wines. In almost every wine-producing country, shipments of fine wines have improved or at least held their own despite the worldwide slump in wine consumption. ''Drinking less but drinking better'' has passed from being an industry catch phrase to a fact of life.</p>
        <p>Thus in West Germany, Portugal and Italy, the mass-production wines have been in trouble: Liebfraumilch in Germany, inexpensive rose wines in Portugal and, in Italy, cheap bubbly lambrusco. Fine wines in all these countries fared relatively well.</p>
        <p>The same phenomenon is occurring in the United States, where wine coolers, the hot item three years ago, have begun to fade rapidly. They were down by 14.4 percent last year, to 58.4 million cases, while premium wines continue to thrive. California table wines alone were up by a modest 1.5 percent last year and, as has been the case for years, some of the most popular small California producers could not meet demand.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most unusual drop-off last year was Australia's, down from shipments of 500,000 cases in 1987 to about 450,000 cases in 1988 despite the wide news coverage of Australian wines, almost all of it laudatory. An unfavorable turn in the currency exchange rate increased prices of Australian wines, apparently to the point where they were no longer perceived as great bargains.</p>
        <p>One importer of Italian wines offered one of the more original theories for the slide in sales of his wines over the last several years. The importer, Harry Mariani, president of Banfi Vintners, told Impact that sales of his Riunite line may have been affected by heavier spending on lottery tickets by the people who ordinarily buy his wine. Perhaps so.</p>
        <p>On the other hand his more expensive imports, Banfi World Class Wines, did exceptionally well - up by 23 percent last year. Perhaps some of those who bought lottery tickets won, and moved up to Brunello di Montalcino.</p>
        <p>Actually Riunite, although still far below its sales of a few years ago, did well in 1988, too. Considered a lambrusco, although much of it is white or ''blush'' while true lambrusco is red, Riunite posted one of the few significant gains among the inexpensive, large-volume imports, with shipments up by almost 15 percent over 1987. All shipments of lambrusco, however, have dropped from nearly 15 million cases in 1985 to just over 5 million last year.</p>
        <p>Two surprise advances among imports last year were posted by the Beaujolais shipper Georges Duboeuf, who went from 375,000 cases in 1987 to 445,000 cases last year, a 19 percent gain, and Louis Jadot, a prominent Burgundy firm, which went from 405,000 cases to 460,000, a 13.6 percent increase. Much of Jadot's volume was also Beaujolais.</p>
        <p>A number of industry figures attributed the decline in imports not just to the weak dollar but also to the immense popularity of inexpensive California varietal wines, which bear the name of their principal grapes, like cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay.</p>
        <p>Offering varietal wines for as little as $3 or $4, wineries like Glen Ellen in Sonoma County have enjoyed considerable success in recent years in a market where even beaujolais rarely drops below $5.</p>
        <p>Admittedly, the most successful of all the varietals is white zinfandel; with carbon dioxide added for fizz and sometimes a sturdy white wine like chenin blanc for flavor, white zinfandel might be described as more a wine product than a true wine, but in the trade it is considered a wine. One winery alone, Sutter Home in the Napa Valley, shipped more than two million cases of white zinfandel last year.</p>
        <p>A number of European suppliers have been scrambling to jump on the varietal bandwagon. Most of their cheap cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays have been poor to indifferent. These do not, of course, include wines like Angelo Gaja's chardonnay from Italy, which sells for more than $30 a bottle.</p>
        <p>One of the best of this group is Louis Latour's chardonnay, from the Ardeche region of France. At around $7, it too is more expensive than low-priced California varietals, but it is an excellent wine at the price.</p>
