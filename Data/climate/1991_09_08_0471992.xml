        <p>QUILTS AND SPREADS</p>
        <p>More than 400 quilts, from antique to contemporary and from all over the country, will be exhibited for sale at prices ranging from $75 to $2,000 at the Stamford Historical Society's giant Quilt Show, on Friday from noon to 6 P.M. and Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M.</p>
        <p>The Stamford 350th anniversary commemorative quilt, made over a two-year period by the society's volunteers, will be on display. After presentation to the city's Mayor last May, it was shown at various corporate headquarters downtown before returning to the Historical Society, its permanent home. Measuring 8 by 12feet, it contains 30 squares depicting the city's history. Among them are a Post Road mail carrier of the 1680's, the 1705 Knapp House that still stands on Stillwater Road, the original railroad station, the First Presbyterian Church (dubbed Fish Church because of its shape), and the contemporary skyline with the G.T.E. Building, General Reinsurance and Landmark Buildings.</p>
        <p>Quilt tops and spreads, food, trompe l'oeil painted furniture, collectibles and anniversary quilt notecards will also be for sale.</p>
        <p>The Historical Society is at 1508 High Ridge Road and admission is free. The phone number is 322-1565. POLISH CULTURE</p>
        <p>Central Connecticut State University in New Britain will be steeped in Polish culture through Oct. 20, while a Polish Arts Celebration continues, open to the public without charge.</p>
        <p>An exhibit called "Voices from Krakow: Contemporary Prints from Poland" consists of aquatints, plaster prints, woodcuts, linocuts, etchings and lithographs by artists associated with the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow. A companion exhibition, "Touched by Angels: Polish Folk Art," includes carvings, reverse-glass paintings, Christmas creches and paper cutouts.</p>
        <p>Both exhibits may be seen in the Samuel S. T. Chen Art Center at Stanley and Wells Streets on the campus. Hours are Monday through Friday from 1 to 4 P.M. and Sunday from 2 to 5 P.M. Gallery talks by university faculty members will be given at 2:30 P.M. on Sept. 22 and at 7:30 P.M. on Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 21 two Polish film classics will be screened in Welte Hall. "Ashes and Diamonds," an Andrzej Wajda film about a resistance fighter in World War II who assassinates the wrong man, will be shown at 7 P.M., followed at 9 by the Roman Polanski film "Knife in the Water," which deals with intense relationships among three people on a yacht. Free tickets may be reserved by calling 827- 7322.</p>
        <p>"A New Vision for Peace and Justice in the 1990's" is the subject of a lecture to be delivered by the Rev. William Sloane Coffin at 8 P.M. on Sept. 28 in the Student Center Ballroom. More information is available by calling 827-7000. MEN AND WOMEN</p>
        <p>Men and women are invited to a free session of the Men's Counseling Centers to be held in Westport on Friday from 7:30 to 9:30 P.M. at the Public Library, Bernhard Plaza. The topic will be "What Men Really Want and Need, and Their Difficulty Getting It From Women." Dr. Robert Helfand and Dr. Louis Kopolow, directors of the counseling centers, will lead the discussion. They said their purpose is to define "deep masculinity" and to foster the growth of a men's movement as a positive and compassionate response to the women's movement.</p>
        <p>The organization will also sponsor a wilderness adventure for men on Sept. 21 and 22 at Camp Pomperaug in Union. The fee will be $135. For more information call 748-3241. KITCHENS IN HISTORY</p>
        <p>Eating your way through eight kitchens dating from 1690 to 1990 in Moodus, East Haddam and Hadlyme will be the order of the day on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 3:30 P.M., when the East Haddam Historical Society has scheduled its Cook's Tour fund-raising event. Tickets, $12 each, may be picked up on Saturday, along with self-guiding maps, at the Amasa Day House on Moodus Green, or ordered in advance for $10 by calling 873-8144.</p>
        <p>Homeowners will be on hand at each house, providing recipes and tastings of their specialties, ranging from 1800's Connecticut Western Reserve breakfast gingerbread to baked beans to salsa and tortilla chips.</p>
        <p>The 1690's house actually has three kitchens: the original, a lean-to built when the house was a tavern and a new one installed in 1989. A 19th-century country kitchen typically has a fireplace for cooking, beehive oven and tin roasting oven. A wood-burning stove is still in use for cooking in a 200-year-old farmhouse, and the latest word in cooking may be inspected in a brand-new all-digital kitchen. ABOUT WRITING</p>
        <p>Alfred Kazin, the critic, writer and teacher, will give a talk titled "An Old Man Mad About Writing" at 5 P.M. today in the Roxbury Congregational Church on Route 317.</p>
        <p>The free informal lecture will focus on Mr. Kazin's more than 50 years as a writer, reader and reviewer for The New Republic, The New York Times, The New York Herald Tribune and Scribner's magazine. He has taught at Harvard, Berkeley, Cornell, Barnard and the City University of New York, and his most recent books are "A Writer's America: Landscape in Literature," published by Knopf in 1988, and "Our New York," Harper &amp; Row, 1989. SEEDLINGS AND FISH</p>
        <p>Each year the Fairfield County Soil and Water Conservation District in Bethel sells a limited number of seedling trees and a supply of fingerling trout for private ponds at below-market prices. Seedling evergreens are recommended as economical and decorative replacements for trees lost in the recent storms. They are sold at 6 to 10 inches in height and grow at a rate of 8 to 14 inches a year. Balsam fir, Eastern white pine, Scotch pine, white spruce, Colorado blue spruce and Canadian hemlock are the varieties available. Orders must be placed by Sept. 20, and 25 seedlings cost $15 to $20, depending on the species; 100 are sold for $40 to $45. Larger amounts are sold at greater discounts.</p>
        <p>Rainbow and brown trout fingerlings are for sale at $26 for 50 fish. The rainbow trout are bred for ponds and grow quickly, bite well and put on spectacular aerial displays. Brown trout survive on lower oxygen levels, are sometimes hard to catch and are better at resisting acid rain. They also prey on fingerlings that are stocked later. Fish must be ordered by Sept. 27. They come in a plastic bag in which they can survive for about two hours. Call 744-6108 to order or obtain more information.</p>
