        <p>International 2-6  BUSH ORDERS RETURN VOYAGE  In another change in policy, President Bush ordered the Coast Guard to escort all Haitian refugees picked up at sea back to their country.  1  Haitians say nothing can dissuade them from fleeing.  4  BAKER LASHES OUT AT EUROPE  Using his harshest words yet, Secretary of State Baker criticized European nations for not punishing Belgrade or trying to stop the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  1  U.N. TO MOVE AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA  The Security Council is working out the details of sanctions against Yugoslavia that are expected to be enacted this week.  6  A 48-DAY REIGN ENDS IN THAILAND  Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon resigned as Prime Minister, then vanished. But his resignation was not sufficient to satisfy protesters.  1  MANUFACTURING MORE THAN GOODS  China's economic revolution, aimed at catching up with the industrialized world, is likely to make it the greatest producer of the gases that contribute to global warming.  1  FAMILY PROBLEMS IN BRAZIL  The Administration of President Fernando Collor de Mello faces new charges of corruption, but this time the accusations of drug use and kickbacks are aimed at the President and their source is his brother.  3  AUSTRIA CHOOSES A PRESIDENT  The former Ambassador to the United States, Thomas Klestil, has been chosen to succeed President Kurt Waldheim in a victory that is likely to end the diplomatic isolation of the Waldheim years.  3  SLAP TO GERMANY'S MAJOR PARTIES  Berlin voters gave about a third of their support to insurgent parties of the right and left in the first citywide election since 1946.  2  MILLIONAIRE QUITS FRENCH CABINET  Bernard Tapie, who owns the Adidas sporting goods company, resigned from the French Cabinet amid reports that he will be charged with fraud in a business dispute.  4  LITHUANIAN REFERENDUM FAILS  Too few voters turned out to pass a referendum that would have granted the leader of Lithuania's Parliament expanded powers.  5  Beira Journal: A corridor to sanctuary in Mozambique.4  Russia says Communist resistance threatens economic reforms.  5  National 7-9  ECONOMIC PLAN FOR CITIES  The Bush Administration is promoting enterprise zones as the centerpiece of its plan to revive the nation's inner cities, but the more than 600 existing zones have made only a slight dent in urban blight. Yet many local officials and urban experts hope the Administration's proposal will provide a nucleus to build around.  1  LEFT OUT OF LAS VEGAS'S BOOM  Much of Las Vegas boomed with the gambling industry in the 1980's, but the poor, overwhelmingly black neighborhoods a few miles from the Strip remained mired in decay and hopelessness. It was those neighborhoods that recently erupted in gunfire and flames.  7  THE ONCE AND FUTURE BROWN  Edmund Brown entered the Presidential primary in his home state of California virtually an invisible man, overshadowed by talk of other candidates and even of his sister Kathleen, who is often cited as the true heir to their father's political talents.  1  BREAKING INTO THE MEN'S CLUB  California will elect two United States Senators this year, and public opinion polls suggest that Dianne Feinstein will win one seat and that another woman, Representative Barbara Boxer, has a solid shot at winning the other.  9  FRIENDS TO SENATOR AND SON  The son of Senator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana raised $324,000 for his own bid for Congress, and much of the money has come from lobbyists who have business before the Senator's energy committee.  9  CLINTON'S NON-PEROT STRATEGY  Even as his Democratic nomination neared inevitability, Governor Clinton and his aides appeared frustrated by the surging popularity of Ross Perot and baffled at how best to combat it.  8  Perot petition tables popped up around New York State.  8  LAWYER SPEAKS OF EXECUTION  The lawyer who made Roger Keith Coleman a high-profile symbol in the debate over capital punishment failed to prevent his execution.

But Columbia's troubles this year have been played out in public on an unusual scale that included attacks by a large segment of the faculty on the president and his administration.  1  Business Digest, 35  Sports 27-34  Auto Racing: Al Unser Jr. wins Indy 500.  27  Crashes slow down Indy.  32  Baseball: This time, Yankees rally and win.  27  Mets' Cones throws another shutout.  27  Quarterly report on the Mets.  29  Basketball: Jazz beats Blazers to even series.  32  The thinking-man's series.  32  Columns: Berkow on war and sports.  31  Golf: Trevino is top senior.  28  Hockey: Streaking teams in Cup finals.  31  Tennis: Springtime in Paris.  28  Triple sweep for Stanford player.  28  Track and Field: Joyner-Kersee wins twice at New York Games.  27  Obituaries 10  John Gates, former editor of the Daily Worker  Arts/Entertainment 11-16  Munich Biennial and new music.  11  Serious Fun.  11  Music: Beastie Boys.  11  From Madagascar.  15  Long Island Mozart Festival.  16  Dance: A benefit for the ill.  11  Dance in Review.  14  Word and Image: "Center Stage," biography of Helen Gahagan Douglas.  15  Editorials/Op-Ed 18-19  Editorials 18  Why not a carbon tax?
