        <p>ON this weekend of national remembrance, there is one thing many Americans will not forget: beer. That is because Memorial Day, for all its solemnity, also heralds a season of thirst quenched in large part by frothy cool ones. So it's a fitting time to note that beer's place in the American mythos is being affirmed lately not only at the backyard barbeque but in print as well.</p>
        <p>The new beer journals are burps from the grassroots entrepreneurial ferment in the American brewing industry, characterized over the last 10 years or so by the appearance of hundreds of new regional beers and brewpubs, and the growing popularity of home brewing. Prone to puns like the ones in the previous sentence, the magazines target different audiences -- beer consumers, home brewers, small "craft" brewers -- and there's a host of new regional "brewspapers," folded tabloid newspapers distributed free at pubs and other beer outlets for those interested in the doings of the beer culture, like the coming summer festivals. In the New York region, for example, there is Ale Street News (Maywood, N.J.) which claims the largest distribution (100,000 copies), while the West Coast has the Celebrator Beer News (Hayward, Calif.), the acknowledged pioneer of the tabloid genre (founded 1988).</p>

        <p>ON this weekend of national remembrance, there is one thing many Americans will not forget: beer. That is because Memorial Day, for all its solemnity, also heralds a season of thirst quenched in large part by frothy cool ones. So it's a fitting time to note that beer's place in the American mythos is being affirmed lately not only at the backyard barbeque but in print as well.</p>
        <p>The new beer journals are burps from the grassroots entrepreneurial ferment in the American brewing industry, characterized over the last 10 years or so by the appearance of hundreds of new regional beers and brewpubs, and the growing popularity of home brewing. Prone to puns like the ones in the previous sentence, the magazines target different audiences -- beer consumers, home brewers, small "craft" brewers -- and there's a host of new regional "brewspapers," folded tabloid newspapers distributed free at pubs and other beer outlets for those interested in the doings of the beer culture, like the coming summer festivals. In the New York region, for example, there is Ale Street News (Maywood, N.J.) which claims the largest distribution (100,000 copies), while the West Coast has the Celebrator Beer News (Hayward, Calif.), the acknowledged pioneer of the tabloid genre (founded 1988).</p>
        <p>An online guide to beer periodicals appearing on the World Wide Web (the web site is given at the end of this article) includes more than 40 (mostly American) publications, and no doubt there are more. "The beer renaissance is far more exciting in America than anywhere else, and the attendant publications are far more diverse," says Michael Jackson, the bearded British author and beer expert widely credited with leading the resurgent interest in beer, and a columnist for many of the new journals. ("I think I'm THE Michael Jackson," he said in an interview from London, not all that jokingly).</p>
        <p>The pages of these publications reflect the milieu and ethos of the beer buff -- from ads for equipment (Get yer "two-vessel brew-house with 50-barrel knockout capacity" here!) to a disdain for trends in mass-market brewing like "ice" and "dry" beer. Over all, the tone is one of sensible fun. Hey, let's crank open a few. TOM KUNTZ</p>
        <p>The Malt Advocate is a glossy quarterly "dedicated to the discerning consumption of beer and whisky" based in Emmaus, Pa., with a press run of 25,000. It is about as upmarket as the magazines get, and proves that wine connoisseurs don't have a monopoly on enthusiastic ways of saying that stuff tastes good. In a recent issue (Vol. 4, No. 1), John Hansell, the editor and publisher, offers his assessment of the Advocate's 1995 beer of the year, a raspberry Belgian wheat beer called Boon 1986 "Marriage Parfait" Framboise Lambic:</p>
        <p>The beer is flawless -- from its beautiful presentation through to its lingering finish. From its 750ml corked champagne bottle flows a beer of amber red hues that would challenge the beauty of sugar maple leaves in autumn. A soft, creamy head subsides to reveal an aroma of great depth and complexity -- tart enough to make the mouth water, yet sweet enough to seductively invite. It is a fragrant bouquet, with raspberries to the fore balanced by oak, leather and classic barnyard-like notes.</p>
        <p>But woe to the beers that don't hit the right notes, barnyard or otherwise. Indeed, some critics can be just so picky. The spring issue of Zymurgy (the science of fermentation), a quarterly published by the American Homebrewer's Association, includes judges' comments on Last Stop Wheezin, a German-style wheat beer, the silver medalist of the association's 1994 competition. Here's one:</p>
        <p>"Flavor more harsh than aroma portends. Includes some additional phenols and harsh bitterness that are not to style."</p>
        <p>And another:</p>
        <p>"Phenolic. Needs more clove, more fruit. I get a slight solvent taste. Very drinkable, but the clove and banana character need to be bigger."</p>
        <p>If such esoteric sensibilities mystify, turn to the brewing advice columns that are features of many of the journals. Barleycorn, a "brewspaper" based in Falls Church, Va., offers "Ask the Beer Geek" ("Nothing's too stupid to ask the Beer Geek"). In one exchange, a reader, Sean Reagan, challenges the claim of Boston Beer's President, Jim Koch, to have produced the strongest beer, with an alcoholic content of 18.4 percent:</p>
        <p>I must boldly suggest that Mr. Koch ought to get out once in a while. I mean the country, that is. I have just recently returned from Germany . . . In Heidelberg, where I lived, a place called Vetter (meaning "cousin") has a stronger brew. The place is a small microbrewery/restaurant  [ and ]  during certain times of the brewing year the owner sells a beer that is 33 percent alcohol. It's called "Vetter's 33." The beer has a reddish color and is served in a 3-ounce glass. Needless to say, the beer is very sweet, and one is enough. . . .</p>
        <p>But the Beer Geek begs to differ, saying the 33 percent referred to the beer's strength before fermentation:</p>
        <p>No offense, but the Beer Geek places a 33 percent alcohol beer in the same category as U.F.O. abductions, Sasquatch and a still warm-and-breathing Elvis. Such things may exist, but he'd like to have some hard evidence.</p>
        <p>We know of three ways to create a super-potent brew. First you can inject alcohol directly in the brew (B.G. did this occasionally at his old college fraternity, I Tappa Keg). This method, however, would violate the German Reinheitsgebot  [ beer purity law ] , and result in the inevitable midnight knock on the brew-house door from the dreaded Bierpolizei.</p>
        <p>Second, you can use a specially bred yeast strain which can tolerate high levels of alcohol. However, even the toughest mutant ninja yeast eventually succumbs when immersed in its own waste product (just as you would in a room full of carbon dioxide). Jim Koch thinks a biological limit is reached around 18 percent . . .</p>
        <p>Third, you can employ the Eisbock method -- freeze the beer and slough off the ice, increasing the proof of the remaining liquid. . . . However, by the time you reach 33 percent alcohol beer, you've crossed the line from beer into distilled spirit, and the resulting liquid would have a bitter, solvent-like taste . . .</p>
        <p>Another topic prominent in beer journalism is travel, particularly in national magazines aimed at consumers, like All About Beer (Durham, N.C., founded in 1979 and the oldest of the glossies); Beer: the Magazine (Hayward, Calif.), and a newcomer called Brew: Traveling America's Brewpubs and Microbreweries (Des Moines, Iowa). In last November's issue of Beer: the Magazine, Jeff Caesar, in "Smuggler's Brews," relates his quest for beer in the rebellious Kurdish region of northern Iraq, which is under blockade by the forces of President Saddam Hussein:</p>
        <p>I'm a humble traveler with modest epicurean interests, hardly a person to be intrigued by the machinations of international politics. But I do like a good beer and exotic locales. . . .</p>
        <p>Now admittedly, I sound a little like the guys who went to El Salvador during the '80's to write up the waves for Surfer magazine. "Sure there's a civil war goin' on, dudes, but ignore it and catch the gnarly 10-footer with a big wave gun!" But I'm not that apolitical and by the time I got to northern Iraq, beautiful Kurdish northern Iraq, protected by a multinational United Nations military presence, I knew who were the good guys and who to avoid. It's just that I also wanted a good beer. Too bad you have to go through hell to get your hands on one. . . .</p>
        <p>Mr. Caesar pays his driver, Akbar (a pseudonym), to risk his life crossing the Iraqi frontier to Kirkuk for two six-packs of Scheherezade, one of the few beers available in Iraq. Akbar smuggles the bottles out labeled "vinegar." But for the author one of numerous disappointments ensues:</p>
        <p>I took the bottles back to the language center where I was staying and did what any American beer drinker might -- waited for them to chill. One six-pack would remain in my blistering room, awaiting my return to the States. The second would enter the blistering refrigerator and wait for the electricity to come on. . . . I was quickly nearing the precipice of my own dipsomaniacal nirvana . . . or so I naively believed.</p>
        <p>Othman, the center's guard and office boy, came knocking on my door early the next day with six empty bottles in hand. "Mister Jeff your vinegar is no good. I found it in the refrigerator of all places and have taken the liberty to clean the bottles for you. I will show you where to get the good stuff.</p>
        <p>"Mister Jeff, you are looking very pale. Are you feeling O.K.?"</p>
        <p>The beer-periodicals guide on the World Wide Web can be found at http://www.mindspring. com/ jlock/beermag0.html. Also, the Celebrator Beer News keeps a directory of beer publications, copies of which can be obtained by mailing a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the paper at P.O. Box 375, Hayward, Calif., 94543.</p>
