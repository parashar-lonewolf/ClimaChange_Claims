        <p>China's Yellow River in Crisis  With the sources of China's Yellow River threatened by climate change, and drought and pollution growing, the river is becoming a symbol of the dire state of the country's limited resources at a time of soaring economic growth.  1</p>
        <p>Sunni Sheiks Denounce Cleric  Sunni Arab sheiks from the volatile Anbar Province denounced a powerful Sunni cleric, calling him ''a thug'' for supporting Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and urging the Iraqi government to arrest him.  22</p>
        <p>Canada's Christian Right Grows  The passing of legislation allowing gay marriage in Canada and the election early this year of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative and an evangelical Christian, have galvanized conservative Christian groups to enter politics in the country as never before.  3</p>
        <p>Journalists at Risk in Venezuela  While the motives behind recent killings and other examples of aggression toward journalists remain unclear, human rights groups say threats and intimidation have become all too common in Venezuela.  14</p>
        <p>Poland Faces Labor Shortage  An estimated 800,000 people have left Poland since it joined the European Union in May 2004, creating a labor shortage so severe that the government may not be able to spend the money that the union is to begin sending in January for projects like improving roads and the water supply.16</p>
        <p>Incentives for North Korea  President Bush and his aides have signaled that they will offer new incentives for North Korea to give up its stockpile of nuclear weapons and technology, American officials said.

        <p>Glum Meeting for Conservatives  For the last 20 years, the Federalist Society, a conclave of conservative lawyers, has flourished, even when there was a Democrat in the White House. But the recent election results may have given a jolt to the group.  26</p>
        <p>Pledge to Keep 49ers Name  In a strange political end run, two California politicians have pledged to introduce laws to prevent the San Francisco 49ers from calling themselves the 49ers if the team follows through on plans to relocate.  28</p>
