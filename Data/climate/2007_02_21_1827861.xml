        <p>With 127 miles of densely populated coastline hugging the Atlantic Ocean from Sandy Hook to Cape May, the New Jersey shore is nobody's idea of an escape from civilization. On the contrary, civilization engulfs you, from the sweaty strangers lying two inches from your beach towel to the hordes of overexcited children on the boardwalk with cotton candy stuck to their faces.</p>
        <p>But that is the point. With a few exceptions, those who buy second homes in the more than 40 towns and municipalities along the Shore enjoy being in the thick of things. The Shore is known, and beloved, for its laid-back, T-shirt-and-ratty-shorts vibe and a surfeit of simple pleasures: a long outdoor shower after a day of building sandcastles; a roller-coaster ride on the boardwalk; a plunge into the ocean when the surf is up, boogie board at the ready.</p>

        <p>With 127 miles of densely populated coastline hugging the Atlantic Ocean from Sandy Hook to Cape May, the New Jersey shore is nobody's idea of an escape from civilization. On the contrary, civilization engulfs you, from the sweaty strangers lying two inches from your beach towel to the hordes of overexcited children on the boardwalk with cotton candy stuck to their faces.</p>
        <p>But that is the point. With a few exceptions, those who buy second homes in the more than 40 towns and municipalities along the Shore enjoy being in the thick of things. The Shore is known, and beloved, for its laid-back, T-shirt-and-ratty-shorts vibe and a surfeit of simple pleasures: a long outdoor shower after a day of building sandcastles; a roller-coaster ride on the boardwalk; a plunge into the ocean when the surf is up, boogie board at the ready.</p>
        <p>As was the case in coastal resorts across the country, housing prices on the Jersey Shore soared from 2000 to mid-2005, when an overall slowdown occurred in the market. Housing inventories rose, and prices dropped an average of 10 percent, according to Jeffrey G. Otteau, a real estate consultant in East Brunswick, N.J.</p>
        <p>But many brokers say there are fewer homes on the market now, and they are seeing increased interest among buyers. Mr. Otteau said he was not convinced that the market had hit bottom, especially in resorts like Wildwood that have lots of inventory and are not within commuting distance of a major city.</p>
        <p>''After having been in a strong housing market and then going into a very weak market,'' Mr. Otteau said, ''now things are a little less weak.''</p>
        <p>People who buy second homes at the Jersey Shore tend to have their primary homes within a few hours' drive of the beach. Most come from North Jersey, South Jersey and the suburbs of Philadelphia, often continuing family traditions that span generations. In recent years, more New Yorkers have discovered the Jersey Shore. Real estate prices are significantly lower than in the Hamptons, and traffic on the Garden State Parkway is manageable compared with the Long Island Expressway.</p>
        <p>Shore resorts were first developed in the mid-1880s, with Atlantic City, Asbury Park, Ocean City and Cape May among the earliest. The profiles here are a sampling of resorts in four counties -- Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May -- that span a variety of interests and appetites, including the glittering casinos and shopping malls of a reborn Atlantic City and the exquisitely restored Victorian houses of Cape May.</p>
        <p>NORTH JERSEY SHORE</p>
        <p>Asbury Park</p>
        <p>With its boarded-up buildings and vacant lots, Asbury Park may not look like a resort about to take off. But those lots are full of construction workers, and the steel skeletons of luxury condominium developments intended for vacation-home buyers are slowly filling the skyline.</p>
        <p>The heart of the city's downtown, which consists of eight square blocks, is occupied by antique stores, restaurants, art galleries and home design stores housed in renovated 19th century buildings. A 56-acre, $1.25 billion waterfront development project is under way, and more than 400 condo units are under construction. With New York only an hour's drive away, the city is hopeful that after a long decline that followed four days of riots in 1970, a turnaround is in sight.</p>
        <p>''The rebirth is just beginning,'' said Greg Demaras, a broker at the John C. Conover Agency and five-year resident of Asbury Park who calls his adopted city ''sophisticated and scruffy at the same time.'' The weak real estate market last year caused prices to drop by 15 or 20 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>At one project, Wesley Grove, prices start at $430,900 for a two-bedroom condo and rise to $895,000 for a three-bedroom town house. Ultimately there will be 3,100 condos and a restored boardwalk with restaurants, shops and clubs. The developers also plan to make improvements to the Stone Pony bar, one of the favorite haunts of Bruce Springsteen, a New Jersey native who named his first album after Asbury Park.</p>
        <p>Most buyers are from urban areas, Mr. Demaras said, with a majority coming from New York. Gay residents of New York were instrumental in starting to turn the fortunes of Asbury Park when they began buying the grand Victorians there in the 1990s at rock-bottom prices and renovating them.</p>
        <p>Prices on some properties have more than tripled since then, Mr. Demaras said, but they remain low compared with coastal property elsewhere. A renovated studio one block from the ocean starts at $165,000, while a restored Victorian with a pool may be as much as $1.3 million. Single-family fixer-uppers in the desirable northeast section sell in the high $500,000s.</p>
        <p>Spring Lake</p>
        <p>Quiet and understated are the words most often used to describe Spring Lake, an Ocean County shore town known for its grand Victorians, tree-lined streets and large, lush lawns. The word ''moneyed'' would also apply to homeowners here.</p>
        <p>In summer, the small downtown is filled with children riding bicycles and young mothers pushing strollers past boutiques, delis, candy stores and an old-fashioned five-and-dime. A majority of second-home buyers come from affluent North Jersey suburbs like Ridgewood, Saddle River, Short Hills and Summit and from New York.</p>
        <p>''Families love it here because they don't need to use a car,'' said Anita Vanden-Bulcke, a broker with Gloria Nilson GMAC Real Estate. ''They bring the children here and let them loose.''</p>
        <p>Spring Lake has the longest noncommercial boardwalk in the state (one and a half miles), and its beaches are rarely crowded. Food and drinks are not allowed on the beach, so on summer days the boardwalk is lined with coolers, and people come out from under their umbrellas at lunchtime to picnic on the boards.</p>
        <p>Housing prices have dropped 10 to 15 percent since the market's peak, Ms. Vanden-Bulcke said, after years of 30 to 35 percent annual price increases. The current median price is $1.65 million, up from $859,000 in 2000. Single-family homes start at about $800,000 and go as high as $7 million.</p>
        <p>In the upper range, a newly built Victorian-style house with nine bedrooms, seven and a half baths, an elevator and ocean views is on the market for $7.5 million; a Victorian built in 1900 that is two blocks from the beach with six bedrooms and four baths is on the market for $2.395 million. At the lower end, a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath Colonial with a hot tub on the back deck is for sale for $869,000.</p>
        <p>CENTRAL JERSEY SHORE</p>
        <p>Point Pleasant Beach</p>
        <p>This central New Jersey borough is blessed with two attractive features: a lively beach scene dominated by Jenkinson's Boardwalk, and a unique location just south of the Manasquan inlet that allows boaters easy access to the ocean.</p>
        <p>The boardwalk is popular both with young families -- Jenkinson's features an amusement park with many rides for small children -- and the 20-something crowd. Jenks Night Club draws a boisterous party crowd on weekends with live bands, low-priced beer and dollar drinks on ''Free for all Fridays.'' Sunbathers take a break to go strolling on Arnold Avenue, home to both upscale and family-style restaurants and many antique stores.</p>
        <p>Jamie Paradise, a sales agent for Remax Bay Point Realtors in Point Pleasant Beach, said many properties that were for sale last summer remain on the market. Prices have dropped at least 10 percent, he said. ''We've seen sellers offering incentives like offering to pay the first year's taxes or buying down the mortgage rate for the first three years,'' Mr. Paradise said.</p>
        <p>Architectural styles include 1940s beach bungalows, 1920s Colonials and 1950s Cape Cods as well as modern behemoths on the beach. A one-bedroom condo a block from the beach starts at about $300,000, with single-family oceanfront homes from $2.9 million to $5 million. The median price is $585,000, up from $255,000 in 2000.</p>
        <p>A single-family wood-shingled two-story house with two bedrooms and two baths is for sale for $580,000. It is a block from the beach and needs some renovation. It has been on the market since March 2006.</p>
        <p>Beach Haven</p>
        <p>With only five blocks between the ocean and the bay, Beach Haven, on the southern end of 18-mile-long Long Beach Island, attracts young families who like active vacations. Visitors can walk to the beach, bike around the borough in designated lanes and spend evenings playing skee-ball in the arcade or riding bumper cars at the Fantasy Island Amusement Park, all without the use of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>There is a small downtown with a supermarket, a pharmacy and restaurants. The architectural style might be called early hodgepodge, with grand Queen Anne-style Victorians next to bland '50s-style ranches. There is, however, a protected seven-block-square historic district with 80 Victorian houses from the late 1800s.</p>
        <p>Prices have dropped since the peak of the market in the summer of 2005, but have now stabilized, said Laura Dunlap, a sales agent for Diane Turton Realtors in Beach Haven. ''The market favors buyers now,'' Ms. Turton said. ''Sellers have to negotiate more.''</p>
        <p>Prices have been reduced by $50,000 and sometimes $100,000, on homes priced close to $2 million or more, she said.</p>
        <p>The median price for condos is $661,250; for single-family homes, $990,000. That is more than double the median price in 2000, which was $349,000 for a single family home. But buyers have been scarce: only 33 properties sold in 2006, down from 62 in 2005.</p>
        <p>Prices in Beach Haven range from $495,000 to $4.2 million. Farther north on the island, the quiet communities of Loveladies and Harvey Cedars tend to have larger, more modern homes priced in the millions. In some spots, the island narrows so much that just one block stands between ocean and bay.</p>
        <p>SOUTH JERSEY SHORE</p>
        <p>Atlantic City</p>
        <p>You can win a fortune gambling in one of Atlantic City's 11 casinos, or you can have your fortune told for $5 in a seedy hole-in-the-wall shop on the boardwalk. Casinos, parking garages and billboards for Trump, Harrah's and Borgata dominate the landscape. The beautiful, wide beaches are almost an afterthought. But the combination of gambling, sand and surf, upscale shopping malls and the celebrity-restaurant roulette that has come to define Atlantic City in recent years has made it the most promising real estate market at the Shore.</p>
        <p>''Atlantic City has changed dramatically,'' said Frank A. Barbera, president of F.A. Barbera Company real estate brokers. ''You have shopping, you have Caesar's, the Borgata, and Harrah's expanding. The boardwalk is becoming a little more upscale. They're replacing the facades on entire blocks and getting rid of some of the T-shirt and honky-tonk stores.''</p>
        <p>The biggest change, however, is the explosion of condo and town house development intended for second-home buyers, most of whom come from North Jersey, Philadelphia, New York and Connecticut. About 20 projects are in the works, with prices starting at $500,000.</p>
        <p>Unlike prices in most other resort areas in the country, Atlantic City prices have not fallen from the peak of the market in 2005, according to Mr. Otteau, the real estate consultant. ''Atlantic City is an exception,'' Mr. Otteau said. ''It is continually upgrading, and it offers a complete package: oceanfront, nightlife and a significant amount of shopping.''</p>
        <p>In the past year, half of the 200 condos in the 27-story Bella Condominiums, one block from the beach, have sold to a mix of second-home buyers and full-time residents. A two-bedroom, two-bath unit on the 16th floor with granite counters, stainless steel appliances and Italian cabinets is on the market for $550,000. Prices there go up to $700,000, but that is hardly the limit for the city. A 4,000-square-foot penthouse in the Ocean Club on the boardwalk is on the market for $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>In December 2005, Anthony Busciglio, who owns a mortgage company branch in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., bought a two-bedroom, two-bath condo at Bella for the preconstruction price of $445,000. (It was recently appraised at $550,000).</p>
        <p>Mr. Busciglio, 30, said he was attracted by all the new restaurants, shopping and nightlife. ''When you buy a house at the shore, normally you use it for three months,'' he said. ''In Atlantic City, we go year-round. Even in winter it doesn't matter, because you're inside the casinos and hotels the whole time anyway.''</p>
        <p>For a city that has been down at the heels for much of its 150-plus years, the transformation is striking. Two new casinos are planned. In a boardwalk mall that opened last summer, the Pier Shops at Caesars, visitors can shop at Burberry, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Tiffany &amp; Co., and, starting this spring, can get married in a chapel on the fourth floor called One Atlantic. There is more shopping at the Walk, an eight-block-long outdoor mall with outlet shops, restaurants and nightclubs (one owned by the rapper Jay-Z). Those seeking a upscale meal can order one of the $40 entrees at Mia, a new restaurant in Caesars in the shadow of a giant statue of Caesar himself.</p>
        <p>Ocean City</p>
        <p>Take away the multimillion-dollar homes that face the beach and the bay, and Ocean City really is not that fancy. Many streets are lined with boxy, two-story vinyl-sided duplexes, packed tightly together on 30-by-100-foot lots.</p>
        <p>As a Methodist retreat founded in 1879, Ocean City has always been a popular destination for the middle-class. Families with young children like that it is alcohol-free (the nearest bar is across the bridge in Somers Point), easy to get around on a bicycle and full of wholesome activities. For years, it has been the traditional summer home of Philadelphians. More recently, New Yorkers have moved in.</p>
        <p>Situated on a narrow, seven-and-a-half-mile-long barrier island, the city has a two-and-a-half-mile-long boardwalk with amusement rides, pizza joints and salt water taffy shops. Entertainment includes rock concerts at the Music Pier on the boardwalk and a baby crawling race called the Pamper Scamper in August.</p>
        <p>Steve Booth, a broker for Prudential Fox &amp; Roach Realtors, said sales slowed starting in July 2005, and prices have dropped 10 to 15 percent. For example: a three-bedroom, two-bath unit in a duplex that sold for $367,500 in 2002 fetched $735,000 in the spring of 2005. ''This year,'' Mr. Booth said, ''it's worth $650,000.'' The median price for a single-family home is $825,000; for a condo, $527,500. Prices in Ocean City start at $200,000 and go as high as $6 million, Mr. Booth said.</p>
        <p>A furnished one-bedroom, one-bath condo near the boardwalk with a kitchenette is on the market for $259,900. In the middle range, a three-bedroom, two-bath second-floor unit in a duplex with central air, garage and rooftop deck -- a typical property for Ocean City -- is $659,900.</p>
        <p>Stone Harbor</p>
        <p>The sticker shock of real estate in Stone Harbor might be worth enduring just for the chance to buy sticky buns every morning at the Bread &amp; Cheese Cupboard, a bakery downtown.</p>
        <p>An average house in Stone Harbor will cost close to $1 million, said Bob Rich, broker and owner of Coldwell Banker James C. Otton Real Estate. But in addition to sticky buns, buyers will find a quiet, family-friendly atmosphere and an attractive, walkable downtown with boutiques, a movie theater and an old-fashioned five-and-dime. A night out consists of a round of rooftop miniature golf at Tee Time Miniature Golf, followed by a trip to Springer's Ice Cream, where lines form predictably on summer weekends.</p>
        <p>Stone Harbor shares a seven-mile-long barrier island in Cape May County with Avalon, a slightly less manicured town to the north. Suburban Philadelphians and people from North Jersey dominate the part-time population, according to Mr. Rich, and most buyers are in their mid-40s and have children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rich first noted a ''correction'' in the market for second homes at the end of 2004, when buyers began to balk at prices. (From 2002 to 2005, prices jumped 96 percent.) Inventory piled up, and eventually prices dropped 10 to 15 percent, he said. Even so, ''It's still hard to get in for under $750,000,'' Mr. Rich said. Some condo units, however, start around $500,000. Beach-block homes sell for $4 million to $4.5 million. Architectural styles include bungalows, ranches and Cape Cods as well as newly built faux-Victorians.</p>
        <p>A lower-priced property on the market is a one-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath condo one and a half blocks from the beach for $489,900. In the upper range, a new two-story single-family home with five bedrooms, four and a half baths, central air and a pool is on the market for $2.595 million.</p>
        <p>Wildwood</p>
        <p>Long known as a vacation paradise for the working class, Wildwood's housing prices have soared as scores of its ''mid-century modern'' motels have been torn down and replaced with new vinyl-sided condos and townhouses.</p>
        <p>Higher prices, however, have not made much of a dent in the resort's ambience. Blessed (or cursed, depending on your point of view) with one of the Jersey Shore's most raucous boardwalk scenes, Wildwood has not completely lost its gritty feel. Although the loss of as much as a third of the distinctive 1950s and '60s-era mom-and-pop motels has concerned architects and city supporters, the slowing real estate market has pretty much put a brake on the bulldozers.</p>
        <p>Prices have dropped from the peak of the market, but it is too late for the really low prices.</p>
        <p>''This was the last undiscovered place at the Jersey Shore,'' said Richard Stokes, a Philadelphia architect who has worked on preserving Wildwood's quirky past. ''It's not cheap anymore.''</p>
        <p>Located just north of Cape May, Wildwood and its sister cities, North Wildwood and Wildwood Crest, occupy a five-mile-long barrier island. Its boardwalk has five amusement piers with a dizzying mix of children's rides, brain-twisting roller coasters and hyped-up crowds. Its beaches are wider than most on the Shore.</p>
        <p>Tom Parisse, 40, a plumbing contractor from Huntingdon Valley, Pa., bought a two-story Cape Cod near the bay in North Wildwood for $257,000 in 2003. In 2005 he tore it down and built a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath house that his wife and four children occupy each summer. He commutes from his office in Olney, a neighborhood in Philadelphia, on weekends.</p>
        <p>''What's not to like?'' Mr. Parisse said. ''I've spent every summer of my life in Wildwood. The beaches are free, there's the boardwalk, the rides, fantastic water parks. I love it down there.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the building frenzy that started a few years ago has left Wildwood with a surplus of new units.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Otteau, the real estate consultant, Wildwood has the weakest real estate market at the Shore because it has been overbuilt.</p>
        <p>''You will see your best deals there,'' Mr. Otteau said.</p>
        <p>A little more than a year ago, there was 38 months' worth of unsold inventory, said Paul Chiolo, broker and owner at Oceanside Realty in Wildwood Crest. That has been cut down to about a years' worth, he said. The median price for a condo is $398,000; for a town house, $624,000; and a single-family home, $638,000. At the high end, a 12-story condo tower under construction in the Diamond Beach area at the southern end of the island will have 125 units priced from $1 million to $5 million when it opens in late 2008. Mr. Chiolo said 24 percent of the units have already been sold.</p>
        <p>Cape May</p>
        <p>Some 150 years ago, our Victorian forefathers traveled to the southernmost part of New Jersey, pulled out their drawing boards, and went wild. The result is Cape May, which advertises itself as the nation's oldest planned seaside resort.</p>
        <p>Anything nailed down, and some things that were not, was covered in gingerbread trim. Turrets sprouted like crocuses in spring. A wraparound porch was the 19th century version of a Sub-Zero refrigerator: everyone had to have one. The houses have survived, many as inns, carefully restored and painted in bright pinks, yellows, greens and blues.</p>
        <p>Today, Cape May attracts both lovers of Victoriana and those who want a traditional shore experience. There are two miles of beaches, arcades and miniature golf, many fine restaurants and a pedestrian mall. Bird-watching is popular at the Cape May Bird Observatory in Cape May Point, a few miles south of Cape May.</p>
        <p>Prices for second homes have dropped five to eight percent, according to Chris Clemans, owner of Chris Clemans &amp; Company Realtors. Things began to slow in early 2005, after years of prices jumping 20 to 30 percent annually. ''We're up to six months' worth of inventory,'' Ms. Clemans said. ''In the spring of 2005 it was closer to two months.''</p>
        <p>There are currently 15 bed-and-breakfast inns on the market, including the 27-room Angel of the Sea, a Cape May landmark with a price of $7.5 million. One seller of a B&amp;B is offering a $5,000 bonus to the real estate agent who finds a buyer.</p>
        <p>For single-family homes, the median price is $800,000; for a condo, $610,000. On the low end is a furnished one-bedroom, one-bath first-floor condo in a Victorian building one block from the beach, with murals of beach scenes on the walls, for $350,000. A seven-bedroom, four-bath Victorian with ocean views on three floors and central air is on the market for $3.5 million. In the middle range, a four-bedroom, four-bath two-story house close to the center of town with a one-bedroom, one-bath detached guest unit in the back was just reduced to $825,000 from $890,000.</p>
