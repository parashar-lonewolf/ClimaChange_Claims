        <p>With Tony Blair, the new British Prime Minister, in the rhetorical vanguard, European heads of state  came before a gloom-and-doom conference of the world's nations today and demanded ever more forceful actions by the United States to confront environmental trends like global warming.</p>
        <p>One after another, as delegates reviewed how the world has fallen short of the ambitious environmental goals set by the United Nations five years ago, the leaders of the European Union repeated the message that they had delivered to the Clinton Administration in private meetings over the weekend: that they do not believe that the United States is being aggressive enough in seeking steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>This time their audience was dominated by leaders of the less developed countries. They are at the United Nations this week to assess progress, or the lack of it, since a United Nations conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 put the threat of global warming and other issues of environment and development at the top of the international agenda.</p>
        <p>With the poorer countries in mind, Japan, which like the United States is taking a cautious approach on reducing greenhouse gases, and Britain, which unlike the United States is calling for aggressive actions, both pledged substantial new commitments of aid to the developing world to help their economies grow without causing even more pollution from burning fossil fuels. And Germany, Brazil, South Africa and Singapore called for a new worldwide environmental organization to reinvigorate the United Nations' lackluster performance.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the warmest applause of the day came for Mr. Blair, who pledged Britain's willingness to do even more to reduce greenhouse gases than the rest of Europe has promised, and who bluntly, if indirectly, criticized the United States.</p>
        <p>Saying that ''some of the great industrialized nations'' have not achieved their past promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Blair said Britain, which under a Conservative Government changed coal policies and kept its promises on carbon emissions, would do even more now that the Labor Party is at the helm.</p>
        <p>''Our targets will not be taken seriously by the poorer countries until the richer countries are meeting them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The biggest responsibility falls on those countries with the biggest emissions,'' he said, in an unmistakable reference to the United States. ''We in Europe have put our cards on the table. It is time for the special pleading to stop and for others to follow suit.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton is to address the gathering on Thursday, amid intense criticism from environmental advocates who say his Administration is not taking a firm enough stance in negotiations, scheduled to be concluded in December in Kyoto, Japan, aimed at setting binding targets for reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>But the Administration is under pressure in Congress to do nothing that would impose costs on powerful industries, or that would curtail the use of fossil fuels by wealthy countries but not poorer ones.</p>
        <p>And its negotiators have been making another argument: that it is simply impossible to meet the ambitious timetables proposed by the Europeans, who want to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 15 percent from the levels of 1990, and to do so by the year 2010. At Rio, industrial countries pledged to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000, but few countries have succeeded.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, who for years has called global warming one of the most serious threats facing the planet, welcomed the delegates with a brief call to ''roll up our sleeves and go to work'' on the undone business of Rio, but spoke only two sentences about the negotiations on global warming.</p>
        <p>''Kyoto presents a critical opportunity for the world to forge an agreement with binding emissions limits, flexibility in meeting those targets and the participation of all nations,'' he said. ''We must unite in our resolve to meet the challenge of climate change.''</p>
        <p>President Jacques Chirac of  France, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and other European leaders echoed the complaint against the Americans for not proposing definite timetables and specific limits for reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, other members of Mr. Blair's Government muted somewhat the implied criticism of the White House.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we have a problem with the American Administration,'' said Robin Cook, Britain's Foreign Secretary. ''The American public have not come to terms with their energy consumption.''</p>
