        <p>LEAD: I BURNED my hand the other morning. Burned it on the paper coffee cup I was cradling in one hand, while trying to manage my briefcase and laptop computer in the other arm, all while trying to make my way onto a crowded elevator in my office in Trenton.</p>
        <p>I BURNED my hand the other morning. Burned it on the paper coffee cup I was cradling in one hand, while trying to manage my briefcase and laptop computer in the other arm, all while trying to make my way onto a crowded elevator in my office in Trenton.</p>
        <p>That had never happened before my building's newsstand vendor switched from polystyrene cups. Doubtless she did it because of ''concern for the environment.'' From what I hear, that's the reason a lot of folks have given up those supposedly ''polluting plastic cups.''</p>
        <p>Although we all use plastics as part of our everyday lives, for reasons of sanitation, safety and convenience many would still like us to believe that plastic is bad. In my opinion, it is not. Rather, it's been framed with a bad reputation, such as ''it's not biodegradable'' (true, and I'll tell you why that's better) or ''it encourages litter'' (false) or ''it depletes the ozone layer'' (false) or ''it's not recyclable'' (also false).</p>
        <p>The rush to replace polystyrene with paper - indeed, the backlash in the popular media right now about virtually all types of plastics - is not only shortsighted but, in the long run, probably even more damaging to the environment we're all out to protect.</p>
        <p>Polystyrene is just a small part of the plastics issue - a fraction of 1 percent of our solid-waste stream. Yet, throughout New Jersey, we've read about municipalities' seeking to ban polystyrene and other types of plastics merely because they do not biodegrade. Well, the last thing that happens in a properly managed landfill is biodegradation.</p>
        <p>Actually, most landfilled garbage degrades very little. A landfill that's environmentally sound does not give the light and air necessary for biodegradation to take place for the thousands of tons of solid waste that New Jersey produces every day.</p>
        <p>Granted, paper does biodegrade when it's littered beside the road. But litter is certainly something we do not want to encourage. And paper, since it's more than 40 percent of the waste stream, is even more likely to be littered. So much for the argument that plastics encourage littering.</p>
        <p>Many of us need to change our cavalier attitudes about litter's being someone else's problem. Not only is it esthetically offensive, but also it conveys the sense that ''we don't care.''</p>
        <p>If you want to see the miracle of ''biodegradation'' take place, visit the scenic mountain vistas of garbage at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. Fresh Kills was built on a swamp starting in the 1940's, and its degradation of garbage has resulted in a nice gray ''ooze'' that has made its way into the underground water supplies that eventually show up in the Arthur Kill and the other waterways that New York and New Jersey share. That's not to mention all the surface garbage that floats its way to the Jersey Shore.</p>
        <p>Plastics have also been said to be bad for the atmosphere's ozone layer. While that may have been true previously, chlorofluorocarbons are, for the vast majority of polystyrenes, no longer used in their production. There is more potential damage to the atmosphere in your car's air-conditioner than polystyrene production.</p>
        <p>But the biggest falsehood is that polystyrene in particular and plastic in general are not recyclable. In the public perception about dwindling landfill space, plastic has been labeled a villain because of ''all the space it takes up.'' Plastics make up far less of the waste stream than their paper product counterparts (8 percent versus 40 percent).</p>
        <p>Right now, New Jersey is missing a golden opportunity to build on its national leadership in recycling by taking the lead on polystyrene and all kinds of plastics. Because of our status as the nation's recycling leader (with the first statewide comprehensive mandatory recycling law), both the government and the private sector must work as partners to take more bold steps in this direction.</p>
        <p>Private enterprise is leading the way. In 1991, Union Carbide will be able to collect and recycle more than 40 million pounds of plastics at a facility in Bound Brook. Later this year, the first polystyrene recycling facility is expected to be announced in southern New Jersey, also to be operational sometime in 1991.</p>
        <p>New Jersey must amend its 1987 Mandatory Recycling Law to include adding plastics as a mandatory material for collection.</p>
        <p>There's a bill to do just that, sponsored by Assemblymen Arthur Albohn of Hanover and Robert Shinn of Hainesport. It would be a natural extension of the law passed by our Legislature last year that adopts the Society of the Plastics Industry code readily identifying all types of plastics.</p>
        <p>In recognition of the increased markets for voluntarily recycled plastics, more than one-third of all our municipalities already recycle plastics. Yet misconceptions die hard. I've spent a number of evenings in the last year speaking to municipal councils about the plastics ban ordinances they have proposed, ranging from urban Paterson to suburban Bridgewater and rural Mount Olive. My home county of Hunterdon proposed one for all 26 of its municipalities. I'm glad to say that the zeal for such bans seems to be waning.</p>
        <p>The bans are most often directed at recyclable polystyrene in fast-food restaurants, while their likely substitutes, wax- and plastic-coated papers, have no such recyclable value. It's interesting to note, too, that the inks and wax on such papers are one of the first things that actually ''break down'' in a landfill.</p>
        <p>Local officials, business people and average citizens are much more receptive to the idea of plastics recycling, yet an important question has been raised as a result of that response. What do we do with all that recycled plastic?</p>
        <p>Plastic lumber, office products and, oddly, things like garbage cans and wastebaskets are just some of the hundreds of products made from recycled plastics. It is 444,000 recycled plastic soda bottles that are now covering a portion of the Meadowlands landfill.</p>
        <p>The infrastructure for plastics recycling is being established at a rapid pace, far greater than the pace with which a similar infrastructure was established for newspaper, aluminum and glass. But it will not be created overnight. Yet plastics recycling, which was really a cottage industry in New Jersey a half-decade ago, is making major strides, as evidenced by large financial commitments from industry.</p>
        <p>Government must provide the statutes to make plastics recycling at curbside a reality - instead of meaningless concessions to public perception, like polystyrene bans. Private enterprise can and must do more to provide the means to make plastics recycling even more cost-efficient. As hundreds of businesses have made the switch to recycled paper products, so must they make a commitment to recycled plastic items.</p>
        <p>The potent combination of those efforts can have the dual purpose of eliminating an additional large percentage of solid waste from our landfills and giving us substantial new quantities of materials to build for our future. That famous line about plastics' being the wave of the future, as spoken to Dustin Hoffman in the 1967 movie ''The Graduate,'' could be more true today, in 1990, than ever before.</p>
