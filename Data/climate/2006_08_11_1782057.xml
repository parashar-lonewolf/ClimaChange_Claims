        <p>Previews and Openings</p>
        <p>'EVENSONG' Opens today. Mary Gage's new play is based on interviews with survivors of the Great Depression and World War II (1:35). TBG Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101.</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' In previews; opens on Aug. 23. If you were one of the people who missed the 17,162 performances of this show the last time around, good news: Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's romantic musical, which closed in 2002, is back (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' In previews; opens on Thursday. This musical sendup of biographical shows features Martin Short and an ensemble telling the story of his life. Mr. Short's beloved old characters, like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick, make appearances (2:15). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' In previews; opens Aug. 21. Meryl Streep plays the title character in Tony Kushner's translation of Brecht's seminal play about a world at war. Kevin Kline also stars, and George C. Wolfe directs (2:30). Delacorte Theater, Central Park. Free. Ticket information: (212) 539-8750.</p>
        <p>'SEVEN GUITARS' In previews; opens Aug. 24. Signature Theater presents its first August Wilson revival since the playwright's death last year. Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who starred in the 1996 Broadway production, directs (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in this heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece about life under apartheid. The recollections of the five cast members and authors are woven together with a cappella performances of spirituals from the apartheid years and vignettes performed by the full cast. The actors all but glow with a sense of mission, as if telling their stories has given them new purpose and power (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'ANAIS NIN: ONE OF HER LIVES' Angela Christian is superb as Nin in this uneven but largely rewarding production about her affair with Henry Miller and his wife, June, in Paris in the 1930's (1:30). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHINgS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James. (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the show room of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, in large part because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE &amp; OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'ALL THIS INTIMACY' In this not-very-deep comedy-drama by Rajiv Joseph, a 30-year-old poet impregnates not only his girlfriend, but also two other women, within two weeks. The women, once they meet, are surprisingly unimpressed with his notable virility (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closing tomorrow. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>* 'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'NEVER TELL' The computer-involved characters in James Christy's intriguing drama about trust, video art and a society-changing application can be irritating but they're never boring (1:50). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Movies</p>
        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeois Parisian marriage, about 1912. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'I LIKE KILLING FLIES' (R, 79 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Matt Mahurin paints an engaging if glib portrait of Kenny Shopsin, of the legendary or notorious, depending on your experience, Greenwich Village eatery that bears his name. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE NIGHT LISTENER' (R, 82 minutes) Robin Williams plays a writer and radio host who strikes up a long-distance friendship with a young man who may not exist. An intriguing premise, but not satisfyingly realized. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE PUFFY CHAIR' (R, 85 minutes) Three 20-somethings on the road with a recliner. Sweet but minor (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SATELLITE' (No rating, 100 minutes) In this captivating romantic fairy tale for grown-ups, made on a shoestring, two young lovers in New York flee yuppie hell into a life of petty theft. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* SCOOP (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Farrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'13 TZAMETI'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE TROUBLE WITH MEN AND WOMEN' (No rating, 74 minutes) This tiny, well-acted movie about the romantic troubles besetting two young couples in London feels at once utterly real and banal. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)</p>

        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133, dannysgrandseapalace.com; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>DEERHOOF, BEIRUT (Sunday) A decade into Deerhoof's career, this avant-garde rock band from San Francisco still has plenty of surprises. Its stop-start songs, with jagged guitars, a drum style somewhere between jazz and metal, and Satomi Matsuzaki's nursery-rhyme vocals, sound intriguingly extraterrestrial. Beirut is the project of Zach Condon, an Albuquerque native who at age 19 made ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber and ecstatic Balkan Gypsy marches, recording most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself. With Apollo Sunshine, the Harlem Shakes and, playing D.J., ?uestlove from the Roots. At 3 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, thepoolparties.com; free. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>DIRTY PRETTY THINGS (Monday and Tuesday) After the tunefully frantic British band the Libertines split a couple of years ago, its singer, Pete Doherty, formed Babyshambles and entered tabloid purgatory, while its talented and less arrest-prone guitarist, Carl Barât, and its drummer, Gary Powell, formed Dirty Pretty Things. The band's debut album, ''Waterloo to Anywhere'' (Interscope), sounds like the Strokes tearing through Kinks songs. With Scissors for Lefty. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JEREMY ENIGK (Tonight) In the 1990's, Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. His first solo album in a decade, ''World Waits'' (Lewis Hollow), is to be released in October. With Stars of Track and Field. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FORRÓ IN THE DARK (Wednesday) For more than three years now, this group has been leading one of New York's best and lowest-tech dance parties at the East Village bar Nublu. The groove is a humble and sexy two-beat dance from northeastern Brazil called forró, made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, nublu.net; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) She is invariably dressed in black, her face in witchy streaks of makeup, but Diamanda Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from darkened Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the second of four shows at the new Spiegeltent downtown, she offers ''O Death,'' with music by John Lee Hooker, Phil Ochs, Ralph Stanley, Hank Williams and Shel Silverstein. At 6 p.m., Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* GNARLS BARKLEY, PEEPING TOM (Thursday) Every summer needs a Gnarls Barkley. This brilliantly nutty duo, featuring the producer-alchemist Danger Mouse and the helium-voiced singer and rapper Cee-Lo Green, has scored the surprise hit of the season with ''Crazy,'' an arty hip-hop goof disguised as a slow-burn soul song -- or is that a slow-burn soul song disguised as an arty hip-hop goof? The band plays a benefit concert for Central Park SummerStage with Peeping Tom, the latest project of Mike Patton, the naughty boy of heavy metal turned naughty boy of the avant-garde. The gimmick here is creepy lounge and trip-hop, with guests ranging from Norah Jones to the bawdily bizarre rapper Kool Keith. Who knows which guests will turn up, although Mr. Patton may not need any help: for the album, ''Peeping Tom'' (Ipecac), he worked alone and traded tapes with his collaborators. At 7 p.m. Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777 or (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; sold out. Peeping Tom also plays Wednesday at 8 p.m. at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>IRON &amp; WINE, LOW (Thursday) Reverse psychology: instead of trying to fill a gigantic space like the McCarren Park Pool with lots of loud noise, do it with a reverent hush. Iron &amp; Wine, which is the singer and guitarist Sam Beam and whoever he happens to be playing with, specializes in gentle acoustic lullabies whose vocals compete with the guitar over which can be more whispery. Low, a veteran band from Duluth, Minn., uses grand, glacial dynamics to give its semiloud climaxes the weight of religious epiphanies. Also on the bill is Califone, a fine band from the Chicago experimental scene that plays wistful songs with a constant, thin hum. At 5 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $32.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CHRIS ISAAK (Thursday) Chris Isaak is a disciple of Roy Orbison, writing dolorous ballads that find their only consolation in his honeyed voice and finely turned guitar lines. Onstage he's a droll storyteller. With Tristan Prettyman. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $30 to $100. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JURASSIC 5 (Wednesday) This hip-hop quintet from Los Angeles harks back to the genial wordplay and jazz vamps of New York's fondly remembered Native Tongues groups, like A Tribe Called Quest. With X-Clan. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>JORMA KAUKONEN (Thursday) One of the original psychedelic blues players, Jorma Kaukonen brought Jefferson Airplane both searing electric guitar lines and old-fashioned blues. He then founded Hot Tuna, a band built on spiky, ragtimey blues. His own songs contemplate death and loss, holding his gentle voice in a lattice of fingerpicking. With Rob McNurlin. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $36.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>CHRIS KNIGHT (Tuesday) Cold-eyed drifters, crooked yet sentimental cops, and prostitutes who kill their johns are characters in the brutal, deadpan songs of Chris Knight, a country singer from Kentucky whose oeuvre resembles Bruce Springsteen's album ''Nebraska'' set in the South. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS (Tonight and tomorrow) Tonight this annual series of free outdoor concerts presents L. Subramaniam, a renowned violinist in the Carnatic style of southern India. He has also recorded with Stéphane Grappelli and Yehudi Menuhin, and plays here with the American classical violinist Eugene Fodor. Tomorrow is one of Out of Doors' many blues-themed concerts. This one looks at the roots and reflections of blues around the world, with Markus James, an American guitarist and singer; Hassan Hakmoun, a master of the gnawa music of Morocco, which is as richly bluesy as it is ecstatic; Fantasia Music, a group that plays rebetika, the rough-and-tumble songs of the Greek underworld; Gazpacho Andalú, a New York flamenco band; and Helder Moutinho, a Portuguese fado singer. The host tomorrow is Guy Davis. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow night at 7, Damrosch Park Bandshell, (212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ASHA PUTHLI, PREFUSE 73, TALVIN SINGH (Sunday) Asha Puthli, a trailblazing Indian singer who has performed with everybody from Ornette Coleman to Ashford and Simpson, makes her first New York appearance in 25 years, with Dewey Redman, Guru, Solar and DJ Doo Wop. She is joined by Prefuse 73, also known as the hip-hop producer Guillermo Scott Herren, and, performing a D.J. set, Talvin Singh, whose experiments mixing traditional Indian music with abstract electronic dance music have been widely influential. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a donation is suggested. Mr. Singh also plays on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tonight and Sunday) Las Rubias del Norte, long in residence at Barbès, a cozy bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. At 6 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* SONIC YOUTH, YEAH YEAH YEAHS (Tonight and tomorrow) These two bands emerged, decades apart, from the same dank and claustrophobic downtown (and Brooklyn) clubs to define avant-garde New York rock. So it is only appropriate that when they share a big stage, it is a really big and really unusual stage: the 50,000-square-foot McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn. Both have released strong albums this year, and they headline these two nights at the pool, joined by Blood on the Wall tonight and Awesome Color tomorrow. At 5 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, (212) 307-7171; $36 in advance, $41 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>STEELY DAN, MICHAEL McDONALD (Thursday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature'' (Warner Brothers), and Donald Fagen and Walter Becker crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as Steely Dan's lead guitarist. Michael McDonald, the smoky-voiced crooner who has been through Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers and a long solo career, has most recently recorded two albums of Motown songs. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $35 to $95. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>'SUGAR WATER FESTIVAL' (Tomorrow) Queen Latifah, Jill Scott and Erykah Badu play a benefit for Celebrate Brooklyn, with Kelis. At 7 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $70 for reserved seating, $45 on the lawn. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THROWING MUSES, 50 FOOT WAVE (Tomorrow) Throughout the 1980's and 90's Kristin Hersh led Throwing Muses, the textbook college-rock band: witty, imaginative, small-scale and entirely non-macho. (The presence of as many as three women in the band helped that.) But there was nothing textbook about the band's songs, which set turbulent and free-associative psychodramas to twisting and unpredictable guitar lines. The band reunited in 2003 after six years, by which time Ms. Hersh had developed a successful solo career and started a new, punkier band, 50 Foot Wave. Both play tomorrow, along with Bullseye. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* WILD MAGNOLIA MARDI GRAS INDIANS, IRMA THOMAS (Tomorrow) One of the more elaborate Mardi Gras traditions in New Orleans is the black men who parade, dance and otherwise revel as ''Indians,'' dressed in impossibly flamboyant costumes loosely based on American Indian designs. Working for months each year, the men sew in extensive patterns of sequins, glitter and beadwork, and fasten the feathers tightly in preparation for lots of dancing. Led by Bo Dollis, the Wild Magnolias, one of the three dozen or so ''tribes,'' make a rare visit. Irma Thomas was a New Orleans soul queen when her version of ''Time Is on My Side'' inspired the Rolling Stones in 1964. Her home and nightclub destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, she recently released her first new album in six years, ''After the Rain'' (Rounder). At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a suggested $30 donation will benefit the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, a nonprofit medical center.(Sisario)</p>
        <p>* WU-TANG CLAN (Thursday) The eight surviving representatives of hip-hop's most ingenious and eccentric band-cum-brand name team up for a rare tour in tribute to Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, the especially ingenious, eccentric and self-destructive member who died in 2004. With Rhymefest. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>TOSHIKO AKIYOSHI TRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) A couple of years ago Ms. Akiyoshi retired her acclaimed big band, ending a standing Birdland engagement. Returning to the club with a trio, she places emphasis on her articulate piano playing, a treat in itself. Through Aug. 19. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)</p>

        <p>MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Wednesday) ''Right Before Your Very Ears'' (Clean Feed), Mr. Blake's most recent album, showcases his tenor saxophone in a rough-hewn but deeply focused pianoless trio setting. Here he enlists musicians different from those on the album -- Marcs Rojas on tuba, and G. Calvin Weston on drums -- but employs a similar concept. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.</p>
        <p>(Chinen)</p>
        <p>GERALD CLEAVER TRIO (Thursday) Dealing less in rhythm than in pulse, Mr. Cleaver's drumming perfectly suits the fluid requirements of jazz's post-everything avant-garde. He has sympathetic partners in the pianist Craig Taborn and the bassist William Parker. At 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ELLERY ESKELIN TRIO (Sunday) Mr. Eskelin is a tenor saxophonist known for gruff abandon; his signature band with the accordionist Andrea Parkins and the drummer Jim Black handles abstraction as well as groove. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FREESTYLE JAZZ (Sunday) This experimental series, formerly established at CBGB's Lounge, has been carrying on in a side room at Jimmy's, an East Village pub. This installment comprises successive sets by Radio I-Ching, led by the saxophonist and Freestyle Jazz organizer Dee Pop; Limbic Trio, a project of the saxophonist Elliot Sharp; and the Matana Roberts Quartet, led by Ms. Roberts, also a saxophonist. At 7, 8 and 9:30 p.m., Jimmy's, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006, freestylejazz.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DON FRIEDMAN TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Friedman's stylistic history as a pianist runs from very traditional to slightly left of center; his rhythm section here includes the drummer Tony Jefferson and the bassist Nilson Matta.

At 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GROUP FIVE (Wednesday) With a lineup suggestive of the Brian Blade Fellowship, this ensemble would seem to pursue similar pastoral fusions. But the placement of this one-night engagement -- The Stone, an avant-garde shrine -- might elicit a more raucous mood from Mr. Blade, on drums; Jon Cowherd, on piano; Doug Weiss, on bass; and Joel Frahm and Myron Walden, on saxophones. At 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>WAYNE KRANTZ TRIO (Thursday) With roots in both jazz and rock, Mr. Krantz manages a genre splice leaner and more rugged than most fusions.

His working band includes David Wong on bass and Peter Van Nostrand on drums.

        <p>BRANDON ROSS AND BLAZING BEAUTY (Sunday) Mr. Ross goes for earthy yet otherworldly effect in both his guitar playing and his compositions.

        <p>* JENNY SCHEINMAN TRIO (Thursday) Ms. Scheinman is a violinist attracted to rusticity but committed to a modern language; the same could be said, more or less, of the drummer Paul Motian and the pianist Jason Moran. Still, this all-star trio carries the burden of a small spectacle: it could be transcendent or a train wreck, and either way it will be something to behold. Through Aug. 20. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>* CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Thursday) Mr. Tolliver leads an upgraded edition of his acclaimed orchestra of the 1970's, with such top-shelf talent as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton, the pianist Robert Glasper and the bassist Cecil McBee. The band will be featured on a forthcoming Blue Note album, but that's no reason not to absorb its visceral impact in person. Through Aug. 20. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CEDAR WALTON QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Walton heeds an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard bop; he's at his best when his forms spark solos from collaborators like Steve Turre, a trombonist (through Sunday only), and Vincent Herring, an alto saxophonist (next week.) Through Aug. 20. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Tuesday, and Thursday) Opera can be formal or pure fluff, and this season's program at Glimmerglass about equally balances the two. All four of this year's operas are in rotation this week: Janacek's dark ''Jenufa'' in the Jonathan Miller production (tonight and Thursday night at 8, Monday afternoon at 1:30); Steven Hartke's brand-new, Maupassant-based opera ''The Greater Good'' (tomorrow and Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.); and, on the lighter side, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance'' (tomorrow night at 8) and Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' (Sunday afternoon at 1:30).

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARD FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Leon Botstein's annual composer-focused festival is devoted to Franz Liszt this year, and, as in past summers, it includes concerts, lectures and panel discussions, for which a large cast of experts -- both players and speakers -- has been assembled. The opening weekend includes six programs, beginning with an all-Liszt catchall concert tonight, in which a handful of pianists, singers and a choir offers a broad selection of works meant to show Liszt as a mirror of his time. A concert tomorrow afternoon broadens the focus, putting Liszt's music beside other composers' scores, including Chopin, Czerny, Moscheles, Hummel, Beethoven, Schubert and Clara Wieck Schumann. Tomorrow evening Liszt's music is related to the currents in 19th-century art, theater and politics, by way of his symphonic poems. Sunday begins with chamber music, mostly by Liszt's contemporaries; an afternoon concert shows the shadow cast not only on Liszt, but also on Brahms and Schumann, by the virtuoso violinist and composer Paganini. Later in the afternoon Mr. Botstein closes the first of two weekends by drifting away from the rugged muscularity of Liszt, and offering a concert of opera excerpts, including bel canto twaddle by Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini. Tonight at 8:30, $20 to $45; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., $35; and at 8 p.m., $25 to $55; Sunday at 10:30 a.m., $30; at 1:30 p.m., $35; and at 5:30 p.m., $25 to $55.

        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Good things come in threes, and Steven Beck, a pianist, seems to have achieved a happy tripartite balance for his recital, with three Bach preludes and fugues, three Shostakovich preludes and fugues, and three early Mozart sonatas. The mood changes considerably for the weekend's other concert at this floating hall: the Corigliano Quartet goes larger-scale with Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A (with Doris Stevenson), Schumann's first quartet and ''Corrie Q's Jigs and Reels'' by Adam B. Silverman. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35 tonight ($30 for 65+; $20 for students), and $40 tomorrow and Sunday ($25 for students).

        <p>COMPOSERS COLLABORATIVE (Tonight and tomorrow) Established in its wonted (and literally underground) summer haunt, the Composers Collaborative is offering, during its mini-festival, the same piece it did last year: Jed Distler's longtime work-in-progress, ''The Gold Standard.'' This music theater work concludes the proceedings tomorrow; tonight's concert features two trios, First Avenue and Maya, performing inventive contemporary chamber music. Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 663-1967, composerscollab.org; $25; $15 for students, with a one-drink minimum. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Seven intense weeks of chamber music conclude on Sunday with Beethoven's ''Choral Fantasy,'' a tradition started 30 years ago by Rudolf Serkin, a festival founder and the longtime artistic director.

        <p>MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL (Tonight through Wednesday) This dual celebration -- the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, and the 40th of the festival itself -- is in high gear, with standard concerts, late-night programs and odd explorations like the collaborations between Concerto Köln, an early-music group, and Sarband, which specializes in Middle Eastern music. Often, you can do it all: tonight and tomorrow night at 8, you can catch the pianist and conductor Christian Zacharias presiding over a program that includes Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto (K. 466), the ''Posthorn'' Serenade and a handful of arias, sung by Sally Matthews. Then, at 10:30, Sarband and Concerto Köln play their multicultural concerts, a different program each night. The pianist Emanuel Ax plays a late-night Mozart program on Tuesday, and on Wednesday Peter Phillips directs the Tallis Scholars in sacred works by Mozart's predecessors -- including the Allegri ''Miserere,'' which, according to legend, Mozart wrote from memory after hearing it once. Mr. Zacharias's concerts are at 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $35 to $55. Concerto Köln and Sarband's concerts are at 10:30 p.m. at the Allen Room, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street; $35.

        <p>'MOZART ON FILM' (Monday) Film about Mozart has long had a place at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, but there are always new things to be seen. ''In Search of Mozart,'' a film by Phil Grabsky, is a biographical documentary, narrated by Juliet Stevenson, and including performances and observations by a broad array of interpreters, from period-instrument specialists like the Orchestra of the 18th Century and the conductor Roger Norrington, to modern players like the pianists Lang Lang and Imogen Cooper, and the singers Renée Fleming and Magdalena Kozena. ''Mozart Interpreted,'' a series of three short films, includes performances of Mozart's Symphony No. 40, from a 1948 broadcast by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra; Karl Böhm's account of the Symphony No. 38, with the Vienna Philharmonic, from 1978; and Nikolaus Harnoncourt leading the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in the Symphony No. 41, from 1991. ''In Search of Mozart'' is at 6 p.m.; ''Mozart Interpreted'' is at 9 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Kozinn)</p>

At 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000, yale.edu/norfolk; $15 to $45. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) Perhaps because the offerings are particularly diverse, tickets for the festival this month have been discounted. Tonight's concert should be a treat: Bach and Handel conducted by the capable early-music specialist Harry Bicket, with the mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, and actual fireworks after the ''Royal Fireworks Music.'' Tomorrow the Boston Pops offer film scores in a deluxe edition with Yo-Yo Ma, John Williams and narration by James Earl Jones; on Sunday Christoph Eschenbach leads the Philadelphia Orchestra in Beethoven's Eighth and Tchaikovsky's Fifth. Some might want to stick around until Monday to hear the student orchestra of the Tanglewood Music Center, led by Herbert Blomstedt, in Beethoven and Hindemith. On Thursday the Renaissance vocalists the Tallis Scholars offer Schütz, Allegri and others. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., $20 to $50; Monday at 8:30 p.m., $11 to $36; Thursday at 8:30 p.m., $16 to $49. Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200, tanglewood.org. (Midgette)</p>

The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news.

Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ATTA KIM: ON AIR,' through Aug. 27. The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early-19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* MET: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable.40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 or madmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: DOUGLAS GORDON: 'TIMELINE,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: GUSTAV KLIMT: FIVE PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF FERDINAND AND ADELE BLOCH-BAUER,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088 or noguchi.org. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: 'AMERICAN SPLENDOR: HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL MASTERWORKS FROM THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner &amp; Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Sept. 9. (The gallery will be closed Aug. 21 to 25.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* A BROKEN ARM The title is a tribute to Duchamp. The works review various strategies of using found objects or images in photography, painting and sculpture. The seven artists include Gedi Sibony, Arnold Odermatt and Karen Kalimnik. All has been orchestrated by Mari Spirito, the gallery's director. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* DERECONSTRUCTION Matthew Higgs, director of the alternative space White Columns, has assembled a handsome show that in typical Higgs fashion brings together outsider, emerging, hip and formerly hip artists. Variations on collage and assemblage predominate without feeling stale. The larger point: deconstruction has had its day, and it is time to start putting things back together again. The putters range from A. R. Penck and Lucas Samaras to Carter and Alexandra Bircken. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9301, gladstonegallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* AMER KOBASLIJA: 'LARGE-SCALE STUDIO PAINTINGS' Large, exhaustively detailed, sensuously painted fish-eye views of the artist's studio. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Aug. 18. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'MATERIALITY' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'MEN' This show of 10 paintings of men by 10 women, organized by the painter Ellen Altfest, covers a lot of stylistic ground and includes an only partly tongue-in-cheek denunciation from the lesbian collective Redykeulous. Realism makes the strongest impression. I-20, 557 West 23rd Street, (212) 645-1100, I-20.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* HOWARDENA PINDELL: 'IN MY LIFETIME' Thirty years ago Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- and emerge from and are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, through Aug. 31. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>JOE BIEL With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box, and one of a knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he has found. Goff &amp; Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-0461, goffandrosenthal.com; closes today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,'  This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* J. BENNETT FITTS: 'NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com; closes today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* FOUNTAINS A summery theme is tweaked by energetic efforts. High points include Daniel Lefcourt's eye-popping photograph of studio tools, Sanford Biggers's video of a disco ball and Gibb Slife's television set, whose do-it-yourself antennae suggest spreading vines or brain waves. The low points seem to have been left out. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com; closes today. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* 'A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL BEING WRITES POETRY ON A FIELD WITH SCULPTURES' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com; closes today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'GIFTS GO IN ONE DIRECTION' With art selling so briskly these days, isn't it time for the art world to hand out some gift bags, some freebies? After all, artists, as members of an intensively networked and mutually supportive community, have been giving one another gifts. That is the subject of this charming summer show, which takes the form of a round-robin of generosity, with artists on both the giving and receiving ends. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>A RABBIT AS KING OF THE GHOSTS With a title lifted from Wallace Stevens, this elegant show posits photography as the leading ghost in the machine of contemporary art and draws visually telling analogies from 140 years of the medium's life span. It has been organized by the photographers Justine Kurland and Dan Torop. Mitchell-Innes &amp; Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com; closes today. (Smith)</p>
        <p>TWO FRIENDS AND SO ON Selected by asking one artist to invite another, who asked another, until a group of 30 had accrued, this show winds from Conceptual-based work through abstract painting and sculpture, and back again, presenting a random cross-section of the art world and displaying a network of style-based alliances. It is a quite a ride. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>

        <p>'EVENSONG' Opens today. Mary Gage's new play is based on interviews with survivors of the Great Depression and World War II (1:35). TBG Arts Center, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 352-3101.</p>
        <p>'THE FANTASTICKS' In previews; opens on Aug. 23. If you were one of the people who missed the 17,162 performances of this show the last time around, good news: Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's romantic musical, which closed in 2002, is back (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' In previews; opens on Thursday. This musical sendup of biographical shows features Martin Short and an ensemble telling the story of his life. Mr. Short's beloved old characters, like Ed Grimley and Jiminy Glick, make appearances (2:15). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>'MOTHER COURAGE AND HER CHILDREN' In previews; opens Aug. 21. Meryl Streep plays the title character in Tony Kushner's translation of Brecht's seminal play about a world at war.

        <p>'SEVEN GUITARS' In previews; opens Aug. 24. Signature Theater presents its first August Wilson revival since the playwright's death last year. Ruben Santiago-Hudson, who starred in the 1996 Broadway production, directs (2:45). Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920's stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'' has theatergoers responding as if they were withering house plants, finally being watered after long neglect. Bob Martin and Sutton Foster are the standouts in the eager, energetic cast (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE HISTORY BOYS' (Tony Awards, best play and best direction of a play, 2006) Madly enjoyable. Alan Bennett's play about a battle for the hearts and minds of a group of university-bound students, imported with the original British cast from the National Theater, moves with a breezy narrative swagger that transcends cultural barriers. Directed by Nicholas Hytner, with a perfectly oiled ensemble led by the superb Richard Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore as schoolmasters with opposing views of history and education (2:40). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS'  (Tony Award, best musical, 2006) From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political-correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' (Tony Award, best direction of a musical, 2006) Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TARZAN'  This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a super-deluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER'  An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80's Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members, who include Stephen Lynch and Laura Benanti, are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'AMAJUBA: LIKE DOVES WE RISE' Tormenting memories dissolve into soaring music, and pain is salved by a collective embrace in this heartfelt, powerfully performed theater piece about life under apartheid. The recollections of the five cast members and authors are woven together with a cappella performances of spirituals from the apartheid years and vignettes performed by the full cast. The actors all but glow with a sense of mission, as if telling their stories has given them new purpose and power (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'ANAIS NIN: ONE OF HER LIVES' Angela Christian is superb as Nin in this uneven but largely rewarding production about her affair with Henry Miller and his wife, June, in Paris in the 1930's (1:30). Beckett Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>'CRAZY FOR THE DOG' Christopher Boal's effective family melodrama about a brother, a sister, a wife and a boyfriend caught in a web of recrimination and confession, touched off by the kidnapping of a shih tzu (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 677-0060, Ext. 16. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'EVERYTHINgS TURNING INTO BEAUTIFUL' Seth Zvi Rosenfeld's thrill-free demi-musical about a pair of commitment-wary songwriters (Daphne Rubin Vega and Malik Yoba) is clearly intended to progress from wintry loneliness to heated confrontation and eroticism. But it remains stolidly at room temperature. Directed by Carl Forsman, with songs by Jimmie James. (1:50). Acorn Theater, 410 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GARDEL: THE MUSICAL' A standard-issue bio-musical about the tango legend Carlos Gardel wallows in melodrama (1:30). Gramercy Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Drew Sarich) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'NO CHILD'  Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200 (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>'PIG FARM' A gleefully stupid comedy by Greg Kotis about lust and violence in the farm belt, with a few gristly bits of satire aimed at the fat-bellied American electorate thrown in for good measure. Powered by the frenzied commitment of the four skilled actors who make up its cast, the comedy careers around the stage like an interminable improv session for a still-unformulated sketch on ''Saturday Night Live.'' (2:15). Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOUT!' A mini-skirted, go-go booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the show room of a Carnival Cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'A STONE CARVER' Despite the high cliché factor, William Mastrosimone's play about an Italian immigrant who is losing his house to a highway exit is timely and sporadically touching, in large part because of Dan Lauria's over-the-top performance as the title character and old-world patriarch who makes a mean barrel of wine and never talks when he can shout (1:40). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>'TEMPEST TOSSED FOOLS' This musical audience-participation children's version of ''The Tempest'' is rowdy, colorful and not all that Shakespearean. Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE &amp; OTHER STORY BOOKS' This children's musical, made up of 10 sketches based on 8 books, is diverse, adorable and free. Also, the adults laugh (1:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village; (212) 642-9033. (Gates)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' Another excavation of what seems to have become Broadway's favorite musical terrain -- call it Scamalot, where con men are king (see ''The Producers''). Now starring Keith Carradine and Brian D'Arcy James as the mismatched swindlers (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DRUMSTRUCK' Lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). New World Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'ALL THIS INTIMACY' In this not-very-deep comedy-drama by Rajiv Joseph, a 30-year-old poet impregnates not only his girlfriend, but also two other women, within two weeks. The women, once they meet, are surprisingly unimpressed with his notable virility (1:45). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422; closing tomorrow. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>* 'FAITH HEALER' In the title role of Brian Friel's great play, Ralph Fiennes paints a portrait of the artist as dreamer and destroyer that feels both as old as folklore and so fresh that it might be painted in wet blood. Also starring Cherry Jones and the superb Ian McDiarmid, this mesmerizing series of monologues has been directed with poetic starkness by Jonathan Kent (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'NEVER TELL' The computer-involved characters in James Christy's intriguing drama about trust, video art and a society-changing application can be irritating but they're never boring (1:50). Michael Weller Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101; closing on Sunday. (Gates)</p>

        <p>Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.</p>
        <p>* 'AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH' (PG, 96 minutes) Al Gore gives a lecture on climate change. One of the most exciting and necessary movies of the year. Seriously. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE ANT BULLY' (PG, 90 minutes) A young boy goes to live among the ants, who talk remarkably like Academy Award-winning actors. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'BARNYARD' (PG, 88 minutes) The barnyard animals in this crude 3-D animation walk, talk and party down like human beings. Way too often the male ''cows,'' as the film calls them, also flash their udders. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>'BOYNTON BEACH CLUB' (No rating, 104 minutes) A fast-paced romantic comedy about frisky 60-something residents of a Florida ''active adult'' community, ''Boynton Beach Club'' is a rose-colored fantasy about aging that has just enough credibility to make you care about its characters and wish them merrily on their way. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE BRIDESMAID' (No rating, 110 minutes, in French) The great Claude Chabrol again takes up a sharp instrument and directs it at one of his favorite targets, the family. Yet while his aim remains true, his touch has become gentler, more forgiving. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'CARS' (G, 114 minutes) The latest 3-D toon from Pixar just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of technological progress and consumer safety. John Lasseter directed, and Owen Wilson provides the voice of the little red race car who learns all the right lessons from, among others, a 1951 Hudson Hornet given voice by Paul Newman. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'CHANGING TIMES' (No rating, 95 minutes, in French and Arabic) Gérard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve star in André Téchiné's rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Tangier. A half-dozen skillfully interwoven subplots create a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'CLERKS II' (R, 98 minutes) More than a decade later, Kevin Smith's New Jersey underachievers have moved from a convenience store to a fast-food franchise. The humor is reliably filthy and frequently hilarious, and the filmmaking is a few steps above rudimentary, but the movie's poignant sweetness is disarming. It has a dirty mind, but its heart is remarkably pure. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'CLICK' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Adam Sandler stars in this unfunny comedy about a harried family man who uses a universal remote to hop-scotch through time. It's a wonderful life, not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DA VINCI CODE' (PG-13, 148 minutes) Theology aside, ''The Da Vinci Code'' is, above all, a murder mystery. And as such, once it gets going, Ron Howard's movie has its pleasures. He and the screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have deftly rearranged some elements of the plot, unkinking a few overelaborate twists and introducing others that keep the action moving along. The movie does, however, take a while to accelerate, popping the clutch and leaving rubber on the road as it tries to establish who is who, what he's doing and why. So I certainly can't support any calls for boycotting or protesting this busy, trivial, inoffensive film. Which is not to say that I'm recommending that you go see it. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'THE DESCENT' (R, 99 minutes) A total horror freakout from the British writer and director Neil Marshall about six women on a caving expedition who meet their fears and some scary monsters, too. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA' (PG-13, 106 minutes) Lauren Weisberger's score-settling best seller about a terrible (and famous) boss is reimagined and reversed. Anne Hathaway plays the beleaguered assistant, but she is much less interesting -- and in the end less sympathetic -- than the boss, Miranda Priestly, incarnated by Meryl Streep as a subtle and searching (and very funny) portrait of glamour and power. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'GABRIELLE' (No rating, 90 minutes) A film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau and starring the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory and Isabelle Huppert, about the dissolution of a haute bourgeois Parisian marriage, about 1912. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE GROOMSMEN' (R, 93 minutes) Just when it seems that Edward Burns might have pulled off an American ''I Vitelloni,'' his X-ray vision into life in an Irish-American enclave in New York glazes over, and he resolves his characters' anxiety and despair with tearful hugs and phony reassurances. (Holden) * 'HEADING SOUTH' (No rating, 105 minutes, in English and French) Sex tourism involving middle-aged white women and black beach boys at a Haitian resort in the late 1970's is the subject of Laurent Cantet's third film, one of the most truthful explorations of desire, age and youth ever filmed, with a politically charged subtext about capitalist imperialism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'I LIKE KILLING FLIES' (R, 79 minutes) The documentary filmmaker Matt Mahurin paints an engaging if glib portrait of Kenny Shopsin, of the legendary or notorious, depending on your experience, Greenwich Village eatery that bears his name. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LITTLE MAN' (PG-13, 90 minutes) A belligerent midget jewel thief assaults groins and molests women in this infantile comedy from the Wayans brothers. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE' (R, 101 minutes) A bittersweet comedy of dysfunction that takes place at the terminus of the American dream. The excellent cast includes Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano and that national treasure, Alan Arkin. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'MIAMI VICE' (R, 133 minutes) This updating of the 1980's television series cost more than the annual budget of the real-life Miami Police Department, making it the most expensive experimental art film ever made. (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'MONSTER HOUSE' (PG, 86 minutes) This scary movie for kids provides more fun in 86 minutes than all the other would-be summer blockbusters combined. A trio of intrepid youngsters face down a demonic dwelling in a quiet suburb. The motion-capture animation produces an uncanny feeling of realism, while the fantastical effects are spooky, witty and spectacular. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Arabic, English and Kurdish) Filmed in Iraq from June 2004 to February 2005, ''My Country, My Country'' views the prelude to the January elections primarily through the eyes of Dr. Riyadh, a Sunni candidate and physician who runs a free clinic in Baghdad. Without comment but with unusual sensitivity, the director, Laura Poitras, exposes the emotional toll of occupation on Iraqis and United States soldiers alike, leaving us feeling that this particular mission is far from accomplished. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'THE NIGHT LISTENER' (R, 82 minutes) Robin Williams plays a writer and radio host who strikes up a long-distance friendship with a young man who may not exist. An intriguing premise, but not satisfyingly realized. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'OVER THE HEDGE' (PG, 83 minutes) This tale about some woodland critters threatened by their new human neighbors has the technical trappings of a worthwhile Saturday matinee, so it's too bad no one paid commensurate attention to the script. The writers, including Karey Kirkpatrick, who directed with Tim Johnson, pad the story with the usual yuks and some glop about family, but there is no poetry here and little thought. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Garrison Keillor's long-running Public Radio hootenanny turns out to be the perfect vehicle for Robert Altman's fluid, chaotic humanism. The performances -- especially by Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep as a pair of singing sisters -- are so full of relaxed vitality that you almost don't notice that the film is, at heart, a wry, sober contemplation of mortality. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'THE PUFFY CHAIR' (R, 85 minutes) Three 20-somethings on the road with a recliner. Sweet but minor (Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'QUINCEAÑERA' (R, 90 minutes) This portrait of a Mexican-American family living in a Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles is as smart and warm-hearted an exploration of an upwardly mobile immigrant culture as American independent cinema has produced. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'A SCANNER DARKLY' (R, 100 minutes) Identities shift and melt like shadows in Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of the Philip K. Dick semispeculative novel ''A Scanner Darkly,'' a look at a future that appears an awful lot like today. With the voices and gestures of Keanu Reeves, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and a wonderful Robert Downey Jr. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SATELLITE' (No rating, 100 minutes) In this captivating romantic fairy tale for grown-ups, made on a shoestring, two young lovers in New York flee yuppie hell into a life of petty theft. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* SCOOP (PG-13, 96 minutes) A not especially funny yet oddly appealing comedy in which Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson make like Nick and Nora, but with more shtick and no martinis (or Asta). (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SHADOWBOXER' (R, 93 minutes) This garish thriller starring Helen Mirren and Cuba Gooding Jr. as contract killers and lovers is an extravagance that leaves you with your mouth hanging open -- partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'STRANGERS WITH CANDY' (R, 87 minutes) High school high jinks, adapted from the beloved Comedy Central series. The comedy is stretched a little thin by the feature length, but there are still some laughs. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND' (PG-13, 110 minutes) A shaky comedy from the director Ivan Reitman, in which ''Fatal Attraction'' meets ''Wonder Woman,'' by way of Uma Thurman, Luke Wilson and some sexist she-devil clichés, some funny, others not. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'SUPERMAN RETURNS' (PG-13, 157 minutes) Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud ''Superman IV,'' the Man of Steel has been resurrected in Bryan Singer's leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and another bummer summer. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) Fast, fun and silly, with Will Farrell as a Nascar driver, Sacha Baron Cohen as his nemesis, and a new course record for product placements per gallon. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'13 TZAMETI'  (No rating, 90 minutes) The flashy black-and-white directorial debut of the Georgian filmmaker Gela Babluani is a sadistic, arty thriller that suggests a French new wave film infected by a virulent strain of Eastern European nihilism. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'THE TROUBLE WITH MEN AND WOMEN' (No rating, 74 minutes) This tiny, well-acted movie about the romantic troubles besetting two young couples in London feels at once utterly real and banal. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'WHO KILLED THE ELECTRIC CAR?' (PG, 92 minutes) A murder mystery, a call to arms and an effective inducement to rage, Chris Paine's film about the recent rise and fall of the electric car is the latest and one of the more successful additions to the growing ranks of issue-oriented documentaries. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' (PG-13, 129 minutes) From Oliver Stone, a return to the emotions of 9/11. Powerful and almost unbearably moving. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' (PG-13, 104 minutes) As expected, the third and presumably last film about the powerful Marvel Comics mutants who walk and often fight among us pretty much looks and plays like the first two, though perhaps with more noise and babes, and a little less glum. The credited writers here are Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn, who, like the director, Brett Ratner, are not mutant enough to fly. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>YOU, ME AND DUPREE' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Owen Wilson stars as the dude who comes to dinner and stays way past dessert in Joe and Anthony Russo's generally unfunny comedy. A fine Matt Dillon and a decorative Kate Hudson also star, rather more wanly. (Dargis)</p>

        <p>DEERHOOF, BEIRUT (Sunday) A decade into Deerhoof's career, this avant-garde rock band from San Francisco still has plenty of surprises. Its stop-start songs, with jagged guitars, a drum style somewhere between jazz and metal, and Satomi Matsuzaki's nursery-rhyme vocals, sound intriguingly extraterrestrial. Beirut is the project of Zach Condon, an Albuquerque native who at age 19 made ''Gulag Orkestar'' (Ba Da Bing), an album of somber and ecstatic Balkan Gypsy marches, recording most of the horns, pianos, organs, percussion and even ukulele and mandolins himself. With Apollo Sunshine, the Harlem Shakes and, playing D.J., ?uestlove from the Roots. At 3 p.m., McCarren Park Pool, Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, thepoolparties.com; free. (Ben Sisario)</p>
        <p>DIRTY PRETTY THINGS (Monday and Tuesday) After the tunefully frantic British band the Libertines split a couple of years ago, its singer, Pete Doherty, formed Babyshambles and entered tabloid purgatory, while its talented and less arrest-prone guitarist, Carl Barât, and its drummer, Gary Powell, formed Dirty Pretty Things. The band's debut album, ''Waterloo to Anywhere'' (Interscope), sounds like the Strokes tearing through Kinks songs. With Scissors for Lefty. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>JEREMY ENIGK (Tonight) In the 1990's, Mr. Enigk was the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, a Seattle group that did as much as anybody to transform emo from a relatively obscure offshoot of hardcore punk into the populist form of yearning and tantrum-throwing that it is today. His first solo album in a decade, ''World Waits'' (Lewis Hollow), is to be released in October. With Stars of Track and Field. At 9, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; sold out. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>FORRÓ IN THE DARK (Wednesday) For more than three years now, this group has been leading one of New York's best and lowest-tech dance parties at the East Village bar Nublu. The groove is a humble and sexy two-beat dance from northeastern Brazil called forró, made with accordion, hand-held percussion and, since this is New York, whiffs of distorted electric guitar. At 11 p.m. and 12:30 a.m., 62 Avenue C, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, nublu.net; $10. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>DIAMANDA GALÁS (Thursday) She is invariably dressed in black, her face in witchy streaks of makeup, but Diamanda Galás needs only her voice to terrify, seduce and beguile. She slides from a low, sensual growl to painful yet musically precise shrieks, and has a vast repertory that ranges from darkened Johnny Cash ballads to her own chilling AIDS Masses. In the second of four shows at the new Spiegeltent downtown, she offers ''O Death,'' with music by John Lee Hooker, Phil Ochs, Ralph Stanley, Hank Williams and Shel Silverstein. At 6 p.m., Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $30. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* GNARLS BARKLEY, PEEPING TOM (Thursday) Every summer needs a Gnarls Barkley. This brilliantly nutty duo, featuring the producer-alchemist Danger Mouse and the helium-voiced singer and rapper Cee-Lo Green, has scored the surprise hit of the season with ''Crazy,'' an arty hip-hop goof disguised as a slow-burn soul song -- or is that a slow-burn soul song disguised as an arty hip-hop goof? The band plays a benefit concert for Central Park SummerStage with Peeping Tom, the latest project of Mike Patton, the naughty boy of heavy metal turned naughty boy of the avant-garde. The gimmick here is creepy lounge and trip-hop, with guests ranging from Norah Jones to the bawdily bizarre rapper Kool Keith. Who knows which guests will turn up, although Mr. Patton may not need any help: for the album, ''Peeping Tom'' (Ipecac), he worked alone and traded tapes with his collaborators. At 7 p.m. Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777 or (212) 307-7171, summerstage.org; sold out. Peeping Tom also plays Wednesday at 8 p.m. at Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505, warsawconcerts.com; $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>IRON &amp; WINE, LOW (Thursday) Reverse psychology: instead of trying to fill a gigantic space like the McCarren Park Pool with lots of loud noise, do it with a reverent hush. Iron &amp; Wine, which is the singer and guitarist Sam Beam and whoever he happens to be playing with, specializes in gentle acoustic lullabies whose vocals compete with the guitar over which can be more whispery. Low, a veteran band from Duluth, Minn., uses grand, glacial dynamics to give its semiloud climaxes the weight of religious epiphanies. Also on the bill is Califone, a fine band from the Chicago experimental scene that plays wistful songs with a constant, thin hum. At 5 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212) 307-7171; $32.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>CHRIS ISAAK (Thursday) Chris Isaak is a disciple of Roy Orbison, writing dolorous ballads that find their only consolation in his honeyed voice and finely turned guitar lines. Onstage he's a droll storyteller. With Tristan Prettyman. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070 or (212) 307-7171; $30 to $100. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>JURASSIC 5 (Wednesday) This hip-hop quintet from Los Angeles harks back to the genial wordplay and jazz vamps of New York's fondly remembered Native Tongues groups, like A Tribe Called Quest. With X-Clan. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, irvingplaza.com; sold out. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>JORMA KAUKONEN (Thursday) One of the original psychedelic blues players, Jorma Kaukonen brought Jefferson Airplane both searing electric guitar lines and old-fashioned blues. He then founded Hot Tuna, a band built on spiky, ragtimey blues. His own songs contemplate death and loss, holding his gentle voice in a lattice of fingerpicking. With Rob McNurlin. At 8 p.m., the Concert Hall at the New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, concertstonight.com; $36.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>CHRIS KNIGHT (Tuesday) Cold-eyed drifters, crooked yet sentimental cops, and prostitutes who kill their johns are characters in the brutal, deadpan songs of Chris Knight, a country singer from Kentucky whose oeuvre resembles Bruce Springsteen's album ''Nebraska'' set in the South. At 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LINCOLN CENTER OUT OF DOORS (Tonight and tomorrow) Tonight this annual series of free outdoor concerts presents L. Subramaniam, a renowned violinist in the Carnatic style of southern India. He has also recorded with Stéphane Grappelli and Yehudi Menuhin, and plays here with the American classical violinist Eugene Fodor. Tomorrow is one of Out of Doors' many blues-themed concerts. This one looks at the roots and reflections of blues around the world, with Markus James, an American guitarist and singer; Hassan Hakmoun, a master of the gnawa music of Morocco, which is as richly bluesy as it is ecstatic; Fantasia Music, a group that plays rebetika, the rough-and-tumble songs of the Greek underworld; Gazpacho Andalú, a New York flamenco band; and Helder Moutinho, a Portuguese fado singer. The host tomorrow is Guy Davis. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow night at 7, Damrosch Park Bandshell, (212) 875-5766, lincolncenter.org. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>ASHA PUTHLI, PREFUSE 73, TALVIN SINGH (Sunday) Asha Puthli, a trailblazing Indian singer who has performed with everybody from Ornette Coleman to Ashford and Simpson, makes her first New York appearance in 25 years, with Dewey Redman, Guru, Solar and DJ Doo Wop. She is joined by Prefuse 73, also known as the hip-hop producer Guillermo Scott Herren, and, performing a D.J. set, Talvin Singh, whose experiments mixing traditional Indian music with abstract electronic dance music have been widely influential. At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a donation is suggested. Mr. Singh also plays on Sunday at 9:30 p.m. at the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>LAS RUBIAS DEL NORTE (Tonight and Sunday) Las Rubias del Norte, long in residence at Barbès, a cozy bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, play boleros, cumbias and other Latin styles, elegantly arranged for a small band and two songbird sopranos. At 6 p.m., Spiegeltent, Fulton Fish Market, Pier 17, Fulton and South Streets, Lower Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, spiegelworld.com; $15. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* SONIC YOUTH, YEAH YEAH YEAHS (Tonight and tomorrow) These two bands emerged, decades apart, from the same dank and claustrophobic downtown (and Brooklyn) clubs to define avant-garde New York rock. So it is only appropriate that when they share a big stage, it is a really big and really unusual stage: the 50,000-square-foot McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn. Both have released strong albums this year, and they headline these two nights at the pool, joined by Blood on the Wall tonight and Awesome Color tomorrow. At 5 p.m., Lorimer Street, between Driggs Avenue and Bayard Street, Greenpoint, (212) 307-7171; $36 in advance, $41 at the door. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>STEELY DAN, MICHAEL McDONALD (Thursday) In 2000 Steely Dan released its first new songs in 20 years on ''Two Against Nature'' (Warner Brothers), and Donald Fagen and Walter Becker crammed them full of musical subterfuges. The band once hated touring but become quite proficient at it, especially now that Mr. Becker has accepted his inevitable role as Steely Dan's lead guitarist. Michael McDonald, the smoky-voiced crooner who has been through Steely Dan, the Doobie Brothers and a long solo career, has most recently recorded two albums of Motown songs. At 8 p.m., Nikon at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000, nikonjonesbeach.com; $35 to $95. (Pareles)</p>

At 7 p.m., Prospect Park Bandshell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, brooklynx.org; $70 for reserved seating, $45 on the lawn. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>THROWING MUSES, 50 FOOT WAVE (Tomorrow) Throughout the 1980's and 90's Kristin Hersh led Throwing Muses, the textbook college-rock band: witty, imaginative, small-scale and entirely non-macho. (The presence of as many as three women in the band helped that.) But there was nothing textbook about the band's songs, which set turbulent and free-associative psychodramas to twisting and unpredictable guitar lines. The band reunited in 2003 after six years, by which time Ms. Hersh had developed a successful solo career and started a new, punkier band, 50 Foot Wave. Both play tomorrow, along with Bullseye. At 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $20. (Sisario)</p>
        <p>* WILD MAGNOLIA MARDI GRAS INDIANS, IRMA THOMAS (Tomorrow) One of the more elaborate Mardi Gras traditions in New Orleans is the black men who parade, dance and otherwise revel as ''Indians,'' dressed in impossibly flamboyant costumes loosely based on American Indian designs. Working for months each year, the men sew in extensive patterns of sequins, glitter and beadwork, and fasten the feathers tightly in preparation for lots of dancing. Led by Bo Dollis, the Wild Magnolias, one of the three dozen or so ''tribes,'' make a rare visit. Irma Thomas was a New Orleans soul queen when her version of ''Time Is on My Side'' inspired the Rolling Stones in 1964. Her home and nightclub destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, she recently released her first new album in six years, ''After the Rain'' (Rounder). At 3 p.m., Central Park SummerStage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free, but a suggested $30 donation will benefit the New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, a nonprofit medical center.(Sisario)</p>
        <p>* WU-TANG CLAN (Thursday) The eight surviving representatives of hip-hop's most ingenious and eccentric band-cum-brand name team up for a rare tour in tribute to Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as Ol' Dirty Bastard, the especially ingenious, eccentric and self-destructive member who died in 2004. With Rhymefest. At 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 533-2111, bowerypresents.com; $50. (Sisario)</p>

        <p>TOSHIKO AKIYOSHI TRIO (Wednesday and Thursday) A couple of years ago Ms. Akiyoshi retired her acclaimed big band, ending a standing Birdland engagement. Returning to the club with a trio, she places emphasis on her articulate piano playing, a treat in itself. Through Aug. 19. At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)</p>

        <p>MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Wednesday) ''Right Before Your Very Ears'' (Clean Feed), Mr. Blake's most recent album, showcases his tenor saxophone in a rough-hewn but deeply focused pianoless trio setting.

At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8.</p>
        <p>(Chinen)</p>
        <p>GERALD CLEAVER TRIO (Thursday) Dealing less in rhythm than in pulse, Mr. Cleaver's drumming perfectly suits the fluid requirements of jazz's post-everything avant-garde. He has sympathetic partners in the pianist Craig Taborn and the bassist William Parker. At 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ELLERY ESKELIN TRIO (Sunday) Mr. Eskelin is a tenor saxophonist known for gruff abandon; his signature band with the accordionist Andrea Parkins and the drummer Jim Black handles abstraction as well as groove.

        <p>GROUP FIVE (Wednesday) With a lineup suggestive of the Brian Blade Fellowship, this ensemble would seem to pursue similar pastoral fusions. But the placement of this one-night engagement -- The Stone, an avant-garde shrine -- might elicit a more raucous mood from Mr. Blade, on drums; Jon Cowherd, on piano; Doug Weiss, on bass; and Joel Frahm and Myron Walden, on saxophones. At 8 and 10 p.m., The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JOHN HEBERT QUARTET (Tonight and Sunday night) Mr. Hebert's bass playing has anchored a handful of prominent recent ensembles, including the Andrew Hill Quintet.

        <p>WAYNE KRANTZ TRIO (Thursday) With roots in both jazz and rock, Mr. Krantz manages a genre splice leaner and more rugged than most fusions. He's aided here by the electric bassist Anthony Jackson and the drummer Anton Fig. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; cover, $15, includes two drinks. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>OKKYUNG LEE (Tuesday) Ms. Lee is a cellist with an experimental streak, as she demonstrates here with two trios: one featuring Anthony Burr on clarinet and Trevor Dunn on bass, and another with Alan Licht on guitar and Chad Taylor on drums. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>DONNY McCASLIN SEPTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. McCaslin, an assertive tenor and soprano saxophonist and, increasingly, an accomplished composer, introduces a commissioned long-form piece called ''In Pursuit.''

        <p>BRANDON ROSS AND BLAZING BEAUTY (Sunday) Mr. Ross goes for earthy yet otherworldly effect in both his guitar playing and his compositions.

        <p>* JENNY SCHEINMAN TRIO (Thursday) Ms. Scheinman is a violinist attracted to rusticity but committed to a modern language; the same could be said, more or less, of the drummer Paul Motian and the pianist Jason Moran. Still, this all-star trio carries the burden of a small spectacle: it could be transcendent or a train wreck, and either way it will be something to behold. Through Aug. 20. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MARK TAYLOR QUARTET (Wednesday) Mr. Taylor's mellifluous French horn playing has been heard in avant-garde ensembles led by the composers Henry Threadgill and Muhal Richard Abrams.

At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* CHARLES TOLLIVER BIG BAND (Thursday) Mr. Tolliver leads an upgraded edition of his acclaimed orchestra of the 1970's, with such top-shelf talent as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Craig Handy, the trombonist Clark Gayton, the pianist Robert Glasper and the bassist Cecil McBee. The band will be featured on a forthcoming Blue Note album, but that's no reason not to absorb its visceral impact in person. Through Aug. 20. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CEDAR WALTON QUINTET (Tonight through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) As a pianist and composer, Mr. Walton heeds an articulate, almost courtly variety of hard bop; he's at his best when his forms spark solos from collaborators like Steve Turre, a trombonist (through Sunday only), and Vincent Herring, an alto saxophonist (next week.)

        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA (Tonight through Tuesday, and Thursday) Opera can be formal or pure fluff, and this season's program at Glimmerglass about equally balances the two. All four of this year's operas are in rotation this week: Janacek's dark ''Jenufa'' in the Jonathan Miller production (tonight and Thursday night at 8, Monday afternoon at 1:30); Steven Hartke's brand-new, Maupassant-based opera ''The Greater Good'' (tomorrow and Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.); and, on the lighter side, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance'' (tomorrow night at 8) and Rossini's ''Barber of Seville'' (Sunday afternoon at 1:30). Route 80, north of Cooperstown, N.Y., (607) 547-5704, glimmerglass.org; $69 to $117, tonight through Sunday; $41 to $104 Monday through Thursday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARD FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Leon Botstein's annual composer-focused festival is devoted to Franz Liszt this year, and, as in past summers, it includes concerts, lectures and panel discussions, for which a large cast of experts -- both players and speakers -- has been assembled. The opening weekend includes six programs, beginning with an all-Liszt catchall concert tonight, in which a handful of pianists, singers and a choir offers a broad selection of works meant to show Liszt as a mirror of his time. A concert tomorrow afternoon broadens the focus, putting Liszt's music beside other composers' scores, including Chopin, Czerny, Moscheles, Hummel, Beethoven, Schubert and Clara Wieck Schumann. Tomorrow evening Liszt's music is related to the currents in 19th-century art, theater and politics, by way of his symphonic poems. Sunday begins with chamber music, mostly by Liszt's contemporaries; an afternoon concert shows the shadow cast not only on Liszt, but also on Brahms and Schumann, by the virtuoso violinist and composer Paganini. Later in the afternoon Mr. Botstein closes the first of two weekends by drifting away from the rugged muscularity of Liszt, and offering a concert of opera excerpts, including bel canto twaddle by Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini. Tonight at 8:30, $20 to $45; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., $35; and at 8 p.m., $25 to $55; Sunday at 10:30 a.m., $30; at 1:30 p.m., $35; and at 5:30 p.m., $25 to $55. Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7900, summerscape.bard.edu. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday) Good things come in threes, and Steven Beck, a pianist, seems to have achieved a happy tripartite balance for his recital, with three Bach preludes and fugues, three Shostakovich preludes and fugues, and three early Mozart sonatas. The mood changes considerably for the weekend's other concert at this floating hall: the Corigliano Quartet goes larger-scale with Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A (with Doris Stevenson), Schumann's first quartet and ''Corrie Q's Jigs and Reels'' by Adam B. Silverman. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35 tonight ($30 for 65+; $20 for students), and $40 tomorrow and Sunday ($25 for students). (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR (Tonight and tomorrow) This weekend the Caramoor summer music festival comes to an end. Tonight Caramoor's composer-in-residence, John Musto, will perform Bach's French Suite No. 5 in G and two of his own works as part of the Extreme Chamber Music series. Amy Burton, a soprano; Steven Tharp, a tenor; and Theodora Hanslowe, a mezzo-soprano, will join Mr. Musto for his ''Book of Uncommon Prayer.'' Music From Copland House, a vibrant ensemble dedicated to championing new music, will play Mr. Musto's Sextet for Clarinet, Strings and Piano (with the composer as pianist). For the festival's finale tomorrow, Donald Runnicles will lead Ingrid Fliter in a performance of Mozart's Piano Concerto in A (K. 488) with the Orchestra of St. Luke's. The program also includes Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony and John Adams's Chamber Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 149 Girdle Ridge Road, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252, caramoor.org; $27 to $37 tonight, $17.50 to $67.50 tomorrow. (Vivien Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>COMPOSERS COLLABORATIVE (Tonight and tomorrow) Established in its wonted (and literally underground) summer haunt, the Composers Collaborative is offering, during its mini-festival, the same piece it did last year: Jed Distler's longtime work-in-progress, ''The Gold Standard.'' This music theater work concludes the proceedings tomorrow; tonight's concert features two trios, First Avenue and Maya, performing inventive contemporary chamber music. Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 663-1967, composerscollab.org; $25; $15 for students, with a one-drink minimum. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday) Seven intense weeks of chamber music conclude on Sunday with Beethoven's ''Choral Fantasy,'' a tradition started 30 years ago by Rudolf Serkin, a festival founder and the longtime artistic director. Ignat Solzhenitsyn will lead Mitsuko Uchida, the pianist and co-artistic director, as well as a chorus and orchestra made up of Marlboro resident artists, family members and innkeepers. Tonight's program includes Haydn's ''Arianna a Naxos,'' with the mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford; Donald Martino's Quartet No. 5, with the violist Samuel Rhodes of the Juilliard Quartet; and Brahms's Trio in B with Mr. Solzhenitsyn as pianist. Tomorrow's program includes Beethoven's ''To the Distant Beloved,'' with the young baritone Thomas Meglioranza, and Takemitsu's ''Entre-Temps'' for oboe and string quartet. On Sunday Mozart's Serenade in C minor for woodwinds; Brahms's Four Songs for vocal quartet, two horns and harp (Op. 17); and Britten's String Quartet No. 3 will precede the finale. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, and Sunday at 2:30, Marlboro Music School and Festival, Marlboro, Vt., (802) 254-2394, marlboromusic.org; $15 to $30; $5 for canopy areas. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL (Tonight through Wednesday) This dual celebration -- the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, and the 40th of the festival itself -- is in high gear, with standard concerts, late-night programs and odd explorations like the collaborations between Concerto Köln, an early-music group, and Sarband, which specializes in Middle Eastern music. Often, you can do it all: tonight and tomorrow night at 8, you can catch the pianist and conductor Christian Zacharias presiding over a program that includes Mozart's D minor Piano Concerto (K. 466), the ''Posthorn'' Serenade and a handful of arias, sung by Sally Matthews. Then, at 10:30, Sarband and Concerto Köln play their multicultural concerts, a different program each night. The pianist Emanuel Ax plays a late-night Mozart program on Tuesday, and on Wednesday Peter Phillips directs the Tallis Scholars in sacred works by Mozart's predecessors -- including the Allegri ''Miserere,'' which, according to legend, Mozart wrote from memory after hearing it once. Mr. Zacharias's concerts are at 8 p.m. at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center; $35 to $55. Concerto Köln and Sarband's concerts are at 10:30 p.m. at the Allen Room, Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street; $35. Mr. Ax's recital is at 10:30 p.m. at the Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street; $35. The Tallis Scholars program is at 8 p.m. at the Rose Theater at Rose Hall; $35 to $60. (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'MOZART ON FILM' (Monday) Film about Mozart has long had a place at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, but there are always new things to be seen. ''In Search of Mozart,'' a film by Phil Grabsky, is a biographical documentary, narrated by Juliet Stevenson, and including performances and observations by a broad array of interpreters, from period-instrument specialists like the Orchestra of the 18th Century and the conductor Roger Norrington, to modern players like the pianists Lang Lang and Imogen Cooper, and the singers Renée Fleming and Magdalena Kozena. ''Mozart Interpreted,'' a series of three short films, includes performances of Mozart's Symphony No. 40, from a 1948 broadcast by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra; Karl Böhm's account of the Symphony No. 38, with the Vienna Philharmonic, from 1978; and Nikolaus Harnoncourt leading the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in the Symphony No. 41, from 1991. ''In Search of Mozart'' is at 6 p.m.; ''Mozart Interpreted'' is at 9 p.m., Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $15. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The Tokyo String Quartet returns to the Yale Summer School of Music's prestigious chamber music program. The quartet will perform Beethoven's Quartet in C minor (Op. 18, No. 4); Brahms's Quartet in B flat; and Michio Mamiya's ''Song of the White Wind.'' At 8 p.m., Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000, yale.edu/norfolk; $15 to $45. (Schweitzer)</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD (Tonight through Monday, and Thursday) Perhaps because the offerings are particularly diverse, tickets for the festival this month have been discounted. Tonight's concert should be a treat: Bach and Handel conducted by the capable early-music specialist Harry Bicket, with the mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, and actual fireworks after the ''Royal Fireworks Music.'' Tomorrow the Boston Pops offer film scores in a deluxe edition with Yo-Yo Ma, John Williams and narration by James Earl Jones; on Sunday Christoph Eschenbach leads the Philadelphia Orchestra in Beethoven's Eighth and Tchaikovsky's Fifth. Some might want to stick around until Monday to hear the student orchestra of the Tanglewood Music Center, led by Herbert Blomstedt, in Beethoven and Hindemith. On Thursday the Renaissance vocalists the Tallis Scholars offer Schütz, Allegri and others. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m., $20 to $50; Monday at 8:30 p.m., $11 to $36; Thursday at 8:30 p.m., $16 to $49. Lenox, Mass., (888) 266-1200, tanglewood.org. (Midgette)</p>

        <p>CEDAR LAKE CONTEMPORARY BALLET (Thursday) For an informal free Thursday evening series this month, the company opens up its intimate theater to the street and turns it into an installation for a 90-minute program of multimedia dance created by company members. Thursday at 6 p.m., Cedar Lake Theater, 547 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 244-0015, cedarlakedance.com. (Jennifer Dunning)</p>
        <p>* CENTRAL PARK SUMMER STAGE (Tonight) With a little luck, the only heat in the park tonight will be onstage as two powerful modern-dance companies perform repertory selections in the closing weekend of this festival. One is Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's Urban Bush Women, known for funny, angry, compassionate dancing about everyday life and social history. The company will perform ''Walking With Pearl  Africa Diaries,'' an evocative, eloquent tribute to the modern-dance pioneer Pearl Primus. The other is Jamel Gaines's rafter-raising Creative Outlet troupe. Tonight at 8, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777, summerstage.org; free. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>CHOREOGRAPHY CAFÉ (Wednesday) Featured artists are Heidi Latsky and Alan Good in this informal series presented by Dancewave, which invites professional choreographers who work with children and teenagers. Wednesday at 2:15 p.m., Old First Reformed Church, 729 Carroll Street, at Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 522-4696, dancewave.org; free. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* CITY PARKS DANCE (Tomorrow) The City Parks Foundation went for the big names in New York modern dance for this performance and dance-lesson series. Jawole Willa Jo Zollar and the Urban Bush Women will follow tonight's Summerstage performance with ''Give Your Hands to Struggle'' from ''Hands Singing Song,'' with music by Sweet Honey in the Rock, and excerpts from ''Walking With Pearl  Southern Diaries.'' Illystyle &amp; Peace Productions will share the program with a fast-moving, exuberant tribute to break-dancing. And Ms. Zollar will teach the program's opening class, ''How We Got to the Funk,'' an exploration of the cultural history inherent in African-American social dances from the 1950's through the 70's. Tomorrow at 3 p.m., Amphitheater, Von King Park, 670 Lafayette Avenue, between Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (212) 360-8290, cityparksfoundation.org; free. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>* JACOB'S PILLOW DANCE FESTIVAL (Tonight through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Shen Wei Dance Arts will be in the larger Ted Shawn Theater through the weekend, followed on Wednesday and Thursday (and next weekend) by Peter Boal's Pacific Northwest Ballet, or at least its touring ensemble. In the smaller Doris Duke Studio Theater through the weekend is MoveOpolis, the company formed by Richard Move, who made his name as a Martha Graham impersonator, and moving in on Thursday is Choreftes, a Greek company making its United States debut. Shen Wei, tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m.; Pacific Northwest Ballet, Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8. At the Shawn Theater, $50.

        <p>MISNOMER DANCE THEATER (Thursday) Chris Elam's ''Throw People'' examines ways of being thrown, both physically and emotionally. Through Aug. 27. Thursday at 7 p.m., Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 Fourth Avenue, at Union Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 857-4816, misnomer.org; $20. (Anderson)</p>
        <p>* 'MOZART DANCES' (Thursday through Saturday) Another month, another major work from Mark Morris. This one, a world premiere, was commissioned by the Mostly Mozart Festival and will offer the Mark Morris Dance Group performing to two Mozart piano concertos (K. 413 and 595) and the Sonata in D for two pianos (K. 448), with Louis Langrée conducting the Festival Orchestra and the pianists Emanuel Ax and Yoko Nozaki. Through Aug. 19. Thursday at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $25 to $75. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>* 'PERSEPHONE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Robert Wilson's well-traveled dance-theater production of this Greek classic, with music by Philip Glass and Rossini, is revived where it was born in 1995, the prelude to another world tour. Tomorrow and Sunday nights at 7:30, John Drew Theater of Guild Hall, 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-4050, guildhall.org; $55. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>* PILOBOLUS (Tonight and tomorrow) The grandfather of the current crop of Nikolais-inspired, Cirque du Soleil-like acrobatic dance troupes with spectacular visual effects. A little mindless but enormously popular for people of all ages. The company concludes its summer Joyce season with the ''Prism'' program tonight and tomorrow afternoon and ''Memento Mori'' tomorrow night. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 8, and tomorrow at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42. (Rockwell)</p>
        <p>RIVER TO RIVER FESTIVAL (Today, Wednesday and Thursday). The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Sitelines series offers ''Oasis,'' a performance by H. T. Chen and Sharon Estacio that celebrates parks as gathering spaces. Through Aug. 18. Today at 12:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 7 p.m., Columbus Park, intersection of Baxter, Mulberry, Worth and Bayard Streets, Chinatown, rivertorivernyc.com; free. (Anderson)</p>
        <p>SMUIN BALLET (Monday through Thursday) A lively San Francisco company offers two new works by Michael Smuin: ''Bluegrass/Slyde,'' to bluegrass music, and ''Symphony of Psalms,'' to Stravinsky. They share the program with ''Fly Me to the Moon,'' to Frank Sinatra recordings. Through Aug. 19. Monday, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 8; Wednesday at 2 and 8 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $42. (Anderson)</p>
        <p>STREET THEATER COMPANY (Tomorrow and Sunday) The show is called ''Tap Dance,'' but its title specifically refers to wiretapping. Still, everyone in the cast will do some tap dancing in this production, which tours the city through Sept. 17. Tomorrow at 2 p.m., St. Mark's Church, 131 East Tenth Street, East Village; Sunday at 2 p.m., Von King Park, 670 Lafayette Avenue, between Marcy and Tompkins Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (212) 254-1109, theaterforthenewcity.net; free.

        <p>SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT THEATER (Thursday) Hey Jeong Yoong and Eun Hee Kim, both from Seoul, will present the timely-sounding ''Beyond the DMZ,'' which documents the division of Korea more than 50 years ago. Through Aug. 13. Thursday at 8 p.m., the Poet's Den Theater, 309 East 108th Street, Spanish Harlem, (718) 651-7725; $20; $15 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY),' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, or folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GRAFFITI,' through Sept. 3. Twenty paintings on canvas from the early 1980's by formerly famous subway graffiti artists who went by names like Crash, Daze and Lady Pink. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>* DAHESH MUSEUM OF ART: 'NAPOLEON ON THE NILE: SOLDIERS, ARTISTS AND THE REDISCOVERY OF EGYPT,' through Dec. 31. Napoleon's invasion of Egypt was a military disaster, but the squadron of scholars and scientists that went with him lay the foundation for Egyptology and Egyptomania, gave Orientalism a big boost and was commemorated by the 1,000 engravings of the 23-volume ''Description de l'Égypte.'' Examples of the book's prints form the backbone of this engrossing if somewhat strange and sometimes piecemeal show, which includes Orientalist paintings and a cache of fascinating ephemera. 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606 or daheshmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION : 'JEAN-ÉTIENNE LIOTARD (1702-1789): SWISS MASTER,' through Sept. 17. Liotard is something of a specialty item now, but he was widely known in the Enlightenment Europe of his day. And even then he was seen as a maverick, a figure of contradictions. He was a stone-cold realist in an age of rococo frills. In a great age of oil painting, he favored pastel. He had ultrafancy sitters for his portraits, including Marie Antoinette. But his most vivid likenesses are of himself and his family. The Frick's perfectly proportioned sweetheart of a solo show is the artist's first in North America. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 or frick.org. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ZAHA HADID: THIRTY YEARS IN ARCHITECTURE,' through Oct. 25. This exhibition, Ms. Hadid's first major retrospective in the United States, gives New Yorkers a chance to see what they've been missing. The show, in the Guggenheim's rotunda, spirals through Ms. Hadid's career, from her early enchantment with Soviet Constructivism to the sensuous and fluid cityscapes of her more recent commissions. It illuminates her capacity for bridging different worlds: traditional perspective drawing and slick computer-generated imagery; the era of utopian manifestoes and the ambiguous values of the information age. (212) 423-3500 or guggenheim.org. (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>* INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ATTA KIM: ON AIR,' through Aug. 27. The South Korean artist Atta Kim's best-known body of work is a series called ''The Museum Project'' (1995-2002), for which he photographed his human subjects -- families, nude couples, maimed war veterans -- locked inside plexiglass exhibition cases like specimens on display. The series eventually took a religious turn, with models posing as Buddhist deities. The pictures here, in his first major American solo show, continue this spiritual trajectory. Filmed using long exposure times, figures, landscapes and religious icons have been turned into apparitions. People, art and museums may last for a while, Mr. Kim seems to say, but all things eventually melt away. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000 or icp.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GIRODET: ROMANTIC REBEL,' through Aug. 27. Hugely famous in the early-19th century, Girodet dropped down the memory chute. His ''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of French Heroes,'' painted for Napoleon, is one of the most deranged pictures in art history. It's so unhinged that it's almost lovable, which is otherwise the last word to come to mind for an artist who, in his uptight, smarty-pants mode, could be a bore. But give the show a shot. It's sometimes brilliant, and Girodet's strangeness and fairly repellent character make him at least fascinating to contemplate and heroic in his immoderation. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* MET: 'RAPHAEL AT THE METROPOLITAN: THE COLONNA ALTARPIECE,' through Sept. 4 This exhilarating show reunites the central panel and lunette of Raphael's Colonna Altarpiece (owned by the Met) with all five panels of the predella. Additional works by Raphael, Perugino, Fra Bartolommeo and Leonardo place the work in context and sharpen the understanding of Raphael's budding genius. (212) 535-7710 or metmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'THE EAMES LOUNGE CHAIR: AN ICON OF MODERN DESIGN,' through Sept. 3. Celebrating the 50th anniversary of a chair whose combination of declarative modernist structure and sheer creature comfort was both innovative and a bit alien, this exhibition is a successful design object in its own right. It pays homage with drawings, advertising ephemera, precursors, vintage television clips, a wonderful documentary and three versions of the chair itself, enshrined, exploded and useable.40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 or madmuseum.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE WORD ON THE STREET: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF LARRY RACIOPPO,' through Aug. 20. Photographs documenting vernacular expressions of religious devotion in New York, including spray-painted murals, private shrines and tattoos. Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212) 408-1500 or mobia.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ARTIST'S CHOICE: HERZOG &amp; DE MEURON, PERCEPTION RESTRAINED,' through Sept. 25. In an unusually accessible bit of institutional critique, the architects who failed to win the commission to design the new Museum of Modern Art bite the hand that didn't feed them. They create a kind of deprivation chamber with a black gallery, where excerpts from American movies play on video screens on the ceiling and 110 works of art and design are crammed into enormous niches that are all but sealed from view. Perverse and cerebral, it may be the best one-liner you'll encounter this summer, and it makes some interesting points about the spectacle of the museum, the Modern included. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'DADA,' through Sept. 11. This is pretty much Dada's official survey (an oxymoron), and it makes nearly all 450 or so objects in it look elegant. That hat rack looks awfully stylish now. It's good to be reacquainted with a generation of artists who had no market to speak of and for whom society's corruption and exhaustion seemed golden opportunities to make themselves useful. Cynical and traumatized, the Dadaists were tireless young optimists at heart. They discovered a world full of wonders, and we are, on the whole, their beneficiaries. (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: DOUGLAS GORDON: 'TIMELINE,' through Sept 4. This selection of works by the artist known for appropriating and inventively manipulating Hollywood movies includes his projection of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho,'' which runs so slowly that it takes 24 hours to complete, and a large-scale video installation that studies a circus elephant performing in an empty art gallery. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 or moma.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: GUSTAV KLIMT: FIVE PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF FERDINAND AND ADELE BLOCH-BAUER,  through Sept. 18. Klimt's 1907 gold portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, lately acquired by the billionaire collector Ronald S. Lauder, reportedly for $135 million, is now aptly installed like a trophy head above the mantelpiece. She's half queen, half Las Vegas showgirl. A perfect New Yorker. She temporarily hangs with four other Klimts, including a second Adele, painted in 1912: a slender, sinuous Coke-bottle-shaped figure, more chaste than carnal. A painting of a birch forest is an archetypal Klimt mix of uncanny naturalism and geometric abstraction. Two other landscapes, of an apple tree and an unfinished jigsaw-puzzle view of houses on the shore of the Attersee, raise the question: had Klimt not died at 55 in 1918, would he have ended up a pure abstractionist like Mondrian? 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200 or neuegalerie.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: CHIHULY AT THE NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN, through Oct. 29. Dale Chihuly, the world's most famous contemporary glass artist, has created ambitious installations of his large-scale, technically virtuosic and materially extravagant works inside the spectacular Haupt Conservatory and outside in reflecting pools and smaller gardens. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx, (718) 817-8700 or nybg.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: LEGACIES: CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS REFLECT ON SLAVERY, through Jan. 7. Slavery, some would say, didn't really end in the United States until the civil rights legislation of the 1960's. That was a full century after the Emancipation Proclamation. Or the ''Emancipation Approximation,'' as the artist Kara Walker calls it in a series of hallucinatory silkscreen prints. They are among the high points of this large, powerful, subtle group show, the second of three exhibitions on American slavery organized by the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 or nyhistory.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY: 'FRENCH BOOK ART/LIVRES D'ARTISTES: ARTISTS AND POETS IN DIALOGUE,' through Aug. 19. Organized with the Bibliothèque Littéraire Jacques Doucet in Paris, this lavish exhibition surveys some of the experimental ferment brought on by the combination of free verse, visionary publishers and the high rate of talent among French artists and poets, especially in the early years of the 20th century. Concentrating on books, but also including prints and drawings, it retells the tale of the French avant-garde on a relatively egalitarian playing field. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 or nypl.org. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'BEST OF FRIENDS: BUCKMINSTER FULLER AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through Oct. 15. Great, lasting friendships are rare, but friendships that enlarge the spirit through ideas, ideals and new insights are in a class by themselves. Over a stretch of more than 50 years the sculptor Isamu Noguchi and the visionary designer R. Buckminster Fuller enjoyed such a friendship, which led to aesthetic and practical achievements that left their mark. The course of their varied collaborations is traced in this exhibition, which includes models, sculptures, drawings, photographs and films. The museum entrance is at 9-01 33rd Road, between Vernon Boulevard and 10th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088 or noguchi.org. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'INTO ME/OUT OF ME,' through Sept. 25. Often with repulsive immediacy and occasionally with wit and subtlety, works by more than 130 artists in this ambitious exhibition explore the body and all its possible experiences along the pleasure-pain continuum. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 or ps1.org. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART : 'WHAT IS IT? HIMALAYAN ART' This museum is an oasis of calm in the city; you can feel your tension dissolve the minute you walk in the door. At the same time, the place jumps with activities, including lectures, films and exhibitions, many devoted to aspects of Himalayan culture. And for a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000 or rmanyc.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>WADSWORTH ATHENEUM: 'AMERICAN SPLENDOR: HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL MASTERWORKS FROM THE WADSWORTH ATHENEUM,' through Dec. 31. Back from a two-and-a-half-year tour at six other American museums, the Wadsworth's formidable collection of 19th-century Hudson River School paintings is on display in this homecoming show. Not every Hudson River collection can boast 11 works by Frederic Edwin Church, 13 by Thomas Cole and 5 by Albert Bierstadt, along with powerful examples by other artists of the school. They are among the more than 60 paintings on display here. It's rare that you see these ultrafamiliar paintings in such concentration; their combined presence gives the show a synergistic sparkle and energy that you don't get when you see them in smaller groupings. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'FULL HOUSE: VIEWS OF THE WHITNEY'S COLLECTION AT 75,' through Sept. 3. The Whitney celebrates a significant birthday this summer with an attic-to-basement display of hundreds of pieces of art from its permanent collection. There are terrific things, arranged mostly by loose theme rather than date. And as an ensemble, they deliver an impressionistic story, through art, of a staggeringly contradictory American 20th-century culture, diverse and narrow-souled, with a devotion to the idea of power so ingrained as to make conflict inevitable and chronic. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 or whitney.org. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* SARAH SZE: 'CORNER PLOT' The upper corner of an apartment building protrudes from the Doris C. Freedman Plaza's pavement as if the whole edifice had toppled and sunk into the ground. Through the window's of Ms. Sze's magical outdoor sculpture you can see a complicated interior that looks as if it were created by a mad architect. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 980-4575, through Oct. 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>YES BRUCE NAUMAN There has never been much in the way of ''No'' to the influential Post-Minimalist and sculptor-of-all-trades Bruce Nauman. But this astutely structured, if male-dominated, exhibition considers his importance anew, especially his use of language, neon and the body, and his visceral sense of form. The show's title is taken from a 1989 work by Jessica Diamond that is included, along with pertinent efforts by Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray, Glenn Ligon, Jason Rhoades, Peter Coffin, Diana Thater, John Bock and, of course, Mr. Nauman himself. Zwirner &amp; Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, through Sept. 9. (The gallery will be closed Aug. 21 to 25.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>* A BROKEN ARM The title is a tribute to Duchamp. The works review various strategies of using found objects or images in photography, painting and sculpture. The seven artists include Gedi Sibony, Arnold Odermatt and Karen Kalimnik. All has been orchestrated by Mari Spirito, the gallery's director. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, 303gallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* DERECONSTRUCTION Matthew Higgs, director of the alternative space White Columns, has assembled a handsome show that in typical Higgs fashion brings together outsider, emerging, hip and formerly hip artists. Variations on collage and assemblage predominate without feeling stale. The larger point: deconstruction has had its day, and it is time to start putting things back together again. The putters range from A. R. Penck and Lucas Samaras to Carter and Alexandra Bircken. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9301, gladstonegallery.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* GALERIE DANIEL BUCHHOLZ AT METRO PICTURES This well-known Cologne gallery presents a surprisingly sweeping view of current art that includes Americans and Europeans and, despite its Conceptual slant, an impressive range of mediums and sensibilities. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Sept. 16. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* AMER KOBASLIJA: 'LARGE-SCALE STUDIO PAINTINGS' Large, exhaustively detailed, sensuously painted fish-eye views of the artist's studio. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Aug. 18. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'MATERIALITY' Inventive works made of all sorts of materials in this show include a stuffed leather-and-plywood tree by Carolyn Salas; a geometric landscape with a slowing-moving, wartlike kinetic element, covered in reflective Mylar, by Charlotte Becket; a neat display of more than 200 pieces of breakfast cereal by Tom Friedman; and a sumptuous stuffed object resembling a much-enlarged amoeba by Ernesto Neto. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com, through Aug. 25. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'MEN' This show of 10 paintings of men by 10 women, organized by the painter Ellen Altfest, covers a lot of stylistic ground and includes an only partly tongue-in-cheek denunciation from the lesbian collective Redykeulous. Realism makes the strongest impression. I-20, 557 West 23rd Street, (212) 645-1100, I-20.com, through Aug. 18. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* HOWARDENA PINDELL: 'IN MY LIFETIME' Thirty years ago Howardena Pindell was well known for meditative, process-based abstract work, though her art has always had two aspects. In the 1970's and 80's it assumed and maintained an overtly political direction in large-scale pieces that combined abstraction, words and figures to deal with social and political issues, from AIDS and homelessness to the present war in Iraq. Both types are in this informal gallery retrospective, which makes clear how thoroughly they are based on -- and emerge from and are fueled and inflected by -- the individual experiences and memories of the artist herself. G. R. N'Namdi Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 316, (212) 929-6645, grnnamdi.com, through Aug. 31. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>'WAR ON 45/MY MIRRORS ARE PAINTED BLACK (FOR YOU)' The latest word from the boys in black is a show of six artists organized by the head boy, Banks Violette. The stark glamour of it cannot be denied, but it looks too much like graphic design. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamidayan.com, through Sept. 2. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>JOE BIEL With an exacting illustrator's touch, Mr. Biel draws large, dreamily perverse images of children, like the one of a girl with rabbit ears and a whip peeking out of a cardboard box, and one of a knife-wielding boy crouching atop a pile of rubble and examining a bone he has found. Goff &amp; Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-0461, goffandrosenthal.com; closes today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,'  This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and castoff clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to and settlement in the United States in a garrulous, very personal way. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 or brooklynmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* J. BENNETT FITTS: 'NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY' Symbolically resonant photographs of mostly derelict motel swimming pools by a young Californian. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com; closes today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* FOUNTAINS A summery theme is tweaked by energetic efforts. High points include Daniel Lefcourt's eye-popping photograph of studio tools, Sanford Biggers's video of a disco ball and Gibb Slife's television set, whose do-it-yourself antennae suggest spreading vines or brain waves. The low points seem to have been left out. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com; closes today. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* 'A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL BEING WRITES POETRY ON A FIELD WITH SCULPTURES' Organized by the sculptor Charles Ray, this beautiful, spare and mysterious exhibition presents sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, Mark di Suvero and the folk artist Edgar Tolson, and a giant photograph by Jeff Wall. Matthew Marks, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com; closes today. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'GIFTS GO IN ONE DIRECTION' With art selling so briskly these days, isn't it time for the art world to hand out some gift bags, some freebies? After all, artists, as members of an intensively networked and mutually supportive community, have been giving one another gifts. That is the subject of this charming summer show, which takes the form of a round-robin of generosity, with artists on both the giving and receiving ends. Apexart, 291 Church Street, near Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>A RABBIT AS KING OF THE GHOSTS With a title lifted from Wallace Stevens, this elegant show posits photography as the leading ghost in the machine of contemporary art and draws visually telling analogies from 140 years of the medium's life span. It has been organized by the photographers Justine Kurland and Dan Torop. Mitchell-Innes &amp; Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com; closes today. (Smith)</p>
        <p>TWO FRIENDS AND SO ON Selected by asking one artist to invite another, who asked another, until a group of 30 had accrued, this show winds from Conceptual-based work through abstract painting and sculpture, and back again, presenting a random cross-section of the art world and displaying a network of style-based alliances. It is a quite a ride. Andrew Kreps Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
