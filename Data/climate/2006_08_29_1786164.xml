        <p>The Discomfort Zone  A Personal History  By Jonathan Franzen  195 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $22.</p>
        <p>The central characters in Jonathan Franzen's critically acclaimed 2001 best seller, ''The Corrections,'' were an especially unpleasant lot: the hero was a pretentious disciple of Foucault and Marx, a hypocrite who ranted about the commercialized world while maxing out his Visa card on expensive wines; his sister was an obnoxiously competitive hipster; and their older brother was a bossy, elitist yuppie, given to paranoia, anger and depression.</p>
        <p>In his new memoir, ''The Discomfort Zone,'' Mr. Franzen turns his unforgiving eye on himself and succeeds in giving us an odious self-portrait of the artist as a young jackass: petulant, pompous, obsessive, selfish and overwhelmingly self-absorbed. He tells us that as a child he was ''a small glutton for attention, forever turning conversations to the subject of myself.'' He tells us that he felt put upon by public entreaties to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina. (''Why should I pony up for this particular disaster?'') And he tells us that he used to find it difficult to enjoy nature's beauty: a hike up to a spectacular summit was never enough; instead he would imagine himself ''in a movie with this vista in the background and various girls I'd known in high school and college watching the movie and being impressed with me.''</p>
        <p>While some readers will want to give Mr. Franzen points for being so revealing about himself, there is something oddly preening about his self-inventory of sins, as though he actually reveled in being so disagreeable. And while it doubtless takes a degree of self-absorption for anyone to write a memoir, in the case of this book the author's self-involvement not only makes for an incredibly annoying portrait, but also funnels the narrative into a dismayingly narrow channel.</p>
        <p>In fact Mr. Franzen is so focused on talking about his younger self that he fails (with one or two exceptions) to make other people come alive. His family -- which seems to have provided considerable fodder for the dysfunctional family in ''The Corrections'' -- emerges as a blur: his parents are sketched in a desultory fashion in these pages; his siblings are drawn in an equally offhand manner. The town of Webster Groves where he grew up -- ''in the middle of the country in the middle of the golden age of the American middle class'' -- is rendered with a lot less detail than the Midwestern suburb conjured up in ''The Corrections,'' and his later peregrinations around the country feel strangely disembodied as well.</p>
        <p>There are two extended riffs in this volume where Mr. Franzen momentarily puts aside his fascination with himself to give the reader some wonderfully observed musings on two subjects that have long preoccupied him: Peanuts cartoons and bird-watching.</p>
        <p>He makes the delights of sighting a rare masked duck or whooping crane palpable to even the most bird-agnostic of readers, conveying the solitary rituals of bird-watching, before he abruptly wearies of the pastime, having booked sightings of 400 different types. He similarly captures the appeal of Charles Schulz's comic creations: the perpetual loser-dom of Charlie Brown, Snoopy's ''confidence that he's lovable at heart,'' the ''Beethoven-sized ambitions'' of Schroeder.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Franzen undermines his sensitively observed analysis of Peanuts by adding that he ''personally enjoyed winning and couldn't see why so much fuss was made about the losers'' like Charlie Brown. He proceeds to recount his showdown in a Homonym Spelldown with another student named Chris Toczko, writing that ''I was a nice enough little boy as long as you kept away from my turf'' and that Toczko made the terrible mistake of being unaware of the fact that ''I, not he, by natural right, was the best student in the class.''</p>
        <p>Indeed the young Mr. Franzen comes across as less of a Snoopy -- ''the warm puppy who amused the others with the cute things he said and then excused himself from the table and wrote cute sentences in his notebook'' -- than as a kind of mean-spirited Lucy on steroids. He describes how he once ''dropped a frog into a campfire and watched it shrivel and roll down the flat side of a log.'' He describes reasoning that ''not having kids freed me altogether'' from having to worry about things like global warming: ''Not having kids was my last, best line of defense against the likes of Al Gore.'' And he describes the judgmental outlook that he and his wife shared for many years: ''Deploring other people -- their lack of perfection -- had always been our sport.''</p>
        <p>As described here, that marriage sounds like another hellish exercise in self-absorption. Mr. Franzen writes that he and his wife ''lived on our own little planet,'' spending ''superhuman amounts of time by ourselves.'' He fills his journals with transcripts of fights they've had, and writes that they both ''reacted to minor fights at breakfast by lying facedown on the floor of our respective rooms for hours at a time, waiting for acknowledgment of our pain.'' ''I wrote poisonous jeremiads to family members who I felt had slighted my wife,'' he adds, while ''she presented me with handwritten fifteen-and twenty page analyses of our condition; I was putting away a bottle of Maalox every week.''</p>
        <p>Just why anyone would be interested in pages and pages about this unhappy relationship or the self-important and self-promoting contents of Mr. Franzen's mind remains something of a mystery. In fact, by the end of this solipsistic book, the reader has begun to feel every bit as suffocated and claustrophobic as Mr. Franzen and his estranged wife apparently did in their doomed marriage.</p>
