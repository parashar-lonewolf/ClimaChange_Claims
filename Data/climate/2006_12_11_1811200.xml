        <p>Senator Barack Obama visited the key campaign state selling a message of hope but proclaiming himself wary of the “hype” surrounding him.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Senator Barack Obama came to New Hampshire for the first time in his life on Sunday, selling a message of hope while proclaiming himself wary of the wave of hype that surrounded his visit.</p>
        <p>His visit gave Democrats in two sold-out halls a chance to inspect the man who has emerged as their party's strongest alternative to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as a presidential contender.</p>
        <p>''It is flattering to get a lot of attention, although I must say it is baffling,'' Mr. Obama said here late Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I think to some degree I've become a shorthand or symbol or stand-in for a spirit that the last election in New Hampshire represented,'' he said, referring to the losses of two incumbent congressmen here in November. ''It's a spirit that says we are looking for something different -- we want something new.''</p>
        <p>What New Hampshire saw was a first-term senator from Illinois who offered a strong condemnation of the way politics have been conducted in Washington and who positioned himself as someone who could strongly appeal to the more liberal Democrats who tend to dominate primaries. In two speeches and a news conference, Mr. Obama called for universal health care -- the issue with which Mrs. Clinton, the New York Democrat, was once closely identified -- a battle on global warming and a timed redeployment of troops from Iraq.</p>
        <p>But most of all, Mr. Obama -- tieless and grinning broadly as he encountered the kind of reception typically afforded a movie star -- talked about what he decried as a toxically partisan atmosphere in Washington, clearly signaling a central theme of a presidential campaign by this newcomer to the national political stage.</p>
        <p>''We've come to be consumed by a 24-hour, slash-and-burn, negative ad, bickering, small-minded politics that doesn't move us forward,'' he said in Portsmouth, emphasizing that both parties were at fault. ''Sometimes one side is up and the other side is down. But there's no sense that they are coming together in a common-sense, practical, nonideological way to solve the problems that we face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Obama, 45, said he had not decided if he would actually run for president, saying he was running it ''through the traps.'' But his appearance here -- two years before the 2008 presidential election, in the state with the nation's first primary -- was nothing short of a spectacle.</p>
        <p>His two public events -- a book signing in Portsmouth and a victory rally for the New Hampshire Democratic Party here -- sold out days ago. A total of 2,500 people turned out to see him, including 1,500 who paid $25 each to attend the rally.</p>
        <p>''We originally scheduled the Rolling Stones, but we canceled them when we figured out that Senator Obama would sell more tickets,'' Gov. John Lynch said.</p>
        <p>In Portsmouth, he walked into the room to an explosion of camera flashes and a prolonged standing ovation. After his speech, hundreds of people waited more than an hour for Mr. Obama to sign a copy of his latest book, ''The Audacity of Hope.'' And 150 members of the news media received credentials to cover his visit, as Mr. Obama realized when he loped before a wall of reporters and cameras for a news conference.</p>
        <p>''Hey everybody, my name is Barack Obama,'' he said. ''And it must be a slow news day.''</p>
        <p>Turning serious, he said: ''I will say this: I am suspicious of hype. The fact that I've become, that my 15 minutes of fame has extended a little longer than 15 minutes, is somewhat surprising to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Obama said he believed he had become a symbol of the voters' desire for new faces and a new tone in Washington. ''Whether it's me or someone else, what is most important -- and over the long-term most newsworthy -- is that desire on the part of the voters.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, Democrats long acquainted with New Hampshire politics were stunned to walk into a ballroom at the Center of New Hampshire here and see signs proclaiming the event sold out. ''I've never seen anything like this before this early,'' said Mike Ballantine, a computer programmer from Nashua, as across the room Mr. Obama was surrounded by more than 100 people, many holding up his book and hoping for an autograph. ''I mean it's amazing. Really amazing.''</p>
        <p>And the reality of Mr. Obama -- as opposed to what people had read or seen in weeks of extraordinarily favorable coverage -- struck a chord with some. ''I was very impressed with the fact that he wants to bring people together,'' said Betsy Shultis, a former state representative. ''I was very taken with him.''</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Fairchild, 37, of Rye, N.H., said: ''I thought he was fantastic. He exceeded my expectations.''</p>
        <p>But other Democrats said they thought that someone with Mr. Obama's experience had little chance of winning a national election.</p>
        <p>''I've looked through his book, and he barely touches issues,'' said Robert Padian, 59, an unemployed database administrator. ''I think he's a serious candidate, but I don't think he has great potential. No track record, and there are too many guys ahead of him in line.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Obama told reporters that he expected questions about his experience and qualifications. If he did run, he said, ''at the end of the process people will know me pretty well, and they'll have a pretty good sense of whether I am qualified or not.''</p>
