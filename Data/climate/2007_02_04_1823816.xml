        <p>In its fourth assessment of global warming, released Friday, the leading international network of climate change scientists used the strongest language yet in drawing a link between human activity and recent warming. In its current report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change notes that using the term ''very likely'' indicates a likelihood of more than 90 percent. Here is how the reports have evolved.</p>
