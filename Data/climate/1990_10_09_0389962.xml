        <p>LEAD: A Congressional conference committee rewriting the Clean Air Act is deadlocked over a proposal to limit state enforcement of auto emission standards, raising the possibility that Congress will not finish the bill this year, some Senate conferees say.</p>
        <p>A Congressional conference committee rewriting the Clean Air Act is deadlocked over a proposal to limit state enforcement of auto emission standards, raising the possibility that Congress will not finish the bill this year, some Senate conferees say.</p>
        <p>''This conference is in trouble if this provision stays in place,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat and a member of the Senate delegation. ''The subject is not in either bill and was suddenly presented to us at the last minute.''</p>
        <p>At issue is a section in the current clean air law that allows states to establish and enforce auto emission regulations as strict as California's, which require auto companies to equip cars sold in that state with cleaner engines. Late last month, Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat of Michigan and leader of the House delegation to the conference, proposed changing the section to make the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, instead of states, responsible for enforcing the stricter regulations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell said the change was necessary to prevent auto companies from having to design different engines to comply with each state's requirements. Critics of the measure, including many of the Senate negotiators and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, said the E.P.A. had failed to enforce Federal standards to control tailpipe emissions and could not be expected to enforce more stringent requirements. New York adopted the California standards on Sept. 27. #4 Meetings Since July ''I have been chairman of this committee for 10 years,'' Mr. Dingell said in an interview, ''and I have sat in on scores of hearings. I have never heard a state raise a single question about the failure of E.P.A. to adequately enforce automobile emissions.'' He added that the amendment had been unanimously approved by the 26 principal House conferees.</p>
        <p>Critics assert that Mr. Dingell is using the amendment to delay consideration on a final measure until the last moment, when lawmakers would face either accepting the amendment and other provisions he wants or seeing the bill die after nearly two years of work. Mr. Dingell responded: ''I reject out of hand any assertion or assumption that I am in any way delaying the process in this matter. I want a bill this year.''</p>
        <p>The struggle over Mr. Dingell's amendment is emblematic of the difficulties the conference committee is having in negotiations on the 20-year-old Clean Air Act. Since the House-Senate Conference Committee convened on July 13, the panel has met four times, said staff members. The last meeting, in September, began with shouting matches.</p>
        <p>''We still haven't dealt with the basic reason of the Clean Air Act, and that's acid rain,'' said Senator Alan Simpson, a Republican of Wyoming and Senate conferee, adding, ''The thing that's vexing is that I've been to a lot of conferences, and I've never seen one that's met less together.''</p>
        <p>Senators in the conference have expressed concern that the panel might not finish before Oct. 19, when Congress is scheduled to adjourn.</p>
        <p>Staff members said Mr. Dingell and Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana and head of the Senate delegation, worked over the weekend on the auto emissions section but were unable to resolve the dispute over enforcement. Staff members said they did not know when the full conference would next meet.</p>
        <p>Difficulties Ahead</p>
        <p>''If you're asking are there a lot of problems ahead, the answer is yes,'' said Senator John H. Chafee, a Republican of Rhode Island. ''I don't want to say we can't do it this year.''</p>
        <p>Few conference committees have been asked to resolve differences as sweeping, technically complex, and potentially costly as the separate clean air bills passed earlier this year by the House and Senate. Both versions broaden the authority of the Federal and state Governments to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants from virtually every industry in the United States, tens of thousands of small businesses, and from millions of new vehicles. The Bush Administration has estimated that the cost of developing and installing new pollution controls, along with changing manufacturing practices to meet the new requirements, could cost $35 billion annually.</p>
        <p>Difficulties Ahead</p>
        <p>Since July, the conferees have resolved most of their differences on three of the act's eight titles. Agreement was reached on new regulations for reducing air pollution in cities, eliminating the use of chemicals that cause depletion of ozone in the upper atmosphere, and rules for regulating emissions from industrial smokestacks and other so-called ''stationary sources'' of air pollution.</p>
        <p>But some of the most difficult provisions are still to be resolved, including controls on acid rain, vehicle emissions and factory emissions of 190 cancer-causing chemicals.</p>
        <p>Senator Baucus said the dispute over Mr. Dingell's proposal could be resolved as long as both sides recognize there is a common goal.</p>
        <p>''The key here is to allow states to fully adopt the California program in any way they choose in a way that does not force automobile companies to have to build three or four different kinds of cars,'' Senator Baucus said. ''It's complicated stuff. It's kabuki. Each side is playing its role. But when the curtain falls, we will have a clean air law.''</p>
