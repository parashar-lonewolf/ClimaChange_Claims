        <p>HOPING to cash in on the lucrative American taste for Beaujolais nouveau, Italy wants America to discover vino novello.</p>
        <p>So, with rivalry in mind, Italy beat France to the corkscrew last week by showing its new wine in New York on Tuesday, two days before the 1991 Beaujolais nouveau landed.</p>
        <p>Whether this dry red wine will find a new world of customers remains uncertain. Only a small quantity from the 1991 harvest will be imported nationwide. Big holiday sales would be nice, but for now the hope is to "draw attention to the genre," said Giorgio Lulli, the deputy Italian trade commissioner in charge of wine.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, the Italian Trade Commission in New York sponsored "the biggest survey of vini novelli ever mounted in the United States": a tasting of 90 wines from 86 producers in 11 regions, which included the Veneto, Tuscany, Piedmont, Trentino-Alto Adige, Emilia-Romagna and Friuli-Venezia Giulia.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, Georges Duboeuf, whom the wine world has crowned the king of Beaujolais, paid a state visit to New York to introduce his simple '91 nouveau and richer Beaujolais-Villages nouveau.</p>
        <p>His importer, William J. Deutsch, in effect threw down the gauntlet to Italy when he told guests at a wine trade luncheon that Air France had flown in more than 150,000 bottles of Duboeuf vin nouveau. (More will be arriving by boat this month and next.)</p>
        <p>The trade commission acknowledges it would take a few years to sell that much in America. But the 11 million bottles of '91 vini novelli made in Italy suggest potential popularity.</p>
        <p>Vino novello is one of the fastest growing categories of wine in Italy, according to Burton Anderson, an authority on Italian wines. Last year, Mr. Anderson wrote, 1.2 million bottles were exported, some to a growing market in Japan. And last year, France sold $23 million worth of nouveau in the United States.</p>
        <p>Why is Frank Gentile, an owner of Vintwood International, a Huntington, L.I., company that imports wine, optimistic about vini novelli in America? Because the Canadians and Germans have developed a taste for them and buy plenty, he says. Now and then, they have been offered in the United States, with spotty results, other importers say.</p>
        <p>Universally, vin nouveau is synonymous with the charming purple drink born from the gamay grape within days of the Beaujolais harvest. To capture the fragrant, gushy aromas and flavors, winemakers in the region ferment whole grapes under a carbon dioxide blanket in a tank.</p>
        <p>This technique, carbonic maceration, has caught on in Italy. Some vini novelli imitate the flavor and style of Beaujolais nouveau. But the Italians also use many different grapes and other methods. Some make red wines in ways that extend their life spans well beyond the two to three months expected of nouveau. Some even make novello bianco (white).</p>
        <p>The tastiest vini novelli, best drunk slightly cool, roll onto the tongue as roundly and softly as the names of their grapes roll off it: barbera, brunello, canaiolo, ciliegiolo, dolcetto, grignolino, nebbiolo, refosco, sangiovese and teroldego. More familiarly, gamay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and pinot noir also turn up.</p>
        <p>Of the vini novelli soon to be found in stores and restaurants, one of the prettiest, best-tasting was Cavit's Terrazze Della Luna Novello di Teroldego (about $9.50).</p>
        <p>The typically light red wines of the Veneto's Bardolino district lend themselves to delightful vini novelli. One was Folonari's amiable, berrylike Bardolino Novello ($8). Giorgio Lungarotti's Falo Novello Rosso Dell'Umbria ($6.75), fruity and meaty, has enough tannin to outlive many '91 peers.</p>
        <p>Two famous wines that started Italy's vino novello romance in the mid-1970's were absent: Angelo Gaja's Vinot from Piedmont, which is sold only in Italy, and Antinori's San Giocondo, from Tuscany, sold only in Europe where demand exists.</p>
        <p>Does Mr. Duboeuf fear competition from vini novelli? "Many people all over the world have tried to make wine like Champagne," he said. "But nobody has succeeded in making a real Champagne the way France does. For Beaujolais nouveau, it's the same thing."</p>
