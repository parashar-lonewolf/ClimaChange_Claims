        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman directly confronted the anger roiling the Democratic Party over Iraq yesterday, making a last-ditch attempt to explain his support for the war and to win back doubting voters in Connecticut before the state primary election tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Using his strongest language of the campaign in a speech that might well determine his political fate, Mr. Lieberman essentially offered a new set of talking points for Democratic leaders who are struggling for the right words to reconcile their support for the war initially and the fiery antiwar views of many Democratic voters today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said that while he believed his vote to authorize the war in 2002 was correct, he now felt a ''heavy responsibility'' to end the war quickly. He said he wanted to withdraw American troops ''as fast as anyone,'' yet insisted that leaving Iraq now would be a ''disaster'' that could worsen the sectarian violence there. And while President Bush may share that view, he added, Connecticut voters were free not to.</p>
        <p>''I not only respect your right to disagree or question the president or anyone else, including me, I value your right to disagree,'' he said at a community center in East Haven.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman's bid for a fourth term has become a bellwether campaign for the Democratic Party nationally as it seeks maximum political advantage -- and protection -- on Iraq in the 2006 midterm election and in the 2008 presidential race.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Lieberman faces a particularly perilous challenge from an antiwar Democratic challenger, Ned Lamont, other Democratic senators up for re-election this year -- from Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York to Maria Cantwell in Washington State -- are facing questions and some criticism about where they have stood, and stand now, on the Iraq war.</p>
        <p>Recent public opinion polls show Mr. Lamont, a multimillionaire cable executive from Greenwich, with a lead of 10 to 13 percentage points over Mr. Lieberman, who was his party's nominee for vice president in 2000 and sought the Democratic nomination for president in 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont has surged in front in the last two weeks, as he has persistently thumped Mr. Lieberman as a war supporter and Bush ally.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Lieberman sought to distance himself from the president and the White House war policy, while also standing his ground and making a plea for bipartisanship.</p>
        <p>''I understand that many Democrats in Connecticut disagree with me and are angry about the war,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''For some of them, I don't think there is anything I can say to change your mind about whether we should have gone to war or when we should bring the troops home, and to a certain extent and to a real extent, at this point I'm not going to insult you by trying.''</p>
        <p>He said he was not President Bush's ''best friend and enabler,'' contrary to some sound bites from television commercials by the Lamont campaign, and noted that former President Bill Clinton and other prominent party leaders had endorsed him.</p>
        <p>''Do you think any of those people would be supporting me if they really thought I was an enabler for George Bush?'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Give me a break.''</p>
        <p>Ticking off his disagreements with the president, from stem-cell research and global warming to the number of American troops in Iraq, Mr. Lieberman noted at the same time that he believed in working with Republicans on mutual goals, like creating jobs in Connecticut and investigating the 9/11 attacks.</p>
        <p>''That's something that distinguishes me from my opponent in this race; I don't hate Republicans,'' he said. ''I know that sometimes in the United States Senate the best way to deliver for the people who sent me to Washington is to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. And I'll tell you this: that doesn't make me a bad Democrat, it makes me a better senator.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has long considered his moderate brand of politics and his independent streak as assets, but it appears, from interviews with voters and from the polls, that likely Democratic primary voters are looking for a little more partisan passion from their Senate candidate in this election.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some Democratic voters reacted especially poorly to Mr. Lieberman's announcement last month that he would run for re-election as an independent this fall if Mr. Lamont won the Democratic primary tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Advisers to Mr. Lieberman said yesterday that he still planned to run as an independent if he loses to Mr. Lamont; current polls show that Mr. Lieberman would beat Mr. Lamont and the Republican candidate, Alan Schlesinger.</p>
        <p>As a way to win nomination and avoid the independent route, Mr. Lieberman had been under pressure from some of his own advisers to deliver a speech like the one he gave last evening, as both a peace offering to antiwar critics and an impassioned appeal to fence-sitting Democrats.</p>
        <p>As late as Saturday night, Lieberman advisers said, it was not certain if Mr. Lieberman would deliver such remarks or stick to his stump speech that included Iraq but did not dwell on it.</p>
        <p>By yesterday afternoon his advisers -- led by Dan Gerstein, a former Lieberman aide and New York Democratic operative -- were furiously writing and rewriting it, while Lamont aides prepared their own rebuttal to try to neutralize any positive effect that the speech might have for Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman accused Mr. Lamont's campaign of using ''lies'' and ''bogus charges'' to try to defeat him. He made his remarks alongside Max Cleland, the former Democratic senator of Georgia, who was defeated for re-election in 2002 after Republicans paired him in ads with Osama bin Laden because he had opposed some domestic security measures.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has done his best to distort my record, spending more than $4 million of his own money to mislead people -- or try to -- into thinking that I am someone I am not,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''This is not unlike what the Republicans did to Max Cleland four years ago.''</p>
        <p>The defeat of Mr. Cleland, a Vietnam veteran and triple amputee, became a sore point for Democrats and a rallying cry for John Kerry in his presidential race in 2004.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cleland, a sharp critic of President Bush's war policy, said that he supported Mr. Lieberman in spite of their differences on the war, and added that the senator was feeling ''tremendous pressure'' over Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Joe and I see things a little differently, but the end is the same, the country belongs to the Iraqis,'' Mr. Cleland said.</p>
        <p>Lamont aides, in a statement last night, said Mr. Lieberman did a ''great disservice'' to Connecticut voters because his remarks were so sharply critical of Mr. Lamont.</p>
        <p>''The senator has finally chosen to talk about issues but we can't help but notice that, like Karl Rove, he has chosen to appeal to people's fears,'' the Lamont statement read. ''Our campaign has focused on the issues and Joe Lieberman's record as a senator. Joe's campaign has consisted of personal and false attacks about Ned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Lamont began the final Sunday of their primary race reaching out to voters at church, and they and their allies also appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows to make closing arguments for their candidacies.</p>
        <p>In a taped segment on ABC News's ''This Week with George Stephanopoulos,'' Mr. Lieberman said he believed he had been ''scapegoated'' on Iraq.</p>
        <p>He also said that Mr. Lamont was a ''center right Democrat'' and not as liberal as Mr. Lamont's antiwar message might suggest. He noted that Mr. Lamont, as a Democratic selectman in Greenwich, frequently cast the same votes as the two other board members, who were Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont, who supports expanding the federal government's role in education and health care, was asked during his own segment on the show if he was a liberal.</p>
        <p>''I am a liberal. But when I mean a liberal, I think a progressive,'' Mr. Lamont said. ''I think, if you're an entrepreneur in business, you see a problem, you want to address it head on; you want to solve it, I think, then you're a progressive in government.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman stopped at churches in Stamford and Bridgeport, where the preachers invoked faith to say that Mr. Lieberman would be nominated tomorrow. At the Congregation of the Community Tabernacle of Deliverance in Stamford, one preacher spoke of the biblical character of Joseph, who he said ''refused to sell out to the haters.''</p>
        <p>A few moments later, Mr. Lieberman added, ''Joseph had faith that God will take care of the haters, and I have a certain faith that this Tuesday God will take care of the voters.''</p>
        <p>When one preacher at the Bridgeport church asked, ''Anybody going through hell right now?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman leaned over to tap a woman sitting to his left and began to nod his head with a smile.</p>
