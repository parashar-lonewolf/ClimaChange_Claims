        <p>LEAD: Senate leaders, responding to public criticism of the recommendation to increase Congressional pay by 50 percent, agreed today to schedule a vote within the next month on whether to reject the pay increase.</p>
        <p>Senate leaders, responding to public criticism of the recommendation to increase Congressional pay by 50 percent, agreed today to schedule a vote within the next month on whether to reject the pay increase.</p>
        <p>Such a vote, however, could prove to be little more than symbolic since no similar action is planned thus far by the House leadership. Unless both chambers agree to reject a proposed raise, it would automatically take effect.</p>
        <p>The agreement came as the House and Senate met in joint session to carry out the constitutional ritual of tallying the Electoral College vote and certifying the election of George Bush as the 41st President of the United States. Mr. Bush, who as Vice President presided over the vote counting, became the first President-elect since Martin Van Buren in 1837 to announce his own victory.</p>
        <p>The ceremony, which was to have been the focal point of Congressional activity today, was overshadowed by news of the clash between American and Libyan forces early this morning in the Mediterranean. Lawmakers were generally supportive of the American action and were briefed on it in detail by Pentagon officials who came to Capitol Hill this afternoon. Pay to Be an Early Issue</p>
        <p>After today's session, Congress will be in recess until Jan. 20, the day of Mr. Bush's inauguration, and then, after receiving nominations from the new President, break again until Jan. 25 when the real work of the legislative session will begin. One of the first orders of business in the Senate will be the question of the pay increase, a political quagmire that Congress had hoped to avoid by establishing an independent commission to recommend pay levels for senior Government officials.</p>
        <p>While the struggle to cut some $40 billion from the Federal deficit is all but certain to dominate this year's Congressional session, lawmakers in both parties have also mapped out preliminary legislative agendas that cover issues ranging from an overhaul of housing programs to campaign financing and acid rain.</p>
        <p>Tax committees have already scheduled hearings to examine the proliferation of company mergers and acquisitions financed with borrowed money.</p>
        <p>Congress will again attempt to tackle the question of Federal support for child care and a proposed increase in the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, announced the plan for a Senate vote on the pay increase after separate meetings today of Senate Democrats and Republicans in which lawmakers expressed their concerns about the appearance of accepting a raise at a time when Congress will be struggling to reduce the deficit.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, expressing a sentiment widely held by senators in both parties, said, ''How do we say no to every region of the country on increases in Federal programs come March and April if the first thing out of the box is a pay raise?'' $135,000 Salaries Suggested A nine-member bipartisan commission composed of former members of Congress, lawyers and business executives recommended to President Reagan last month that the salaries of Federal judges, senior officials in the executive branch and members of Congress be increased. It recommended raises to $135,000 a year from the current $89,500 for members of Congress. As part of the package, the commission also recommended that the fees lawmakers receive for speeches and appearances before private groups be abolished.</p>
        <p>Under current rules, House members can receive up to 30 percent of their annual salary in honorariums, or $26,850, and Senators can receive up to 40 percent, or $35,800. Mr. Reagan will make his own suggestion for the size of a pay increase in the budget he submits to Congress next week, and it is that figure that lawmakers have 30 days to reject.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell said, ''I believe we should abolish honoraria, enact a comprehensive ethics bill that covers Congress and at the same time provide some increase in compensation to make up for the elimination of honoraria.'' He said he had not decided on the specific amount of a pay increase that he would support. Wright Awaits Proposal</p>
        <p>Asked how the House would respond to the pay increase, Speaker Jim Wright of Texas would only say that he wanted to wait and see the President's proposal. The Speaker has previously said that he would support a pay increase and the abolition of honoraria.</p>
        <p>Representative William H. Gray 3d, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, scoffed at the Senate's plan for a rejection vote. ''Looking at the number of millionaires over there, I understand that,'' he said. Mr. Gray said he supported a pay increase because of the expenses House members incur in maintaining residences here and in their home states.</p>
