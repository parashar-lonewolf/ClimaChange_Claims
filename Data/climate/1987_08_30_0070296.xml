        <p>LEAD: From a distance, the galvanized-steel roofs of this mountain village glint invitingly to the weary traveler. But upon arrival, it becomes painfully clear that Nios is an African ghost town.</p>
        <p>From a distance, the galvanized-steel roofs of this mountain village glint invitingly to the weary traveler. But upon arrival, it becomes painfully clear that Nios is an African ghost town.</p>
        <p>Overripe guavas rot on the ground. Lush vegetation climbs through house windows. A door, pried open by scavengers, hangs motionless in the torpor of a Central African afternoon.</p>
        <p>Last year, as Nios slept on the night of Aug. 21, a cloud of carbon dioxide burst from the waters of Lake Nios, a nearby volcanic lake. #1,750 People Asphyxiated The cloud, estimated by scientists to be nearly one cubic mile in size, poured silently through mountain valleys at speeds up to 40 miles an hour. Within minutes, about 1,750 people were asphyxiated, including almost all of the 1,300 inhabitants of Nios. The poisonous cloud also took a devastating toll on livestock.</p>
        <p>This week, about 4,500 survivors of surrounding villages marked their first anniversary of life in tent camps. With the onset of the second rainy season in a year, many tents are starting to leak.</p>
        <p>Cameroon officials have yet to decide whether to resettle the refugees or to return them to their villages. Behind the official paralysis is a bitter squabble between French and American scientists over the mysterious origin of the gas.</p>
        <p>The French say the gas was released by a volcanic explosion. Arguing that such eruptions are impossible to predict and are extremely rare in Cameroon, they say it is safe to return to the Lake Nios area. Area Is Called Unsafe</p>
        <p>The Americans argue that underwater volcanic vents steadily feed an already dangerous level of gas in the lake bottom. They say the area is unsafe.</p>
        <p>Last month, the leading exponent of the French theory, Haroun Tazieff, angrily stalked out of a meeting at an international conference held on Lake Nios in Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.</p>
        <p>Charging that the conference sided ''with the other school of thought,'' as one scientist put it, the French volcanologists organized a counterconference in Paris in June.</p>
        <p>Today, officials at the French and American Embassies in Yaounde only distribute copies of Lake Nios reports prepared by their own nationals.</p>
        <p>Caught in the middle are the refugees - peasant farmers and cattle herders. 'I Want to Work'</p>
        <p>''I want to do something with my hands; I want to work my coffee again,'' one refugee, Pipang Ngong, said as a chill downpour swept around his tent at a camp in Wum.</p>
        <p>The canvas tent, one of 250 donated last year by the United States, does not leak. But many tents, especially those donated by the Red Cross, have started to disintegrate, according to Fred Tenhorn, a Dutch Catholic missionary who runs the camp.</p>
        <p>The missionary said that some survivors want to go home. ''They don't see the gas as a problem of nature, but as something caused by an enemy,'' he said. ''They say, 'Whoever caused this will come back to try to get us wherever we go.' ''</p>
        <p>A Cameroon Army lieutenant, Roger Mvogo Nzdana, has the job of keeping the would-be returnees out of a 10-mile radius around Lake Nios. 'The Lake of Death'</p>
        <p>''It's a closed zone, but some people manage to slip in,'' he said as he piloted a small rubber raft across the still waters of what Cameroon's newspapers call ''the lake of death.''</p>
        <p>Rimmed by stiff quartzite cliffs that alternate with low beaches of black volcanic ash, the blue waters of this crater lake would be, in different circumstances, a wilderness lover's dream.</p>
        <p>Located in a remote range of volancoes 30 miles from the Nigerian border, Lake Nios is reached by driving five hours on rugged dirt roads and then hiking one hour to the shoulder-high grasses of western Cameroon's wooded savannah.</p>
        <p>Along the way, a few clues reveal that the 1.2-mile-long lake is different from the numerous other high-altitude lakes in the area. The trail to the lake is marked by sun-bleached bones, testimony to the estimated 3,000 cattle that died in the disaster.</p>
        <p>At the lake, sophisticated instruments closely monitor water temperature and register seismic shocks. Rumbling and Reddish Sparks</p>
        <p>Last Dec. 30, a series of three explosions from the lake startled a French scientist and a group of Cameroonian soldiers camped nearby. ''There was this rumbling, and then reddish sparks over the water,'' recalled the lieutenant, who was there at the time. ''Everyone ran up into the hills as fast as possible.''</p>
        <p>To render the area habitable again, American scientists, led by Edward J. Koenigsberg of the Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, have proposed a ''controlled degassing'' of Lake Nios.</p>
        <p>One method calls for strategically inserting five tubes in the 680-foot-deep lake to vent off the gas. A cruder method calls for draining much of the lake by blowing up a weak natural dam of volcanic ash.</p>
        <p>Cameroon has 33 volcanic lakes, but only Lake Nios and Lake Monoun contain dangerous levels of carbon dioxide, according to an American study released in June. Situated 40 miles south of here, Lake Monoun released a cloud of gas in October 1984 that killed 37 people.</p>
