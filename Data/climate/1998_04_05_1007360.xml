        <p>TWO years ago, the young composer and lyricist Adam Guettel teamed up with the director Tina Landau and presented ''Floyd Collins,'' a chamber opera at Playwrights Horizons, about a 1920's cave explorer. Although reviews were mixed, critics much admired Mr. Guettel's score, and Nonesuch ultimately recorded it.</p>
        <p>Reviewing the CD last year, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that, ''with the possible exception of Bob Telson, Adam Guettel is the most artistically promising American theater composer.''</p>
        <p>This time around, Mr. Guettel and Ms. Landau are offering ''Saturn Returns: A Concert'' at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, opening on Thursday. Something of a song cycle without a story, it is based on myths and hymn texts with words and music by Mr. Guettel. The composer explained his framing device as a quest for spiritual meaning in a secular world: ''I want, I hunger for something, but I don't know what it is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The musical styles veer from hip-hop to plain chant and hallelujah shouters, and the six performers under Ms. Landau's direction are Vivian Cherry, Lawrence Clayton, Annie Golden, Jose Llana, Theresa McCarthy and Bob Stillman.</p>
        <p>Here are the lyrics for ''Icarus,'' which is set to a bossa nova beat.  Chorus: Icarus was not an achiever.  Always resented what his father could do.  Was sick and tired of the hullabaloo:  When would he ever make his mark?</p>
        <p>Icarus was not a believer.  His father trusted him and took it for granted  That he would turn out to be just as enchanted;  That all he needed was some help getting off the ground.</p>
        <p>Father: Put these on  And learn to fly a course above the ocean.  Test your strength.  Learn to change the angle of your wing.  But Icarus,  Fly beneath me shaded from the sun.</p>
        <p>Unlimited altitude  Will heat up your wings and they'll come unglued.  Of the sun, you must beware  When you're gliding through the air.  You have to try to stay in my shadow.</p>
        <p>Chorus: Icarus could see the potential,  Aerodynamic mythological coup,  Of being the only flying demigod who  Dared to land on the sun.</p>
        <p>Icarus could see the credential  And face the glory of the journey ahead.  The light reflected off his wings when they spread.  He started singing when his feet only found air.</p>
        <p>Icarus: Look at me.  I'm going to be the stuff that myths are made of.  Divine event;  The kind of myth that makes a masquerade of a father.  Over him  I'll cast a shadow broader than the sun.</p>
        <p>Unlimited altitude;  I like to navigate in the nude,  Breezes blowing through my hair,  While I ride the dunes of air.  I think I'll let him fly in my shadow.</p>
        <p>Chorus: He didn't try to get his ears to pop.  He liked the atmospheric pressure drop.  The sky around him and the earth below,  Earth below.  Earth below.</p>
        <p>Icarus: Look at me.  I'm going to be the stuff that myths are made of.  Divine event;  The kind of myths that make a masquerade of a father.  Over him  I'll cast a shadow broader than the sun.</p>
        <p>Unlimited altitude;  The ozone layer is rainbow-hued.  Nimbus cloud about my head,  I think I'll wear it in my father's stead.</p>
        <p>All: I think the air is getting thin.</p>
        <p>Icarus: Look at me.  I'm going to be the stuff that myths are made of.  Divine event;  The kind of myth that makes a masquerade of a father.  Over him  I'll cast a shadow broader than the sun.</p>
