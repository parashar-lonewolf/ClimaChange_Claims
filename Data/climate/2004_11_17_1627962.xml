        <p>The United States and 13 other countries signed an agreement on Tuesday to work together to capture emissions of methane, a gas that contributes to global warming and, as the main component of natural gas, is a relatively clean-burning fuel.</p>
        <p>It makes up 16 percent of the heat-trapping emissions that nearly all climate scientists have linked to global warming, a distant second only to carbon dioxide at 74 percent.</p>
        <p>The United States is underwriting some of the costs of the nonbinding methane agreement, $53 million over five years. It calls on the participating industrialized countries to help poorer countries capture and market methane leaking from countries to use American expertise to develop methods of capturing the gas from landfills, coal mines and oil and gas operations.</p>
        <p>The gas would then be sold for energy.</p>
        <p>Michael O. Leavitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, said the agreement was an important step that would lead to ''an environmental and economic harvest'' for participating countries. The goal is to capture nine million tons of methane a year by 2015.</p>
        <p>The agreement won support from both industry and environmental groups. But it also provoked comments about the fact that the Bush administration declined to sign the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty that will take effect early in 2005. That pact requires adherents to reduce heat-trapping gases; the Bush administration by contrast has pursued only voluntary measures for stemming the increase of such emissions.</p>
        <p>''It's useful,'' David D. Doniger, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the new pact on methane. ''But compared to the problem that's being ignored, it's small potatoes.''</p>
        <p>Similar criticism came from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who used a Senate hearing on Tuesday to criticize the administration's policy on climate change, calling it ''disgraceful.''</p>
        <p>James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality, insisted that the administration had supported a number of programs to harness the rise of carbon dioxide emissions, including efforts to expand land conservation and to develop advanced hybrid vehicles.</p>
        <p>Frank Maisano, an energy industry lobbyist, praised the administration effort because developing countries like India and China were included. ''One of the big arguments about climate change is that developing nations never want to participate,'' Mr. Maisano said. ''The fact that they are signing on is significant.''</p>
        <p>The other countries participating are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, Britain and Ukraine.</p>
