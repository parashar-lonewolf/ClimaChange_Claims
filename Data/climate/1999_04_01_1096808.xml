        <p>Heightened NATO Air Raids Aim to Weaken Milosevic  NATO opened an expanded bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, and alliance officials said they were planning weeks of air strikes intended to undermine President Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Three American infantrymen patrolling Macedonia's border with Kosovo were missing after reporting by radio that they were surrounded and under fire, the Pentagon said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>NATO adopted a strategy of bombing Yugoslavia despite several military assessments and intelligence warnings that it alone would not deter attacks in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>France will provide 10 airplanes to protect Kosovo refugee convoys from Serbian forces, and Italy will send police officers to Albania to bring order to refugee camps.</p>
        <p>A13</p>
        <p>Russia said it would send a reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean to monitor the conflict in Yugoslavia, a move criticized by the United States as unhelpful.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Serbian forces are shelling villages, towns and cities across a wide swath of Kosovo, refugees said.</p>

        <p>Computer users in Serbia managed to temporarily disable NATO's Web site last weekend and to cause intermittent outages over the last few days, NATO officials said.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>The international war crimes tribunal disclosed that it had warned Yugoslav officials that they would be accountable for violence against civilians in Kosovo. It also said it had indicted Zeljiko Raznatovic, the Serbian militia leader known as Arkan.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Two Kosovo Albanian leaders reported to have been summarily executed by Serbs were now said to be alive.</p>

        <p>Zambia Founder is Stateless  The Zambian High Court has ruled that Kenneth D. Kaunda, the father of modern Zambia and the country's President for 27 years, is not a Zambian citizen under the Constitution because his parents were from the former British Nyasaland, now called Malawi.</p>

        <p>U.S. Drug Chief Open To Farmers Growing Hemp  Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, indicated in an interview that his opposition to the growing of hemp in the United States was softening. Hemp is a nonintoxicating look-alike cousin of marijuana that is grown for fiber, seed and oil. It is banned in the war on drugs, but some American wheat farmers are seeking the right to grow it. Legislation to revive hemp has passed in Hawaii and been introduced in at least five other state legislatures.</p>

        <p>A20</p>
        <p>Assessment of Climate Treaty  The United States and other industrial countries may find it easier and cheaper than expected to comply with a proposed treaty to fight global warming, largely because of reduced fuel consumption in Russia, a Government agency said.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>Court Hears Federalism Case  The Supreme Court heard arguments on whether state employees could go to state court to sue for federally guaranteed overtime pay. It was the first of four arguments in important Federalism cases.</p>
