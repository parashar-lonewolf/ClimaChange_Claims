        <p>LEAD: AGRICULTURAL scientists say advances in identifying and developing plants that thrive in salt water and salty soils may help alleviate severe food shortages in developing countries.</p>
        <p>AGRICULTURAL scientists say advances in identifying and developing plants that thrive in salt water and salty soils may help alleviate severe food shortages in developing countries.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, scientists have domesticated wild plants known as halophytes, which thrive in salt water and are sources of food, fodder and fuel. They have worked to make conventional crops more salt-tolerant through crossbreeding and have developed hybrid species that can repair soils ruined by salinization and supplement food supplies for animals and people.</p>
        <p>Farmers are beginning to increase food supplies by growing grasses in the sand dunes of the Nile, and food grains on the coastal dunes near Bhavnagar, India, lands once believed to be too soaked with salt to support crops.</p>
        <p>Salt-Tolerant Tomatoes</p>
        <p>Sweeter, tastier tomatoes and melons made more salt-tolerant through crossbreeding are being grown with drip irrigation in desert settlements in Egypt and Israel. In Pakistan, a hybrid grass called sordan is not only providing food for cattle but also improving soil ruined by poor farming practices so that it can once again grow conventional crops.</p>
        <p>Methods used in these areas can work in Africa and other parts of the third world, the scientists say.</p>
        <p>While current research provides a basis of hope for combating food shortages, there are still many unanswered questions and problems in saline agriculture, including the high costs of many methods. Scientists are divided over which aspects of saline agriculture offer the most promise for increasing the food supply in poor nations.</p>
        <p>Scientists like Dr. James W. O'Leary, director of the Environmental Laboratory at the University of Arizona in Tucson, say they believe that the most promise lies in the domestication of salt-tolerant plants.</p>
        <p>Others, like Dov Pasternak, an agricultural scientist and professor at Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, say that making conventional crops like tomatoes, cotton and melons more salt-tolerant will be more useful.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the United States Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, Calif., are studying the genes and development of hybrid plants to create new salt-tolerant species.</p>
        <p>Millions of acres of land worldwide are not used for crops because they are too salty or the available water is too salty for irrigation. These lands include coastal deserts where only seawater is available, former farmland with soil that has been ruined by poor irrigation practices and arid areas atop salt lakes or underground brackish water.</p>
        <p>Scientists say there is an increasing need to develop saline agriculture as the world's population grow and available farmland decreases.</p>
        <p>''There is today big pressure on the semi-arid and arid land of the world - population pressure,'' said Dr. Pasternak. But he added that those countries have saline water that can be used to feed people who are starving in those areas.</p>
        <p>''I believe that the knowledge that we have developed can be used in all deserts of the world,'' he said, asserting that every desert has saline water that has not been used to grow crops.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that salt has reduced productivity on about 49.4 million acres of the world's irrigated land, threatening the economies of arid countries like Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan, where irrigation is the foundation of agriculture.</p>
        <p>A report published in April by the National Research Council listed hundreds of salt-tolerant plants, including grasses, shrubs and trees, that ''could contribute significantly to the developing world's supply of food, fiber, fuel and fodder.''</p>
        <p>Dr. O'Leary said many of the plants discussed in the report, like several salt-tolerant grasses that can be used to feed cattle and whose seeds can be used to make bread, could make good crops and bring into use lands that now cannot be used for agriculture.</p>
        <p>The report addresses a problem faced by more than a billion people in developing countries who rely on forests for fuelwood but are faced with rapid deforestation. It identifies salt-tolerant shrubs and trees like those belonging to the genus Prosopis or Eucalyptus, that can be grown on salty, marginal lands and can be used for cooking and heating.</p>
        <p>Other plants identified in the report include several species of a halophyte called Acacia, found in Australia, which are rich in nutrients and higher in energy, protein and fat than wheat or rice. Aborigines have ground the dry, ripe seeds of these plants to make a coarse flour that can be used to bake bread on hot stones or in the ashes of a fire.</p>
        <p>But scientists say several problems remain: the management of such crops requires advanced and carefully planned irrigation, and Dr. O'Leary said the cost of carrying out many crop management programs has not yet been addressed.</p>
        <p>''I think a realistic projection would be 10 years for when you will see large-scale planting of halophytes, or in 10 years, halophyte research will be on the junk pile,'' Dr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>''It's not going to be cheap,'' he said, referring to the high cost of labor and materials like pipes and pumps.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pasternak recently abandoned research on halophytes because he has been more successful in increasing the salt tolerance of conventional crops like tomatoes, cotton and some melons and irrigating them with brackish water.</p>
        <p>Calling halophytes the answer to the third world food crisis ''is too presumptuous,'' Dr. Pasternak said. ''It has not been proven yet. The only use for halophytes is for forage.'' Dr. Pasternak, using drip irrigation, works primarily with water containing 5,000 to 7,000 parts per million of salt. Seawater contains 35,000 to 38,000 parts per million.</p>
        <p>Dr. O'Leary conceded Dr. Pasternak ''is probably right'' in focusing on conventional crops instead of halophytes. But he said it was ''highly unlikely that conventional plants will be adapted to high levels of salinity'' of 10,000 parts per million and above.</p>
        <p>Drip Irrigation Method</p>
        <p>Dr. Pasternak recently completed a project in Egypt where he introduced drip irrigation in sand dunes of the Nile to produce melons out of season. In drip irrigation, instead of periodically wetting an entire field, water is constantly dripped on the soil right around the roots of plants through a hose run along crop rows. This method greatly restricts the amount of water sprayed over an entire field, preventing salt buildup, but it insures that soil around the roots is almost always moist. Dr. Pasternak said the salinity produced tastier and sweeter fruit. Scientists at the United States Agricultural Research Service in Kimberly, Idaho, have worked successfully in Pakistan with a hybrid grass called sordan, which can be used as feed for cattle and can repair damaged land.</p>
        <p>Repairing Damaged Soil</p>
        <p>In Pakistan and other parts of the third world, a major main problem for farmers is the prevalence of lands called sodic. Unlike saline soils, sodic soils no longer have a high concentration of different types of salts of magnesium, sodium, calcium but contain only sodium that has been chemically adsorbed on the clay. This makes the clay too crusty to admit air and water easily, making it unsuitable for growth of crops.</p>
        <p>Sordan grass, the result of breeding between a plant called sorghum and Sudan grass, can repair the damage in sodic soils and reclaim the land so that it can once again be used to grow conventional crops.</p>
        <p>David L. Carter, director of soil and water management research at the Agricultural Research Service in Kimberly, Idaho, said that sordan ''is going to produce some good forage on these marginal soils and at the same time will reclaim some of these soils for crops for human consumption.''</p>
        <p>What the plants do when grown on sodic soils is to release organic acids into the earth through their roots. The organic acids dissolve calcium carbonate, or lime, which is found in most arid lands.</p>
        <p>The calcium that is released displaces the sodium left in the soil. The sodium goes into solution and joins with the carbon dioxide from the lime to form sodium bicarbonate. This compound is then washed away by water from rain or irrigation.</p>
        <p>After growing sordan on sodic lands for about two years, farmers can often re-use the soil for conventional crops.</p>
        <p>Crops for Salty and Damaged Soils and Water</p>
        <p>Tecticornia</p>
        <p>This salt-tolerant plant yields seeds that the Australian aborigines grind into a flour that can be used for bread. It grows in coastal mud flats above the normal tidal level.</p>
        <p>Sordan grass</p>
        <p>This grass repairs soil made crusty by sodium compounds. It releases acids that dissolve calcium carbonateto release calcium and carbon dioxide. Calcium displaces sodium in the soil. The sodium dissolves and joins with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate, which washes away.</p>

        <p>Using Saline Water, Drop by Drop</p>
        <p>In drip irrigation, tubes release controlled amounts of water, most of it into the soil just around the roots of plants. The method allows frequent irrigation to keep the soil almost constantly moist but reduces the total amount of water used. This is especially important when using saline water because it also reduces the amount of salt deposited in the field.</p>
