        <p>Early this spring, long before the trees had leafed, I found myself standing in the rain in a dark field in southern New Jersey waiting for woodcocks -- shy, chunky, long-billed birds -- to rise out of the shadows and begin their mating dance. Sometimes called timberdoodles, woodcocks are not the most graceful birds on the planet. Their eyes are spaced so far apart that you might wonder how they can see the trees in front of them. As the late winter days begin to lengthen, they throw caution to the wind, and at dawn and dusk the males rise straight up into the air some 200 or 300 feet and then spiral down, uttering a plaintive, musical series of notes. Although deterred by cold, they don't seem to be bothered by rain -- and that's a good thing, too, because this ''sky dancing'' is how they maintain themselves as a species. The mystery is what was I, a devoted urbanite, doing there?</p>
        <p>I've been watching birds for six years. It all began at a brunch in Manhattan when someone happened to mention that soon the warblers would be arriving in Central Park. I didn't know what precisely warblers were, but I knew in some uncanny way that when they arrived I would go out to find them. The next day, I signed up for a course in beginning bird-watching at the New York City chapter of the Audubon Society. There were two classes and two field trips -- one to the Jamaica Bay wildlife refuge and one to Central Park. To get to Jamaica Bay, I took the A train to Broad Channel in Queens, where I saw glossy ibis and snow geese and egrets rising against the Manhattan skyline, sharing the air with jets taking off from Kennedy Airport. On the trip to Central Park, not two blocks from where I live, I saw warblers -- tiny, colorful neotropical migrants, flitting with mysterious life in the trees and bushes of the Ramble, the 36-acre woodland at the heart of the park.</p>

        <p>Some 300 of North America's 700 bird species pass through New York City each spring on their way north. Discovering these birds in the park where I had played as a child was a revelation. I had not known at the time that nature was missing from my life, but this newfound connection to something wild made me feel, for lack of a better word, whole. It was as if I had never seen the stars and someone tapped me on the shoulder one night and told me to look up.</p>
        <p>With a convert's zeal, I began spending countless hours stalking birds with my binoculars, and as soon as spring was over, I began to look forward to fall, when they would come back on their return flight. I began subscribing to mainstream periodicals like Audubon and Natural History and then to specialty journals with names like Birder's World, Birdwatcher's Digest and Winging It. I bought Birding by Ear tapes and Peterson's guide to Eastern birds, then the more comprehensive ''National Geographic Guide'' and species-specific volumes like ''Warblers of the Americas'' and ''Hawks in Flight.'' I began to plan my vacations and even my work assignments to birding hot spots like Madera Canyon in southern Arizona, Bosque del Apache in New Mexico, the Orkneys in Scotland, the Everglades.</p>
        <p>I had stumbled into a vast, largely invisible world. It seemed like a private discovery, until it dawned on me that I was part of a quiet revolution. The first time I traveled for the express purpose of birding I went to Point Pelee in Ontario. Pulling into the bed-and-breakfast where my wife and I were staying, I saw a car with vanity plates that read ''Birder.'' At 6 a.m. in the packed parking lot of the nature preserve the next morning, I found hundreds of people wearing sun hats and binoculars; though somewhat taken aback by the crowds, I felt a thrilling shock of recognition. Like the birds themselves, the world of bird-watching had simply been hidden from me. Once I was initiated, I found a whole complex culture waiting to receive me.</p>
        <p>According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, somewhere between 42 million and 50 million Americans over the age of 16 watch birds, far more than the numbers of people who hunt and fish combined. Birders spend some $20 billion a year -- on travel and optics and gear and seed -- and scores of birding festivals have sprung up in the last few decades, reversing the fortunes of small coastal towns in Texas and rural backwaters in regions that were once neglected. There are now more than 400 franchise stores, like Wildbird Unlimited, specializing in birding gear and birdseed, and some 600 more independents. Twenty years ago there were almost none. This August, Houghton Mifflin -- which, since publishing Roger Tory Peterson's first field guide in 1934, has sold eight million Peterson bird guides -- will publish a new field guide to the birds by Kenn Kaufman with a first printing of 150,000 copies, making it Houghton Mifflin's biggest book of the year. In October, Knopf will bring out ''The Sibley Guide to Birds,'' created by the master bird artist David Allen Sibley, with a print run of 100,000.</p>
        <p>The appeal of birds may be mythically ingrained -- think of the bird gods of Egypt -- but there are also practical explanations. For one thing, they're still here. Remnants of wild America may lurk in corners of the country, but birds, thanks to their ability to fly, span the continent. ''There is probably no place in North America where you can stand and not hear birds,'' Pete Dunne, director of the Cape May Bird Observatory, told me recently. Even from my apartment, I hear blue jays and mourning doves and house finches and the occasional downy woodpecker. In the heart of downtown, pigeons pace the windowsills in memory of their cliff-dwelling rock dove origins, and sparrows peep out of the hollow metal crossbars of virtually every traffic light. For Dunne, the environmental movement of the 1960's ''left its imprint on everyone,'' so that grown-up baby boomers with time on their hands are not simply discovering nature but returning to something that touched them when they were teenagers learning about the effects of DDT.</p>
        <p>Dunne, 48, himself typifies the new sort of birder; he has helped popularize the pursuit with lively books like ''Tales of a Low-Rent Birder'' as well as serious field guides. He is also the creator of the World Series of Birding, a freewheeling annual event that takes place the second week of May in which participants have 24 hours to find as many bird species as possible using the entire state of New Jersey as the playing field. The team with the most sightings at the end of the day wins. Begun in 1984 with 13 teams, the World Series now attracts more than 50 teams from all over the world and raises about half a million dollars for conservation groups. The World Series and numerous similar events, like the Great Texas Birdathon, gratify the naked competitive energy that fuels a certain sort of bird-watching -- sometimes referred to as ''birding,'' distinct from bird-watching. Birders are more likely to keep ''life lists'' of what they have seen and are known to travel great distances to add a single bird -- a lesser prairie chicken in, say, Kansas or a rose-throated becard in Arizona -- to their lists.</p>
        <p>I am neither a fanatical ''lister'' nor a casual backyard bird-watcher but something in between. Of course, birding itself is an in-between activity, half science and half pastime, half sport and half conservationist crusade. Born of an ancient impulse, it required the 20th century, when binoculars replaced the shotgun, to be fully realized. Some primal, conquering hunter's urge is never far below the surface when I'm out with my binoculars, even though the living bird is all I'm after. Linked to the natural world, bird-watching nevertheless forces me to stand at a slight remove. It is more about the interplay of the human and the natural -- naming, labeling, fitting the wild world against the ordering grid of human understanding, even as I am simultaneously lured farther out into animal habitats. I am left with something both untamed and ordered -- a weirdly satisfying, deeply human mixture of elements.</p>
        <p>But things may not be as satisfying for the birds. ''The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk'' -- Hegel's comment about civilizations flourishing as they move toward the brink of extinction -- has an eerie echo for bird-watchers. Just as nature was, in some sense, beginning for me, Bill McKibben was foretelling ''The End of Nature.'' The inexhaustible, self-renewing environment of our fantasies died with the Industrial Revolution, and unless we change our ways, he posited, rising temperatures, acid rain and a host of other ills will carry off what's left of the natural world. Bird-watching, alas, is not necessarily an indication of the health of the bird population. George Fenwick, president of the American Bird Conservancy, a small but important advocacy group, points to the fanaticism of British bird-watchers, well known in this country because so many show up at American birding spots. ''The best birders are there and everyone's obsessed with birds,'' he told me, and yet ''there's hardly a wood lot left -- everything's been developed and redeveloped. I'm glad the Brits are so interested, but I hope that's not our fate.''</p>
        <p>Bird-watching, in other words, may be what you do at the end of nature. According to Frank Gill, director of science for the National Audubon Society, one out of every six species in North America is in trouble, declining 2 to 10 percent a year; over 20 or 30 years, that means whole species would be cut in half -- or worse.</p>
        <p>On the wall of my study, near a multiplying collection of bird books, hangs a reproduction of Audubon's portrait of two passenger pigeons. Although these birds roosted communally and flew in flocks so vast that they darkened the sky for hours while passing overhead, Audubon has given them individual life, a male and female, touching bills. I find these birds, peach and blue and gray, not merely beautiful but haunting, a sort of avian memento mori. One hundred years ago, on March 24, 1900 (and it adds a weirdly modern element that we know the exact date), the last wild passenger pigeon ever recorded was shot out of the sky in Pike County, Ohio. Fourteen years later, the last surviving member of the species, a bird named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo.</p>
        <p>Today's imperiled birds include the Bicknell's thrush, a modest species that nests on mountaintops from New York to Canada and winters on the island of Hispaniola in the highest elevations of the Dominican Republic -- where 90 percent of the land has already been deforested. Development and population pressures there are such that there is a real danger of extinction, not merely for the Bicknell's thrush but for other species wintering there as well. The grand migratory flights of birds that I found so exhilarating because they carried my imagination in all directions, even standing in Manhattan looking up, began, as I became more aware of their imperiled status, to darken the sky with danger -- and with politics.</p>
        <p>Paul Kerlinger, an expert in bird migration who studies the economic impact of birding, wants bird-watchers to wake up to their enormous spending power. They might agree to a tax on birdseed, he says, or endorse legislation like the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which would use revenues from offshore oil drilling to support habitat conservation. His studies have shown that ecotourism often brings more money to an area like the Delaware Bay than a local industry like horseshoe crab harvesting, which has a directly adverse effect on the birds. But his economic approach has had only limited appeal. ''I don't know if they're all Luddites or Socialists or what,'' Kerlinger says in frustration, alluding to the deep-seated fear among some bird-watchers that market forces are at odds with environmentalism.</p>
        <p>However birders feel about economic strategies, it is not easy to organize people who do something so solitary and so individualistic. Unlike hunting or fishing, birding requires no license -- you need only slip out the door with a pair of binoculars, which is why Kenn Kaufman, who dropped out of high school and hitchhiked across the country looking for birds, calls bird-watching a ''subversive'' activity.</p>
        <p>Make a birder, make a conservationist, Roger Tory Peterson said. All I really wanted was to look at birds -- but that won't be possible if I don't give in to this secondary duty and make my thinking as global as the birds themselves are. It remains to be seen if the rise in bird-watchers can somehow stop the disappearance of the birds -- since saving the birds means saving the places they live, which is to say what's left of the natural world.</p>
        <p>The great biologist Edward O. Wilson coined the term ''biophilia'' to describe the inborn need of human beings to affiliate with nature because as a species we evolved within the natural world. We may have an urge to conquer nature, but we still need it around us for our mental and even our genetic health. If this is true, then conservation is really only a form of self-interest. And bird-watching, as I have long suspected, isn't really a hobby, any more than rearing my daughter is a hobby. It's just a way of participating in the natural world that produced me, if only in a token, postmodern manner.</p>
        <p>In his poem ''The Oven Bird,'' Robert Frost made this small warbler with a stripe of orange down the middle of its head (easily seen in Central Park in May) a metaphor for the vanishing natural world. ''The question that he frames in all but words,'' the poet wrote, ''is what to make of a diminished thing.'' That is still the question bird-watching poses. I think of this in my field in southern New Jersey, where the light is failing, my patience is waning and the woodcock, as a chill wind kicks up, is making itself scarce.</p>
        <p>Nature itself may be failing -- and we may be failing it. But from out of the darkness, I suddenly hear the call of the woodcock -- a buzzy, nasal ''peent'' not altogether unlike the ''meep meep'' sound the roadrunner makes in the cartoon when he sees the coyote. Everyone in my group falls breathlessly silent, and then there is a whir of wings that make their own music as the bird launches himself from a nearby patch of scrub straight up into the air. When he reaches the apex of his flight he begins to drift down in a wavering series of spirals, singing as he goes. If his song is successful, then when he lands, in the exact spot he took off from, a female woodcock will be waiting for him and they will mate.</p>
        <p>The woodcock is dimly visible against the dark sky, and for a moment philosophy and ecology and poetry and politics all go out the window. What to make of a diminished thing? It will take a lifetime to figure that out. But for one brief, heart-stopping second, the bird itself seems like answer enough.</p>
