        <p>LEAD: WHEN the Appalachian Mountain Club, a low-key, nonprofit organization that for more than 100 years has brought millions of Americans in closer contact with the natural world, started a multimillion-dollar fund-raising campaign nearly two years ago, it was counting on its reputation and the loyalty of its supporters to bring that effort to fruition.</p>
        <p>WHEN the Appalachian Mountain Club, a low-key, nonprofit organization that for more than 100 years has brought millions of Americans in closer contact with the natural world, started a multimillion-dollar fund-raising campaign nearly two years ago, it was counting on its reputation and the loyalty of its supporters to bring that effort to fruition.</p>
        <p>That confidence has been rewarded with more than $8 million in contributions. But the drive, which ends Jan. 31, is about a million dollars short of a $9.2 million goal.</p>
        <p>The club, commonly known as A.M.C., was founded in 1876 by a group of college and university professors who wished to introduce others to the grandeur of the White Mountains in New Hampshire and is noted for its ability to recruit volunteers.</p>
        <p>Even today, with 12 chapters from Washington D.C. to Maine, 35,000 members and an annual budget of more than $5 million, the organization has fewer than 70 members on its professional staff.</p>
        <p>The fund-raising effort has been trying since 1981 to take up the slack created when the United States Forest Service slashed its trail maintenance budget by some 80 percent. In the Androscoggin District of New Hampshire's White Mountain National Forest, the Service has only one back-country ranger where it once had nine, according to the A.M.C.</p>
        <p>Year-round programs in outdoor leadership, on varied terrain and in all seasons, are part of activities by the A.M.C., as is instruction in trip planning, building and maintaining trails and trail huts, map reading and map making.</p>
        <p>The club conducts acid rain research on high-altitude lakes and ponds, is involved in trail mapping and trail building in the British Virgin Islands, has developed a service program for those visiting the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska and is building and maintaining trails in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>Because the club serves members and nonmembers with impartiality, support for the drive has been forthcoming from both groups.</p>
        <p>Late this summer, for example, one letter accompanying a $500,000 donation from a husband and wife, who choose to remain anonymous, noted that the A.M.C. ''stands for the best and wisest use of the outdoors for recreation and other appropriate purposes.'' They added that the organization ''renders a great public service.'' Although they are not members, the couple have long used the A.M.C.'s huts and trail systems.</p>
        <p>L. L. Bean of Freeport, Me., has been the major corporate donor to the A.M.C. campaign. In his letter to the club announcing his firm's pledge of $500,000, L. L. Bean's president, Leon Gorman, observed: ''The Appalachian Mountain Club is a truly outstanding organization. You have made a profound impact on our society in maintaining and enhancing the natural environment of the Northeast and elsewhere, and by making these outdoor surroundings available to the public for their recreational needs.'' The letter added that the club deserves the ''full support of everyone with an interest in the outdoors and its future for the American people.''</p>
        <p>A few days ago, L. L. Bean gave an additional $50,000 to the A.M.C. that was intended, said Kilton Andrew of the firm, to offer encouragement to the club in the final stage of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Gifts of any size are welcome, and may be earmarked for a specific fund or program. For information on this, one may call the organization's campaign office (617) 523-0655. That office - and the A.M.C. headquarters - is at 5 Joy Street, Boston, Mass. 02108.</p>
        <p>The club's workshops, based at its Pinkham Notch Camp in Gorham, N.H., are many and varied. On Jan. 2 and Jan. 3, for example, the A.M.C. is offering a guided exploration of the region that will enable participants to observe and study animal tracks, trees, shrubs, snow and plants. And other activities will include instruction in ski touring and winter camping with one night spent under the stars. Previous workshops have been devoted to Alpine region flora and high country photography.</p>
        <p>The A.M.C.'s schedule of short and long excursions, about 7,000 of them annually, include Alpine and cross-country skiing, hiking, snowshoeing, canoeing, bird watching, rock, snow and ice climbing and kayaking.</p>
        <p>The club has long had a program in Boston designed to provide inner-city youngsters with outdoor experiences and last year that effort was extended to New York City.</p>
        <p>It is astonishing, says Thomas Deans, the A.M.C.'s executive director, how many good camping and hiking areas are close to metropolitan areas and accessible by mass transit.</p>
        <p>''In New York City right now,'' said the A.M.C.'s Lisa Keith, ''we have a project in which local chapter volunteers, working with the Greater New York Council of Girl Scouts and the city's department of Children's Services, are taking public school children out on hikes.</p>
        <p>''We have built a new section of trail in Pelham Bay Park, and we have a staff person who works with the local chapter and other groups to implement our various public service programs. Nor are area conservation issues ignored. The local chapter has, for example, become quite involved in trying to protect Sterling Forest.''</p>
        <p>Sterling Forest is a privately owned tract in the New Jersey Highlands that developers have been eyeing. The club has, among other things, suggested that the state buy the land.</p>
        <p>The A.M.C.'s New York office is presently at 24 East 38th Street, but by mid-January the address will be 202 East 39th Street, New York, New York 10016.</p>
        <p>A lively organization fiercely dedicated to protecting and enhancing the quality of the streams within its baliwick, the Croton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited, will begin its fly fishing and fly tying schools Jan. 11. The courses, which run for seven consecutive Monday evenings starting at 7:15, will be at the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Bedford, N.Y. The fee for the fly tying school is $45, and $40 for the other. To register or for information, call (914) 666-5727 or 666-8091.</p>
