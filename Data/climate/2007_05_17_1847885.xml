        <p>For those who want to take a personal stand against climate change, Gaiam Real Goods of Broomfield, Colo., is offering the Global Warming Action Kit($99), above. It includes ''The Solar Living Sourcebook,'' by the company founder, John Schaeffer, and a showerhead that uses 1.4 gallons a minute instead of the typical 2.5 gallons. ''You're saving a gallon a minute,'' said Bill Giebler, the company director. ''Over a 10-minute shower, that's a lot of water.'' There is also a solar-powered flashlight, three 13-watt fluorescent bulbs, rechargeable batteries and a charger, a stainless steel water bottle and a solar-powered hat fan. For information: (800) 919-2400 or the parent company's Web site, gaiam.com.</p>
