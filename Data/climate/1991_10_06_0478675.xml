        <p>Hydro-Quebec, the $50 billion utility that is wholly owned by the Quebec government, has powered a vast industrial expansion in the province. And the company is committed to further development that would almost double its output of inexpensive hydropower. But getting there might be a problem. For the first time, the company is encountering fierce resistance.</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec's chief executive, Richard Drouin, has faced tough fights before. He took office three years ago amid a labor battle in which unionized workers ransacked some of the company's executive offices. He has since brought a measure of labor calm and improved the reliability of the company's electrical service.</p>
        <p>But he may have more difficulty carrying out the company's ambitious growth plans. Hydro-Quebec is now in the center of a storm over a proposed project that would spend 12.6 billion Canadian dollars to tap hydropower on the Great Whale River, which flows into Hudson Bay. The project is intensely opposed by the Cree Indians who live in the area and by environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The dispute has spread to the United States, where opponents are pressing New York and Vermont to restrain purchases of power from Quebec even as growth in power demand is slowing. New York, which currently gets only a tiny percentage of its power from Quebec, has delayed until late next year a final decision on proceeding with a contract to pay 14.5 billion American dollars over 21 years for power from Quebec.</p>
        <p>In this atmosphere of uncertainty about demand for its hydropower, the company's heavy use of debt to finance construction is causing some analysts to wonder if it will have sufficient revenue to pay off its bonds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drouin, however, expresses no doubts about the worthiness of the project. Still, he acknowledges with a diffident grin that the company's profile "is a little higher these days than we would like."</p>
        <p>The 59-year-old Mr. Drouin went to school with the current Premier of Quebec, Robert Bourassa, at the College Jean-de-Brebeuf in Montreal, then took a law degree at Laval University in Quebec City. That early friendship, combined with Mr. Drouin's expertise in labor relations, won him the job that some say is equivalent to economics minister of the province. As a source of big construction projects as well as of hydropower, the company has long been an important engine of growth for Quebec.</p>
        <p>The urbane, square-jawed, silver-haired executive, who as a sailor in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence often braves inhospitable seas, came aboard Hydro-Quebec three years ago, when the utility faced severe labor problems.</p>
        <p>The rancor stemmed from the company's insistence on contracting out work instead of hiring additional workers or paying more overtime. Mr. Drouin reached an agreement with the unions under which company workers perform operating and maintenance work, while subcontractors handle new construction. Nonetheless, relations with the company's 25,000 workers are still touchy.</p>
        <p>As chief executive, Mr. Drouin has tried not only to get a better handle on labor relations but also to improve the company's reliability. In the last decade Hydro-Quebec has been plagued by power blackouts and brownouts. But failures have already been sharply reduced, and Mr. Drouin's goal is to make Hydro-Quebec one of Canada's most dependable utilities by the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>The Great Whale construction project had already been set in motion by the time Mr. Drouin arrived on the scene. He has pursued it vigorously, saying expansion is essential for the well-being of the province, where the company's operating and construction activities in 1990 injected more that $7.5 billion into the economy, equivalent to 4.5 percent of Quebec's gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>The entire province is believed to have a hydroelectric potential of about 50,000 megawatts, equivalent to the output of about 60 traditional power plants. The company has already developed about 25,000 megawatts, with plans for 20,000 more.</p>
        <p>Noting that hydropower is "cheaper to develop and bring to major load centers than any other generating option," Mr. Drouin said he expects to be able to sell power in the northeast United States for 40 percent below other electricity producers.</p>
        <p>But to continue tapping Quebec's hydro resources, the giant utility, which generates revenues of $6 billion a year and borrows about $4 billion a year, needs environmental approval to go forward with the 3,100 megawatt Great Whale project.</p>
        <p>The project entails building dikes and dams, roads and airports, diverting four rivers and flooding an area slightly larger than Lake Champlain, in a region where 10,000 Cree and 5,000 Inuit make their home. Mr. Drouin insists that his company can carry out the construction work while preserving the environment and raising living standards of the native peoples.</p>
        <p>The Cree and their lawyers in Montreal dispute this. They argue that the project will take a severe toll on the environment. They are fighting the project every inch of the way and now have help from North American conservationist groups, including the Sierra Club and the National Audubon Society. Entertainers are also getting involved; three rock concerts are scheduled for this week at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan under the title "Ban the Dam Jam."</p>
        <p>The coalition recently won a significant victory. Quebec's Environment Minister, Pierre Paradis, announced on Aug. 22 that no work would begin on the Great Whale project until after there has been a thorough environmental assessment by the province, which will take at least a year.</p>
        <p>In addition, a federal judge in Ottawa last month ordered the Canadian Government to undertake its own environmental review, and Ottawa and Quebec are weighing a joint assessment. But it cannot begin until the indigenous people agree to participate.</p>
        <p>Quebec's Energy Minister, Lise Bacon, said the province needs the power and faces a choice of using either hydropower or nuclear power. "Do you want a nuclear plant to be built in Quebec?" she asked at a news briefing last week. In fact, Hydro-Quebec already operates two small nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bourassa and Governor Cuomo signed a power contract in 1989 under which Hydro-Quebec would provide 1,000 megawatts of electricity to New York State for 21 years beginning in 1995, they gave each other until next Dec. 31 to back out without penalty. Now both parties have extended the deadline until Nov. 30, 1992.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the New York Power Authority, said the state would use the time to reassess its power needs in light of the reduced growth in electricity sales resulting from the recession and from greater conservation. The growth has fallen to six-tenths of 1 percent annually from 1.5 percent in the mid-80's. This could mean changes in the contract to adjust delivery schedules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flynn said in an interview that the contract offered "significant environmental benefits" for New York. He cited a report of the state's energy office that hydroelectric power cuts "millions of tons" of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide pollutants that would otherwise pour out of from oil- and coal-fired power stations.</p>
        <p>In addition, he calculates that Quebec power has saved the state's residents more than $600 million since 1978.</p>
        <p>The Great Whale project is only the latest of a number of projects to open up the hydro resources of the north. A huge complex on La Grande River, a couple of hundred miles to the south of the Great Whale, was completed in 1985 and generates 10,300 megawatts of power. A second phase at La Grande is scheduled to add 4,500 megawatts in 1995.</p>
        <p>In the next decade the company expects to spend some $64 billion not only on La Grande Phase 2 and the Great Whale but a vast new complex along the Nottaway, Broadback and Rupert Rivers, south of La Grande, which would generate 8,400 megawatts. It is also negotiating with Newfoundland to develop two big hydroelectric sites on the lower Churchill River in Labrador.</p>
        <p>To get the funds for these tremendous capital-intensive ventures, the company has used retained earnings and borrowed heavily in local and foreign capital markets.</p>
        <p>With long-term debt of $25.6 billion at the end of last year, including $7.5 billion in United States dollars, Hydro-Quebec already owes more money than all but a few other North American corporations, and some bankers have expressed uneasiness about future borrowing for the new ventures.</p>
        <p>Robert Blohm, an American investment banker in Montreal, said the export contracts for New York and Vermont are intended to provide the bulk of the income needed to service the American indebtedness. If these contracts are annulled, he warned, the company could be "dangerously exposed to risk on the American portion of its debt."</p>
        <p>But William Streeter, vice president of Moody's Investors Service, is less worried. He cites positive factors, including the company's "strong management," its "flexibility" in construction programs and its "very competitive" electricity prices.</p>
        <p>There is no greater enthusiast of water power than Premier Bourassa himself, the 58-year-old leader of Quebec's Liberal Party, who has been provincial chief executive on and off since 1970.</p>
        <p>In a book titled "Power From the North," published by Prentice-Hall Canada in 1985, Mr. Bourassa wrote: "Quebec is a vast hydroelectric plant in the bud, and every day millions of potential kilowatt-hours flow downhill and out to sea. What a waste!" A BARGAIN FOR SMELTERS</p>
        <p>THE secret is finally out about how much big energy-hungry aluminum smelters and other metal refiners actually pay for the power they buy from Hydro-Quebec, the utility owned by Quebec's taxpayers.</p>
        <p>The answer: precious little in bad times, more in good times. Under risk-sharing variable-rate contracts, prices are pegged to a combination of the inflation rate, the world price of the metal and the customer's profits.</p>
        <p>For example, Norsk Hydro Canada Inc., operating a magnesium smelter at Becancour, Quebec, for its Norwegian parent, now pays 1.6 cents a kilowatt-hour. This is about half of what Hydro-Quebec charges other industrial users and a quarter of what the New York Power Authority pays.</p>
        <p>Norsk Hydro is one of 13 heavy energy users that have invested billions of dollars in Quebec and have similar contracts. Of the 13, four are magnesium or aluminum smelters -- companies that use enormous amounts of electricity to separate and refine metals.</p>
        <p>As times improve for Norsk Hydro, its payments for electricity would rise under the formula so that over the term of the contract Hydro-Quebec theoretically would fare as well as with its other industrial customers.</p>
        <p>Still, there are questions about whether the smelters are being subsidized at the expense of other consumers, the taxpayers and competitors. The Utah-based Magnesium Corporation of America has brought a case before the United States International Trade Commission seeking duties to wipe out any competitive advantages Norsk Hydro may have gained from its contract with Hydro-Quebec.</p>
        <p>Hydro-Quebec says no subsidy is involved. It calculates that it may lose as much as $125 million this year on the 13 agreements but that it can make a profit of twice that much if aluminum sales and profits recover.</p>
