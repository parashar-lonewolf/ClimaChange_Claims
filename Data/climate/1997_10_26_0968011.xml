        <p>AT the northern end of Pachaug State Forest, on Porter Pond, Indian summer stretched the leaping antics of the frogs later this year than usual. As Joey Gerst led the way to the water's edge, a dozen small green frogs jumped in unison like an amphibian dance troupe, while fat tadpoles wiggled out  of the boy's reach into the shallows.</p>
        <p>Fall foliage was reflected on the surface, while out in the middle of the pond a kingfisher dove for prey. Four wild turkeys crossed a road into the woods nearby. Along the pond's banks, in the grass and among the stones exposed to the sun, a little ribbon snake slithered  away from the human trespassers.</p>
        <p>The tranquillity of the pond hid an ugly fact until this summer when Joey, an 11-year-old middle school student, and his father, who live in Moosup, visited with a net to scoop up frogs from along its shoreline. A large number of the green frogs, perhaps the majority of them, have deformities, and scientists are stumped for a cause.</p>
        <p>Joey's discovery in August added Connecticut to the list of some 30 states where deformed frogs have been found, and researchers investigating it credited curious children like Joey for having uncovered the environmental conundrum.</p>
        <p>''We were just exploring,'' Joey said, ''netting frogs.'' One frog was missing a back leg, but Joey's father, Joe Gerst, suggested a turtle might have bitten it off. But then Joey found more malformed frogs, some missing both back legs, others with shriveled legs, and the more they captured the more deformed creatures they found, eventually more than a hundred.</p>
        <p>''I began to think, something isn't right about this,'' Mr. Gerst said. They took a bucket of deformed frogs home that afternoon and called the State Department of Environmental Protection, which promised to get back to him. When no one called back, Mr. Gerst called a local newspaper.</p>
        <p>Again his message was taken, but no one called him back. Understandably, Mr. Gerst thought no one was interested, but he was wrong.</p>
        <p>Dawn McKay, a zoologist with the D.E.P., was on vacation when Mr. Gerst called, and she found his message when she returned to work. She immediately called him, and drove down that evening to get the bucketful of frogs from the Gerst family. ''My first reaction was to be alarmed, and my next reaction was to find out if it's something natural or if we humans are doing something to cause it,'' Ms. McKay said. ''It's quite a mystery. I'm very intrigued.''</p>
        <p>Frogs are important in the natural environment. They eat insects, including mosquito larvae, and in turn are eaten by fish, snakes, birds and other frogs. ''Remove the frogs and you throw off the balance of things,'' Ms. McKay said.</p>
        <p>But they are important for another reason. Ms. McKay said: as an indicator of how clean the water is. Some species of frogs only live in the cleanest water, while other species will thrive in dirtier water, so water quality can be judged from the type frog found in it.</p>
        <p>When her investigation turned up no clues of a cause for the deformities, Ms. McKay returned to Porter Pond in September with officials from the Federal Environmental  Protection Agency's office in Boston. They took water samples, looking for  fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals, metal waste or parasites. But once  again, no mutagen was found.</p>
        <p>Porter Pond is shallow and muddy, between 5 and 10 acres in size, and  impounded behind a dam. One stream enters at one end and another stream flows out at the other. Upstream are farms that might have contributed agricultural chemicals. A half mile uphill at the downstream end is a municipal trash transfer station and landfill site.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKay said that corn silage waste was dumped in it several years ago, and the rotting silage created a foul odor that drew complaints from nearby residents. However, that problem ''seems to have been addressed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But something is wrong. Even in late September, she and the E.P.A. officials collected several deformed frogs from the pond. That was unexpected because frogs that are missing limbs cannot easily escape from predators like the blue heron that has frequented Porter Pond lately and is known to have an appetite for frog. That any are there at all this late in the year testifies to the large number of deformed frogs there must have been to begin with, she said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in October, Mr. Gerst and his son returned to Porter Pond with their net and captured several more of them, along with a one-legged tadpole.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKay said green frogs don't metamorphose into adult frogs typically until the second or third year of life, so whatever the cause of what is showing now has been long in the making. That complicates the investigation.</p>
        <p>''If a chemical is ever implicated or if something natural happened, it could have occurred up to two years ago when their limb buds were developing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Next year, Ms. McKay plans to return to Porter Pond and collect more water samples and a variety of frogs and salamanders to study.</p>
        <p>Deformed frogs have been noticed for more than a decade throughout the United States, but the problem rose to a new, higher magnitude in 1995 when three seventh graders in LeSeuer, Minn., on a school science outing discovered a large number of them on a farm.</p>
        <p>''They were walking down the field road by the woods and started catching frogs,'' said Nick Pollack, a ninth grader at the New Country School in  LeSeuer, who has joined 10 of his classmates in a continuing investigation. They posted their findings on the school web site at http:// www.mncs.k12.mn.us/.</p>
        <p>Water samples from sites in southwestern Minnesota were used to incubate a species of frogs that develop from tadpoles in a single year, and every one of the frogs was deformed in some way. That prompted the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency this summer to warn residents there to stop drinking their tap water.</p>
        <p>Several theories have been advanced. One is that there is a parasitic organism affecting the frogs, but has lately been rejected by most researchers. Others concern air pollution, agricultural chemicals or an increase in ultraviolet radiation due to damage of the earth's stratospheric ozone layer, but no evidence has  been found supporting any of them.</p>
        <p>The mystery of the frogs has also highlighted the value of the curiosity of children -- those in Minnesota and Joey Gerst, too.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKay said that the new emphasis in education on hands-on science is partly responsible, and that the media tends to dwell more on precocious activities by children than if trained adult scientists did the same thing.</p>
        <p>Children not only love to be out in the woods, but also are more likely than adults to try to capture what they see there. Furthermore, when they catch small animals, they examine them more closely than adults do.</p>
        <p>Joey Gerst confirmed that view. Like his father before him, Joey has been an amateur naturalist and sportsman since the age of 6, and loves to fish for bass in the streams of eastern Connecticut. Finding the deformed frogs has given him thoughts of becoming a professional biologist some day.</p>
        <p>''I like catching animals and stuff,'' he said. ''I grew up here, and I like it. Maybe if I was a city slicker I wouldn't,'' he added, a comment that made his father laugh out loud.</p>
