        <p>The word ''sprawl'' does not even appear in the index of ''Earth in the Balance,'' Vice President Al Gore's earnest 1992 treatise on the environment. But these days that word, and the set of creeping suburban problems it embraces, from traffic congestion to loss of open space, has emerged as one of the reigning buzzwords in the political lexicon.</p>
        <p>Politicians as diverse as Mr. Gore and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey have made the issue a priority, and voters around the nation have shown their concern in the most tangible way that taxpayers can, by passing billions of dollars in bond measures to buy and preserve undeveloped land and approving ballot measures intended to slow growth.</p>
        <p>Sprawl, in sum, is the new language of environmentalism, seen by political strategists as perhaps the best way to engage voters in a debate that had become more abstract over the last two decades as regulation curbed many of the most egregious environmental abuses, from pesticides to pollution, that had animated suburbanites in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The new debate is being driven by some of the same concerns that inspired the original movement, but now the length of a commuter's daily drive is increasingly seen as an environmental issue like chlorofluorocarbons or global warming. And political strategists say that the voters  most concerned about these issues -- suburban women -- are the voting group that helps decide elections.</p>
        <p>''In a period of prosperity, it's not about how much we have, it's about how we hold our lives together,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political consultant who has worked for candidates in Texas and Florida and helped spread the concept of the soccer mom. ''So all these quality-of-life issues, from health care to the environment, come to the fore. A lot of it is the feminization of politics. The warrior of the suburban jungle is the mom out there in her suburban assault vehicle, and there's no oasis for her, no place for her to rest.''</p>
        <p>''Where Joe Six-Pack is not concerned about green space, he is not the dominant force on the spectrum anymore.''</p>
        <p>With its Teddy Roosevelt-style emphasis on conservation in the classic sense, the fight against untrammeled sprawl finds an equally comfortable place in Mr. Gore's emerging Presidential campaign theme of ''practical idealism'' and in the ''compassionate conservative'' mantra of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And although it has not emerged as a top-tier issue like education or crime in public opinion surveys, it is steadily gaining.</p>
        <p>In Ventura County, just west of here, voters in November overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative called SOAR -- for Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources -- which will force every proposed development that requires a zoning change to be approved by a public referendum. Similar measures were passed in four individual cities within the county, just one beachhead among some 200 measures worth $7 billion that passed nationwide.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Governor Whitman successfully pressed for $1 billion in borrowing to set aside half the state's remaining 2 million acres of open space over the next 10 years. Voters overwhelmingly approved the measure in November.</p>
        <p>A statewide survey last year by the Public Policy Institute of California found that more than a quarter of Californians saw population growth and development as a big problem in their region -- hardly a surprise in a state that is expected to add 18 million more people, an entire New York State, to its current population of more than 32 million people by the year 2025. In the San Francisco Bay Area, where Silicon Valley has fueled a boom, nearly 40 percent of respondents saw growth as a major problem, while statewide a third of residents saw transportation and traffic congestion as a big problem.</p>
        <p>''It's an issue which, on the surface, seems like a very policy-wonk kind of thing,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey director for the nonpartisan institute. ''But there's a lot of public sentiment and concern about the everyday annoyance of sprawl and growth, and the long-range problems associated with air pollution and environmental degradation. And, after all, most Californians do live in suburban regions.''</p>
        <p>Depending on how suburban is defined, so do about half of all Americans, and the sprawl issue is increasingly seen as a way for politicians like Mr. Gore to take the lingering elitist tinge off environmentalism, and capitalize on a longstanding personal concern by casting it in terms readily apparent to average voters.  In its budget proposal, the Clinton Administration is seeking more than $1 billion in new spending to help local governments preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and promote environmentally sensitive economic development. The Administration calls it a ''livability agenda,'' and in addition seeks another $1 billion for a ''lands legacy initiative'' to preserve parklands.</p>
        <p>''It's an upscale issue in the sense that if you're worried about your basic material well-being, you don't have so much time to be worried about your quality of life,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster in Washington who said he saw increasing interest in the issue among political clients. ''But once you pass that threshold, even in rural areas, where family farms are threatened by development, this is really an issue that cuts across the board for folks.''</p>
        <p>Predicting just how much steam a given issue may have in an election, much less a Presidential contest still more than a year off, is notoriously difficult, and an economic downturn could quickly relegate sprawl to the  back burner. But Mr. Mellman notes that many of the Congressional seats in swing districts are centered in suburban areas, so the issue could well loom large in local contests.</p>
        <p>Precisely because most land-use decisions are the province of cities, counties and states, it is not entirely clear what role the Federal Government may play. In announcing the Administration's initiative last month, Mr. Gore took pains to say that the Government should not act as ''beauty commissar'' but should instead provide financial incentives -- like transportation aid -- for localities to work together.</p>
        <p>Richard Moe, who was chief of staff to Vice President Walter F. Mondale and is now president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, said that although sprawl was often portrayed as the natural free-market consequence of normal and desirable growth, the reality was that government action at all levels had effectively subsidized it for years, by actions as simple as building Federal office buildings on the outer edges of cities instead of downtown.</p>
        <p>''State policy is the single most important factor in trying to deal with this issue, and there's not a one-size-fits-all solution,'' said Mr. Moe, an author of the book ''Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl'' (Henry Holt, 1998). ''Sprawl is affecting people much more directly, in terms of air quality, visual blight, all these manifestations,'' he said in an interview. ''It's hitting people right in the face, and they see it and know it and don't like it. They're not quite clear what needs to be done, but they know that the way we're doing it is not right.''</p>
        <p>In a recent speech to the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Moe ticked off a litany of sprawl's reach: Since 1950, Pennsylvania has lost more than 4 million acres of farmland, an area larger than Connecticut and Rhode Island combined;  metropolitan Phoenix now covers some 600 square miles, an area larger than Delaware; and by at least some estimates, over the next half-century sprawl is expected to consume more than 3.5 million acres of California's Great Central Valley, the nation's greengrocer.</p>
        <p>If sprawl is often couched as a motherhood issue, not every group approves of efforts to limit it. The National Association of Home Builders has warned that it will fight any efforts to limit new Federal money for infrastructure like roads. In some cases, developers have successfully co-opted anti-sprawl efforts. In Arizona last fall, a measure narrowly passed that would set aside $20 million a year for 11 years to buy open space, in exchange for a ban on development fees and restrictions on urban growth.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Castellanos, the Republican consultant, said Mr. Gore could be hurt by any sign that he still subscribed to a ''fairly 60's-style environmental agenda,'' and he insisted that the Republicans' most important issue was the high taxes that forced families to work longer hours to keep up.</p>
        <p>''When it comes to quality of life, you can either give someone a park to go to, or you can give her more time to go to the park,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Mellman, the Democratic pollster, said it would be possible for Democrats to attack Republican candidates who seemed too willing to allow unbridled development.</p>
        <p>But he added: ''I think it's really an issue that unites more than it divides. It goes to the question, can you understand and articulate the kinds of concerns that people have in their lives. This is an opportunity to do that.''</p>
