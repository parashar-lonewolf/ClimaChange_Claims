        <p>In their third debate, Gov. John G. Rowland and his Democratic challenger, William E. Curry Jr., sparred tonight over many of the same issues raised in their first two meetings: education, transportation, the environment and the possibility of a third Indian casino in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>But unlike the first two debates, this one took place in Stamford, in the heart of affluent and vote-rich Fairfield County, where issues like urban sprawl and increasing traffic congestion are election priorities.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, if there was a difference tonight in the two candidates' increasingly familiar refrains from the two past debates -- Mr. Rowland's steady recitation of his achievements in eight years, and Mr. Curry's itemized indictments of the ways in which he says the governor has failed to improve life for middle- and low-income people -- it was in Mr. Curry's eagerness to compare his thoughts on open space and commuter trains with Mr. Rowland's two-term track record.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry painted the Rowland administration as a group of road builders uninterested in innovative public-transportation solutions to relieve the congestion that clogs Interstate 95 many hours a day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland countered with statistics on how many buses and commuter-train cars have been added to solve congestion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry also hammered Mr. Rowland for supporting a plan to build towering high-capacity electricity lines through Fairfield County instead of investing in renewable energy sources. He also accused Mr. Rowland of not doing more to improve Connecticut's air quality, which is among the nation's worst.</p>
        <p>''The governor could have been a hero to every school kid who carries around an inhaler,'' Mr. Curry said. ''Instead, he caved in to the energy companies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland stuck to his main points: 150,000 new jobs in the last 10 years; 30,000 acres of recently bought open space in Fairfield County; public schools whose students that score among the highest in the country; experienced leadership in tough economic times.</p>
        <p>Political experts say Mr. Curry has refined his message and curtailed his habit of giving meandering answers since the first debate with Mr. Rowland on Oct. 7, moves that may translate into more votes on Election Day.</p>
        <p>But, they added, with only two weeks left to campaign and only one-quarter of the money that the Rowland campaign has raised, Mr. Curry has reached the moment of truth. If he is to win, experts say, he must do something immediately to catapult himself ahead or damage the governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry remains publicly optimistic. On Monday, he highlighted the silver lining in a just-released University of Connecticut poll that showed Mr. Rowland leading by 15 percentage points among likely voters. Two weeks ago, Mr. Curry noted, he had trailed by 18 points, evidence, he said, that his message was beginning to sink in. The poll, of 608 likely voters, has a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.</p>
        <p>But the UConn survey held other clues suggesting that a full-fledged Curry comeback may not be imminent. Those surveyed indicated that improving public education is their top concern in choosing the next governor, and that Mr. Rowland would do that better than Mr. Curry, by 43 percent to 31 percent.</p>
        <p>Balancing the $12.3 billion state budget, which now faces a $400 million deficit, was the second-greatest concern of those surveyed. On that issue, respondents favored the governor over Mr. Curry by 46 percent to 30 percent.</p>
        <p>But perhaps most worrisome for Mr. Curry is his relative lack of support from fellow Democrats. While 85 percent of Republicans support Mr. Rowland, Mr. Curry carries only 57 percent of Democrats, the poll found.</p>
        <p>Most Connecticut voters are independent; among them, the poll found Mr. Rowland leading Mr. Curry by 42 percent to 31 percent.</p>
        <p>The two candidates are scheduled to debate once more, next Monday.</p>
