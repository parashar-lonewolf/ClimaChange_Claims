        <p>Corporate executives live in fear of what happened to the Coca-Cola Company. Following reports that scores of Belgian children fell ill after drinking the company's trademark beverage, the Governments of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands ordered bans on Coke products.</p>
        <p>The Government decisions -- and the resulting concern by consumers over the safety of the company's soft drinks -- create a significant public relations challenge for the company, according to management professors and consultants. Coca-Cola has issued a statement assuring consumers that there are ''no health or safety issues'' concerning its products, but the outside experts say the company's reputation remains at risk.</p>
        <p>''Any time the government bans your product, it sends a very, very strong signal to the public,'' said Steven Fink, president of the Lexicon Communications Corporation, a crisis-management firm based in Los Angeles. Unlike a voluntary recall, in which a company is seen as acting on its own, a ban may suggest that regulators believe a company is not taking sufficient steps to protect the public.</p>
        <p>The question now facing Coca-Cola is whether it is moving aggressively enough to reassure the public by explaining clearly what caused the events in Belgium and by making its top executives available. While the current crisis is not as serious as the one faced in 1982 by Johnson &amp; Johnson when some packages of Tylenol had been tampered with or by Source Perrier S.A. over contamination of its bottled water in 1990, how Coca-Cola handles this is critical to its reputation, the experts say. Any doubt about the safety or quality of its beverages needs to be erased as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>''Consumers will find it very easy not to consume this brand, for days or weeks,'' said Stephen A. Greyser, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>Some management professors and consultants say that Coca-Cola needs to do more.</p>
        <p>A company spokesman declined to comment on Coca-Cola's handling of the recall, arguing that ''it is premature to do the Monday morning quarterbacking.'' The company issued a statement saying that defective carbon dioxide and an external odor on some of its cans had caused the consumers in Belgium to feel ill. Coke also emphasized it was taking the complaints seriously and was working with the Belgian officials to make sure its products are safe.</p>
        <p>But crisis-management experts say that any company faced with a safety concern over its products must do everything in its power to persuade the public that it is addressing that concern. The company needs both to explain why some children became ill and to make clear how it plans to make sure there are no future problems, they say. If it is successful, even as tragic an event as the tampering with Tylenol will raise its credibility, they say.</p>
        <p>The company needs to ''overreact,'' said Gerald C. Meyers, a business professor at the University of Michigan. He maintains that the company's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, should speak out, assuring the public that the company is doing all it can. ''Nobody less than Ivester should come forward,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Company executives in Belgium have commented on the situation, according to the Coca-Cola spokesman. While he confirmed that Mr. Ivester had not been quoted about the events, he said that Coca-Cola ''is a local business in 200 countries.''</p>
        <p>But while Coca-Cola apparently hopes to limit any concerns to a handful of European countries, the danger is that the anxiety over its products could spread. ''I would expect that this would be contagious,'' Mr. Meyers said.</p>
        <p>''What they are dealing with is their credibility,'' he added.</p>
