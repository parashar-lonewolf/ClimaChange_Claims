        <p>LEAD: The Environmental Protection Agency said today that pending legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act would substantially reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency said today that pending legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act would substantially reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>According to an analysis made available by the E.P.A.'s Administrator, William K. Reilly, the requirements and incentives in the clean air bill for switching from oil to cleaner-burning fuels would save the United States at least 800,000 to a million barrels of oil a day in the next decade.</p>
        <p>That is considerably more than the 606,000 barrels of oil the nation was importing each day from Iraq and Kuwait before the invasion.</p>
        <p>Some industrial groups dispute the savings in oil consumption that could result from the clean air act. But environmentalists and other supporters of the bill said the E.P.A. findings could help speed Congressional action on it.</p>
        <p>Both houses of Congress have passed the bill and differences are being ironed out in a conference. But work in conference has been slow and there has been concern that an agreement would not be reached before Congress adjourns at the end of October.</p>
        <p>''With American lives at stake in the Middle East, even the most outrageous industrial lobbyist could not oppose reducing our nation's addiction to crude oil,'' said Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, the nation's biggest conservation group. Mr. Hair said the improvements in the Clean Air Act proposed by President Bush ''are exactly what the American people want.''</p>
        <p>R. G. Ensz, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group that opposes some aspects of the clean air bill, said his group had not seen the analysis. ''Frankly, we would be surprised if the Clean Air Act resulted in improved energy security,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the economic cost of the legislation range up to $20 billion for such things as scrubbers to reduce sulfur emmissions from electric utilities and new controls on automobile tail pipe emissions. It is also expected to reduce costs of illnesses caused by air pollution.</p>
        <p>Another bill before the Senate that would cut domestic oil consumption requires that autos achieve a fuel efficiency of 40 miles a gallon. It would save the nation another 2.8 million barrels of oil a day by 2001, said Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada and author of the legislation.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, however, opposes the fuel effiency standards because, Mr. Reilly said, they would create other problems, like reducing the competitiveness of American-made cars and delaying the introduction of newer, cleaner cars.</p>
        <p>Despite the expected savings in oil consumption as a result of the Clean Air Act, Mr. Reilly said that the Administration, in addition to the bill, continued to favor the development of new domestic sources of oil, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists strongly oppose drilling in the refuge, saying that the amount of oil there is not worth destroying the wilderness.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reilly said the oil there could be developed without harming wildlife. ''Our energy future has to include both conservation and development'' he said during a meeting with New York Times reporters and editors today.</p>
        <p>Effect of Cleaner Fuels</p>
        <p>According to the E.P.A. analysis of the pending clean air bill, new provisions requiring nine cities with particularly dirty air to mandate that cars burn cleaner fuels would reduce oil use by 500,000 barrels a day.</p>
        <p>In addition, the requirement in the legislation that seeks to reduce the pollution that causes acid rain would probably induce many electric utilities now burning oil to switch to natural gas. That could save 300,000 to 500,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the analysis, which was prepared for the environmental agency by ICF Resources Inc., a Fairfax, Va., consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said that requirements of the bill that would crack down on tailpipe emissions and gasoline vapors that escape from the engine or during refueling would produce additional oil savings because pollution is really wasted fuel.</p>
        <p>An analysis done by the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Officers found that the fuel-switching provisions of the clean air bill could save the country up to 2.4 million barrels a day.</p>
