        <p>THE work of evolution is usually done on a time scale of millennia, too protracted for scientists to witness. So biologists were surprised by a finding that a bird known as the blackcap had evolved an entirely new migration pathway in a mere 40 years, right under the watchful binoculars of Europe's devoted bird enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>The blackcap, a European wood warbler and relative of American gnatcatchers and kinglets, appears to have developed the genetic program for an entirely new migration route that shuttles it each winter from Central Europe to England rather than to the warmer climes normally sought by these birds in the western Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>"The really surprising thing was that the adaptation to this new migratory behavior developed so rapidly," said Dr. A. J. Helbig, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Heidelberg. He was an author of the new study in the current issue of the journal Nature. "It's the first demonstration that evolutionary processes can be much quicker than we thought," he said.</p>
        <p>Researchers have been increasingly concerned about the ability of long-distance migrants to adapt to myriad changes in their environment as humans alter the planet ever faster.</p>
        <p>"Long-distance migrants breed in one place, overwinter in another and pass through any number of habitats in between," said Dr. Frank Moore, an ornithologist at the University of Southern Mississippi. "Looking at this from the positive side, the paper shows the birds can respond rapidly. That's why this is so exciting."</p>
        <p>But Dr. Moore cautions that while blackcaps seem able to adapt their migrating habits quickly, such evolution may not be a solution to all changes, particularly the habitat degradation commonly experienced by migrants.</p>
        <p>"If the change is simply destructive," he said, "if a bird is given no alternatives, it doesn't matter how much genetic variability you have or how rapidly you adapt."</p>
        <p>Researchers also expressed excitement over the study's support for the newly emerging idea that birds may be able to serve as accurate indicators of climate change.</p>
        <p>Scientists say the blackcaps' migratory shift is typical of changes that have been seen in bird species around the world. For more than a century, ornithologists have noticed increasing numbers of species venturing farther and farther northward to pass the winter.</p>
        <p>By showing that blackcaps were genetically programmed to fly to England, the study indicated that the recent worldwide changes in bird migration might be more than short-term behavioral adjustments to the weather. If the changes in blackcaps are any indication, Dr. Helbig said, the large-scale alterations in bird migration could likewise be genetic changes, the result of rapid evolution in action.</p>
        <p>"The genetic evidence, that is the real news," said Dr. Paul Kerlinger, director of the Cape May Bird Observatory, a center for bird migration studies operated by the New Jersey Audubon Society. "We know that migration can change in very short periods of time, but being able to link those changes to a genetic component, these researchers have taken it two, even four or five steps beyond what's been done before."</p>
        <p>Blackcaps are found across all of Europe, north to where the forest retreats from the cold, south to the Mediterranean and east to the Ural mountains in Russia.</p>
        <p>Before 1950, birds seen in Britain were either those there to breed for the summer before moving on to winter farther south, or those passing through during fall migration on their way from Scandinavia to sunnier climes.</p>
        <p>Since that time, birdwatchers have noted a steady increase in the blackcaps wintering in England. Today the birds can be counted by the thousands during the winter in England and ornithologists have found that many of the birds carry tags indicating that they spent the summer breeding in Germany and Austria. 'Ingenious, Meticulous' Experiments</p>
        <p>To test whether a genetically altered migration program was causing these birds to deviate some 800 miles from the rest of the birds leaving Central Europe each fall, researchers from the Max Planck Institute in Radolfzell, Germany, collected birds from Weston-super-Mare, about 100 miles east of London on the Bristol Channel.</p>
        <p>In what Dr. Kerlinger praised as "ingenious, meticulous" experiments, Dr. Peter Berthold, Dr. Helbig and colleagues removed the birds to Germany and bred 41 experimental young birds over two seasons, along with birds caught in Germany for comparison. Since all the birds in the experiment had never been out of Germany and were subject to the same environmental cues, the researchers said, the only way for them to find their way to England would be through a genetically encoded map.</p>
        <p>The birds' preferred migratory path was tested by putting them in covered cups lined with typewriter correction paper on which, as they tried repeatedly to take off, their feet scratched out their preferred direction in tiny birdprints on the painted paper.</p>
        <p>The offspring of birds that had wintered in England left tracks in a direction northwest from Radolfzell, Germany, toward Weston-super-Mare, England. The offspring of birds that had wintered in Germany, by contrast, left tracks headed on the birds' standard route southwest toward the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p>The researchers pointed to the birds' preferences for different migratory paths as evidence that they were guided by a map programmed into their genes. Researchers say that as much as 10 percent of the population that breeds in Central Europe and once went en masse to the Mediterranean in winter now heads instead for Britain. Birdseed and Evolution</p>
        <p>Commenting on the study in Nature, Dr. William J. Sutherland of the University of East Anglia in Britain suggested that blackcaps might have been encouraged to pass the winter in Weston-super-Mare by the many Britons who put out birdseed. By fattening up the first few blackcaps whose genetic mutations brought them to England, bird lovers have given these creatures a better chance for breeding upon return to Central Europe in the summer.</p>
        <p>The growing popularity of feeding winter birds both in America and Europe may be influencing migratory paths and populations worldwide, researchers believe. Those sunflower seeds and clumps of suet people put in their yards may thus in their own small way be influencing the course of evolution.</p>
