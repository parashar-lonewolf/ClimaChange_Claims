        <p>The Better to See With</p>
        <p>Giant squid, those monsters of the deep, are famous for (among other things) having eyes the size of dinner plates.</p>
        <p>Now comes word that another sea creature had eyes that could just as easily have graced a table. A researcher at the University of California Museum of Paleontology and colleagues report that some types of ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles that lived 90 million to 250 million years ago, had eyes up to 10 inches in diameter, rivaling those of the largest giant squid. The ichthyosaur eyes are the largest ever found in a vertebrate.</p>
        <p>Ichthyosaurs, which ranged in size from about 7 feet to more than 30, had fishlike bodies, including fins and vertical tails. Among the fossils studied, those of a genus called Ophthalmosaurus had the largest eyes for its size, about 9 inches in diameter for a body length of roughly 13 feet.</p>
        <p>In general, the larger the eye, the better it can see in low light conditions. The researchers, writing in the journal Nature, estimate that the ophthalmosaurs could probably have detected point light sources (like those from photoluminescent prey) in deep water, and suggest that the creatures dived to depths of close to 2,000 feet.</p>
        <p>Supporting the idea that ophthalmosaurs were deep divers, the researchers found evidence in the fossil bones that the reptiles suffered from the bends, which occurs when an animal (or human) dives to great depths and rises too quickly, with the pressure changes causing gas bubbles to expand in tissues.</p>
        <p>Atomic Clock Watch</p>
        <p>Strange things happen during a solar eclipse. Twilight falls, the wind can shift, birds stop singing: it almost seems that time stands still.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than almost. Experiments during some eclipses over the last half century have appeared to show strange things happening to atomic clocks and pendulums, attributed to some unexplained feature of gravity.</p>
        <p>A set of experiments during four partial eclipses from 1987 to 1992 was particularly odd: it showed a small but significant accumulated time difference between atomic clocks in the same laboratory, where the gravitational effects, if any, would have been the same.</p>
        <p>But a new study by German scientists during August's total solar eclipse in Europe contradicts these previous findings. The experiment used four atomic clocks of three different types, and all were placed in an air-conditioned basement laboratory in Wessling, Germany, with a computer recording their time differences every four seconds between Aug. 3 and 23 (the eclipse occurred on the 11th). The results showed no anomalous changes in the relative rates of the four clocks.</p>
        <p>Haze Over China</p>
        <p>Burning of soft coal to feed its growing economy has made China the world leader in sulfur emissions, and its neighbors are complaining about acid rain caused by all that sulfur. But China's economic progress is causing problems at home in the fields as well.</p>
        <p>A NASA-financed study by a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and colleagues shows that heavy haze in China's chief growing regions may be cutting agricultural production by up to one-third.</p>
        <p>The aerosol haze, which the researchers say is most likely a result of the burning of coal and other fuels, acts like a filter, absorbing some of the sunlight that would ordinarily be used by plants for photosynthesis.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who reported on their work in a recent issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said that sunlight was reduced by 5 percent to 30 percent over the roughly 250,000 square miles of hazy areas in China, which include some of the country's most productive farmland.</p>
        <p>The scientists also point out that similar haze problems exist in many developing countries.</p>
