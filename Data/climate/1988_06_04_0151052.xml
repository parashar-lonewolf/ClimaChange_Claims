        <p>LEAD: The most striking aspect of ''Mood Music,'' a futuristic ''cartoon opera'' created by Julia Heyward, the performance artist, is its use of light.

        <p>The most striking aspect of ''Mood Music,'' a futuristic ''cartoon opera'' created by Julia Heyward, the performance artist, is its use of light. The four principal characters in her latest mixed-media phantasmagoria wear outfits studded with flashing chaser lights that accelerate, reverse direction and change pattern. As they converse and sing in an allusive poetic argot that mixes techno-jargon and hip street slang, the actors seem to disappear behind their illuminated garb. Humanity has been reduced to an extension of the technology that supports it.</p>
        <p>''Mood Music,'' which plays at the Kitchen (512 West 19th Street) through next Saturday, begins promisingly, as Ms. Heyward welcomes the audience to ''the New Dark Age'' and reflects in amusing oracular verse on the impact of chemicals on the ozone layer. ''Hairspray rapes heaven,'' she chants. ''The sun is a gun.'' Slide projections show her face wreathed in fire.</p>
        <p>But once the evening expands from a solo performance into a play with actors portraying symbolic characters named Mood Thing (Ms. Heyward), Mr. Link (Ken Butler), Cowgirl Mouth (Kim Brown) and Fertility Goddess (Angel Dean), the work becomes increasingly incoherent and slow-moving. The bulk of ''Mood Music'' is a metaphysical fashion show in which Mr. Link, the representative of a lighting company called Beamers, introduces its new fall line.</p>
        <p>Actors model computer fashions that ''access'' the brain, heart and soul. While Ms. Heyward's work has always seemed strongly influenced by Laurie Anderson, both the jargon of ''Mood Music'' and the pulsing electronic score by Robert FitzSimons seem uncomfortably imitative. With its eerie electronic pulses and its chants, the music reiterates sounds and ideas that Ms. Anderson explored with far more subtlety and expertise in ''United States.''</p>
