        <p>Four weeks before leaders of the world's big industrial nations are to gather at a Baltic Sea resort in northern Germany, the police conducted sweeping raids on Wednesday on the offices and homes of left-wing campaigners whom they suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting.</p>
        <p>The raids, in which 900 police officers searched 40 sites in half a dozen cities, amounted to a show of force against potentially violent protesters at the meeting of the Group of 8.</p>
        <p>Like other countries that have been the host in recent years for this gathering, Germany is nervous about a repetition of the riots in Genoa, Italy, in 2001, when the police killed a demonstrator.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors said they were investigating 18 people suspected of belonging to a group that they said was planning fire-bombings and other attacks to disrupt the meeting in Heiligendamm, an expensive, out-of-the-way resort on a stretch of coast in the former East Germany.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors did not announce any arrests, but they said the people on their list were suspected of carrying out fire-bombings and other, less severe attacks in Hamburg and Berlin in the last two years.</p>
        <p>The Interior Ministry said it would tighten controls at border crossings to stop troublemakers from entering Germany -- a tactic it used successfully last summer during the World Cup soccer tournament. Normally, Germany's borders with its European Union neighbors are wide open.</p>
        <p>''We want to distinguish between those who come to demonstrate peacefully and those who plan violence,'' said Christian Sachs, a ministry spokesman. He characterized the security precautions as the most extensive for one event in Germany since World War II.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to welcome the leaders of Britain, Canada, Italy, France, Japan, Russia and the United States to the three-day meeting on June 6. She is setting an agenda that includes topics as varied as climate change and Africa. But terrorism is also likely to be on the minds of the leaders.</p>
        <p>At the last Group of 8 meeting in Western Europe, held in Gleneagles, Scotland, in July 2005, the leaders had barely settled in when news came of deadly bombings on the London transit system.</p>
        <p>Germany has been on edge about new terrorist threats since last month, when the Interior Ministry said it had learned that a radical Islamic group was plotting to strike an American installation here. The United States tightened security at its embassy in Berlin and other diplomatic buildings.</p>
        <p>''That threat was absolutely serious,'' said Rolf Tophoven, a German counterterrorism expert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sachs said there was no evidence linking that threat to the Group of 8 meeting. The authorities say they are more worried about radical antiglobalization groups, which have used the Internet to mobilize tens of thousands of protesters at previous Group of 8 meetings, even those held in similarly remote locations.</p>
        <p>German authorities are leaving little to chance. They have constructed a 7.5-mile, $17 million fence that will cut off access to Heiligendamm. Local residents have complained bitterly about the concrete-and-barbed-wire barrier, which some have likened to a new Berlin Wall.</p>
        <p>Nine naval ships will patrol the waters off the resort, while 16,000 local police officers and 1,100 soldiers will guard the perimeter, keeping protesters several miles from the meeting. Protest organizers said the security measures eclipsed those for President Bush's visit last July to the same part of Germany.</p>
        <p>Monty Schädel, a local organizer of the demonstrations, said antiglobalization forces in Germany had been subjected to intense surveillance by the police in recent weeks. ''Whenever three or four people get together for a meeting, the police are watching,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The organizers have told the police to expect 100,000 demonstrators in Rostock and other towns near the meeting. Mr. Schädel said the actual turnout could range from 50,000 to 150,000 people.</p>
        <p>Germany has had relatively little trouble with radical leftist groups since the 1970s and 1980s, when the Red Army Faction, also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, carried out more than 30 assassinations.</p>
        <p>But as the meeting draws closer, tensions are rising. Protesters recently splashed paint on a hotel in Heiligendamm. In December, a car belonging to a senior Finance Ministry official was set on fire.</p>
