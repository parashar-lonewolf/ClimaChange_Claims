        <p>Over the objections of China (population 1.2 billion), the Security Council cleared the way today for the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu (population 10,000) to become the 189th member of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The General Assembly is expected to admit the new country formally later this year.</p>
        <p>The assembly spokeswoman, Shirley Brownell, said that the organization was trying to place a call to Tuvalu through Fiji today to tell the Tuvaluans the good news. Tuvalu, which occupies nine coral atolls halfway between Hawaii and Australia, is the fourth small Pacific nation to apply to join the organization recently. Last year Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati became members.</p>
        <p>Tuvalu, with no point of land higher than about 15 feet, is one of the countries most threatened by rising seas caused by global warming. A diplomat from another small island nation suggested that Tuvalu may have decided that now was a good time to join the United Nations, which took up the problems of small island states at a special assembly session last fall.</p>
        <p>Formerly a British colony known as the Ellice Islands, Tuvalu became independent in 1978.</p>
        <p>The Security Council vote today was 14-0 with one abstention -- China's. Tuvalu, with a total land area only one-tenth the size of Washington, D.C., has diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province. China said Tuvalu was in violation of the United Nations resolution recognizing Beijing as China's sole representative.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has now grown from 51 members at its founding in 1945 to nearly four times that number.</p>
