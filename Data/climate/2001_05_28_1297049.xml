        <p>In October 1999, Gov. George E. Pataki announced that New York would impose the toughest emissions rules in the country on old power plants, a major source of both acid rain and smog. His aides said that the new regulations would be out in less than a year.</p>
        <p>Nineteen months later, there are still no regulations, though officials say a preliminary version will probably become public this week. Factions within the administration have fought over whether to stick to the letter of the governor's promise, and indications are that in some areas it will fall short, though it will still be one of the most aggressive programs of its kind. Many of the same environmentalists who praised Mr. Pataki in 1999 now complain that he is not going far enough.</p>
        <p>These struggles illustrate how the stakes have risen since 1999. The price of electricity has climbed sharply, and state officials see a possible power supply crisis on the horizon. Smog in New York, after decades of steady improvement, has worsened again. Studies have shown that some of the consequences of air pollution are worse than previously thought, like poisoning of mountain lakes and asthma among urban children. And Mr. Pataki, planning to run for a third term next year, has taken pains to distance himself on air quality issues from President Bush, a fellow Republican.</p>
        <p>Power plants built before 1970 are subject to few emissions rules. A handful upstate that burn coal or oil account for a large share of the state's output of sulfur dioxide, the major cause of acid rain and a source of soot and mercury, an element that poisons lakes and streams.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki had pledged in 1999 to make New York's power plants cut sulfur dioxide emissions to 50 percent below new federal standards. New York and other Northeast states had already agreed to steep reductions in power plant emissions of nitrogen oxides -- the main contributor to smog, and a cause of acid rain -- in the summer, and Mr. Pataki said that he would make those year-round requirements. The new rules, he said, would be phased in from 2003 to 2007.</p>
        <p>Since then, power companies have lobbied hard to ease those standards, and have found a sympathetic ear at the Public Service Commission, the state agency that regulates them. That has created conflicts between the commission and the State Department of Environmental Conservation, where officials drafting the new regulations largely favored adhering to the proposal.</p>
        <p>''We have made it very clear to the P.S.C. and the governor's office that this is a factor that could drive up the price of electricity and hurt reliability,'' said a top official at a company that owns power plants upstate.</p>
        <p>Such warnings rang loudly at the commission, where there has been mounting concern about rising electric rates and a possible supply crisis in the coming years. Administration officials are aware that such problems could do political damage to the governor as he runs for re-election. ''Let's just say that this is an agency that is very sensitive these days to questions about price and supply,'' said a top commission official.</p>
        <p>John P. Cahill, a senior policy adviser to the governor who has played a central role in resolving such disputes and shaping the regulation, played down the importance of tensions between the agencies and expressed confidence that the pollution rules would not affect the price or availability of power. He attributed the delay in producing a regulation to the administration's being conscientious in hearing both the power producers and the environmentalists. ''I think that they have been given unprecedented access,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, the Democratic chairman of the Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, and a frequent critic of the administration, traced the delay to politics. ''The heart and soul of their energy and environmental policies is to avoid blame for what might happen to electric power, to the price and to the reliability, between now and 2002,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The power companies appear to have won some concessions, as shown by a draft version of the regulation that the administration has circulated, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times by an environmental group, and that officials say will closely resemble the final product. Its most controversial feature would allow the companies to achieve a small portion of the required emissions reductions not at their New York plants, but at plants they own in neighboring states -- a plan that does not conform precisely to the governor's pledge. Environmentalists say that although any reductions are good, the benefit to New York is greater if the reductions are achieved here. The draft plan also pushes the starting date of the sulfur controls back by a year, to 2004, and leaves unclear whether the rules would be fully in place by 2007, as Mr. Pataki originally said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cahill would not address specifics, but he defended the administration's modification of the initial plan. ''We don't want to have a regulation out there that is not going to be effective in implementation,'' he said. ''If some leeway on the time allows these plants to achieve that in a meaningful way, that's certainly something that the department needs to consider before it promulgates its reg.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups are complaining about such concessions, and they say the governor should go beyond the 1999 plan, arguing that the landscape has changed, scientifically and politically.</p>
        <p>''We don't think this regulation lives up to the governor's promises,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, of the American Lung Association of New York State. ''But beyond that, our substantive understanding of the role of particulate pollution, of the extent of the problems caused by acid rain, mercury and greenhouse gases, has all grown in the last 19 months.''</p>
        <p>Since the governor made his proposal, the talk among environmentalists has shifted from controlling two power plant pollutants, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, to four, adding mercury and carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. President Bush contributed to that by saying, during last year's campaign, that he favored a national four-pollutant standard, a stance he has since dropped. In addition, Mr. Bush, unlike President Clinton, opposes the commitment to carbon dioxide reductions made at an international gathering in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts last month became the first state to impose a four-pollutant regulation on older power plants, leapfrogging past New York's proposed regulation, and Connecticut and New Hampshire are also moving in that direction. Mr. Pataki said last month that his administration was considering a four-pollutant plan, though officials say the final regulation will address just two. And the governor has criticized Mr. Bush's moves, saying that he thinks the federal government should adopt a four-pollutant standard.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists concede that reducing nitrogen and sulfur emissions would also reduce mercury, even without a rule to that effect, and New York already complies with the Kyoto reductions on carbon dioxide. But they want to push for more, and some note that with the governor promoting his environmental credentials as part of his re-election platform, this may be the time. ''As we see it,'' said Ashok Gupta, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, ''the big question, on one of the big issues of the day, is, is Governor Pataki going to be a national leader or not?'' To that, Mr. Cahill said, ''Whether they're not getting everything that they want, I think they would all recognize that this is a very pivotal step dealing with the problems of acid rain and air emissions.''</p>
