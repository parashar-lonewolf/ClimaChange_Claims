        <p>TV Land must first acknowledge that its demographic is way too broad (Lorne Manly). Fifty- and 60-year-olds grew up in a different time than 40-year-olds did. Boomers of the 1960s lived through a decade of turmoil, creative explosion and youthful hope for the world.</p>

        <p>TV Land must first acknowledge that its demographic is way too broad (Lorne Manly). Fifty- and 60-year-olds grew up in a different time than 40-year-olds did. Boomers of the 1960s lived through a decade of turmoil, creative explosion and youthful hope for the world.</p>
        <p>Boomers are a catholic generation. They watched ''That Was the Week That Was'' more often than ''Laugh-In;'' listened to Dylan and made rude jokes about the Monkees; watched ''The Prisoner'' and explored the possibilities of global warming, while the grown-ups said the ''hippies'' were crazy.</p>
        <p>But most of all, TV Land, stop trying to ''sell'' to us. We're hip to the hype, you know. We invented it.</p>
