        <p>Ah, winter! ''When Winter Comes,'' Verlyn Klinkenborg's essay about his country winter (The Rural Life, Dec. 17), makes me nostalgic for the remembered winters of my childhood, in Buffalo and later in Montreal, winters of hip-deep snow and relentless cold and the profound quiet that heavy snowfall brings. We surrendered to winter, happy victims; we reveled in it.</p>

        <p>Cities have had their winter rhythms, too, and but for the tragedy of global warming, would still. When the snow lasted more than a day before turning to slush, when recess meant a snowball fight, before the days of Polartec and Thermolite, when children played outside until we couldn't feel our fingers, toes and noses and Mom had hot chocolate waiting as we put our mittens on the radiator to dry for the next time, and our boots by the hot-water heater, well, those were the days.</p>
