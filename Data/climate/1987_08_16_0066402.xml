        <p>LEAD: CERTAIN AMERICAN SCIENTISTS WASTED SOME time recently trying to make a superconductor out of the wrong element. They were chasing a phantom - a typographical error by the physicist Ching-Wu Chu. Certain American scientists believe that the error was no accident.</p>
        <p>CERTAIN AMERICAN SCIENTISTS WASTED SOME time recently trying to make a superconductor out of the wrong element. They were chasing a phantom - a typographical error by the physicist Ching-Wu Chu. Certain American scientists believe that the error was no accident.</p>
        <p>Chu stunned his colleagues and competitors in laboratories around the world last February by announcing the discovery of a new material that would make the phenomenon of superconductivity commercially feasible at last. But Chu refused to name the material before official publication of his discovery, weeks away. His claim set off a stampede. For experimenters struggling to take part, a hellish month followed - a month of tense days and sleepless nights. A practical superconductor, a material through which electricity flows without losing even the smallest fraction of its energy to resistance, would be a turning point in scientific history. Scientists were glimpsing a new age of electricity - a world of absurdly cheap power and trains floating in the grips of magnets. Enormous corporate interests were already at stake. Patent lawyers were chaperoning the research teams like pilot fish surrounding sharks.</p>
        <p>So Chu's incomplete announcement was every scientist's nightmare: the breakthrough of a generation, and someone else had the secret formula. ''It was gruesome,'' says Robert J. Cava, a member of a team at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories, one of the major institutions near the forefront of the research. ''There was a lot of pressure on us to figure out what was going on.'' The Bell researchers say they remained in the dark until the last days before publication, but other scientists heard a provocative rumor: that the esoteric element ytterbium was the key to the new superconductive material.</p>
        <p>Ytterbium was indeed the element named in the manuscript that had been submitted by Chu's team, relative unknowns at the University of Houston, to Physical Review Letters, the premier journal for reporting breakthroughs in physics. But when the journal appeared on March 2, the final paper named a different element, yttrium.</p>
        <p>Chu had pleaded with the journal for special handling, insisting on secrecy, fearful that the editors would leak. ''Which we now know they did - like a sieve,'' says Arthur J. Freeman, a theoretical physicist at Northwestern University. ''Only they leaked ytterbium instead of yttrium. I had heard for weeks that the material was ytterbium, and now I know where it came from.''</p>
        <p>As news of the yttrium-ytterbium affair spread through the scientific world, the journal's editors denied vehemently that they had divulged the secret. They privately expressed anger at Chu, suspecting an intentional deception on his part to mislead competing researchers. (Chu's friends share the suspicion. They have been retelling the joke about the king who leaves to his favorite knight the key to his queen's chastity belt, only to hear the knight gallop up behind him, shouting angrily, ''It's the wrong key.'') Chu, in turn, earnestly denies any deception. He explains the mistake as a typist's error, and anyway, he says, he corrected it two weeks before publication. ''I don't understand why those people made such a big deal,'' he says. ''Whether it's a typo or not - it is a typo, I have to say -why should they get so excited?''</p>
        <p>''This is all supersensitive,'' says Myron Strongin, the journal editor responsible for sorting out a flood of superconductivity papers. ''Everybody's uptight. It's of unique scientific importance. And they know Nobel Prizes are on the way.''</p>
        <p>THE SECRECY, THE PETULANCE, THE JOCKEYING for science's top prize, the raw displays of ego and ambition - all these have risen nakedly to the surface in recent months. For researchers, the Nobel Prize is certain, but the precise names it will honor are not. For industry, a patent battle likely to burn through the next decade will hinge on the events of this year.</p>
        <p>Still, when these conflicts recede from memory, a story will remain of scientific discovery in its purest form. The heroes will be a few obsessive physicists driven to understand the strange, shimmering, electronic qualities of crystalline matter and who chose a path that their colleagues either scorned or overlooked. They blended intuition with experiment, mixing weeks and months of patient trial-and-error with an occasionally uncanny insight into structures too small to see.</p>
        <p>Today, superconductivity is becoming a household word. The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union have all begun national programs meant to foster the years of engineering and development that will be needed to make a commercial reality out of the laboratory discoveries. The White House science adviser, William R. Graham, announcing the American program last month, contended that the rewards would be as rich as those that have flowed from the invention of the transistor and the integrated circuit. Yet only a year ago, superconductivity belonged to the obsessive few. It was a piece of scientific esoterica, tantalizing but obscure, for good reason. It seemed to be strictly a creature of the extreme cold near absolute zero.</p>
        <p>Mercury, for example, is an ordinary conductor at room temperature - some small part of any electric current running through it is lost, converted by resistance into heat. In 1911, though, mercury also became the first superconductor. When cooled to 4 kelvins (452 degrees below zero Fahrenheit), or degrees Centigrade above absolute zero - the point at which all atomic motion stops - it suddenly lost all resistance. Scientists slowly realized that the phenomenon might raise the possibility not only of cheap electrical generation and transmission but, also, of powerful magnets and levitation - because it is a peculiar characteristic of superconductors that they float calmly into the air when placed above a magnet.</p>
        <p>But for most practical purposes, the necessity for extreme cold made superconductivity forbiddingly expensive. Just a few applications could justify the necessary cooling apparatus: magnetic resonance imaging machines used in diagnostic medicine, for example, and the powerful magnets that speed subatomic particles around an accelerator. The most exciting applications never passed the stage of drawings or prototypes. The Japanese National Railway made a levitating train, floating in a magnetic field above a metal rail and racing quietly at 300 miles an hour. A superconducting cable at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, though just 16 inches thick, proved capable of carrying one-eighth of all the electricity used by New York City on the hottest of hot days. These demonstrations led no further. But they showed what superconductivity could do.</p>
        <p>The search for materials that become superconductors at warmer temperatures progressed slowly, sometimes proceeding by just tenths of a degree at a time, and by 1973 the temperature of superconductivity had been raised to 23 kelvins. But there progress stopped. Physicists would hear rumors of some improvement, and occasionally the rumors even reached print, setting off minor flurries of futile activity. By the 1980's, though, the field was dying. Many believed that science had reached nature's limit. Only a few kept looking for a high-temperature superconductor, a substance that would work its magic with less cooling or none at all. Ching-Wu Chu was one of those.</p>
        <p>CHU, KNOWN TO HIS FRIENDS BY HIS BAPTISMAL name, Paul, is in his tiny office at the University of Houston, wearing, as usual, a long white lab coat over his jeans, his head framed by a rough helmet of black hair. He is speaking excitedly into the telephone, using one of the increasingly common languages of American physics -scientific Chinese, every fourth word an English technical term. In the laboratory a few feet to the left, the red glow of a furnace is visible; inside, a dark pebble of ceramic hardens at a temperature of 900 degrees Centigrade. Across the hall, Chu's colleague Pei-Herng Hor is also on the telephone, explaining for the 100th time the miracle of superconductivity - conduction with zero resistance, whether over a few feet of wire coiled in a magnet or over transmission lines spanning a continent. ''Not approaching zero, it is zero. Yes. Yes. It can be 10,000 miles long and it's still zero.'' In the quest for this ultimate zero of electricity, Chu's team - barely a dozen men and women, nearly all immigrants, working with second-rank equipment - was among the few serious players remaining.</p>
        <p>Chu was born in 1941, in China's Hunan Province, grew up in Taiwan and graduated from Cheng Kung University there in 1962. He came to New York to get a master's degree at Fordham University and then he moved to the University of California at San Diego, where he came under the magnetic influence of Bernd Matthias, the grand old man of superconductivity. For years, the German-born Matthias was directly or indirectly responsible for almost every improvement in the temperature at which materials become superconductors. If Chu later routinely scoured the world's scientific journals for hints of new materials, it was because Matthias had taught him to. Whenever Matthias learned of a promising substance, he made sure to get a sample and cool it down to the realm of absolute zero; so did Chu. Matthias once told his protege that many of the best ideas come from dreams. In 1982, Chu woke from a dream about sodium sulphide and, for the next two weeks, his team concocted every conceivable version of sodium sulphide. (Every one turned out to be useless.) Chu also shared with his teacher an intuitive feeling for his esoteric substances. ''Paul has beliefs which he can't walk up to a blackboard and prove to you, but, if you talk to him, you realize they come from deep experience,'' says Marvin Cohen, a theoretical physicist at the University of California at Berkeley. ''He has an intimate relationship to his materials. It's different from the cold, analytical, machinelike style of some people in our field.'' A theorist in this quantum age thinks of substances abstractly and mathematically. ''I don't know what color they are, I don't know whether they're heavy or light,'' Cohen says. ''Paul knows the sizes of their atoms, how they act chemically, what kind of crystal structures they go into. He's accumulated these things.''</p>
        <p>In studying superconductivity, Chu took an unusual tack. Instead of staying with metals, which are natural conductors, he worked with oxides, compounds of metallic elements and oxygen, which generally conduct no electric current at all. A few oxide superconductors were known to exist, but their useful temperatures were unpromisingly low. Considering that they were oxides, though, Chu thought it was odd and interesting that these substances would be superconductors at all.</p>
        <p>He told his wife last summer that he was giving himself three years: if he did not find a high-temperature superconductor by 1989, he would give up. Soon after, one day in November, he arrived at work and found on his desk a paper from Zeitschrift fur Physik, a German journal. He glanced at the title -''Possible High Tc Superconductivity . . .'' - and felt a physical shock. ''God,'' he said, ''we had worked so hard on the oxides, and there they got it.''</p>
        <p>A LONG STALEMATE with nature had ended, not in Chu's laboratory, but at the Zurich research center of the International Business Machines Corporation, where two scientists had made the breakthrough reported in Zeitschrift. They, too, were specialists in oxides: Karl Alex Muller, a gentlemanly Swiss physicist who had seemed to be nearing the end of a productive career, and J. Georg Bednorz, an experimentalist and an expert on materials. Their work was guided by Muller's intuitive feeling about oxides but was governed, day to day, by the relentless demands of trial and error, mixing powders in water, dropping them in acid, testing them at cryogenic temperatures. Sometimes, they found, just a tiny change in molecular structure, a substitution of one atom for another at certain places in the patterns that make up crystals, turned a material into a conductor. But as far as superconductivity was concerned, progress was not just slow; it was nonexistent.</p>
        <p>Then Bednorz came across a paper by some French chemists describing an oxide of copper mixed with two other elements, barium and lanthanum. The French had never cooled the substance to look for superconductivity. Bednorz and Muller did -and, on Jan. 27, 1986, they struck gold. As Bednorz cooled his sample, measuring a current passing through tiny wires attached to it, he discovered a sharp drop in resistance. By April, the two men had raised the record for a superconductor from 23 kelvins to 35 - still 397 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. That was not warm enough for new practical applications, but it was warm enough to rekindle interest in superconductivity's future.</p>
        <p>Muller and Bednorz made no announcement. They did not even tell scientists at other I.B.M. laboratories. They submitted a modest paper, not to Physical Review Letters, but to the German journal, which they knew would remain unread by most physicists. One reason for the two scientists' caution was that the history of superconductivity had been littered with false alarms. Another was that Muller and Bednorz wanted to continue their work in peace. ''We expected we would have a delay time of one or two years,'' Bednorz says. ''Even at I.B.M. we didn't spread the preprint. We wanted to measure as much as possible without being pressed by competitors.''</p>
        <p>CHU'S GROUP HAD A routine: the researchers divided up the journals and were responsible for catching any news of even the remotest significance. ''I told them you don't have to understand what you read, but come back and tell us what you think is exciting,'' Chu says. Zeitschrift fur Physik is not an obscure journal, but at places like Bell Laboratories it went unnoticed. ''It's not in our tea room library,'' said Bertram Batlogg, who rushed into the fray at Bell a month later. Chu, calling his staff together that morning last November, had a headstart.</p>
        <p>Racing to confirm the Zurich discovery and advance it to practical temperatures, Chu called on the intuition that his mentor Matthias had tried to foster. Even with the Zurich recipe at hand, Chu was operating almost blind: no one knew exactly what the desirable crystal structure was, because four elements mixed together can produce dramatically different substances depending on how they are baked or how they are cooled. Muller and Bednorz had stumbled upon a particular crystal by an accident of preparation - a different structure from the one discovered by the French. ''That was a kick of luck,'' Bednorz says.  Chu found that he could duplicate the accident, but his first samples of the material were unstable. One day they would prove to be superconductors; four days later, after reacting with water vapor and carbon dioxide in the air, these porous ceramics would once again be worthless. In the middle of this work, at a scientific meeting in Boston last Dec. 4, Chu gave a long-scheduled talk on an earlier oxide superconductor and, at the end, described his latest results with the new materials. Koichi Kitazawa, a physicist at the University of Tokyo, was in the audience. His group, too, had read the I.B.M. paper and begun a race to pursue its promise. After telephoning Tokyo for the latest data in his lab there, he told the Boston meeting about his results so far.</p>
        <p>Chu took him aside and asked, ''Is your sample stable?''</p>
        <p>Kitazawa looked at him. ''It depends,'' he said. ''Four days?'' Chu said. ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>THE WORD WAS OUT. CHU'S group and the Tokyo group quickly learned how to stabilize the I.B.M. material. Scientists at Bell Laboratories invited Kitazawa to present his latest data there, and he did so - traditional scientific openness still outweighed the less familiar urge for competitive secrecy. Bell's scientists hastily assembled a team. Like Chu, they quickly confirmed the Zurich results.</p>
        <p>But for all these groups and the many others who now entered the fray, the question was whether the hint contained in the Zurich discovery could be turned into still other materials that would act as superconductors at even higher temperatures. The difference between 23 kelvins and 35 was historically enormous, but for applications it was not enough. The next goal was 77 kelvins, the temperature that would allow liquid nitrogen to be used as a coolant. Liquid nitrogen is cheap - the supply is as abundant as air. Scientists casually pour it from thermos bottles or even from laboratory hoses into Styrofoam containers.</p>
        <p>Each scientist who considered the possibility of a liquid-nitrogen temperature superconductor brought to the problem a different set of hunches and a different style of experimentation. As a first step, many substituted new elements for the atoms of barium in the Swiss compound. The Bell researchers immediately tried the closely related element strontium, and strontium worked. Chu did a further test, highly characteristic of his working habits. He placed samples of the I.B.M. material under high pressure, using a piece of equipment he calls his ''bomb'' - a custom-made lipstick-sized container capable of creating within it pressure 200,000 times that of the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Chu had ''squeezed'' many materials over the years, knowing that pressure reduces the distances between atoms. Having squeezed earlier superconducting oxides, he knew what to expect: not much. In this case, however, he found that pressure dramatically raised the temperature of superconductivity, to 40 kelvins, then 52, then 57. There were even fleeting, transitory hints of declining resistance at temperatures above 70. Chu next tried substituting smaller atoms: strontium, and then calcium. With calcium, though, the temperature at which superconductivity occurred fell back down, to a discouraging 20 kelvins. ''So we said we should do something else now - no hope with that kind of structure.''</p>
        <p>The materials he was working with were rough, filled with impurities and visible discolorations. Chu tried growing pure single crystals of the materials, but he quickly realized that he lacked the equipment and expertise to compete with the big laboratories. The question of impurity nagged at him. In his desk drawer he kept microscopic photographs from his work on an earlier oxide superconductor, barium lead bismuth oxide, and the photographs showed an eerie, cracked molecular landscape riven with chaotic fragmentation. He wondered about the electronic role of such flaws - ''quantum mechanically, anything is possible,'' he says. And he wondered whether it was a mistake to look for a perfectly regular crystal. Some theorists had proposed that the strangely coordinated flow of electrons needed for superconductivity might be enhanced by complex molecular structures, one-dimensional chains, for instance, or two-dimensional sheets.</p>
        <p>In January, looking over his data, he found one more crucial clue. The impure materials produced hints of superconductivity at high temperatures, but, as the experimenters cooled the samples, the materials were slow to reach zero resistance. When the researchers succeeded in making purer versions of these materials, however, even though superconductivity came more suddenly, the hints at the higher temperatures did not appear. One especially impure sample had come out of the furnace red on the outside instead of shiny black, and green, blue and white on the inside. It was clearly a mixture of different substances and different crystalline arrangements of substances that were otherwise chemically the same. Chu insisted that this bastard ceramic be tested, and it showed a faint signal that it contained some as-yet-undiscovered superconducting substance. ''It gave us confidence something must be there,'' Chu says.</p>
        <p>By now he had expanded his team to include a group at the University of Alabama, headed by his former student Maw-Kuen Wu. This time, the scientists tried a different substitution, again dictated by Chu's sense of atomic size: they mixed in the element yttrium for I.B.M.'s lanthanum. At first, the composition was all wrong. The furnace temperature had to be changed. But on Jan. 29, testing a sample at different temperatures, Wu saw the unmistakable drop in resistance at more than 90 kelvins, only 298 below zero Fahrenheit, the pen line on graph paper falling off a cliff. A few days later, after due consultation with his university's patent lawyers, Chu made his incomplete announcement.</p>
        <p>HE CAUSED CHU'S disease - everybody was trying to duplicate it without knowing his results,'' says Theodore H. Geballe, a Stanford University authority on superconductivity. Even those who suspected that Chu's secret was yttrium - if not the rumored ytterbium - remained off the track; they made the mistake of trying to follow the composition described in the I.B.M. paper, eliminating the impurities that led Chu to an altogether new crystal structure. As one experimenter, Ivan Schuller of Argonne National Laboratory, put it afterward: ''Everybody was trying to do the same thing, imitate what Bednorz and Muller did, and with hindsight that was the completely wrong thing to do. The yttrium compound is a very different sort of beast.''</p>
        <p>When Chu's March paper finally appeared, several groups succeeded over a single weekend in duplicating the yttrium material. Several succeeded in purifying the compound and identifying its precise structure; Bell Laboratories was the first to publish these results. Theorists struggled to understand a superconductor that performed at theoretically improbable temperatures. Experimenters found a dozen more compounds sharing the crystalline form of Chu's yttrium material. Chu and others began talking openly of the next grail, perhaps already in sight, a room-temperature superconductor. A joyous fever over superconductivity erupted at a historic, all-night special session of the American Physical Society in New York later in March. But the competitive bitterness began to come out as well. ''The history is already a dangerous subject,'' says Robert Cava of Bell Laboratories. ''There's lots of big egos in this game.''</p>
        <p>None of the contenders mentions the most famous award in physics, even privately. As one physicist put it, ''There's a very old saying: One way not to get the Nobel Prize is to talk about it.'' Those who do talk about it warn against revisionism. Some accuse I.B.M. of trying to keep the prize exclusively for itself. Some accuse the University of Houston of trying to capitalize on an accidental discovery. Some accuse Bell Laboratories of trying to deflect attention from all other competitors. On advice of counsel, all remain silent about their patent applications; I.B.M., Houston and Bell are only three of the institutions honing their claims. In a few years, the prize committees and patent courts will make their judgments.</p>
        <p>But Paul Chu will remember four tense and glorious weeks in February. ''It's strange,'' he says, ''yttrium and ytterbium, they both start with 'Y.' People kept on calling me and saying, 'Ytterbium's not working.' I just said, 'Oh? It's not working?' ''</p>
