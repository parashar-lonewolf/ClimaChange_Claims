        <p>President Bush made a pitch today for his plan to reduce air pollution, and while he outlined the environmental benefits, his focus was just as much on the issues that his advisers say are more likely than any others to determine his chances at re-election: jobs and the economy.</p>
        <p>In a 21-minute speech in the East Garden of the White House, Mr. Bush mentioned jobs or the economy at least 21 times, saying his plan for reducing emissions from power plants and other major polluters would clean the air without driving up costs to business so much that it would kill employment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal, which he calls the Clear Skies initiative, has been stalled in Congress, and his appearance today with a group of state and local government officials, business executives and other supporters was intended in part to put pressure on Congress to act.</p>
        <p>It also underscored how Mr. Bush was casting many of the issues likely to come up in the presidential campaign as economic questions that would help determine whether the economy could again begin creating jobs after losing millions of them during his presidency.</p>
        <p>''People in this country must understand that we can have a pro-growth agenda, a pro-job agenda and a pro-environment agenda at the same time,'' he said, ''and Clear Skies legislation is just that.''</p>
        <p>Most environmental groups have criticized the legislation as too weak in its initial goal of reducing acid rain emissions from sources like power plants, and largely silent on the potentially bigger long-term issue of global warming.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, at least four Republicans have signed on as sponsors or co-sponsors to what they describe as tougher proposals, and Senate leaders have resisted White House pressure to attach the bill to the energy legislation currently being considered by a House-Senate conference committee.</p>
        <p>''Under the president's plan, acid rain emissions caps come too late and cut too little,'' Senator James M. Jeffords, the independent from Vermont who is the ranking minority member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement. ''Their plan will continue the rapid decline in the health of lakes and forests in the Northeast and across the country. There are other, much better bipartisan proposals before Congress that have greater support.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's plan calls for substantial reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury over the next 15 years. It would allow utilities and other polluters to choose on their own how to meet the goals. Plants that cut emissions below the required level could sell credits to other companies that do not reach the goal, giving them a financial incentive to cut emissions.</p>
        <p>His environmental policies, the president said, would allow communities ''to meet national standards without sacrificing good jobs.''</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates have challenged the assumption that strict standards will eliminate jobs, saying that investment in new technology to clean the air, for example, will create jobs.</p>
