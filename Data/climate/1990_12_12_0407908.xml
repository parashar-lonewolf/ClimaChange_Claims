        <p>Cityspire, that lipstick-like 72-story edifice on West 56th Street near Seventh Avenue, has been accused of emitting a high-pitched whistle that distracts New Yorkers from Ninth to Third Avenues. The sound apparently is created by wind blowing over louvers on its dome, about 800 feet above the ground.</p>
        <p>In our city, beset by so many ills caused by the onslaught of modernity, this novel "crime" has immediately been taken as evidence of yet another generation of insults to the senses: inhumanely gigantic buildings that are now heard as well as seen.</p>
        <p>The first, predictable reaction of bureaucrats was to "arrest" the building for speaking out of turn -- to issue a summons against its surprised developer, Ian Bruce Eichner. This is far too unimaginative a response to a sound that, admittedly, can make the neighbors crazed on a blustery day.</p>
        <p>Before New York officialdom levies an $880 fine for violating the noise control code -- before it requires the architect to alter the dome -- the community should attempt to understand what the building is trying to say. (After all, don't suburbanites interpret creaks in the attic at night?) Maybe we need a linguist who has deciphered the eerie songs of whales or the chit-chat of dolphins.</p>
        <p>Is Cityspire's whistle a lonely call for companionship to Citibank's far-off tower in Long Island City, a sirenlike wooing of the World Trade Center, a fraternal nod to the Empire State Building, which has seen more towering days?</p>
        <p>Maybe it is a cry of sympathy for Cityspire's lower floors, which worry about the real estate recession. Or an echo of the winds of fortune that rise and fall through increasingly vacated acres of Financial District office buildings.</p>
        <p>As we come to appreciate Cityspire's whistle, perhaps we will not condemn it so readily. As with graffiti and other detritus of today's world, desperate New Yorkers may even come to value it as an art form. One day, the Municipal Art Society might even oppose construction modifications that would alter a building's sounds -- a step in the direction of landmarking the music of the architectural spheres.</p>
        <p>Let's not, just yet, think of Cityspire's wail as another sign of environmental doom: the aural equivalent of global warming. Let's not explain the sound, as one newspaper did, by likening it to the result of bursts of air across the neck of a soda bottle.</p>
        <p>To enrich, rather than impoverish, our urban lives, we might think of Cityspire's sound not as a whistle but as the voice of a mythical Wind -- Zephyr or Boreas or Eurus -- as it expresses itself in the Aeolian cave of the gods, as a kind of monologue in the sky. Or, more simply, as winter's cold heights humming an up-to-date version of "The Tin Roof Blues."</p>
