        <p>LEAD: IN scenes reminiscent of science-fiction movies in which the world's peoples band together to face a common threat from outer space, delegates from around the globe have come together in the last month to confront the dangers posed by planetary warming and the depletion of the earth's protective ozone shield.</p>
        <p>IN scenes reminiscent of science-fiction movies in which the world's peoples band together to face a common threat from outer space, delegates from around the globe have come together in the last month to confront the dangers posed by planetary warming and the depletion of the earth's protective ozone shield. But all nations are not in harmony. International gatherings in New Delhi and London have also made it clear that a conflict has developed between the industrialized countries and the third world.</p>
        <p>Delegates from developing countries left no doubt that they blame the industrialized nations for creating what threatens to become an environmental crisis. The developed countries are clearly responsible for most of the industrial emissions that threaten to raise the earth's temperature and deplete the ozone layer, and they have grown rich in the process. So, the third world delegates argued, the rich nations are duty bound to bear most of the burden. Would it be fair, they asked, to clean up the environment at the expense of people who are struggling to achieve what the industrialized world already has?</p>
        <p>''The developed countries consume 80 percent of the world's resources and produce an equivalent amount of pollution,'' said Liu Ming Pu, China's environment commissioner, at a conference in London this month on the ozone problem. Those countries, he said, ''can use their past accumulated wealth to manage the environment. The third world countries cannot do this.'' China and India, the world's two most populous countries, drove the point home by refusing to join in an international ban on chlorofluorocarbons that harm the ozone shield unless the industrialized world helps them develop substitutes.</p>
        <p>The developing countries are also tired of being used as dumping grounds. At a United Nations conference last week in Basel, Switzerland, where more than 100 countries adopted a treaty restricting international shipments of hazardous wastes, developing nations complained that the controls were not strong enough.</p>
        <p>Many delegates from the rich countries conceded that the developed world must bear the bigger burden, not only in cleaning up its own act, but also in helping the rest of the world control pollution. But they said that the developing countries must also do their part by instituting reforestation and vigorously seeking alternatives to fossil fuels and chlorofluorocarbons. The global environmental battle could be lost, the London conference was told, if the third world continues to follow the industrialized nations' example of trying to achieve the good life by burning fossil fuels and producing chlorofluorocarbons for refrigeration and other uses.</p>
        <p>In building a modern economy, for instance, China hopes to draw on its huge coal reserves. ''If China expands its coal use as planned, there will be no hope, I think, of stemming the greenhouse problem,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, expressing a fear that haunts other Western environmentalists as well.</p>
        <p>Moreover, these environmentalists say that developing countries like Brazil are doing little to control massive deforestation for agriculture and hydroelectricity. When trees are burned or when they are cut and die, they release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that promotes global warming. Alive, they absorb it.</p>
        <p>There need be no either-or relationship between economic development and environmental responsibility, many Western environmentalists contend. In the end, they argue, responsible development is more economical because energy production would be more efficient while many of the social costs of an industrial economy -health care, for one - would be reduced. Straight to Solar</p>
        <p>To a country like China, which has so much cheap coal, the cost of bypassing the fossil-fuel stage of development and going straight to renewable energy could be enormous. But a number of third world countries are thinking in that direction; India, for example, is vigorously pressing solar power. Dr. Oppenheimer raises a provocative question: Fifty years from now, will the United States be buying its solar units from India the way it now buys electronics from Japan?</p>
        <p>Attention is beginning to focus on the role of international aid agencies in promoting environmentally sound projects in the third world. The World Bank, for example, finances the development of coal-fired power plants in developing countries. Could it not also, as a condition for its loans, require steps to encourage more efficient use of energy? Some World Bank officials say yes. ''It is perfectly appropriate,'' said Ken Piddington, the bank's environmental director.</p>
        <p>In the end, the issue will be won or lost in the give-and-take of international politics. Both worlds, Dr. Oppenheimer says, have chips to play in the bargaining. But given the difficulty of bringing the countries together in London on the comparatively simple issue of the ozone layer, there may be a long road ahead on the more complicated matter of the greenhouse effect.</p>
