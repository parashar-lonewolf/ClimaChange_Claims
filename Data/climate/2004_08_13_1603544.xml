        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* ''BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE: NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO FROM CHINA,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, and Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 327-9276, through Sept. 5. This perspective-altering exhibition, divided between two institutions, gives a panoramic glimpse of China's continuing cultural revolution after the Cultural Revolution, picking up where Asia Society's 1998 survey ''Inside/Out'' left off. The work ranges from documentary-style shots of avant-garde performances in the mid-1990's to identity-searching photographs and videos, to images of old cities being demolished as new ones rise. The 60 artists represent a mere tip of the creative iceberg in a country changing with breathtaking speed. One way or another, those changes will affect the world. An important show. Center hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+. Asia Society hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).</p>

        <p>''LEE BONTECOU: A RETROSPECTIVE,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212)708-9400, through Sept. 27. This much celebrated touring retrospective has been a victory lap for this nearly forgotten artist whose works, many of them unseen until now, have gone through some dizzying changes over the years. Ms. Bontecou became famous in the 1960's for her hulking, ferocious wall reliefs with yawning black cavities. The show introduces her later works, after she dropped out of the scene: vacuum-formed sculptures from the early 70's, like mongrel toys, of fish and flowers; delicate mobiles and drawings, which flirt with kitsch but at their best are like the sculptures: suave, deeply mysterious, materially inventive, suggesting surreal or otherworldly universes. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8.50 (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''BRANCUSI: THE ESSENCE OF THINGS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Sept. 19. Because the work of the early 20th-century sculptor Constantin Brancusi and Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral rotunda share points of origin in dreams of Modernism, as well as palette, materials and simplified organic forms, not to mention a certain Art Deco flavoring, this exhibition is beautiful almost beyond belief. Its clarity provides a renewed sense of Brancusi's sensitivity for materials, his spirituality and his importance as the riverhead of Minimalism, especially with works of 20th-century abstraction from the museum's collection filling in the ramp after the show's 35 objects come to an end. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10 (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,'' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting American Indian art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''FROM HOMER TO THE HAREM: THE ART OF JEAN LECOMTE DU NOÜY (1842-1923),'' Dahesh Museum of Art, 580 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 759-0606, through Sept. 19. The latest brushmeister flushed from obscurity by that 19th-century salon, the Dahesh Museum, the French Orientalist painter Lecomte du Noüy was an unregenerate academician at a time when French modernism was coming to flower. He had all the Beaux-Arts requisites: a passion for the classical past; respect for academic categories; proficient drawing and finicky high finish. His set piece here is ''The White Slave'' (1888), a deliciously campy painting of an odalisque in a deluxe harem, dreamily blowing smoke through her nostrils as she faces two black women performing a less luxurious kind of servitude, laundry. A more operatic scene is his painting of a court eunuch conjuring out of his opium pipe an androgynous figure and a cherub wielding a knife. An arrow slices through the cherub's crotch. But some works he painted on trips to North Africa and the Middle East are carefully observed documentations of religious and other customs. Has another reputation been resuscitated by this well-prepared show? No, it just provides further evidence of the dead end that spurred the French modernist movement. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $4; free to members and children under 12 ( Glueck).</p>
        <p>''THE GAMES IN ANCIENT ATHENS: A SPECIAL PRESENTATION TO CELEBRATE THE 2004 OLYMPICS,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Oct. 3. Established 200 years after the original festival that began at Olympia in 776 B.C., the Panathenaic Games in Athens followed much the same lines, except that they awarded far more valuable prizes than the simple wreaths that crowned Olympic champions. Chief among them were large painted amphorae (vases) filled with valuable olive oil from a sacred grove. The Met has placed nine of these treasures on display in special showcases in its first-floor Greek galleries, along with other works, and set up a kind of treasure hunt for visitors throughout the rest of the galleries by placing special markers next to other games-related art. Among the vases is one by an unknown painter bearing a beautifully stylized version of a two-horse chariot race; another depicts a pankration, a no-holds-barred combination of wrestling and boxing that here shows a man grasping his opponent's leg. Hours and admission: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Glueck).</p>
        <p>WILLIAM GEDNEY AND CHRISTOPHER WOOL, ''Into the Night,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, through Sept. 27. Gedney (1933-88), a Modernist photographer, and Mr. Wool, a Postmodernist painter, each made resonant nocturnal urban photographs. Gedney's beautifully composed images of dark buildings, shot in cities during cross-country trips from 1965 to 1975, exude an Edward Hopperesque mystery and lonesomeness. Mr. Wool's raw and haphazardly composed photographs, made from the mid-1990's to 2002, show stains and puddles on sidewalks, razor-wire topped fences, overflowing dumpsters, foraging mongrel dogs and other squalid and scary things. They have their own kind of grungy beauty. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>''CHILDE HASSAM, AMERICAN IMPRESSIONIST,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 12. A grossly inflated retrospective of this immensely popular American Impressionist, he of the candied views of patriotic, flag-draped New York during World War I. Retrospectives are supposed to change your notion of an artist, so I suppose you could say that this one succeeds by definitively ratcheting Hassam's reputation several notches down. The show is full of Hassam's cheerful, nostalgic views of Americana; skillful, high-keyed scenes full of flickering light, which, while occasionally brilliant, look especially facile brought together by the dozens, as they are here. Hassam could do almost anything technically in a variety of media: a night scene, the glint of water on the side of a horse-drawn carriage, dappled sun through a scrim of autumn trees, people massing in a canyon of tall buildings, a Seville courtyard in the slanting light of the late afternoon. Anything except what mattered most, which was to offer up something deeper and daring. Hours and admission: see above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''LIVING LEGACIES: THE ARTS OF THE AMERICAS,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, permanent installation. In conjunction with its new facade and lobby, the museum has opened its revamped Hall of the Americas, the spacious display arena for objects from its collection of North, Central and South American art. Redone in vibrant colors, the hall offers three thematic shows as Phase I of its new installation. ''Enduring Heritage: Art of the Northwest Coast'' is the fiercest and most startling, with dramatic animal masks and a giant totem pole. ''Threads of Time: Woven Histories of the Andes'' presents 38 textiles and related materials from ancient times to the present and ''Stories Revealed: Writing Without Words,'' the smallest, conveys how Indian cultures used graphic art rather than words to record their histories. A fuller account of the museum's collections will appear with Phase II, planned for 2006. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 65+ (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''MAGNUM'S NEW YORKERS,'' Museum of the City of New York, Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, through Sept. 6. Photojournalists represented by the renowned Magnum Photos agency present a panoramic, collective portrait of the people of New York City. Among the 130 pictures, dating from the late 1940's to 2002, are works by luminaries like Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bruce Davidson and Susan Meiselas. Boys jumping into the East River, James Dean walking through Times Square, a sprawling family picnicking in Central Park, teenage gangsters in 1950's Coney Island and a man in a maid's outfit in a private club for sadomasochists: these and many other images tell a familiar, intermittently gripping story about the city's human diversity. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $7; children, students and 62+, $4 (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''ANA MENDIETA: EARTH BODY, SCULPTURE AND PERFORMANCE, 1972-1985,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Sept. 19. Much of Ana Mendieta's work took the form of outdoor performances and site-specific sculptures made of ephemeral stuff: earth, fire, water, vegetation. For many of the performances, only Mendieta and a photographer were present. When she died in 1985 at 36 under mysterious circumstances, she left behind mostly documentary photographs and short films. It's not much material to build a full-scale retrospective on, and the Whitney show feels stretched. But Mendieta still comes through as the alert, ambitious artist she was, one who absorbed and acted on a wide range of ideas: aesthetic, ethnic, sexual, religious, political. Her best images, like one in which her nude body seems to be growing flowers, are of death and transfiguration, and they have the heartbreaking writ-on-water sting of fine poems. Hours and admission: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+ (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''MODIGLIANI: BEYOND THE MYTH,'' Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, through Sept. 19. The first big New York retrospective of Modigliani since 1951, believe it or not, this is an overstuffed show that includes predictable duds but also a select group of his best sculptures and paintings, which belie the stereotype of Modigliani as an impulsive lunatic, hellbent on self-destruction, doing poster-ready work. The good works indicate someone of worldly intelligence, patience, discipline and steady concentration. Modigliani's huge popularity has always depended on his risqué reputation and on his languid, pretty, easily digested and unmistakable brand of delicately abstracted Modernism. As with the work of Chagall or Ben Shahn, Modigliani's could frequently tip over into kitsch or parody. But at its best it is original and exquisite and suggests someone beyond the bohemian cliché, clearly wrestling with issues besides the formal felicity of elongated shapes, who died prematurely. Hours: Mondays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, to 9 p.m.; Fridays, to 5 p.m.; Sundays to 8 p.m. Admission: $14; $11.50 for students and 65+ (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''ISAMU NOGUCHI: SCULPTURAL DESIGN,'' Noguchi Museum, 32-37 Vernon Boulevard, at 33rd Road, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, through Oct. 4. This beautiful small museum dedicated to Noguchi's elegant Modernist sculpture and design has reopened after renovations. A new program of temporary exhibitions begins as well, with about 100 of Noguchi's sculptures, stage props, pieces of furniture, paper lights and models collected into a sprawling, cluttered and noisy show organized by the theater designer Robert Wilson. Works from the permanent collection are in the clean, cool and quiet ground-floor galleries and the garden. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 62+ (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084; ''Hard Light'' through Sept. 4; others through Sept. 27. P.S. 1's assortment of summer shows offers nearly a biennial's worth of information about contemporary art. ''Hard Light'' traces the various uses of narrative, perception and the camera through video, photographic and installation works by nine artists, including Bruce Nauman, Carsten Höller and Ugo Rondinone. Its high point is ''Interiors'' by Doug Aitken, a three-screen installation that weaves the sights, sounds, inner drives and outer realities of four very different individuals into a movingly symphonic work. In contrast, ''Curious Crystals of Unusual Purity'' favors the overtly hand-made. Based on the concept of the wunderkammer, it brings together 100 works by 36 disparate artists -- many of them emerging, re-emerging or overlooked -- in a bit of tightly worked curatorial intarsia that intimates the strange, wonderful and quasivisionary underpinnings of all kinds of art. Also worth seeing (through Sept. 5): the first retrospective of the complicated, fabulously angry Minimal-Conceptual cartoonist Lee Lozano (1930-1999); the courtyard folly, designed this year by nArchitects, in green bamboo; and an outstanding batch of smaller solo shows and special projects. Among the most special is Walead Beshty's photo-slide meditation on dead malls, possibly dead shoppers and empty promises; Phoebe Washburn's heaving topographic installation made entirely of found wood and newspaper; and Mika Rottenberg's hilarious video installation, ''Mary's Cherries,'' in which the camera and the handmade fruitfully collude. Hours and admission: see above(Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''COTTON PUFFS, Q-TIPS, SMOKE AND MIRRORS: THE DRAWINGS OF ED RUSCHA'' AND ''ED RUSCHA AND PHOTOGRAPHY,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Sept. 26. The first drawing retrospective of this influential Left Coast Pop artist is a little large, but it covers the development of his immeasurably influential fusion of image, language and materials with admirable order and precision. It is complemented by a small but dense selection of his photographs and books, including dozens of early images. These reveal a previously unknown side of his talent and his considerable achievement, as an heir to Walker Evans who discovered his indelibly American sensibility and subject matter while on a grand tour of Europe. Especially synergistic is the way both shows and their impressive catalogs clarify the importance of photography to all his efforts. Hours and admission: see above (Smith).</p>
        <p>* AUGUST SANDER, ''People of the 20th Century: A Photographic Portrait of Germany,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sept. 19. Although only a sampling of his vast inventory of portraits of German society, the show, naturally, is too big: the prints are vintage but uneven, and the best pictures are not given enough breathing room. But genius is genius, and you may leave nearly overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of Sander's obsessive ambition and humanity. An accompanying display, ''Indexing the World,'' is a gem, providing a brisk, buoyantly eccentric overview of the dubious role of photography in the quest to index the world. It is often remarked that Sander photographed one era turning into another, Weimar Germany into Nazi Germany, which is true. His work, despite its scientific pretense, is suffused with the unconscious melancholy of a world he could see was already fading. Another way to describe him is to say that his project was both deeply reactionary and revolutionary, and this tension became the central, illuminating paradox of his achievement. Museum hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''SPEAKING WITH HANDS: PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE BUHL COLLECTION,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Sept. 8. The idea of concentrating on photographs of hands is slightly inane, as they can be found in some form in millions of photographs. But this show squeaks past monotony, obviousness and sentimentality, among other threats, on the excellence of its mostly big-name selections. The 173 images on view, chosen from a collection of more than 1,000, cover photojournalism, portraiture, avant-garde experimentation and more. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>PAUL STANKARD, ''A Floating World,'' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956 3535, through Aug. 29. For more than 30 years Paul Stankard has specialized in the arcane craft of making glass paperweights. He creates spherical, oval or block-shaped objects of clear, solid glass in which miniature representations of North American wildflowers rendered in glass with extraordinary accuracy are suspended. They are impressive as feats of technique, and they have, at their best, a captivating magical realism. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6, students and 62+ (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''TOOLS OF HER MINISTRY: THE ART OF SISTER GERTRUDE MORGAN,'' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Oct. 10. If you wonder what it really means to say that art is a calling, see this ethereal show. A self-appointed prophet and street preacher, Sister Morgan was called by God to paint in the 1950's. Untutored but full of an uncanny grace, her vivid, high-key works have a plain-spoken ecstasy and inborn eloquence, both formal and literary, that can lift the soul. The mix of text and image relates to many modern artists and poets, none of whom she ever heard of or cared about. Her pictures are talismans of mystical devotion derived from inner necessity, conceived as teaching tools for lost souls. In heaven works like these would be eternally before our eyes. The world not being heaven, this is your opportunity to see them. The day has come, as Sister Morgan might say. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Fridays until 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; $7, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>GEOFFREY JAMES, ''Zones of Contact,'' Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950, through Sept. 11. Like the New Topographers Robert Adams and Lewis Baltz, this Toronto-based photographer casts a searching eye on cultural alterations of the North American landscape. His 1997 series of richly detailed black-and-white views of a 14-mile corrugated metal fence erected to prevent illegal immigration between Tijuana and San Diego is visually absorbing, politically provocative and sad (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>PETER FLACCUS, Zabriskie, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223, through Aug. 20. Mr. Flaccus's attractive compact encaustic paintings combine physical sensuousness and spacey luminosity. Pouring molten, richly colored wax and further working it as it cools, he creates blurry, approximately centered areas of bursting or quietly pulsating light suggestive of astronomical phenomena, primitive submarine life forms like jellyfish or purely spiritual entities (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''REFLECTING THE MIRROR,'' Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Aug. 27. Notable works in this interestingly varied show about an enduringly paradoxical subject include a quietly duplicitous film by Pierre Huyghe; a beautiful cabinet of multicolored, semi-reflective interior parts by Olafur Eliasson; a big sheet of semi-reflective glass by Gerhard Richter; full-length mirrors built flush to the wall, creating the illusion of another world beyond the wall, by Felix Gonzalez-Torres; and a funny doll-size self-portrait called ''Mini-Me'' by Maurizio Cattelan (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''WOODWORK,'' Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212) 755-0434, through Aug. 27. Highlights of this 22-artist show of wooden sculptures include George Stoll's wooden sponge painted yellow; a big, lovingly smoothed, upright log by Jene Highstein; a bark-covered sphere like a giant cantaloupe called ''Tree Ball'' by Lars Fisk; a bearded man nicely carved in lime tree wood and hung upside down by Paloma Vargas Weisz; an improbably bent 2-by-4 by Matt Johnson; and a big human hand with many little hinged doors built into it by Los Carpinteros (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''EA50,'' Here Art Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, (212) 647-0202, through Sept. 13. Part emerging-artist show, part conceptual installation and part raffle, this exhibition presents 50 plain brown boxes. Each contains an artwork and bears a label that tells the artist's name, some personal facts and a description of the hidden work. ''You will want to grow old with the contents of this box,'' promises one. Ten professional curators picked the artists. Pick one you like the sound of, buy a $10 ticket and you might win what's in the box (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ROBERT RYMAN, ''Works on Paper, 1957-1964,'' Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Sept. 25. Although Mr. Ryman is usually referred to as a Minimalist, he began his career as something more like an abstract conceptualist, making paintings at least as interesting to think about as to look at. This stimulating, richly varied exhibition of 30 works on paper catch him at a pivotal point in his career, which coincides with a fertile one in American art. They include paintings, drawings and collage, often in combination, and show an artist using abstraction's strangeness and uncertainties to think his way into his creative place in the world (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''TOYS IN THE ATTIC,'' Lennon, Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012, through Aug. 20. This entertainingly varied group show includes H. C. Westermann's colorful lithographic images of adventures on the fringes of civilization; Carl Ostendarp's small, finely color-coordinated image of a light bulb; Catherine Murphy's assiduously realist painting of a Mylar birthday balloon; Alan Turner's incisively drawn picture of tree roots and rocks; Matthew Draper's John Currinesque portraits of dewey-eyed young women; and Matthew Fisher's oddly archaic paintings of Napoleonic soldiers in pastoral landscapes (Johnson).</p>

        <p>PATTERSON BECKWITH, ''Home,'' American Fine Arts, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-7366, through Sept. 4. For this participatory show, Mr. Beckwith has simulated a schoolroom with a green chalkboard and a sock-puppet theater, and he has scheduled single-session classes to be taught by fellow artists. Classes have included salsa dancing (taught by Andrea Fraser), ''Pillowcase Workshop'' and ''Divination With Common Household Objects.'' The project, writes Mr. Beckwith, is designed ''to position the artist as a facilitator rather than as a master producer whose work is fetishized/commodified'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''DO,'' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Aug. 31. That's ''Do'' as in hair-do. This entertaining show presents 42 examples of fine art, journalism, fashion photography and publicity in which the hair on people's heads -- and sometimes in other places -- figures prominently. William Wegman's Weimaraner with a Mohawk; Sean Penn with a pompadour; the Three Stooges, the Beatles, a bald Nikita Khrushchev visiting the Lincoln Memorial; a postcard of Nancy Reagan sitting in the lap of television tough guy Mr. T, who is wearing a stylized Santa suit: these and other images will bounce your mind around like a pinball (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''DROP OUT,'' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, through Aug. 19. Something is missing in each of the photographs in this clever group show. Absent female figures leave white silhouettes in Charles Cohen's large color pictures. Blank white billboards punctuate a digitally altered pastoral landscape by Oliver Wasow. Chris Sauter cuts vacant cartoon speech bubbles into photographs of grain silos; John O'Reilly's collages create mysterious, Cubist mixes of positive and negative spaces. Oscar Palacio's observant photographs discover voids in the world like a black door in a purple wall. Mel Kendrick's X-ray-like images are studies of his own hollowed-out wooden sculptures (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''FOUR-PLY,'' Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, through Aug. 20. Featuring works made not on but of paper, ''Four-Ply'' offers an engaging assortment of ways to be creative with paper. Highlights include Cubist-cartoon style heads by Ryan Johnson; a delicate blob of cast pink paper by Lynda Benglis; Aric Obrosey's lacy white work glove made of perforated, knit-patterned paper; and one of Robert Gober's simulated bundles of newspapers (Johnson).</p>
        <p>GROUP SHOW, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, (212) 560-0670, through Sept. 30. This unusually elegant show presents one work each by six artists: Sol LeWitt's white ''Incomplete Cube''; Carl Andre's grid of Belgian blue limestones on the floor; three cadmium orange wooden panels with routed horizontal lines by Donald Judd; a fluorescent light piece by Dan Flavin that glows peach and blue; a seductively textured white-on-white painting by Robert Ryman; and Lawrence Weiner's vinyl letters spelling ''Rolled into &amp; on the sea'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''POOL PARTY,'' Yossi Milo, 552 West 24th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Aug. 20. The seasonal theme is no surprise, but the rich selection of pictures of people in and around swimming pools by 37 photographers is. The show is also truly partylike in that much of its fun is in the unexpected conversations criss-crossing the room. From Slim Aaron's preternaturally lucid image of Stepford-style women seated by the pool of a Richard Neutra house to O. Winston Link's Magritte-style vision of a massive locomotive charging past an outdoor public pool is just one of many mind-stretching leaps you can take (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''WATER,'' Ricco/Maresca, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4819, through Aug. 20. This well-timed show, presenting almost 40 works more or less directly about water, includes Marc Dennis's smooth painting of a perfect wave; Ken Grimes's black-and-white sign painting that tells about water on Mars; Amanda Means's oversize photographs of glasses of water; Bohnchang Koos's soothing photographs of glassy ocean surfaces; and Gerald Slota's video in a bucket thst retells the story of Jack and Jill (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''WILD FLOWERS,'' Ariel Meyerowitz, 120 11th Avenue, between 20th and 21st Streets, (212) 414-2770, through Aug. 20. A sign on flowerless municipal property that reads ''Cutting Roses Prohibited'' in a photograph by Peter Kayafas announces a slightly eccentric approach to a perennial theme. Other examples include Joel Meyerowitz's sidewalk picture of a man carrying a big bouquet past a woman with a heavily bandaged nose; Matt Harnett's portrait of a boxer shadow-boxing in front of a floral shower curtain; and Chad Kleitsch's enlarged, richly colored, computer-scanned images of single blossoms (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''AFRICAN ART IS . . .'' UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885, through Sept. 10. The complexity of African art is laid out in this omnibus show, a look at some of the challenging exhibitions already held by the Museum for African Art, which is building new quarters on upper Fifth Avenue. Its shows have ranged from a survey of Yoruban art (1989) to a display of Congolese popular painting dealing with the political career and assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the country's first prime minister (1999). Each show was framed as an approach to the open-ended question of what is African art, exploring it as a broad field of many different cultures and beliefs. Overall, this display includes more than 75 objects from 14 African countries; paintings, photographs, masks, costumes, pottery, baskets, warriors' shields and idol figures. Drawings give a preview of the new site for the museum, tentatively scheduled to open in 2006. As potent reminders of the trail it has blazed in presenting issues of African culture, these show segments are an enticing come-on (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''HOT + COOL * SUMMER,'' Gallery W 52, 31 West 52nd Street, through Aug. 28. Midtown pedestrians will enjoy a detour through this lobby gallery where a seasonally playful exhibition includes brightly striped eccentric forms painted by Gary Peterson; a futuristic green-and-orange chess set by Karim Rashid; a bristling inflated chair by Tung Chiang; a garden trowel with a bulbous, perforated handle by Tony Cragg; a Modernist dollhouse with a miniature art collection inside by Laurie Simmons and Peter Wheelwright; and Skeet McAuley's preternaturally lucid, panoramic photograph of a heavenly golf course (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''INNOCENCE FOUND,'' DFN, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa (212) 334-3400, through Aug. 27. Symbols of innocence in this theme show are mostly generic -- lots of children and tame animals -- but they are beautifully realized in many of the 38 works. Look for Tom Birkner's realist painting of teenage lovers strolling through a small town; Loretta Lux's luminous photograph of a little girl in a bridal gown; David Humphrey's surrealistically goofy painting of two white cats and a peanut butter sandwich; and Dan Witz's Thomas Eakins-style portrait of a naked adolescent girl. (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROY LICHTENSTEIN, City Hall, City Hall Park and the Tweed Courthouse, Lower Manhattan, through Oct. 15. Rising five stories under the octagonal skylight of the Tweed Courthouse's fabulous Italianate rotunda, Lichtenstein's clunky tower of giant cartoon brush strokes is an impressive sight, the centerpiece of a Public Art Fund installation of four sculptures in and around City Hall. Its sly commentary on Modernist myths of freedom and spontaneity is enhanced by its insertion at the core of New York City's bureaucratic control center. You can't just spontaneously walk in to see it, though. Call 311 to sign up for a Friday-only tour (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* FRANZ WEST, Lincoln Center and Doris C. Freedman Plaza (southeast corner of Central Park), sponsored by the Public Art Fund, (212) 980-4575, through Aug. 31. Standing at the stop of the steps leading into Lincoln Center, seven of Mr. West's big, gnarly aluminum sculptures painted in retro-colors and resembling a kindergartner's hugely enlarged papier-mâché creations comprise a zany visitors' welcoming committee. At Doris C. Freedman Plaza, two bizarre 20-foot boatlike objects, the colors of plastic squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard, are comical, viscerally physical, mysterious and surprisingly comfortable to sit on (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>CHARLES (SPINKY) ALSTON, Bill Hodges Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 333-2640, through tomorrow. Among many other achievements, Alston (1907-77) was the first black artist to teach at the Art Students League in New York, where he worked from 1950 to 1971. This small retrospective of works from 1936 to 1969 reveals a skilled and versatile painter who was equally adept at Social Realist narrative, portraiture and Modernist abstraction (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* HAI BO, Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6999, through today. After a decade of extroverted work, many Chinese artists are looking inward. This Beijing-based photographer is one of them. Included in ''Between Past and Future,'' the survey at the International Center of Photography and Asia Society, he makes his New York solo debut here with beautiful work that riffs on classical Taoist themes found in painting. It both mourns and resurrects the past by combining pictures of family members taken some years ago with images of landscapes associated with them (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''CUT! COSTUMES FOR THE SILVER SCREEN FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE CINÉMATHEQUE FRANÇAISE, PARIS,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818, through tomorrow. You don't have to be a fashion maven to savor the art and artifice of these creations by designers for Hollywood and foreign movies: Paul Poiret, Jeanne Lanvin, Coco Chanel, Adrian, Cecil Beaton, Travis Banton and Karl Lagerfeld, among others. Adorning actresses like Vivien Leigh, Bette Davis, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Stéphane Audran and Clara Bow, the 30 costumes, accompanied by film clips, are stunning, including the short, fringed and beaded Jazz Age gown designed by Travis Banton for Clara Bow in ''Red Hair'' (1928) to the sleekly sophisticated floor length gown of black silk crepe by Karl Lagerfeld for Stéphane Audran in ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' (1972) (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* KAREL FUNK, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121, through today. This outstanding first solo show breathes some new life into the seemingly exhausted photo-realism genre with small portraits of young men, usually wearing hooded jackets, who seem lost in thought and look anywhere but at the viewer. This creates license to scrutinize the artist's meticulous technique. Individual brush strokes stand out as clearly as on a painting by Chuck Close, which creates a breathtaking, strange balance of facticity and imbues both surfaces and the subjects with an almost religious sense of concentration. Contributing to the mood is the artist's ability to borrow from Renaissance painting without academic side effects (Smith).</p>
        <p>''MINDSCAPE,'' Pavel Zoubok, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, through today. A spirit of playful surrealism unites works by 22 artists, including pieces by Yves Tanguy and Kay Sage, and by the 94-year-old Stella Snead. The show's interest is mainly in the diversity of technical approaches, which include polished steel panels shot with a gun by Margaret Evangeline; Ruth Marten's lovingly painted, allegorical images of hairpieces; Jerry Mischak's Constructivist collages made of colored duct tape; Daniel Zeller's finely lined topographical fantasies; and smooth blobs of white marble by Venske &amp; Spänle (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''OPEN HOUSE: WORKING IN BROOKLYN,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Sunday. This all-Brooklyn show of new art has been timed to coincide with the inauguration of the museum's new front entrance pavilion and public plaza. With 300 pieces installed in the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries, and spilling over into the permanent collection galleries, it's a very crowded affair. It's also all over the place in terms of media, styles and themes, not to mention quality; the good, the bad and the iffy mingle. Still there's plenty of good work by artists you know and by some you don't, drawn from across a borough that has many different art worlds. Also on view, though not part of the show, is Alexis Rockman's mural-size painting of Brooklyn 3,000 years in the future, submerged under water as a result of global warming. Hours and admission: see above (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS OF REALITY: THE LEGACY OF LEONARDO AND CARAVAGGIO IN LOMBARDY,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Sunday. This show was partly conceived in the scholarly world, and it includes a few dull pictures that are here only to prove academic points you didn't know mattered in the first place. But don't let that obscure the exhibition's attraction, which has, above all, to do with discovery. You probably have never heard of many of the painters on view. Consider this an opportunity. Yes, you will find Leonardo and Caravaggio. But the visceral joy should come from happening on very great artists you might not know, with names like Savoldo, Lotto, Ceruti and Fede Galizia. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''RELENTLESS PROSELYTIZERS,'' Feigen, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-0500, through tomorrow. The 12 artists in this show share a penchant for visual hyperbole. Look for Gina Dawson's hilariously gross tableau of three people and a horse, all made of oozy gray and white resin; a horrifying gynecological examination table made of junk by Jesse Bercowetz and Matt Bua; Ben Blatt's assidulously detailed watercolor depicting a Jules Verneian fusion of nature and machinery; and Elizabeth Huey's Henry Darger-like paintings envisioning the mystical adventures of fashion models in Bavarian forests (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''WATERCURRENTS,'' Kouros, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-5888, through today. None of the 12 artists in this show are revolutionizing the medium of watercolor, but all practice it with skill and sensitivity. Highlights include Wilbur Niewald's Cézannesque still lifes and landscapes; Deborah Kirklin's delicate miniature tablescapes; Lois Dodd's jagged, Cubistic studies of leaves; and Garth Evans's richly colored biomorphic abstractions (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''WHERE GODS AND MORTALS MEET: CONTINUITY AND RENEWAL IN URHOBO ART,'' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700, through Monday. This engrossing show documents aspects of a so-called traditional African art as it existed in the recent past, and as it survives in a 21st-century world. Africa in this case means a society called the Urhobo of the Niger Delta, and the art ranges from spectacular larger than life-size figures of ancestor spirits to carvings of grotesque beasts with gaping, saber-toothed mouths, images meant to both encourage and control male aggression. Although some sculptures are now rarely produced in their original forms, they are in the paintings and prints of Bruce Onobrakpeya, a contemporary Delta-born artist of international stature, in whose art Urhobo traditions live on. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3 (Cotter)</p>
        <p>JULIE YORK; DENISE PELLETIER, Garth Clark Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205, through today. These two ceramists are sculptors of considerable formal, technical and conceptual refinement. Ms. York's small-scale white porcelain works play with modular industrial forms and include magnifying lenses to call attention to the distorting effects of ocular perception. Ms. Pelletier's delicate, faux-Victorian works explore the surrealistic and erotic dimensions of antique medical devices (Johnson).</p>
