        <p>Delegates from 143 countries ended their preliminary talks on global warming here today with no agreement on key issues and growing concern about the prospect for success at the concluding meeting, to be held in Kyoto, Japan, in early December.</p>
        <p>The United States' long-awaited proposal for cutting emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases has been scornfully attacked as too weak by delegates and environmentalists from around the world. And there is no sign that American negotiators are about to yield. Still, the Americans themselves said there was more than a little cause for hope, and they have been lobbying their counterparts here, urging them to take a closer look at the American proposal.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, several small-scale but higher-level meetings will be held between now and Dec. 1, when the Kyoto conference begins. The goal of the conference is to revise the climate treaty negotiated in Rio in 1992, which set voluntary limits on emissions.</p>
        <p>''There are enough ideas out there to have an agreement,'' a senior State Department official said here, speaking on condition of anonymity.  ''We just don't see all the kinds of coalescence that you need yet'' for that to happen.</p>
        <p>On the surface, the American proposal looks like the weakest on the table. The proposal would require industrialized countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012. By contrast, the European Union wants to cut emissions 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. But the American official said that the American plan compares more favorably with other countries' positions once the details are inspected, and that it is superior to a major alternative plan advanced by Japan. Japan calls for a 2.5 percent to 5 percent reduction in emissions by about 2010.</p>
        <p>Other American officials here today released an analysis by the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency which suggests that the American position actually occupies a middle ground between those of Japan and the European Union. The contention is based mainly on the fact that under the United States' proposal, emissions of a full array of six different greenhouse gases would be controlled. The other proposals would control only three.</p>
        <p>Some critics said the the American estimate that its plan occupies the middle ground were based on uncertain projections of future emissions of the less abundant gases. The Administration countered that even if the projections of future emissions are cut in half, the basic conclusion still holds.</p>
        <p>The conclusion is ''a valid point,'' said Dr. Daniel Lashof, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ''I think the U.S. proposal is stronger than the Japanese position, but it still falls short'' of the European position.</p>
        <p>With the Bonn phase of the talks over, key players must ''review their options so that they can come to Kyoto with more flexible positions,'' said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the executive director of a 1992 climate treaty under which the discussions are proceeding.</p>
        <p>The State Department official, however, said that ''before we start perhaps working toward any compromises, we want to be sure that people understand'' the full scope of Washington's position.</p>
        <p>It may be, said Mr. Zammit Cutajar, that the Kyoto session will produce ''an agreement based not on a single target, but on different targets for each country.'' The individual targets for emissions cuts would be based on an array of economic and social characteristics. The possibility of differentiated targets received much attention here over the last few days.</p>
        <p>Talks between now and the Kyoto conference are to take place in a number of forums and through a number of channels, some of them at higher levels, between now and the start of the Kyoto conference on Dec. 1. Among the forums coming up is a meeting involving ministers from key countries in Tokyo Nov. 8 through 10. The American official said there was ''great scope'' for resolving many issues before the Kyoto talks begin.</p>
        <p>Aside from the question of what cuts in emissions industrialized countries will make, and when, the biggest outstanding issue is the role of developing countries. While the 1992 Rio climate treaty generally requires them to control their emissions, it does not bind them to any specific commitments. The rationale is that since the richer countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions so far, they should take the lead in reducing them. The negotiators in Bonn had no authority to consider new commitments for the developing world.</p>
        <p>But the Kyoto meeting involves a higher-level conference of parties to the 1992 treaty, and it can take up the issue. The United States has insisted it will sign no agreement in Kyoto that does not include ''meaningful'' participation by the developing countries. Everyone agrees that eventually, the poorer nations will have to take on specific commitments if greenhouse gases are to be controlled, since their emissions are expected to surpass those of the industrialized world in the early decades of the next century.</p>
        <p>''If all the industrialized countries shut down their economies, it wouldn't solve the problem,'' said Bert Metz, a prominent European negotiator from the Netherlands. But the issue of the developing countries' future role has proved intractable so far. In part, that is because these countries argue that the industrialized countries have become rich through a century of increasing emission of greenhouse gases. They argue that initially, the rich countries should bear most of the burden of preventing climate change.</p>
        <p>The American diplomat here said that since the issue is so difficult, it may be possible to resolve only part of it in Kyoto, with negotiations continuing beyond that.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration says that under its proposal to include all six greenhouse gases, total greenhouse emissions in the United States would be reduced by some 30 percent from what they would otherwise be around 2010.</p>
        <p>The most important of the six heat-trapping gases is carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. The others are methane, which forms in landfills and is emitted in part as waste natural gas, and nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride, which are produced by a variety of industrial processes and have a variety of uses.</p>
