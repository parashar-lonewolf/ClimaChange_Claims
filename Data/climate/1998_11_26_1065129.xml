        <p>On the second day of tropical storm Mitch in Maria Salgado's house, the family watched in horror as the mud floor caved in and the bed was swept away. Then the refrigerator. Soon the walls, made of palm fronds and sticks of wood lashed together, and the corrugated tin roof collapsed. Ms. Salgado's youngest child, 1 1/2-year-old Victor Antonio, vanished in the debris.</p>
        <p>More than two weeks later, the refrigerator is still lying in a foot of stagnant water. The boy has not been found. Ms. Salgado cries as she stands in the ruins and looks at the concrete-block house of her wealthier next-door neighbor, which was untouched by the storm.</p>
        <p>That poverty was the main characteristic of Mitch's victims is not the only man-made aspect of this natural disaster. El Salvador's national emergency agency concentrates on helping victims after disaster strikes, not warning or evacuating people beforehand. Another huge factor was environmental neglect. Many scientists believe that global warming contributed to this year's devastating floods -- in China and Bangladesh as well as the Caribbean and Central America -- and, conversely, to droughts and forest fires elsewhere. Locally, deforestation multiplied Mitch's damage. Five days of torrential rain would have caused damage anywhere, but there would have been fewer lethal mud slides if the land in Honduras and Nicaragua had been covered with trees. Central America is one of the most deforested parts of the world, losing 118 acres of trees an hour.</p>
        <p>El Salvador lost only a few people from mudslides. But environmentalists here say deforestation swelled the flood waters that took Victor Antonio and left 239 others dead, 84,000 homeless and the country's water, agriculture and health in tatters.</p>
        <p>Trees hold the soil together and help it absorb rain. When the land is stripped of trees, heavy rains sweep mud and minerals into the rivers, swelling and clotting the water and increasing its power to destroy. The erosion caused by Mitch will speed this vicious circle and increase the destructive power of future storms.</p>
        <p>Deforestation has other consequences. It reduces soil fertility, crucial in a country of subsistence farmers. In addition, because less rain is reaching the subsoil, aquifers dry up and the country begins to run out of water. San Salvador's water table drops a meter a year.</p>
        <p>In Honduras, commercial logging, much of it aimed at North American markets, causes some of the deforestation. El Salvador has no logging, but its deforestation is the worst in the hemisphere after Haiti. The most fertile land was cleared for cotton and coffee plantations. (Most of El Salvador's coffee needs shade, and thus requires the conservation of some trees.) Small farmers were pushed onto hilly terrain, where the soil is so poor that they must keep moving, clearing new land. Developers also cut down forests to build houses, often in violation of the country's poorly enforced environmental laws.</p>
        <p>The storm is a sign that environmental concerns are no middle-class luxury. It is a call to everyone to reduce greenhouse gases, and a warning to nations like El Salvador to plant more trees, enforce environmental laws and devise strategies for development that do not depend on deforestation.</p>
        <p>These projects are long-term -- a phrase that in these parts often means ''never'' -- and may now be less likely to happen because Mitch has created so many overwhelming and expensive needs. But as Central America tries to rebuild, it must keep the environment, and the likelihood of future flooding, in mind.</p>
        <p>Especially in El Salvador, the most densely populated nation in the hemisphere, it will be hard to find places for the homeless that are not in forests, on slopes or in flood-prone river basins. At the very least, new housing should be made of concrete blocks. A private-enterprise group has promised to build storm-resistant houses in a devastated town near El Cuco, but the building material the Government promises the grief-stricken Ms. Salgado is flimsy corrugated tin. It has not yet come, and the house is as it was, half submerged in water.</p>
