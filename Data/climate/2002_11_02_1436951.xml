        <p>Editorial on voters' decreased stress on environmental issues in midterm election; blames both Bush administration's skill at hiding its worrisome indifference to environment and failure of Democrats to challenge Bush's agenda in serious, coordinated fashion</p>

        <p>Environmental issues are not resonating with voters in this midterm election the way they usually do. This is as much a rebuke to the Democrats as it is a tribute to the administration's ability to hide its assault on the rules protecting the nation's natural resources under the political radar.</p>
        <p>According to the polls, the environment commands voter interest about on a par with taxes, above crime and corporate malfeasance but below the economy, education and health care. Environmental issues could yet make the difference in several tight races, Colorado and New Hampshire among them. But its national impact is not nearly what it was in 1996, when voters hammered Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America Republicans for similar transgressions -- even though Mr. Bush's indifference to the environment is every bit as worrisome as Mr. Gingrich's.</p>

        <p>Environmental issues are not resonating with voters in this midterm election the way they usually do. This is as much a rebuke to the Democrats as it is a tribute to the administration's ability to hide its assault on the rules protecting the nation's natural resources under the political radar.</p>
        <p>According to the polls, the environment commands voter interest about on a par with taxes, above crime and corporate malfeasance but below the economy, education and health care. Environmental issues could yet make the difference in several tight races, Colorado and New Hampshire among them. But its national impact is not nearly what it was in 1996, when voters hammered Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America Republicans for similar transgressions -- even though Mr. Bush's indifference to the environment is every bit as worrisome as Mr. Gingrich's.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons for this. One, of course, is the talk of war with Iraq, which has taken the wind out of nearly everything. A second is the miserable failure of the Democrats to take a stand on the issue, as Bill Clinton alertly did in 1996. One hears periodic complaints about Mr. Bush from important members of the Senate committee on the environment like James Jeffords and Joseph Lieberman, but there has been nothing resembling a sustained Democratic counterattack.</p>
        <p>Another reason is the clever way Mr. Bush has pursued his anti-environmental agenda. Except on the matter of global warming, when he stood up and openly repudiated the Kyoto Protocol, the president has stayed in the shadows -- leaving it to his cabinet officers to chip away, administratively and in the courts, at the various rules and regulations that his allies and political contributors in the oil, gas, mining, timber and other extractive industries find so annoying.</p>
        <p>These sorties have done real damage. The Interior Department, for example, continues its relentless search for oil and gas in places like Utah and Wyoming without regard to the fragility of the landscape or the niceties of the law. The same department has reversed Clinton-era regulations imposing stricter standards on mining operations. The Corps of Engineers has weakened protections for streams and wetlands. Most of President Clinton's forest protection program is now at risk -- including his plans to protect 60 million roadless acres from commercial activity, to enlarge protections for old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska's Tongass National Forest, and to manage forest lands in ways that give greater weight to environmental values.</p>
        <p>Collectively, however, these actions -- scattered across government, hidden in obscure courtrooms -- have not coalesced into a decisive political issue. There is no time to make them one before Election Day. Still, there's a lesson here for Democrats. Unless they start challenging Mr. Bush's agenda in a serious, coordinated fashion, his policies will sail on with minimum resistance.</p>
