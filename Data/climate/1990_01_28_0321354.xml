        <p>LEAD: THE Herculean labor involved in building the Shoreham nuclear-power plant may have been largely a waste, but a group of energy experts in Midland, Mich., hopes to convince Long Islanders not to overlook the value of an indestructible component: the land on which the plant sits.</p>
        <p>THE Herculean labor involved in building the Shoreham nuclear-power plant may have been largely a waste, but a group of energy experts in Midland, Mich., hopes to convince Long Islanders not to overlook the value of an indestructible component: the land on which the plant sits.</p>
        <p>Never mind the $5 billion reactor, they say. Instead, think of Shoreham as a large piece of land already connected to the power grid, and with a source for cooling water and a clutch of permits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere in New York.</p>
        <p>The entrepreneurs are the developers of the Midland Cogeneration Venture, a failed nuclear project that is being repowered with natural gas to supply electricity and industrial steam, a process called cogeneration.</p>
        <p>The project, 110 miles north of Detroit, is scheduled to complete a 23-month metamorphosis next month. About the time it enters into commercial operation, its builders, led by CMS, the corporate parent of the utility that built the Midland reactor, will probably be starting a campaign to persuade Long Island to let them do the same with Shoreham.</p>
        <p>Siting of New Lines a Problem</p>
        <p>''Siting new transmission lines is an abomination,'' William T. McCormick Jr., chairman of CMS, told a group of visitors from Long Island earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Making use of existing permits for water use, and of the decision more than 20 years ago to use the site for power generation, will save years in building another plant, he said.</p>
        <p>Matthew C. Cordaro of Long Lake Energy agreed. Said Mr. Cordaro, a former vice president of the Long Island Lighting Company, whose company hopes to participate in a conversion:</p>
        <p>''I don't know where you could site a generating plant in Nassau County or western Suffolk.''</p>
        <p>Lilco itself, however, is unenthusiastic. One reason is that conversion of Shoreham by third parties like the Long Island Power Authority and the Michigan utility would turn Lilco into an electricity buyer and reseller, rather than a producer and seller.</p>
        <p>Intense Sales Effort</p>
        <p>CMS put on an intense sales effort for the visitors, members of the Long Island Power Authority. The pitch included a videotape on conversion with a sound track that a CMS official said sounded like ''co-gen Rambo.''</p>
        <p>For the Power Authority officials, the trip to Michigan had some coincidences. The chairman, Richard Kessel, told Mr. McCormick over dinner at the Midland Country Club that he also served as chairman of the Consumer Protection Board in New York.</p>
        <p>''My job is to kick utilities,'' Mr. Kessel told Mr. McCormick. ''I'm good at it.''</p>
        <p>Shoreham is so unpopular, he said, that a converted project would probably have to be renamed. He mused about holding a contest to pick a new title.</p>
        <p>The main source of opposition to a conversion is not likely to be the partisans of another site but rather those who believe that the money needed to build a new plant would be better spent on more efficient light bulbs, refrigerators, electric motors and other consuming equipment.</p>
        <p>The environmental impact of growth is small if natural gas is the fuel, but it is smaller yet if existing supplies of power are made to do more work at lower cost, efficiency advocates say.</p>
        <p>The converters, led by CMS, argue that a converted Shoreham is the best option if a power plant is needed. (A Shoreham twin, the Zimmer reactor in Moscow, Ohio, is being converted to coal, and a 15-year-old reactor in Sacramento, Calif., may also be converted to natural gas. But in general, conversion is a strategy born of desperation.) At Midland, CMS's utility subsidiary, Consumers Power Company, had spent $4.1 billion to bring the twin-reactor project to a point that it said was 85 percent complete.</p>
        <p>Facing stiff opposition from its customers and the Michigan Attorney General, and engineering problems, including the settling of parts of the plant into mud, Consumers Power stopped work in 1984. When CMS contributed the nonnuclear portion of Midland to the new venture, it valued those assets at $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The conversion was opposed by many of those who fought the nuclear plant, and the power sales contract between the Midland Cogeneration Venture partners, which include CMS, and the CMS subsidiary, Consumers Power, has been the subject of extensive hearings before the Michigan regulatory authorities.</p>
        <p>Abandonment Called Opportunity</p>
        <p>But abandonment is an opportunity, Mr. McCormick said, adding that the Shoreham abandonment could transform the energy picture in the New York region in a positive way.</p>
        <p>In electricity terms, Long Island is the end of the line, an extended finger at the end of the power grid that must fend for itself to a large extent because geography sets limits on imports.</p>
        <p>But CMS would like to turn Long Island into the beginning of the line, an energy exporter generating enough electricity to provide steady power to Connecticut, New York City and New Jersey. Conceivably, the new transmission line being built under Long Island Sound to bring in power from the north might run in the other direction.</p>
        <p>One essential reason for a gas-powered plant bigger than the reactor is technical. The part of Shoreham that turns steam into electricity is designed for nuclear steam, which is about 550 degrees.</p>
        <p>Air Dumped at 1,000 Degrees</p>
        <p>But when it comes to fossil fuels, the higher the temperature, the higher the efficiency, and natural gas is generally used to produce hot air at 2,000 degrees.</p>
        <p>Plants that use that air to make electricity dump the air at 1,000 degrees, and that waste energy is still hot enough to make steam that the nuclear turbine can handle after it has had some modifications.</p>
        <p>But it takes the waste heat of many gas burners to make enough steam to use the nuclear turbine. At Midland, a plant that was to be 800 megawatts will run, in its initial phase, at 1,200. Eventually, the complex, which includes a mothballed turbine from a second reactor, could be used to make 3,500 megawatts.</p>
        <p>That amount of power is vast by any standard. The largest electric-generating complex in New York, in Scriba, where Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 and the James A. Fitzpatrick reactors are situated, comes to 2,500 megawatts. Shoreham was intended to be an 809-megawatt plant.</p>
        <p>Even 809 megawatts is more power that Long Island is projected to need in the near future. The settlement under which Shoreham was shut envisioned three 300-megawatt plants going into service in 1997, 1999 and 2001.</p>
        <p>Demand Rising Steadily</p>
        <p>But in the Northeast as a whole, a strong economy and a long-term trend toward greater electrification of jobs previously done with fossil fuels are steadily raising demand.</p>
        <p>New York State's position is relatively strong, but in the hottest and coldest days each year, the New England utilities have come uncomfortably close to their generating limits.</p>
        <p>In hot weather, the group of utilities that serves the region from Newark to Washington, D.C. and west to the Allegheny Mountains has had to cut voltage repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania added a large nuclear reactor, Limerick 2, earlier this year, and New England may add the Seabrook plant, but each of these represents only about one year's growth. Future growth is likely to be met by smaller gas-fired plants.</p>
        <p>Does that make an expanded, gas-powered Shoreham a good deal for Long Island?</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel pondered that question as he gazed at a row of 12 rust-colored gas-turbine exhaust stacks at Midland, each towering 120 feet over the flat landscape.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to place it on Long Island,'' he told James A. Mooney, the CMS official in charge of engineering and construction. ''Does it have to have stacks?'' ''Well, you could paint them green,'' Mr. Mooney replied.  The stacks also could be partly screened by the hilly terrain at Shoreham, said another CMS official who had scouted the Long Island site.</p>
        <p>The Swiss-built gas turbines in use at Midland are 87 megawatts each. Probably at least four would be needed before it would be sensible to use the Shoreham turbine.</p>
        <p>But if the waste heat were used in the turbine, about 43 percent of the energy in the gas would be turned to electricity, which is considered highly efficient. Most oil- and gas-fired plants achieve efficiencies of only about 34 percent.</p>
        <p>A larger plant would have lower costs per kilowatt-hour produced, say its proponents, and, Mr. Kessel noted, would have a higher assessed valuation for tax purposes.</p>
        <p>But he and other Power Authority officials expressed leeriness about large projects. He added, given the history of Shoreham, that for a conversion to work, ''This has to be seen as a good deal by Long Island.''</p>
