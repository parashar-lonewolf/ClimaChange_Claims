        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>My heart goes out to those affected by Hurricane Katrina. The devastation caused by this hurricane, however, should be a wake-up call that perhaps stronger regulations should be enforced in the future about where structures can be built and how strongly built they should be.</p>
        <p>The devastation could just as well have hit any coastal city in the United States, yet we persist in building homes and buildings on and near the water.</p>
        <p>One can only imagine the destruction in future years as the land continues to subside in some areas and water levels rise around the world as a result, in part, of global warming.</p>
