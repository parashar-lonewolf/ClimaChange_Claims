        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''ARCADIA AND METROPOLIS: MASTERWORKS OF GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM FROM THE NATIONALGALERIE BERLIN,'' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through June 7. In 1937 the Nazis seized a large collection of Expressionist works from the Kronprinzen Palace in Berlin, Germany's first museum of contemporary art. But this branch of Berlin's Nationalgalerie has made great strides in restoring what was the heart of its collection. This show of 40 works by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Emil Nolde, Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Otto Dix, Hannah Hoch, Paula Modersohn-Becker and others touches on the history of German modern art -- Expressionism, Dadaism, Neue Sachlichkeit -- from around 1910 through the post-World War I period. Its title is drawn from the early preference of the Expressionists for rural places versus their later attraction to the city. One of the show's great ''Metropolis'' paintings is Kirchner's large ''Potsdamer Platz'' (1914); in the ''Arcadia'' mode is Modersohn-Becker's ''Kneeling Mother With Child'' (1907). Satirical thrusts at the failures of the Weimar Republic by Hoch, Dix and Grosz are also standouts. Hours: Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7 for students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''BOCCIONI'S MATERIA: A FUTURIST MASTERPIECE AND THE AVANT-GARDE IN MILAN AND PARIS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through May 9. The Italian Futurist Umberto Boccioni's view of his mother as she sat before her apartment window was far from conventional. Her broken-up face is done in a distinctly Cubist style, her enormous folded hands are given frontal prominence, and the Futurist concept of simultaneity makes street activity almost part of her personage. The painting ''Materia'' is the centerpiece of this ambitious show, which studies Boccioni's work in relation to that of some European contemporaries, among them Braque, Delaunay, Duchamp, Gris and Picasso. The indebtedness of Italian Futurism to French Cubism and their rivalries are also addressed. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Fridays until 8 p.m. Admission: $15; students and 65+, $10 (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''BYZANTIUM: FAITH AND POWER (1261-1557),'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 4. This vast and humblingly beautiful show about the waning centuries of the Byzantine empire reminds us that political decay does does not necessarily mean artistic decline. Full of amazing exotica -- manuscripts, miniature mosaics, textiles, drawings, paintings -- the exhibition ends with a room of great Northern Renaissance art indebted to icons that proves Byzantium's continued reach. People who are not Eastern Orthodox believers can enjoy the earthly pleasures of aesthetic spectacle linked with historical enlightenment. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7 (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''CHRISTO AND JEANNE-CLAUDE: THE GATES, CENTRAL PARK, NEW YORK,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through July 25. At last ''The Gates,'' the long-plotted Christo-fest in Central Park, is about to be realized: in February 7,500 saffron-colored fabric panels, each suspended from a free-standing 16-foot-high framework, will be installed for 16 days on 23 miles of park walkways. The project, 25 years in the making, is saluted in this preview installation of Christo's drawings, collages, photographs, maps, diagrams and samplings of the actual ingredients, like poles, panels, bolts, supports and self-locking nuts. Like everything else the collaborative team of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, his wife, does, this documentation is as yawningly thoroughgoing as a space exploration log, sparing the viewer no detail. But for anyone who wants a pre-game fill-in, this show is indispensable. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,'' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That Native American art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting Native American art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''GUSTAV KLUTSIS AND VALENTINA KULAGINA: PHOTOGRAPHY AND MONTAGE AFTER CONSTRUCTIVISM'' AND ''WAR IN IRAQ: THE COORDINATES OF CONFLICT, PHOTOGRAPHS BY VII,'' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through May 30. Provocatively buttressed by two smaller shows, these imposing exhibitions dovetail into a chillingly informative examination of the roles of photography in art, history and science. The political, the personal and the formal alternate energetically in the first exhibition in this country devoted to Klutsis and Kulagina, who were married, and is primarily the tale of an artist whose striking photomontage posters helped establish the graphic look of the young Soviet Union, until Stalin had him assassinated. ''War in Iraq'' makes manifest the kinds of events that swirled around but rarely registered within the work of Klutsis or Kulagina. Starting with the ruins at ground zero, 53 images by nine intrepid photojournalists associated with the agency VII record the havoc that war, violence, dictatorial regimes and fanatical faith have wrought in our own time. Whether riveting, shocking, seductive or merely banal, few can resolve the question raised by even the most seemingly straightforward photograph: does it bring us closer to reality or does it distance us from a reality that is already constructed largely of photographs? Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7 (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''MOMA AT EL MUSEO: LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272, through July 25. The first broad-scale exposure of the Modern's extensive holdings from Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America, the 150 or so objects here are a small selection from the more than 2,000 it owns. But they form an arresting show, from the powerful Surrealist-  influenced ''Jungle'' (1943) by the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam to an untitled 1995 sculpture by the Colombian Doris Salcedo that invokes the political violence in her country. The sardonic humor of Marisol (Venezuela) and Fernando Botero (Colombia); the geometric tweakings of Jesús Rafael Soto and Gertrude Goldschmidt (Venezuela); the Conceptual hatchings of Felix González-Torres (Cuba) and Cildo Meireles (Brazil), among others, remind us of the artistic richness south of the border. This show joins the strength of the Modern's resources with the growing importance of El Museo as a showcase of Latino culture. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $7; students and 65+, $5 (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''OPEN HOUSE: WORKING IN BROOKLYN,'' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Aug. 15. This all-Brooklyn show of new art has been timed to coincide with the inauguration of the museum's new front entrance pavilion and public plaza. With 300 pieces installed in the fourth- and fifth-floor galleries, and spilling over into the permanent collection galleries, it's a very crowded affair. It's also all over the place in terms of media, styles and themes, not to mention quality; the good, the bad and the iffy mingle. Still, there's plenty of good work by artists you know and by some you don't, drawn from across a borough that has many different art worlds. Also on view, though not part of the show, is Alexis Rockman's mural-size painting of Brooklyn 3,000 years in the future, submerged under water as a result of global warming. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''ROTH TIME: A DIETER ROTH RETROSPECTIVE,'' Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400, and P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, through June 7. This exhaustive, exhausting but ultimately astounding exhibition offers total immersion in the art of the German-born, Swiss-based multimedia dynamo Dieter Roth (1930-1998), who not only erased the line between art and life, but also fused them into a single insoluble entity. With nearly 400 works of painting, drawing, prints, sculpture, assemblage, collage, music, poetry, film, photography, video and sound, and using every imaginable kind of found object or material -- foodstuffs included -- the exhibition moves through 50 years of incessant, obsessive art-making with remarkable clarity. It culminates in a presentation of five enormous installation pieces at the Modern's little-sister institution, P.S. 1, that reveal a seemingly boundless universe of artistic activity and a radically new picture of an artist at work. MoMA Queens hours: Thursdays through Mondays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays to 7:45 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $8.50. P.S. 1 hours: Thursdays through Mondays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; students and 62+, $2 (Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''SINGULAR FORMS (SOMETIMES REPEATED): ART FROM 1951 TO THE PRESENT,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through May 19. A lavish, mostly in-house display of Minimal art and its progeny. Along with the requisite examples by standard-bearers (Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Robert Ryman) and a few by predecessors (Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt), it features post-1960's works by a range of artists including Gerhard Richter, Charles Ray, Robert Gober, Liam Gillick, Sherrie Levine, Rachel Whiteread and Damien Hirst. Ultimately, Minimalism doesn't describe everything here. The show is a hodgepodge. But it's a stimulating hodgepodge, and it looks great in Wright's building. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''WHERE GODS AND MORTALS MEET: CONTINUITY AND RENEWAL IN URHOBO ART,'' Museum for African Art, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700, through Aug. 16. This engrossing show documents aspects of a so-called traditional African art as it existed in the recent past, and as it survives in a 21st-century world. Africa in this case means a society called the Urhobo of the Niger Delta, and the art ranges from spectacular larger than life-size figures of ancestor spirits to carvings of grotesque beasts with gaping, saber-toothed mouths, images meant to both encourage and control male aggression. Although some sculptures are now rarely produced in their original forms, they are in the paintings and prints of Bruce Onobrakpeya, a contemporary Delta-born artist of international stature, in whose art Urhobo traditions live on. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3 (Cotter)</p>
        <p>* WHITNEY BIENNIAL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through May 30. Easily the best biennial in a long time. The spirit is upbeat and ingratiating -- almost polite -- on the surface at least, with a utopian streak and a youth-heavy emphasis on gloss and craft. There's plenty of painting and drawing, ratifying the much-hyped trend, and multigenerational work, stressing ecstatic engagement and meticulousness. But the real story is the stress on the handmade in general, on materiality in whatever medium -- a change from the politics-heavy, slacker installations of recent years. The cross-generational dialogue is an interesting subtext. Among the younger set utopia does not mean 1960's-style radicalism; it implies something unattainable, except perhaps in a hand-me-down form, and therefore smaller and inherently poignant. Look for a few standout works from artists both younger and older, including Yayoi Kusama, Alec Soth, Catherine Opie, Julie Mehretu, Jim Hodges, Eve Sussman, Raymond Pettibon, Slater Bradley, Robert Mangold and Stan Brakhage, who died last year. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 62+, $9.50 (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>BRICE BROWN AND DON JOINT, ''A Marriage in Paint,'' Naumann, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 472-6800, through May 22. Painters who share a life as well as a studio, Mr. Brown and Mr. Joint nevertheless have distinctly disparate abstract styles. Mr. Joint's is one of exuberant high-key color laid down in hard-edge geometric and biomorphic shapes; Mr. Brown's looser brushwork and softer palette relates more to Abstract Expressionism. But subtle similarities might be discerned and the two have painted a collaborative canvas that comes off. Soft shapes and hard ones form a pleasant melding; wayward linear trackings play off precisely formed edges. The colors get along. But each is a persuasive painter in his own right (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* JEFF KOONS, ''Highlights of 25 Years,'' C&amp;M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, through June 5. This excellent 27-piece survey touches on all phases of Mr. Koons's career, including greatest hits like the basketballs mysteriously hovering in aquariums; the Mylar ''Rabbit'' balloon cast in shiny stainless steel; and the sexy blonde embracing the Pink Panther in glazed ceramic. The climax of the show is the 10-foot-tall ''Balloon Dog.'' Made of stainless steel and coated in coppery translucent orange, it is a breathtaking symbol of the inflationary euphoria and anxiety of our times (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>''ANIMALS AND US,'' Galerie St. Étienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734, through May 22. This menagerie of an exhibition offers many different species of animals viewed through many stylistic lenses. It includes Sue Coe's expressionistic anticruelty cartoons; William Wegman's comic photographic dog portraits; Frank Noelker's photographs of live animals in zoos; Hiroshi Sugimoto's eerie photographs of simulated animals in museum dioramas; and Rona Pondick's surrealist stainless steel dog, which has a human head and hands cast from life with a smooth and shiny canine body (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* LES KRIMS, ''Fact or Fiction,'' Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930, through May 15. In the 1970's, feminists hated Mr. Krims's staged pictures of naked women in absurd and humiliating situations. Today, these small prints from the late 1960's and early 70's are striking for their psychological urgency and mold-breaking inventiveness. His famous picture of a screaming legless man on a small table in a windowed alcove remains an image of frightening intensity. His mother seated naked in her dimly lighted living room is an image of heartbreaking vulnerability (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>JOE ANDOE, Feigen, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500, through May 15. Mr. Andoe's ghostly monochromatic paintings of pretty, erotically alluring young women and boxy 1960's-vintage cars rolling through barren, nocturnal landscapes are about memories of teenage years devoted to drinking, drugs and reckless driving on the outskirts of Tulsa, Okla. They exude the nostalgic romance of a Bruce Springsteen song (Johnson).</p>
        <p>NIGEL COOKE, Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, through May 15. This young British painter's landscapes combine Magic Realism, postapocalyptic fantasy and extreme shifts of scale. Along the bottom edges of canvases that measuring up to 6 by 12 feet, Mr. Cooke paints scruffy landscapes of dirt, weeds, and rubble in miniaturistic detail. Above, immense walls rise with passages of graffiti here and there. Looking closely you discover that tiny human heads, separated from their bodies, are unaccountably scattered about the ground (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHRISTA DONNER, Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238, through May 8. This young Chicago artist makes surreal narrative paintings on paper, cutting out and pasting together generic comic-book style images of women in colors alternately muted and acidic. Why they are connected to one another by arteries or intestinal tubing, and why the prevailing mood is one of agitated, gothic melodrama with hints of a baleful supernaturalism, remain unexplained. But something promising is brewing in Ms. Donner's world (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PAPER CHASE,'' Axel Raben, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 647-9064, through May 8. This entertaining show of things made of paper, organized by Renée Riccardo, includes Jon Rosenbaum's miniature, intricately detailed fantasy constructions; Charlene Liu's delicately visionary landscapes of cut paper and watercolor; Molly Smith's wryly simplified sculptures of a waterfall and a big blue drip leaking from a hole in the wall; Doug Morris's intensely patterned symmetrical reliefs; and Koji Shimizu's toylike, papier-mâché sculptures of industrial vehicles (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ANDRÉ PRETORIUS, ''A Year in the Life,'' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through May 8. Mr. Pretorius's comical, vividly illustrative paintings depict allegorically suggestive scenes. ''Active, Passive, Neuter'' shows three pajama-clad children in a bright modern living room -- a boy with his pants down, another with a raised switch and an amused girl watching. In ''Fear of a Second Child,'' a perplexed woman contemplates a farmer in the company of a child-size extraterrestrial and a metrosexual with a diapered chimpanzee (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''REVISITING HISTORY: SELF-PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY,'' Cristinerose/Josée Bienvenu, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 206-0297, through May 15. This show of postmodernist, photographic self-portraiture includes Yasumasa Mormura in drag, in big parodies of Pre-Raphaelite paintings; giant-size prints of Orlan as a Baroque Virgin in white robes with one breast exposed; Kimiko Yoshida in blackface wearing an American Indian headdress and as a white-faced nun; Janieta Eyre wearing Edwardian costumes in surreal pictures of herself and her imaginary twin; and John O'Reilly's naked body as an element in small Cubist montages (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ERIK SCHMIDT/NEAL ROCK, Henry Urbach, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-0974, through May 15. Mr. Schmidt, a Berlin painter, depicts corporate sterility in high-contrast, photo-derived images of spectral businessmen and office buildings. Crusty painterly surfaces call to mind stale cake frosting. The London-based Mr. Rock created ''Work From the Polari Range,'' an installation of sculptural reliefs, by squeezing colored silicone out of pastry bags. Suggesting reeflike accumulations of tropical submarine creatures, they are grotesque, seductive and comical (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* WILLIAM SCOTT, Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through June 5. Pots, dishes, fruits, vases and other domestic shapes form the basis for much of this Scottish-born painter's imagery, magically reduced to lyrical, luminous ghosts of themselves. Scott, a figure of some importance in post-World War II British art, was well known in New York, too. This small but engrossing show progresses from 1954 to 1977, and in his spare, sensual paintings shape, space and color play beautifully together (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Downtown</p>
        <p>GIDEON BOK, Plane Space, 102 Charles Street, Greenwich Village, (917) 606-1268, through May 9. In heavily worked paintings of his studio and living space, Mr. Bok captures temporal as well as visual experience. When objects or people move, he adds their new positions to the developing picture; the parts that stay still are finished, the things that move have a ghostly transparency. Combining scratchy lines, resinous glazes and troweled-on impasto, he produces a flickering, cluttered vision of bohemian transience (Johnson).</p>
        <p>FORD CRULL, ''Horror Vacui,'' Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424, through May 15. Mr. Crull produces layered, richly colored and textured paintings in which passages of brushy smearing and linear scrawling emphasize the surface, while blended areas create spaces of illusory luminosity. Heraldic, alphabetic, geometric, numerological and other kinds of mystically suggestive symbols are woven into the painterly fabric (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''INDIGESTIBLE CORRECTNESS,'' Participant, 95 Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334, through May 9, and Kenny Schachter/ROVE, 132 Perry Street, West Village, (212) 807-6669, through May 5. The Participant half of this two-part show is excellent. With sculptures by Louise Bourgeois and Richard Prince, one of Lutz Bacher's great Vargas paintings, a gender-blending collage by the artist-team Breyer P-Orridge, and metal shoes by the couturier Imitation of Christ, it's fervid, twisty, demimondaine tangle of fashion, pornography and youth culture. Part II, at ROVE, is spread out over a much larger space, which reduces the tension considerably. Still, with a circa 1940 painting by Francis Picabia and an altar by the artist Kembra Pfahler devoted entirely to her charismatic self, it's not half bad (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''OCEAN FLOWERS: IMPRESSIONS FROM NATURE,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through May 22. Dense with ethereal images and silhouettes of seaweed, this unusual exhibition shows how the needs of Victorian botanists, book publishers and inspired amateurs pushed traditional drawing and printmaking into the realm of photography without so much as touching a lens. The driving force was the need to get the wonders of nature down on paper, one way or another. Those ways run riot here and provide a startlingly revised view of the mongrel hands-on origins of the age of mechanical reproduction (Smith).</p>
        <p>''TACTICAL ACTION,'' Gigantic Artspace, 59 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-6762, through June 10. This lively but crowded and unfocused exhibition is designed to promote leftish dissidence. Highlights include scenes of the war in Iraq, drawn on location by Steve Mumford; clever anticorporate lenticular photographs by David Byrne and Danielle Spencer; David Krippendorff's noirish video about the eroticism of hate; Michele Pred's American flag sculpture, made from pen knives confiscated at airports; and a mock prison visitors' booth, with a soundtrack about teenage gang violence, by Dread Scott (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''THE DEVONSHIRE INHERITANCE: FIVE CENTURIES OF COLLECTING AT CHATSWORTH,'' Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000, through June 20. The stately English country home Chatsworth has been occupied since its construction in 1552 by the Cavendish family, headed by a long succession of dukes and duchesses of Devonshire. They have enriched it with notable collections of fine and decorative arts, an awesome library of books and manuscripts, scientific instruments, silver, furniture and needlework. A glimpse of these treasures is provided by this show, which has works by Rembrandt, Raphael, Titian, Dürer and Lucian Freud; books and drawings by Andrea Palladio; a spectacular jewelry ensemble worn at the coronation of Czar Alexander II and much else to light up the eyes of the most jaded connoisseur. The next step is a visit to Chatsworth itself, still a private home for the Cavendishes but very much open to the public (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>RALSTON CRAWFORD, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through tomorrow. Crawford, an American Modernist, painted in a stylistic range bounded by George Ault's reductivist Precisionism and Stuart Davis's jaunty, planar Cubism. This selection of paintings and photographs dating from the late 1930's to the late 70's reveals how he drew on the abstraction in his photographs of urban and industrial subjects for the composition of his hard-edged, nonrepresentational paintings (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JIM DINE, PaceWildenstein (through tomorrow) and Pace/MacGill (through next Saturday), 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292. New works by Mr. Dine include a series of medium-large paintings, each of which has a valentine heart image imbedded in an all-over field of Abstract Expressionist brushwork; a freestanding folding screen with tools, Venus de Milo reproductions and molten metal puddles attached to a steel framework, randomly spray-painted in saturated colors; and a series of big, grainy photographic views of the artist's messy studio, which make it seem like a place of scary mystery (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* CHRISTIAN JANKOWSKI, ''Now Playing,'' Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, near Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-4977, through Sunday. Spread throughout a small building, in contrasting viewing situations, the three film and video pieces in this inspired show include a Felliniesque film of people encountered on a street in Rome; a series of mysterious exit interviews with New York moviegoers; and outtakes from another director's film into which Mr. Jankowski has inserted his own script. The artist himself doesn't seem to do much of anything, but he has created something memorable: a cerebral, transparent, emotionally touching experience of the ways films flow out of and back into life (Smith).</p>
        <p>CY TWOMBLY AND JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT, Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, Chelsea,(212) 560-9075, through tomorrow. Showing these works on paper together is a natural idea given Mr. Twombly's influence on Basquiat, and the differences are as interesting as the similarities. With a mix of irony and nostalgia, Mr. Twombly's scribbly improvisations romance the cults of antique humanism and modern primitivism. Basquiat's blocky diagrammatic organizations of found words and pictographic images suggest the comic pseudo-rationalism of an inspired but mentally unbalanced street poet (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''JOHN WATERS: CHANGE OF LIFE,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222, through Sunday. In the mid-1990's the filmmaker John Waters, of ''Pink Flamingos'' notoriety and ''Hairspray'' fame, started making collages of stills from films of the past, including his own. Some collages reduce entire movies to a few images; others are devoted to themes like childbirth, cosmetic surgery and cinematic violence. Dozens of them make up the bulk of this survey; while ingenious and funny, they're a bit light to carry a show. But they are supplemented by a continuous showing of three Waters films -- the first made in 1964 when he was in high school -- that are worth the price of admission. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m., Thursdays until 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students, artists and 65+, $3 (Cotter).</p>
