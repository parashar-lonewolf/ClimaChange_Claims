        <p>OUR first decade of married life was an exercise in stunning conformity. We married in our 20's because that's when everybody else was marrying. Then we had two children right away because everybody else was doing that. We even moved to the suburbs because that's where everybody else was moving.</p>
        <p>In time, with a few extra dollars in our pockets and two children in diapers, we abandoned our youthful ideals, joined the middle class and the ranks of those whose heads would be displayed on pikes in the event of a revolution.</p>
        <p>In February, when everybody else went to the Caribbean for a week, Larry and I did too. When they returned they said they had a wonderful time. We said we did too.</p>
        <p>They went because they needed a rest and wanted to go to an island paradise, relax in the sun and have someone cater to their every whim.</p>
        <p>We didn't have any whims and we didn't believe in paradise, not even as an after-life experience. Nevertheless, we went. We didn't have minds of our own at the time.</p>
        <p>Which paradise should we choose? Anguilla, Angola, Angora, Atilla, Ayatola, Antilles, Lesser Antilles, Greater Aunt Tilly, Petit Aunt Tilly, Barbados, Barbuda, Big Barbuda, Baby Barbuda, Barbarola, Barbarosa, Barbasol? It was confusing.</p>
        <p>Some of these islands were half French and half Dutch, or half English and half Rockefeller, or half Club Med and half Hilton. To get to some of them you had to take a big plane then a little plane then a little boat and then a rusty taxi. To get to others you had to take two big planes and one little plane and then one motorboat, one rowboat and a dugout canoe. At some of them you turned in all your money for a necklace of wooden beads. At others you just turned in all your money. The basic idea was to be carefree.</p>
        <p>The first day was usually taken up with the wonder of it all. Suddenly it was summer: warm instead of cold, green instead of gray, and the children weren't with us. Best of all, there were always plenty of orientation activities on the first day: the complimentary welcoming tropical drink with plastic monkey, registration, bungalow finding, room showing, tipping, chaise dragging, towel renting and salamander appreciation.</p>
        <p>Day 2 was always a sobering experience. We would learn yet again that we could not read on the beach. It was just too hot to concentrate. Too hot, even for Jackie Collins.</p>
        <p>And so, like two amphibious creatures in a PBS nature documentary, we would lie in the sand until some internal signal as old as life itself would tell us that we had preheated to 350 and it was time to make our way to the sea. There we would submerge and swim about for several minutes before we retraced our steps up the beach to resume our patient vigil on the sand. After a preordained period of time, the amazing cycle of nature would begin again, and back we'd go to the sea.</p>
        <p>We'd become so bored that Larry began to look forward to dinner even though it was the same menu every night -- local fish with a hibiscus blossom, pur√©ed taro root with a hibiscus blossom. And a hollowed-out pineapple filled with tropical fruit.</p>
        <p>My major daytime activity was getting a tan. This was before anybody ever heard about global warming or the ozone layer. This was when melanoma sounded like an imported fruit. Getting a tan was pretty much the whole point of going to the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>Typically, by the third day, Larry would alternate pacing the beach with demonstrating how to build drip castles to other people's children. By Day 4 he resumed smoking. Now each time he lighted up I had my choice of two new activities -- looking daggers or hurling invectives.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, it took us three such vacations before we realized that we didn't like the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>What we didn't understand then that we do understand now is that Larry and I don't go on vacation to relax. Vacations are for work. We'll have plenty of time to rest when we get home. A trans-Atlantic cruise, for instance, would not be a good vacation choice for us, unless our ship came under enemy attack or ran into the perfect storm.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, we still can't figure out why, just a few years later, we signed up for a weeklong barge trip through the waterways of Burgundy. Is there anything more confining, sedentary, slow and tranquil than a barge trip?</p>
        <p>We had a fabulous time for the first few minutes. The scenery along the gently winding canal was reminiscent of my childhood picture books -- rows of poplar trees, tiny stone villages, castles, grazing cows, jumping fish, rolling hills and patchwork-quilted fields. It was heavenly.</p>
        <p>Within an hour, the miles and miles of relentless, uninterrupted tranquillity and nonstop loveliness started getting on our nerves. An occasional fisherman standing on the bank, a straw hat on his head, an old-fashioned bamboo pole in hand, might have broken the monotony were it not for the tedious local custom of waving, which obliged us to wave back -- from the moment we drifted into view until the moment we passed out of sight. According to Larry's calculations the barge was moving at two and a half miles an hour. For the next six days we waved, paced the deck, ground our molars down to the gum line and argued about whose idea this was in the first place.</p>
        <p>LARRY misses his law practice when he goes on vacation. This makes him particularly vulnerable to the siren call of international advocacy, even though people who live in foreign countries live under legal systems that do not resemble our own. Nor does he let the fact that he is not licensed to practice law in any other countries discourage him.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 2000, we stayed in a friend's authentic thatch-roofed cottage in the tiny village of Kinvarra on Galway Bay. After three extremely quaint days, we reached our tolerance for inner peace and outer rain and were ready for some utter chaos. It came just in time in the form of a land dispute that Larry learned about while hanging out in the local pub.</p>
        <p>Contractors from the big city were threatening to build a residential development of 23 tract homes in this village of 342 souls, 11 pubs and a broken-down castle, where little had changed in 50 years, where plumbing pipes ran down the outside of buildings, where cows pastured by the side of the roads as if they thought they were in India.</p>
        <p>The villagers wanted to fight back. Larry let it slip at the pub that night that he was a lawyer with a specialty in land use. He volunteered to help them.</p>
        <p>One of his more sober potential clients questioned the relevance of Irish to American zoning laws, but Larry patiently allayed his fears by explaining that they deviated in only the smallest details. Would the increased traffic adversely affect the cows? Would the proposed houses interfere with the neighbors' view of the castle? Larry assured them he dealt these routine matters all the time in Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>The papers had to be filed in three days. There was no time for delay. For the balance of our stay the neighbors gathered in our living room every day to plot against the wily city folk. The builder's plans were permanently unfurled on the kitchen table, surrounded by Padraic McKinney, Connor Joyce, Prather Houlihan, Kathleen Donovan and Larry O'Lawyer. Larry was no longer doing nothing. Neither was I -- I was a bar maid, serving pints of Guinness. We were on vacation. There was work to be done.</p>
