        <p>8 P.M. (HBO) ELIZABETH I -- Helen Mirren (right) plays England's 16th-century Virgin Queen later in life (beginning in her mid-40's). Jeremy Irons stars as the Earl of Leicester and Hugh Dancy asthe Earl of Essex, both important men to Elizabeth. When British viewers saw the film on Channel 4 last fall, Christopher Matthew of The Daily Mail declared Dame Helen ''the greatest Elizabeth of all,'' John Preston of The Sunday Telegraph found her performance ''oddly pallid'' and Rupert Smith of The Guardian didn't care for the exposition-heavy dialogue. Part 1 of 2.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (HBO) TOO HOT NOT TO HANDLE -- This documentary laments just how bad global warming is and considers what individuals can do about it.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Science) COOL FUEL -- Shaun Murphy, an Australian, and his dog, Sparky, see the U.S.A. on custom-built vehicles powered by alternative fuel sources. At one point in this two-hour special, they visit Daryl Hannah's house.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) 48 HOURS MYSTERY: THE MARILYN TAPES -- In a few months (on Aug. 5), it will have been 44 years since Marilyn Monroe (left), Hollywood's blonde of blondes, was found lying nude in her Los Angeles bedroom, dead of a drug overdose at 36. People are still questioning whether it was suicide, an accident or murder and who might have been involved. Peter Van Sant offers up new documents and interviews</p>
        <p>about the case.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Sci Fi) MAMMOTH -- A spaceship crashes into a natural history museum in Louisiana. On board is a shape-shifting life form that needs a body to inhabit. It decides on a frozen woolly mammoth, which is soon terrorizing the town. Vincent Ventresca, Tom Skerritt and Summer Glau, as a paleontologist, his father and his daughter, do their best to get through this television movie.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (CBS) SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE -- (2003). Diane Keaton plays a divorced playwright with a perfect house in the Hamptons who finds herself unwillingly playing host and nurse to her daughter's much-older boyfriend (Jack Nicholson, above, with Ms. Keaton) after his heart</p>
        <p>attack. Then the film turns into an appealing if not scintillating romantic comedy that actually celebrates middle age. (He asks, ''What about birth control?'' She answers, ''Menopause.'')</p>
