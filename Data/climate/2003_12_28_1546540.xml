        <p>I DRIVE to work alone in my car. This fact brings me into the blood brotherhood of New Jersey residents, as census figures show that three-quarters of us drive to work alone in our cars each day. The data also show that the average commute in New Jersey takes 30 minutes and is the third longest in the country. My commute, from Princeton to New Brunswick, takes 45 minutes, door to door. I wonder if other commuters in New Jersey, and throughout the nation, share the same mixture of affection and disgust for their commute that I have for mine.</p>
        <p>In the mornings, particularly, I appreciate the buffer between home and work that is provided by my commute. It's a chance to savor my coffee and take in the change of seasons. Some days, it's the only chunk of time that I really have to myself. I always listen to the radio, and this is usually news on public radio. Owing to this radio habit, certain stretches of road have taken on the ability to unleash sudden but brief emotions related to September 11th, the recount in Florida or, more incongruously, Monica Lewinsky. But for the most part, my commute is a restful, thinking part of the day. I have scores of illegible notes scattered throughout the car, with the names of songs and recording artists, books and movies that I heard reviewed, and cryptic notes related to brilliant ideas that I tried to scribble down without taking my eyes off the road for too long.</p>

        <p>I DRIVE to work alone in my car. This fact brings me into the blood brotherhood of New Jersey residents, as census figures show that three-quarters of us drive to work alone in our cars each day.

        <p>In the mornings, particularly, I appreciate the buffer between home and work that is provided by my commute. It's a chance to savor my coffee and take in the change of seasons. Some days, it's the only chunk of time that I really have to myself. I always listen to the radio, and this is usually news on public radio. Owing to this radio habit, certain stretches of road have taken on the ability to unleash sudden but brief emotions related to September 11th, the recount in Florida or, more incongruously, Monica Lewinsky. But for the most part, my commute is a restful, thinking part of the day. I have scores of illegible notes scattered throughout the car, with the names of songs and recording artists, books and movies that I heard reviewed, and cryptic notes related to brilliant ideas that I tried to scribble down without taking my eyes off the road for too long.</p>
        <p>When you drive the same route so often, certain landmarks take on a peculiar significance. There is a large dead tree along my route that is the favorite haunt of turkey vultures. I think this is because of the proximity of a quail farm that, in combination with a sudden sharp turn in the road, supplies a desirable yield of road-kill. Ten or twelve huge vultures will sit in this tree at one time, sometimes with their wings squared out to the sides. Around Halloween one year, I drove my children up to see it, but, of course, the tree was vulture-less. Thankfully, there is a habitually overdecorated house a bit farther along in my route (another landmark), and the fake hearse, tombstones and guillotine proved equally drive-worthy that day.</p>
        <p>Commuting is not all quiet meditation and autumn leaves drifting down upon the roadway, however. It is often quite dangerous. There have been the near misses when I almost didn't see the deer crossing, and angry fists brandished when I didn't push the light hard enough. Once I kind of fell asleep at the wheel and ''came to,'' still driving, on a road I didn't recognize. There was also the time when a duck flew up from the side of the road and squished straight into my windshield. Swerving or even braking at that moment would have cost my life, instead of the duck's. Nonetheless, I cried most of the way to work and was terrorized by the sight of ducklings that I imagined as motherless for the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>Owing to the hundreds of hours that I have spent in my car listening to news radio, I am remarkably well informed about the negative impact of my commute on the larger world: the dangers of ozone layer destruction, the political ramifications of our reliance on fossil fuels and the effects of automotive pollution on both weather patterns and long-term health.</p>
        <p>The quality, availability and cost of public transportation are partly to blame. The end points on my commute are unusually well connected. Still, it is both more time-consuming and more expensive for me to commute by train. The last time that I tried to take the train home, it was unaccountably delayed and spent a very irritable hour and half locating and riding a bus home down Route 27.</p>
        <p>For many of us in New Jersey, public transportation isn't even an option. There are tens of thousands of desks just in the 18 miles between Princeton and New Brunswick that are completely inaccessible by public transport. Small wonder that Route 1 was voted the worst road in New Jersey by drivers who responded to the ''Keep New Jersey Moving'' Web site poll. And most foreseeable development in the area affirms rather than punishes our reliance on cars.</p>
        <p>Given the economic and environmental ramifications of my commute, in fact, it's too bad that it isn't more uncomfortable or more costly. We are all admittedly creatures of comfort and, like all objects in nature, keep to the path of least resistance. So as long as my car has heated seats, a coffee holder and decent radio reception, I will guiltily, but comfortably, maintain my status quo among New Jersey residents and drive at least 30 minutes to work, in a car, alone.</p>
