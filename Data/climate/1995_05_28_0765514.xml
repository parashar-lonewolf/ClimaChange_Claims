        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the May 21 Jersey column "Midlife Lessons of a Meadowlands Landfill," David Corcoran gives a mistakenly optimistic impression of the state of the Hackensack Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>He talks about cleaning up pollution, banishing the dumpers and luring "classy" developers to the site. It is true that pollution has been abated to a certain extent. But dumping continues; in fact, the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission wants to open a new dump for regional construction waste in Kearney on top of a previous dump that has by no means been fully and properly closed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the "classy" developers have wreaked havoc with the marsh's ecosystem to the detriment of the critters who live there. The developers' much-ballyhooed devotion to "mitigation," the building of fake marshes to compensate for the loss of real ones, does not work for scientific reasons. Meanwhile, garbage landfills continue to leach toxins to the waterway and vent methane that can contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corcoran writes glowingly of a new commission plan -- essentially, a new master plan -- for the Meadowlands and says that "all parties" have agreed to it. In fact, that plan is only in draft form, and public review has not even begun. What's more, the plan would destroy more than 2,000 acres of open space, filling in wetlands at great loss of habitat and wildlife.</p>
        <p>The commission guarantees that only those actions stated in its plan would be carried through. But this is the same agency that presided over construction of the Meadowlands sports complex, which, contrary to your essay, was not part of the original master plan.</p>
        <p>Recently, thousands of fishermen, hunters and other interested citizens have begun a petition drive to have significant portions of the Meadowlands declared a national wildlife refuge. Something like that must be done before it is too late for the Meadowlands. ANDREW J. WILLNER Baykeeper American Littoral Society Highlands</p>
