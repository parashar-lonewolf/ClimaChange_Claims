        <p>8 P.M. (13), (49) THE STATE OF THE OCEAN'S ANIMALS -- Case studies from every corner of the globe illustrate the effects of global warming and illegal fishing on sea animals in this episode of ''Journey to Planet Earth.'' Matt Damon is host and narrator.</p>
        <p>7:30 (BET) ACCESS GRANTED -- See what it takes for Paul Wall to shoot his latest music video and check out the finished product.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) THE GREAT AMERICAN DREAM VOTE -- Two women dreaming of their own clothing line, mothers wanting to kick their adult children out of the house, and an ice cream truck owner hoping to keep his business are among the six contestants vying to have their dreams come true. The audience votes on who deserves help, and the results will be announced next week.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (NBC) FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS -- Coach Taylor has to help his players keep their minds on football and ignore dubious distractions off the field, like the envelopes of cash mysteriously appearing in their lockers. Meanwhile, an accident robs the team of its home field advantage for a big game.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CW) AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL -- The field is down to nine women, and they receive a no-holds-barred lesson in personal style. The prospective models then show off their fashion sense when they play mannequins in department store displays they create themselves.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13), (49) THE BOOMER CENTURY 1946-2046 -- Baby Boomers have transformed American culture over the last 60 years, and now those born in the postwar generation are beginning to retire. Will the people who began the cultural revolution of the 1960s redefine old age, and what will that mean for all Americans?</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (BBC America) HOW NOT TO DECORATE -- Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan, interior designers, step in to bring a 1970s design dinosaur into the 21st century.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (BBC America) WHAT NOT TO WEAR -- Mica Paris and Lisa Butcher -- singer and model and best friends -- take over the makeover show. Tonight they help two women who have had mastectomies dress to regain their self-esteem.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (NBC) MEDIUM -- Allison (Patricia Arquette, left) dreams about a young woman who is possessed, and Devalos may be able to use those dreams in investigating a friend. Miguel Sandoval, who plays Devalos, directs this episode.</p>
