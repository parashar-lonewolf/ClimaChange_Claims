        <p>'Music Is Contagious'</p>
        <p>The Museums at Stony Brook, 1208 Route 25A, Stony Brook. To June 18.  (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>This small show, focusing on the music theme in the career of William Sidney Mount, touches a large topic, for music was an important component of social interaction during the decades when Mount's genre paintings were conceived, from the late 1820's to the mid-1860's.</p>
        <p>Paintings, drawings and prints are on view, along with thematically related artifacts once owned by Mount, a Setauket resident who also wrote, played and collected tunes that reflect popular interests.</p>
        <p>The show's title, ''Music is Contagious,'' was used by a French print publisher for an 1849 lithograph based on Mount's ''Dance of the Haymakers.''</p>
        <p>Europeans had a special fascination for America's diverse cultures. Featuring two farm workers dancing to the rhythm of a violin and framed by an open barn door, the work suggests Mount's strengths in both glorifying the commonplace and building on the compositional lessons of the old masters. His skills made rustic scenes a particularly popular category of genre painting during an era characterized by national self-discovery.</p>
        <p>Mount stood apart as a storyteller who introduced a sense of immediacy to his canvases. ''The Novice,'' a triangular composition of three boys exploring a fife, is a good example of how his lively, open-mouthed figures who seem to be captured in a moment of action.</p>
        <p>A similar instantaneous impression is conveyed by raised arms, parted lips and twinkling eyes in four portraits of musicians that combine immediacy with the formal traditions of ennobling portraiture.</p>
        <p>A mystical light behind the figures and a carefully calculated illumination of facial features serve as testimony to Mount's belief, documented in his correspondence, that music contained the seeds of virtue and could have a moralizing effect.</p>
        <p>A rather simplified treatment of the face in the early ''Self Portrait With Flute'' contrasts with his later, more nuanced style, but it suits the cartoonlike anecdotal character that he inserted into work that blended a straightforward technique with a down-to-earth subject matter.</p>
        <p>'NOT Pollock/NOT Krasner'</p>
        <p>Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, 830 Fireplace Road, East Hampton. To Oct. 28. (631) 324-4929.</p>
        <p>When the motion picture ''Pollock'' is released later this year, audiences will see scores of art works used as background props in various scenes. Ostensibly by Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, all are actually set-designer copies authorized by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation.</p>
        <p>This exhibition of 22 examples results, in part, from the foundation's wish to make the existence of the replicas known to the public. Small photographs of the originals adjacent to the movie versions allow comparisons, and in some instances it is obvious that there was a degree of adjustment to suit the camera requirements.</p>
        <p>Certain copies are now in positions they originally had here in the artists' home during their lifetimes and this gives valuable insight into what the couple chose to hang. (The Stony Brook Foundation, which operates the historic site as a study center, received no art with the building.)</p>
        <p>While most often fakery immediately triggers issues of meaning, content, ethics and creativity, in this instance the first response is more of a jolt at seeing every room and hallway sparkle with a sense of vitality. The reality of the home jostles with the stage-set origin of the work.</p>
        <p>Pollock broadened subject matter to include the subconscious. Replicas lack his gestural movements and contain no direct emotional links to his psyche. Nor do they reflect the way he made process an integral part of the expression. Still, within their own context, the replicas can have a small role as reference footnotes to Pollock's interests in autonomous linear rhythms and continuous fields of action with no central reference point.</p>
        <p>'Earth, Wind and Fire'</p>
        <p>Elaine Benson Gallery 2317 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton. To June 19. (631) 537-3233.</p>
        <p>A group show dealing with the environment, ''Earth, Wind and Fire'' has a title that may stir associations with prior visual and emotional experiences, although for the most part it is a rather tame exhibition.</p>
        <p>Anne Culver leaves the most lasting impression with compelling paintings featuring burning landscapes that seem to be in part representations of fire and in part encounters with powerful red pigment.</p>
        <p>Visually controlled but mentally incendiary, Rita Welsh DiGia's small conceptual pieces make provocative, superimposed lettering as prominent as the underlying scenic images.</p>
        <p>Examples include ''Global Warming,'' ''Acid Rain'' and ''Don't Drink the Water.''</p>
        <p>Lorna Libert's paintings of small boats in coastal settings develop the wind aspect of the exhibition theme. Light-drenched thick strokes of pigment swirl about as if driven by a roaring gale, but the results are not always convincing.</p>
        <p>Ideas relating to earth form the bulk of the show, with most artists presenting fairly traditional landscape interpretations.</p>
        <p>Several concentrate on isolating a single component, like a tree, a root or a blossom, and this work tends to stand out, either because of its impact or the variety of meanings that might be conjured. Carla Messina presents idealized, enlarged flowers at their peak and Jane Johnson paints synthesized Tuscan trees that are surrounded by mystical lighting and appear otherworldly. Emily Barnett achieves wonderful results in drawings and prints that use fine, delicate lines to suggest the delicacy of bird nests. Another Barnett series depicting the intricacies of nature makes magnolia seedpods appear to have explosive energy.</p>
