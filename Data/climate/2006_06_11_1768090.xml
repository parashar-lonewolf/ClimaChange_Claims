        <p>RAPIDS</p>
        <p>By Tim Parks.</p>
        <p>246 pp. Arcade Publishing. $24.</p>
        <p>MOST novelists take themselves too seriously. They're no good at describing fun. Maybe they prefer to address the serious themes -- marital disaster, midlife crisis, terrorism -- because more cheerful subjects can so easily be dismissed as idle entertainment. But depressing subjects can just as easily stagnate: a character who moans throughout a novel isn't someone you want to spend a lot of time with. The real trick is to balance the appeal of schadenfreude with a plot that isn't afraid to hurry things along.</p>
        <p>Tim Parks has always been interested in narrative pace. His novels ''Europa'' (which involves a frenetic bus journey across the continent) and ''Judge Savage'' (featuring a philandering judge on the run from Korean gangsters) are dense and serious books that gradually accelerate into unexpected craziness. And in his latest novel, Parks has found a way of writing about the idea of velocity itself.</p>
        <p>''Rapids'' describes a kayaking trip in northern Italy in which a group of British tourists repeatedly throw themselves into a speeding river with general enthusiasm but varying levels of competence. There's a great deal of very English banter as heads are banged against rocks, techniques are shown off and lives are threatened. (''I'm Maximilian, but you're allowed to call me Max. Come to develop my skills and have a shot at my four-star and it's not true I'll be trying to avoid the washing-up.'')A Wally award -- a teddy bear on a string -- is given for the biggest idiocy of the day,like fastening the quick-release tab on the wrong side of the spraydeck.</p>
        <p>All the book's babbling voices are transcribed, in Parks's usual way, in one great flow without quotation marks. But out of this generalizing sweep -- the hard-working Indian teenager, the handsome and confident champion sportsman -- a few convincing characters emerge. Clive, a charismatic instructor, respects the river and is deeply (perhaps violently) tormented by the effects of global warming. Michela, his Italian girlfriend, idolizes Clive and longs to be English. Vince, a widowed workaholic banker, on vacation with his daughter, has feelings for Michela.</p>
        <p>It's a soap opera in the making. While the adolescents do their adolescent things -- kissing in the shrubbery, checking out porn on the Internet -- the adults clash. Clive, who takes part in antiglobalization protests, slaps Adam, who is all for free trade. It would be easy to see ''Rapids'' as a vehicle for an environmentalist tirade -- the glaciers are melting, the river is high and dangerously unpredictable -- but Clive comes across as messianic and deranged, and Adam as a soulless bore.</p>
        <p>The advantage of constructing a novel around its characters' voices is that the writer doesn't have to come down on one side or the other: the reader roots for the character he prefers. Gradually, though, the widowed banker, Vince, takes over the narrative. Exhilarated by the freedom he feels while running the rapids, he tries to avoid all thoughts of politics -- and of his professional life. He has learned the canoeing basics by the book, applying workplace rules to holiday problems, and at first is perplexed to find that his aging body won't obey him. He watches in awe as the younger members of the party effortlessly negotiate the waves. Only after a near disaster does he learn that the way to succeed in the water is not to fight it but to surrender to its pull.</p>
        <p>Vince has had a difficult middle age -- his much-loved and misunderstood wife has died, after intimations of an affair; his daughter is rebelling -- and a more ordinary novelist would allow him to wallow in self-flagellating gloom. But Parks sets Vince straight off downriver, abandoning all thoughts of the office, learning -- as it were -- to go with the flow. This is midlife crisis as burgeoning heroism.</p>
        <p>A good novel often pulls off the trick of convincing a reader that more is going on beneath the surface than a character admits. Parks, however, believes in surfaces -- and he believes in the idea of performance. Vince discovers that he can perform in his kayak, and he loves the self-forgetfulness of it. What he doesn't entirely forget, however, is his experience as a director of a multinational bank. Toward the end of the novel, once the trip has descended into inevitable disaster, he is forced to make his authority felt.</p>
        <p>One of the cleverest aspects of this very clever book is that it isn't clear which of its many striking images we're meant to be left with: is it the DeLillo-ish vision of masked terrorists chained to the railings of the Reichstag, a group with which Clive may be too closely linked? Is it Vince's cool and urbane exchange of banter with the London colleagues he may secretly want to abandon? Or is it simply the thrilling and meaningless rush of capsizing in a turbulent river? No matter. Parks makes all of them good smart fun.</p>
