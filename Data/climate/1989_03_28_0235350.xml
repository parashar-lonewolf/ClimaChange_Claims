        <p>LEAD: The environment and the economy are inextricably linked, says the Worldwatch Institute, a research organization based in Washington.

        <p>The environment and the economy are inextricably linked, says the Worldwatch Institute, a research organization based in Washington. The institute's 12-member staff regularly publishes reports exploring that connection, covering subjects like the global warming trend, the hole in the ozone layer, ocean pollution and soil erosion.</p>
        <p>Those problems can also offer business opportunities, the institute says. Cynthia Pollock Shea, who has spent five years on its research staff, has written extensively on the means by which innovation and entrepreneurship can create not only cleaner air and water but also a profit.</p>
        <p>The trick, she says, often lies in seeing value where others see only garbage.  Q. In what specific areas do you see the potential for making environmental innovations into a successful business?  A: You can make investments that improve the bottom line, and the environment, in almost any area, from global warming to ozone depletion to waste disposal and air and water pollution. In all of these areas, there's a need for innovative devices and approaches. Recycling is particularly rich.  Q. Why?  A: Waste is the new mother lode. We're producing ever greater volumes of waste - over 150 million tons in the United States over the course of a year. And there are no longer inexpensive, accessible places to put that waste. Landfills are filling up.  Q. Can you give an example of a company that's followed this approach successfully?  A: There's a company called St. Jude Polymer, in Frackville, Pa., that's named after the patron saint of hopeless causes. They had an idea to recycle PET plastic, the type from which soda bottles are made. They had a very difficult time getting bank loans, because the bank thought it was not an economical venture. But the company has expanded tenfold in the last five years. They're unable to keep up with orders for their plastic pellets, from which you can make the insulation that's used in sleeping bags, paint brush bristles, plastic box strapping and many other items.  Q. Are there other waste materials awaiting the invention of innovative reprocessing techniques?  A: Many. If you can invent a way to reprocess magazines, for instance, you've got a market just waiting for you. The number and different types of magazines are increasing, but magazines are currently not recycled because of the clay used to make glossy paper, as well as the glue binding.  Q. Isn't it unrealistic, though, to say that an entrepreneur can tackle a problem of global scale - like global warming or the hole in the ozone layer - and hope to make either a difference or a profit?  A: It's increasingly realistic. Environmental problems have become so severe that they threaten the viability of the planet. And thresholds of public perception are starting to be crossed, since the problems are hitting close to home.  Q. So how do you make a profit from addressing such problems?  A: In such an environment, if you can invent devices that help solve these problems, they will sell. You could develop something like a film for automobile windows that would mean the car would heat up less. Therefore you would use the air-conditioner less, thereby saving you energy and helping to save the ozone layer, because the refrigerant used in air-conditioning units is CFC's, or chlorofluorocarbons, which also contribute to global warming.  Q. What if an entrepreneur isn't an inventor, and doesn't have a research and development budget?  A: There are plenty of innovative designs for products that already exist; what's needed is consumer education in order to create a market for them. There are many products that are environmentally sound but are not being used, either because consumers are not aware the item is available or because there are institutional barriers.  Q. What precedent is there to suggest that a society-wide change in environmental consciousness could ever occur?  A: As recently as World War II, there was an incredible public ethic that virtually every material had to be saved for the war effort. They saved metal goods to be melted into guns and bullets, and they saved everything else, all the way down to bones and hair and nylons.</p>
