        <p>SITTING on Bill Solecki's desk at Montclair State University was a study outlining the probable effects of global warming toward the end of the century: more frequent severe winter storms, sending floodwaters surging into such places as Jersey City and entrances to the Hudson River tunnels.</p>
        <p>The good news -- according to the new governmental study that Dr. Solecki helped edit -- is that you will be able to wear short-sleeved shirts more often.</p>

        <p>SITTING on Bill Solecki's desk at Montclair State University was a study outlining the probable effects of global warming toward the end of the century: more frequent severe winter storms, sending floodwaters surging into such places as Jersey City and entrances to the Hudson River tunnels.</p>
        <p>The good news -- according to the new governmental study that Dr. Solecki helped edit -- is that you will be able to wear short-sleeved shirts more often.</p>
        <p>The report did not put it that way exactly, nor did Dr. Solecki -- who as a scientist speaks in more weighty terminology befitting a soon-to-be full professor of geography in the department of earth and environmental studies.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' said Dr. Solecki, 39. ''The world meteorological organization just declared today that 2001 will probably be the second-warmest year on record, second to 1998. But this has been the warmest fall, particularly for the region, and you know, these kind of warmer temperatures are illustrative of what future climate change might look like.''</p>
        <p>Like what? he was asked.</p>
        <p>''Potentially, we could start looking more like Atlanta,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The report -- prepared for the United States Global Change Research Program, which was established by Congress a decade ago -- focused on New Jersey, New York and Connecticut and was one of more than a dozen regional studies. A general study that took in the entire United States was made public last year.</p>
        <p>One aspect of climate change that experts have to ponder in making plans, the report says, is that sea level has risen 0.09 to 0.15 inches a year in the New York metropolitan region over the last 100 years. And with the climate warming, the level may rise 4.3 to 11.7 inches by the 2020's, 6.9 to 23.7 inches by the 2050's and 9.5 to 42.5 inches by the 2080's, all of which would lead to damaging floods.</p>
        <p>Noting that some of the highest growth rates in the United States occur in coastal counties -- and specifically mentioning high-rise construction in Jersey City, Hoboken and Edgewater -- the report says the Jersey coast is especially vulnerable. A big hurricane would be much more damaging with high sea levels, Dr. Solecki says.</p>
        <p>The study of the New York area, published by the Columbia Earth Institute at Columbia University and called ''Climate Change and a Global City: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change -- Metro East Coast,'' assessed the effect of climate change in such areas as water supply, public health and energy demand.</p>
        <p>Dr. Solecki and his co-editor, Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at the Columbia Earth Institute and a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, led a team of specialists who contributed chapters, and they wrote several themselves.</p>
        <p>The two first met several years ago while working on a scientific study of climate and population in China, India and the United States, she as a biophysical scientist studying the effects of climate change on the physical environment and he as the social scientist exploring its effect on people.</p>
        <p>When the leadership of the Columbia Earth Institute asked Dr. Rosenzweig to head up the climate study of the New York metropolitan region, she immediately thought of teaming up again Dr. Solecki.</p>
        <p>''He's a geographer and a specialist in urban areas and urban hazards, and is really excellent at weaving together the climate and social elements of how climate extreme variability and change affect the human sectors,'' Dr. Rosenzwieg said. ''He's just absolutely great to work with.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''We feel that the report really is groundbreaking in its look at an urban area. It is really the first comprehensive study of climate change impacts in an urban area and such an important urban area as New York.''</p>
        <p>Bill Solecki's interest in the landscape around him is rooted in his attraction to biology, history and environmental issues as a child.</p>
        <p>''A field that kind of blends them is geography because it looks at human environments and how they've changed over time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His interest in geography may also stem from his early travels -- beginning at the age of 2.</p>
        <p>''My parents were archaeologists, so I went overseas a lot as a kid, mostly Europe and the Middle East,'' Dr. Solecki said. ''There was a point before the age of 8 where I'd been overseas more than in the United States.''</p>
        <p>His father, Ralph, is a professor emeritus of archaeology in the anthropology department at Columbia University and his mother, Rose, also taught archaeology at Columbia, New York University and in the City University of New York system.</p>
        <p>When they were not traveling, the Soleckis lived in Manhattan. When their son was 2, they moved to Bergen County, settling for seven years in Leonia and then in Demarest, where Bill attended Northern Valley Regional High School. It was there that he focused his efforts on biology and history.</p>
        <p>He received a bachelor's degree from Columbia in 1984 and then attended Oregon State University for a year before transferring to Rutgers, where he earned a master's degree in geography in 1987 and a doctorate in 1990.</p>
        <p>At Rutgers, he participated in research on technological hazards and airborne acute toxic releases and was also a teaching assistant. In 1991, he joined the geography department at Florida State University, where he taught for six years. Although he had tenure there, his research interests drew him back to New Jersey, and he joined the faculty at Montclair State four years ago.</p>
        <p>''I still have his ice skates,'' said David Robinson, the New Jersey State climatologist and a professor of geography at Rutgers when Dr. Solecki was a student.  ''He gave them to me when he moved to Florida State. He said, 'I won't be needing these.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Robinson said Dr. Solecki was interested in the human dimension of climate change.</p>
        <p>''What Bill brings to it is the discipline of geography and the ability of geography to cross between the social dimensions of an issue and the physical dimensions,'' Dr. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Solecki is a member of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment of the National Academy of Sciences as well as chairman of the Human Dimensions of Global Change Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers.</p>
        <p>Like his parents before him, Dr. Solecki, who is married and has a 9-year old son and 5-year old daughter, finds himself traveling often, and has made many trips to China.</p>
        <p>As to what he hopes to accomplish with his work, Dr. Solecki said, ''I guess most importantly to make people aware of the process of environmental change and how their actions affect the environment and therefore raise questions about how to more effectively and efficiently interact with the environment.''</p>
        <p>And, he added, ''To promote better stewardship and greater equitable distribution of scarce resources.''</p>
