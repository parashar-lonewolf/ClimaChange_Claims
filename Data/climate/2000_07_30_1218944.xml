        <p>Since the early 1980's, automakers have made small fuel-economy gains on some models only to make other vehicles larger and more powerful, with poorer mileage. The result has been ever-increasing emissions of global warming gases and more dependence on foreign oil. Ford Motor changed course, vowing to increase the average mileage of all its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent, to 23 miles a gallon from 18, by 2005. Ford will also improve the fuel economy of its other models.</p>
