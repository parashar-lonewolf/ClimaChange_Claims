        <p>President Bush rushed today to side with Far West loggers in a war with environmentalists over a threatened owl, vowing to block renewal of the Endangered Species Act unless it takes into account jobs and the economy while protecting vanishing creatures.</p>
        <p>The President's position, long implicit but not formally announced until now, would force a basic change in the 19-year-old law, one of the strongest environmental measures ever enacted.</p>
        <p>"The Endangered Species Act was intended as a shield for species against the effects of major construction projects like highways and dams, not a sword aimed at the jobs, families and communities of entire regions like the Northwest," Mr. Bush said. "It's time to put people ahead of owls."</p>
        <p>The law now requires the Government to take steps to protect threatened wildlife, regardless of the economic effects on towns or regions where the wildlife live. Effort to Change Law</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's statement marked a significant step in what has become an election-year transition from advocate of strict environmental laws to a candidate who sees economic benefits in relaxing environmental restrictions.</p>
        <p>In the first two years of his Presidency, Mr. Bush pushed through a Clean Air Act that strengthened controls on virtually every source of air pollution in the country, barred construction of a new dam in Colorado, halted oil exploration off both coasts and ordered a Government-owned electric utility to reduce pollution that clouded the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p>And his Administration added plants and animals to the endangered species list at an annual rate faster than any President since Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>But since last summer, when Mr. Bush approved a proposal that would open half the nation's wetlands to development, the President has favored an approach to environmental policy aimed at protecting jobs. In January, he halted new environmental regulations that he said would be too costly, and he speeded up those the White House considered friendly to business. He removed restrictions on logging in the national forests, approved efforts by the Justice Department to relax enforcement of strip-mining laws and negotiated out of an international treaty's restrictions on American production of carbon dioxide. Decades of Bitter Debate</p>
        <p>The Endangered Species Act has been a point of contention between conservative and liberal political interests for decades, precisely because it is so unbending. In the past, Federal courts have halted billion-dollar dams to save tiny snail-darters in the waters below them, and have limited subdivisions to save desert kangaroo rats.</p>
        <p>Here in Washington, where timber companies are struggling in court with environmentalists over the fate of a threatened bird, the northern spotted owl, Mr. Bush assailed the act as a "broken" law that he pledged "will not stand." He offered no details of his favored replacement, except to say that it should give "greater consideration to jobs, families and communities." But his sentiment was clear.</p>
        <p>The challenge to put people ahead of owls drew cheers from nearly 5,000 people crammed into a chilly local lumberyard here, although residents said none of the forests in this part of the state are home to the owls.</p>
        <p>Colville, near Spokane, is a Republican stronghold in nominally Democratic Washington. The dispute over the owls is centered mostly in far western Washington and Oregon, where the logging industry is badly depressed and Mr. Bush is far less popular.</p>
        <p>It also was not clear what Mr. Bush's threat to block renewal of the endangered species law actually means in practical terms. Congress has not sought to re-authorize the act this year, in part, Republicans charge, because it would force Democratic lawmakers to take a stand on the spotted owl.</p>
        <p>The White House is seeking instead to place language that would reinterpret the act in the $7 billion Interior Department appropriations bill, which is now in a House-Senate conference.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the department, Steve Goldstein, said Mr. Bush's challenge was technically aimed at a future re-authorization of the act, but he refused to rule out a Presidential veto of the Interior bill if his language was rejected.</p>
        <p>The Endangered Species Act, signed by President Nixon and enacted in 1973, prohibits the Government, with very rare execeptions, from considering economic factors in identifying animals and plants that are threatened with extinction. The law allows the President to name a Cabinet-level committee, popularly known as the God Squad, which can approve plans to save a species even if the palns take into account economic considerations like the number of jobs affected. But that has only been done twice: this year and in 1979. The first time, the committee approved a dam in Wyoming near a habitat of the endangered whooping crane. Last May, the panel voted to allow logging in Oregon on 1,700 acres that are a home of the spotted owl.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists swiftly assailed Mr. Bush's remarks today.</p>
        <p>"A cost-benefit analysis would gut the Endangered Species Act," said Eric Glitzenstein, a Washington environmental lawyer who has been an adversary of the Interior Department. "It would substitute an economic judgment for a scientific and biological judgment on the status of species." Popular Stand Here</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's comments were cheered by hundreds of members of the Alliance for Freedom, a national group that hopes to roll back environmental restrictions.</p>
        <p>"This is extremely encouraging to those of us who have been a besieged community the last four years," said Larry Mason, executive director of the Washington Commercial Forest Action Committee, in Forks, Wash. "Finally, there is a discussion on the Presidential level of the appropriateness of a law like the Endangered Species Act."</p>
        <p>In his remarks today, Mr. Bush sought to depict his position on the act as a moderate one, saying Congress had always contemplated a balance between environment and economy.</p>
        <p>"Not far from here is a timber town called Forks," Mr. Bush said. "Like Colville, Forks supported a mill, and the mill supported a community. Because of a lack of timber, the mill had to close. Today unemployment at Forks is at 20 percent. The car dealership has closed. The clothing store is gone."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush maintained there was a single reason for the economic devastation: "The balance has been lost" between economics and environmental needs.</p>
        <p>"Today," he asserted, "when harvesting on Federal timberland is stopped outright by 13 different lawsuits under 7 different statutes, each inconsistent with the others, the balance has been lost. It's time to fight for jobs, families and communities."</p>
        <p>Flying by helicopter into this town of 5,500 people deep in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, Mr. Bush also opened his Federal grab-bag again, as he has repeatedly in recent weeks, to strengthen local industry.</p>
        <p>He said he would not sign a new species law unless he is given a specific plan "to harvest enough timber to keep timber families working in 1993 and beyond." He also promised to mandate that all logs cut from Federal lands in Washington be processed at local mills, rather than exported uncut to foreign ports. On Thursday, the President moved to keep idle timber mills open by waiving Federal rules that slow the cutting of dead and dying timber in the West, where drought and disease are rampant in forests.</p>
        <p>The exporting of uncut logs, productivity improvements in lumbering and a shift of the industry to the South have contributed to a large loss of jobs in the Western timber business.</p>
        <p>Washington and Oregon are at the center of the debate over saving the spotted owl, a subspecies now reduced by logging to about 3,000 nesting pairs in Washington, Oregon and California. The owl lives mostly in the dwindling stands of old-growth forests that are among the last areas untouched by timber firms.</p>
