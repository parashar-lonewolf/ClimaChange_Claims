        <p>LEAD: Scientists who have investigated the death of 1,800 people in Cameroon in August generally agree that they were killed by carbon dioxide erupting from Lake Nios. They differ, however, on the cause of the eruption.</p>
        <p>Scientists who have investigated the death of 1,800 people in Cameroon in August generally agree that they were killed by carbon dioxide erupting from Lake Nios. They differ, however, on the cause of the eruption.</p>
        <p>Meeting here this week, American and French investigators said they believed the carbon dioxide came from remnants of volcanic eruptions that produced the lake crater ages ago.</p>
        <p>The two groups differ on the source of the gas. A French team said the gas was blown from beneath the lake bed by a steam-driven explosion.</p>
        <p>The Americans suggested that the gas had gradually percolated through the lake floor and accumulated in deep layers of the lake water, which became supersaturated. Then some effect, such as a sudden intrusion of added carbon dioxide, triggered a discharge of the gas from solution into bubbles that erupted from the lake surface. Meeting of Volcanologists</p>
        <p>The scientists, attending a meeting of volcanologists here, described some of the clues in interviews.</p>
        <p>Some survivors were severely burned and had no recollection of what happened. Others were covered with sores that the French team attributed to acid burns, although nearby trees and bushes, blown down in the eruption, showed no signs of burns.</p>
        <p>Pathologists with the American team liken the sores to bedsores that the victims may have developed while lying unconscious for long periods.</p>
        <p>The French studied the effects of breathing carbon dioxide. Until now, according to Francois Le Guern of the French team, little was known of the effects of breathing pure carbon dioxide. It was assumed that death would occur from lack of oxygen, but that carbon dioxide was not poisonous.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, it was thought, the effect is insidious, creeping up on a person who does not recognize the symptoms.</p>
        <p>''We had to known how it feels,'' Mr. Le Guern said, ''so we put our heads into it.'' Effect on the Nervous System</p>
        <p>It turned out, he said, that inhalation of pure carbon dioxide affects the central nervous system, inducing almost instantaneous unconsciousness. The burns are believed to have occurred where people fell into their cooking fires lacking the reflexes that might have caused them to withdraw.</p>
        <p>Michele L. Tuttle of the United States Geological Survey, who is a specialist in lake chemistry, described how the landscape on her arrival, a week after the disaster, was littered with thousands of decaying cattle. Yet no flies were swarming about the carcasses.</p>
        <p>She then realized that the flies had been killed, as well as the birds. It was a silent landscape. Soon, flies arrived from elsewhere, as did flocks of vultures wheeling overhead.</p>
        <p>Another clue cited by the French was the account by one native of a jet emerging from the lake glowing with a ''light, like fire.'' He told of explosions that lasted 20 minutes, and waves that sloshed back and forth in the lake for two hours or more.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Le Guern, who is with France's National Center for Scientific Research, the waves swept away all ground cover to a height of 260 feet at one end of the lake, yet rose to a lesser height at the opposite end.</p>
        <p>The Americans are skeptical of witnesses who speak of a jet emerging from the lake. But Dr. Le Guern said another expedition member had seen a similar effect when a new explosion occurred during a night in December.</p>
        <p>In addition to the French and American teams, expeditions were dispatched to Cameroon from Britain, Italy and Japan. All are represented here at a conference marking the 75th anniversary of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, operated by the United States Geological Survey.</p>
        <p>Determining what caused the Lake Nios catastrophe is of concern because it was the second such event in Cameroon in two years. In the 1984 eruption, at Lake Monoun, more than 30 lives were lost. Both lakes occupy volcanic craters and, since there are 31 such lakes in Cameroon and others elsewhere, recurrrences are feared.</p>
        <p>If the American assessment of the cause of the Lake Nios eruption is correct, it should be possible to monitor the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the deep lake waters. If necessary, the water could be pumped to the surface, allowing its carbon dioxide to escape.</p>
        <p>If the French theory is correct, such countermeasures would be impractical. Nevertheless, it should be possible to study each lake for clues to carbon dioxide emission and define the most hazardous areas nearby.</p>
        <p>Because carbon dioxide is heavier than air, scientists theorize that it flowed like water - at 30 to 40 miles per hour - down the valleys radiating from the crater.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is invisible and odorless. The American team said half the survivors they interviewed at hospitals said they experienced burning eyes and difficulty breathing, and described either the smell of rotten eggs, which could denote hydrogen sulfide, or that of gunpowder.</p>
        <p>The physiologists suspect the gunpowder smell may have been an illusion induced by the effects of carbon dioxide on the nervous system.</p>
        <p>The gas killed residents in villages up to eight miles away and as much 400 feet above the lake level, indicating that it filled the crater to that elevation.</p>
        <p>One of the challenges has been to explain production of so much gas. The Americans believe it could have accumulate in the bottom waters. The French suggest that it accumulated in a sandy deposit formed by the acidic breakdown of granites under the lake.</p>
        <p>The sand would also have accumulated water whose temperature would increase until it burst forth as steam in a so-called phreatic explosion.</p>
        <p>The French team was told by a helicopter pilot that trees around the lake had been coated with white material. A heavy rain washed it away before samples could be collected.</p>
        <p>While the French believe the victims were chemically burned, as by sulfuric acid, no residue of acid has been found. The French argue that the explosive jet carried the acid through the lake too fast for any to remain and that rain washed the trees clean.</p>
        <p>An American argument against the jet hypothesis has been the lack of evidence of a rupture in the lake floor, although the bottom survey may have been incomplete, and the absence of suspended sediment in the lake.</p>
        <p>The upheaval envisioned by the American specialists differs from the seasonal turnover of water that occurs in some lakes when surface layers become heavier than deep layers.</p>
