        <p>Heavy flooding has killed more than 100 people across Afghanistan, relief workers said today as a Red Cross official warned of an ecological disaster in the war-devastated country.</p>
        <p>At least seven provinces, covering more than a quarter of Afghanistan, have been affected by floods brought on by melting snow and heavy rains, aid workers  said. They said they had received reports of some 100 deaths but the toll was likely to be much higher. About 3,000 homes were destroyed or badly damaged and  thousands of cattle and other livestock killed.</p>
        <p>This is just the first symptom of a major ecological disaster affecting the whole of the Hindu Kush" mountain range, said Bob McKerrow, the leader of the Kabul delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p>
        <p>In the northern province of Faryab, two villages were virtually washed away when a giant wall of water crashed down on the area Friday, an aid worker said.  Southern and northwestern areas also have been affected.</p>
        <p>Aid groups are trying to assess the damage and provide relief but are being hampered by poor communications.</p>
        <p>The arrival of spring each year melts the snow on the vast Hindu Kush mountain range, causing rivers to swell and burst their banks. But this year, the heavy rains have combined to produce the worst flooding for decades.</p>
        <p>Afghanistan, torn by 17 years of civil war, has no functioning central Government, with parts of the country controlled by various warring Islamic factions. Deforestation, poor water management and over-grazing are blamed for the ecological problem.</p>
        <p>"We are seeing provinces, which were once rich in forests, virtually stripped down to nothing," Mr. McKerrow said. "Grasses and alpine vegetation have been removed because people are either grazing or ploughing right up to the snowline."</p>
        <p>"The whole Hindu-Kush is being denuded of forest cover," he added. "The mountains can no longer cope." Global warming, he said, had changed Afghanistan's weather patterns, producing unseasonal rain. In Badakshan, it has rained continuously for three months.</p>
