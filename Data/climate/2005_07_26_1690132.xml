        <p>Editorial on life-threatening heat in desert Southwest this summer as reminder that humans survive at such high temperatures only with huge expenditures of energy, which they also must be able to pay for</p>

        <p>By any measure, this has already been a summer of extremes. The brutality of the record-setting heat that lay over the desert Southwest for the past two weeks may have broken at last, but it has not really dissipated. It has merely slid further east and north, where it is torturing the country's midsection. Life is barely tolerable in Phoenix during an ordinary summer, when the monsoons arrive on schedule. But when the temperature passes 110 degrees day after day, as it did recently, with barely any respite at night, the city nears the very edge of human habitability. At 117 degrees, Las Vegas becomes a mirage, an implausible experiment in desert living. Now it is Chicago's turn to swelter.</p>
        <p>Behind the crisis of this anomalous heat lies an underlying anxiety about its provenance. Taking global warming seriously means, in part, understanding that it is a broad-scale pattern of incremental changes, a shifting of averages over the long term rather than the immediate cause of today's weather. It may not be possible to say that this heat wave or the drought that is afflicting Europe has been caused by global warming, especially when some of the records that fell recently were set many years ago. But it is also impossible to say that these temperature extremes are not part of the cumulative human impact on the climate.</p>

        <p>Behind the crisis of this anomalous heat lies an underlying anxiety about its provenance. Taking global warming seriously means, in part, understanding that it is a broad-scale pattern of incremental changes, a shifting of averages over the long term rather than the immediate cause of today's weather. It may not be possible to say that this heat wave or the drought that is afflicting Europe has been caused by global warming, especially when some of the records that fell recently were set many years ago. But it is also impossible to say that these temperature extremes are not part of the cumulative human impact on the climate.</p>
        <p>Climatologists argue that the baseline changes caused by global warming will probably amount to only a few degrees, but what is most worrying about a heat wave like this is witnessing the effect that a shift of a few degrees can have. Temperatures like those in Phoenix and Las Vegas last week are a reminder that the threshold of human tolerance for heat is as absolute as our tolerance for cold. We survive at such high temperatures only with huge expenditures of energy. Those who cannot afford the energy run the risk of death.</p>
