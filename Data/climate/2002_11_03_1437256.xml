        <p>IT'S on a coast, its sandy beaches are havens for the Hollywood set, and it tends to pass unusual laws that are seen as either ahead of the curve or out in left field, depending partly on whether others follow suit.</p>
        <p>It is Suffolk County, the California of the East.</p>
        <p>Since the Suffolk Legislature was formed in 1970, the list of products and behaviors it has banned has grown to include everything from certain types of detergent to festive balloon releases to herbal cigarettes.</p>
        <p>If all the proposed bans had passed, residents from Montauk to Huntington would have to go jogging with headphones covering only one ear, dim the lights illuminating their driveways and patios and stop cursing during Little League games.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists made fortunes acting on the frantic calls they received from the makers and marketers of the latest endangered products -- until Suffolk enacted a series of tough anti-lobbying regulations.</p>
        <p>Some careful watchers of the Suffolk Legislature are wondering whether the next thing to crack down on ought to be crackdowns themselves.</p>
        <p>''I call it ban burn,'' said one legislative aide who asked to remain unidentified. ''So many have come at one time.''</p>
        <p>But a ban ban does not appear likely. This year alone, lawmakers have made it illegal to release more than 24 balloons at once, smoke within 50 feet of public entrances to county buildings and hospitals, and ride motorized scooters in public. Currently under consideration are bans on the sale of Ironite fertilizer, dietary supplements containing the herb ephedra and, once again, smoking.</p>
        <p>At times, Suffolk's bans have become contagious.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Suffolk was thought to be the first county in the nation to outlaw hand-held cellphone use while driving. The measure was copied by Nassau County and then by New York State.</p>
        <p>At other times, the bans have encouraged more chuckles than copycats. Some critics simply disagree with the substance of Suffolk's bans. Others believe that legislators' ideas may have merit but that enactment makes sense only at the state or federal level.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Legislator Michael D'Andre initiated a law severing the county's leases for Toshiba copiers after reports accusing a Toshiba subsidiary of selling the Soviet Union equipment used to make quieter submarines.</p>
        <p>The cold war may be over, but Mr. D'Andre's venture into foreign policy is still in place.</p>
        <p>The previous year, Mr. D'Andre made a less successful attempt to bar Suffolk from doing business with countries that dealt with terrorist nations, including Syria, Libya, Nicaragua, Iran, Lebanon and South Yemen.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's anything wrong with the Legislature making a statement on this issue,'' Philip Nolan, a Democrat and the minority leader at the time, was quoted as saying. ''But the notion that we're going to have an impact on the policies of Libya is ludicrous.''</p>
        <p>Asked recently if he stood by his anti-terrorist proposition, Mr. D'Andre, who retired from the Legislature about a year ago, said, ''Absolutely.'' He added: ''I have no sympathy for totalitarian countries.''</p>
        <p>Last year, legislators passed a law regulating carbon dioxide emissions from local power plants. The original proposal, which would have required major renovations and electricity rate increases, was amended, and the version now in place ''makes more of a symbolic move to express a feeling that carbon dioxide emissions need to be reduced,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority.</p>
        <p>Critics say that the county should try regulating emissions from coal plants in the Midwest, arguably a bigger problem for Long Islanders' air quality.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kessel applauded the Legislature for its law, even if its effects have been negligible.</p>
        <p>''They're pioneers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a few cases, Nassau County has beaten Suffolk to the punch. Last month, for example, Nassau passed strict regulations that outlaw smoking in all indoor restaurants and bars. Suffolk is still mulling similar legislation. But in 1984, when Suffolk passed its first smoking regulations, which prohibited smoking in significant sections of workplaces, as well as in movie theaters and while standing in line indoors, it was ahead of its time.</p>
        <p>''This was the first crusade,'' said Paul Sabatino II, counsel to the Legislature. ''It was before it was popular.''</p>
        <p>But why Suffolk? Why does the county seem to be such fertile ground for prohibiting, outlawing, restricting and mandating?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabatino suggested that to some extent, it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
        <p>''When you establish a tradition, people feel almost an obligation to carry it on, I think,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Until 1970, Suffolk was governed by a Board of Supervisors made up of the heads of the county's 10 towns, leaders who were primarily concerned with the goings-on in those towns. The creation of the Legislature meant there were suddenly 18 politicians, many of them newly minted and all of them eyeing countywide measures.</p>
        <p>One of the Suffolk Legislature's first moves was to ban sales of detergents containing phosphates, which polluted the waterways. The restrictions were lifted in 1981, after it became clear that Suffolk residents were simply using Nassau imports and after detergent makers reformulated their products. But the ban was still in place when William H. Kelly, now the mayor of Asharoken, moved there.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ''People were smuggling Tide from Nassau County. Everyone smuggled it. Now I can't let my child's balloon get away.''</p>
        <p>Actually, he is safe unless the child has 25 balloons. Nonetheless, Mr. Kelly has called for the abolition of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Many of Suffolk's bans, like the detergent restrictions, have hinged on environmental concerns. Suffolk residents tend to be particularly environment-conscious, perhaps because the county is constantly trying to ward off the same fate as Nassau, which is more densely populated and heavily developed.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Suffolk became the first county in the nation to pass a law requiring bottled beverages to carry deposits. And in 1988, the county banned certain plastic and Styrofoam products used to package fast foods.</p>
        <p>Other restrictions have to do with quality of life and personal safety -- two big reasons why many people move to places like Suffolk in the first place.</p>
        <p>''People move to the suburbs for these things, for safety and for comfort,'' said Stanley B. Klein, a political science professor at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University, in Brookville. ''And they want to maintain that.''</p>
        <p>Maybe it has something to do with Suffolk's unusual bipartisan governing coalition. While, say, Nassau County legislators tend to vote in lock step along party lines, Suffolk is ruled by a loose coalition that is led by Paul J. Tonna, the Republican presiding officer, but includes Democrats as well. Both Democrats and Republicans hold committee chairmanships.</p>
        <p>''When you're dealing with a nonpartisan coalition of legislators, every single idea can see the light of day,'' Mr. Tonna said. ''We don't have a rules committee that kills legislation, so a lot of stuff gets out there.''</p>
        <p>Allan Binder, a Republican whose 13 years in the Legislature have earned him something of a reputation for opposing proposed bans, also attributed the phenomenon to the political structure, but his analysis was less complimentary.</p>
        <p>''Party politics helps members do what they would like to do and feel comfortable doing what's right, even though it's not politically popular,'' Mr. Binder said, adding that in Suffolk ''they just come up with these wild ideas as individuals, and then there's no structure to employ some discipline.''</p>
        <p>In a form of subtle resistance that he insists is also a genuine effort at lawmaking, Mr. Binder has proposed a ban of his own, a law that would prohibit adults from smoking in a car when children are passengers.</p>
        <p>''It protects those who can't help themselves -- children,'' Mr. Binder said of his proposal, inspired in part by the strict smoking regulations now being considered, and which he opposes.</p>
        <p>''I also know that there's an aspect of this bill that exposes the hypocrites in the Legislature,'' Mr. Binder said. ''We love saying we're the first in the nation. But if we're worried about something, fatty meat has killed a lot more people than ephedrine.''</p>
        <p>Ephedrine is an herbal stimulant that acts like an amphetamine and is used in weight-loss and energy products. It has been linked to heart attacks, strokes and seizures, and Legislator Jon Cooper wants the county to ban it.</p>
        <p>Bradford W. O'Hearn, a Democratic political consultant with an office in Melville, noted that much of the business of county government, like welfare and health care, pertains to poorer residents. Restrictions that address quality-of-life issues, he suggested, are one way for county legislators to appeal to their middle-class voters.</p>
        <p>And with legislators running for office every two years, Mr. O'Hearn said, attempts to outlaw an annoying suburban scourge -- or publicize and then ban an invisible one (how many people had heard of Ironite fertilizer, or knew that it contains arsenic, before Legislator Vivian Viloria-Fisher proposed taking it off the shelves?) -- may be a relatively easy, low-budget way to prove one's mettle.</p>
        <p>''In a body of 18 members, there's always a scramble to stand out, not to be one of the crowd, not to be a back-bencher,'' Mr. O'Hearn said. ''The temptation to be seen as doing something is tremendous.''</p>
        <p>Some of the bans come from the constituents themselves -- a constituent has a pet issue, and the legislator takes it upon himself to address that issue with a law.</p>
        <p>Someone is struck by a car while jogging and listening to music on earphones? Why not require joggers to keep one ear headphone-free? That is what one legislator proposed in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>The law failed, but not without serious consideration. ''It was a lively debate,'' Mr. Sabatino recalled.</p>
        <p>Speaking of pet issues, Mr. Sabatino mentioned one passed in 1985 that permits people to break car windows to rescue animals that appear to be sweltering inside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper, a Democrat, has proposed banning all dietary supplements containing ephedra even though two major manufacturers of herbal supplements containing it are based in Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>''Even though I think the federal government should be banning this, I'm going to do what I can at the local level to make sure we take it off the shelves in Suffolk County,'' said Mr. Cooper, whose credits in less than three years as a legislator also include the cell-phone law. ''Some people feel that we go too far, but others feel that when it comes to public health, we can't go far enough.''</p>
        <p>As a legislator, Patrick G. Halpin sponsored the 1981 bottle deposit law. ''I couldn't go into my local deli without seeing my image being hung in effigy,'' said Mr. Halpin, now executive vice president of the Institute for Student Achievement, a nonprofit group. ''There are still some beer distributors that won't talk to me.''</p>
        <p>The state later followed in Suffolk's footsteps, with Mr. Halpin, at that point a state assemblyman, sponsoring it in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>''It started in Suffolk County,'' he said. ''I'm very proud of that.''</p>
        <p>But later still, as county executive, Mr. Halpin vetoed another measure that would have required employers to pay for annual eye exams for workers who use computer screens. At the time, he said, Suffolk and San Francisco were the only two places considering such measures. Legislators overrode the veto, but measures that dealt private employers were later struck down in court.</p>
        <p>In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Halpin sounded almost apologetic for his veto. ''In my heart,'' he said, ''I wanted to sign it.''</p>
