        <p>Efforts to head off a predicted global warming by reducing the burning of fossil fuels, as is widely being urged, could actually worsen the warming in the short run, scientists say.</p>
        <p>Fossil fuels like coal and oil emit carbon dioxide when they are burned, and the carbon dioxide traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere much like a greenhouse does. Climatologists predict that if the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases like methane and chlorofluorocarbons continues at current rates, the average surface temperature of the Earth will rise 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century, causing widespread ecological, agricultural and social damage.</p>
        <p>But in a less-noticed phenomenon, the burning of fossil fuels also emits sulfur dioxide particles, which scientists refer to as aerosols. These reflect sunlight, cooling the Earth and partly offsetting whatever warming may be taking place. A reduction in the burning of fossil fuels would reduce this cooling effect.</p>
        <p>The resulting rise in temperature could more than compensate for the cooling that would be achieved by the accompanying reduction in carbon dioxide in the next 10 to 30 years, according to a study reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature by Dr. T. M. L. Wigley, a climatologist at the University of East Anglia in England.  Warming Could Be More Intense</p>
        <p>This means that global warming could be more intense than expected for up to three decades, Dr. Wigley found, after which the reduction in burning fossil fuels would begin to bring about a global cooling.</p>
        <p>The reason for the lag is that the effect of carbon dioxide reductions would be felt only over decades, since that is how long it takes them to work their way through the ocean-atmosphere climate system. By contrast, the effect of atmospheric sulfur dioxide particles is felt almost immediately and dies away rapidly once emissions stop.</p>
        <p>"If you instantly stopped burning fossil fuels, then the aerosols would fall out in a couple of days," said Dr. James E. Hansen, a climatologist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. "The greenhouse gases stay there for 100 years, so you'd actually increase the heating" in the short term. "But in the long run, you'd decrease the temperature and the heating." Calculations Look 'Reasonable'</p>
        <p>The calculations "look very reasonable," said Dr. Robert J. Charlson, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington who is an expert on aerosols and climate. Dr. Charlson said that both he and Dr. Wigley are persuaded that the question of the aerosols' effect on global warming is "a sleeping giant of a sort." It is "something that has been missed, and the consequences are not trivial," he said. "It is going to complicate matters in terms of setting policy."</p>
        <p>Delegates from 130 countries are now meeting at Chantilly, Va., outside Washington, in the first negotiating sessions toward a treaty limiting emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Both Dr. Wigley and Dr. Charlson warned against using the aerosol effect as a justification for taking no action to reduce the burning of fossil fuels. For one thing, Dr. Charlson said, the cooling effect of the sulfur dioxide aerosols must be viewed as a temporary phenomenon "that has masked what's really going on in the temperature record."</p>
        <p>The average surface temperature of the Earth has been rising over the last decade and is now at a record level, although few scientists are yet ready to conclude that the warming has been caused by the greenhouse effect rather than other climatic factors.</p>
        <p>In the long run, Dr. Charlson said, failure to rein in the greenhouse gases would risk a dangerous warming despite the aerosol effect.</p>
        <p>Moreover, both he and Dr. Wigley pointed out, the cooling effect of the aerosols takes place mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, where most sources of aerosols are located, while the carbon dioxide and its warming effect are diffused around the globe.</p>
        <p>Big questions remain as to how the aerosols would affect weather patterns, Dr. Charlson said. That is crucial, since weather is what distributes heat around the planet. And Dr. Wigley wrote in his report that the very imbalance in aerosol effects between the Northern and Southern hemispheres is "potentially even more disruptive to the climate system than a uniformly distributed 'pure' greenhouse effect."</p>
        <p>For this reason, Dr. Wigley concluded, the effect of sulfur dioxide aerosols should not be seen as a benefit, but "as further reason for implementing controls on fossil fuel use."</p>
        <p>But much remains unknown about the aerosols, Dr. Hansen said, and for that reason it is difficult to gauge the real short-term effect they might have on global warming if the burning of fossil fuels declined.</p>
