        <p>LEAD: By about the year 2010, it may be possible for globe-trotters to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo at two or three times the speed of sound - cutting the nine-hour trip to three or four hours - and pay only slightly more than they would for a ticket on a Boeing 747.</p>
        <p>By about the year 2010, it may be possible for globe-trotters to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo at two or three times the speed of sound - cutting the nine-hour trip to three or four hours - and pay only slightly more than they would for a ticket on a Boeing 747.</p>
        <p>That, at least, is the goal of officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, their counterparts in Europe and Japan and of executives at most of the world's aircraft makers. No one is yet sure whether such a plane is possible, but hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent to find out. This year, NASA began a five-year, $284 million program to assess the likelihood of solving the most formidable problems associated with building the aircraft. If the results are good, NASA officials want to follow up with a far bigger effort to develop the component technologies.</p>
        <p>This is not the space plane dubbed the ''X-30'' that - as envisioned by former President Reagan - would travel into space from existing airports and travel at 25 times the speed of sound. That, NASA says, is still 40 years away as a passenger plane.</p>
        <p>A new civilian supersonic transport might sound like an easy challenge. The first passenger supersonic plane, the Concorde, has been flying commercially at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound, since 1976. Military fighter planes have been flying faster than Mach 3 for even longer.</p>
        <p>What makes the new project so daunting is the need to develop a plane that is not only feasible but environmentally acceptable and commercially successful. To do that, it will have to satisfy a wide range of often competing demands for size, speed, range and safety. ''Everyone is still in the study phase,'' said Michael Henderson, the head of high- speed civil transport activity at the Boeing Company. ''What we have to do first is understand the economic viability.''</p>
        <p>In the last three years, aircraft manufacturers have arrived at a rough consensus on the performance requirements for a new supersonic transport:</p>
        <p>* Speed: It should fly at two to three times the speed of sound, only moderately faster than the Concorde.</p>
        <p>* Size: It must carry 250 to 300 passengers, compared with 103 for the Concorde, to generate enough revenue.</p>
        <p>* Range: It should be able to fly about 7,000 miles without refueling - long enough to travel from Los Angeles to Tokyo. The Concorde's range is 3,500 miles.</p>
        <p>* Cost: To attract enough passengers, fares should be only 10 percent to 15 percent higher than those for subsonic planes.</p>
        <p>* Environmental safety: Because the plane would cruise at 55,000 to 60,000 feet, many experts are worried that its emission of nitrogen oxides could devastate the ozone layer that shields the earth from the sun's life-threatening ultraviolet rays. The new engines will have to burn far more cleanly than those now in use.</p>
        <p>* Reduced airport noise: The engines must also be quieter than those of the Concorde, if the plane is to win approval from local communities to take off as frequently as conventional subsonic planes.</p>
        <p>* Reduced sonic boom: If possible, aircraft designers would like to limit the boom enough for the plane to win permission for supersonic flights over land.</p>
        <p>Most of these requirements imply trade-offs. Environmental safety and reduced noise are likely to add weight, hurt efficiency and cut range. Developing an acceptable solution to these problems means finding ways to balance competing needs, as well as developing new technologies and new sources of efficiency. These include identifying lighter and stronger materials, more efficient engines and novel aerodynamic designs.</p>
        <p>''These are tough issues,'' said Donald Graf, who oversees the high-speed civil transport program at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. ''But given all the advances we have today that we didn't have 20 years ago, there are reasons to be hopeful.''</p>
        <p>If development does proceed, the costs are expected to be huge. Refining the key technologies is expected to cost $1.5 billion to $2 billion, according to Government and industry experts. Developing a working aircraft would cost another $10 billion to $15 billion.</p>
        <p>''In the past, building a new airplane meant that you had to bet the company,'' said James P. Loomis, director of the Center for High Speed Commercial Flight at the Battelle Memorial Institute, a research organization in Columbus, Ohio. ''This effort will in all likelihood mean that four or five companies will have to join forces.''</p>
        <p>The most serious concern, and the top priority of NASA's new five-year program, is the potential for damaging the ozone layer. Scientists believe that nitrogen oxide emissions released in the stratosphere could be lethal if they destroyed the ozone layer and increased the ultraviolet radiation reaching the ground. But the evidence remains unclear. NASA's goal, therefore, is to develop a more accurate understanding about the danger and to develop engines that reduce emissions to one-tenth their current level.</p>
        <p>Aerospace experts already have a general idea of the plane's other technical characteristics. In contrast to the needle-like shape of the Concorde, the new plane is likely to have broad, triangular wings that provide better lift throughout the flight. It's called a ''double delta'' because the forward part of the wing slopes backward in a sharp triangle while the back half spreads out at a wide angle.</p>
        <p>Such shapes have generally been viewed as difficult to stabilize, but designers hope to offset this by capitalizing on new advanced electronic control systems.</p>
        <p>To define precisely the best shape for the wing and fusilage, engineers are using computer modeling to simulate high-speed air flow over a hypothetical plane. A second major requirement is to develop building materials that are stronger, lighter and far more heat-resistant than those used today. The wings and fusilage will probably be made from advanced composite materials rather than metals. But identifying composites with the right mix of strength, weight, hardness and durability is still a long way off.</p>
        <p>Experts predict that the next generation of supersonic engines is likely to burn the same kerosene-based fuel as today's jets. But the jets will have to be far quieter than those on the Concorde, which are unacceptably loud for most airports.</p>
        <p>In addition, the new plane is likely to require ''variable cycle'' engines, which operate efficiently at both subsonic and supersonic speeds. Because of differences in the behavior of air flows, the turbofans of supersonic engines are different from those of conventional aircraft and are relatively inefficient at slow speeds. If, as many experts believe, the next generation plane is forced to fly at subsonic speeds over land, to avoid producing sonic booms, then the engines must be able to channel air flow along different paths at different speeds.</p>
        <p>Assuming that manufacturers can overcome all of these hurdles, they must still obtain agreement on environmental and noise standards from governments around the world. ''Nobody is going to go forward unless these agreements are in place and are stable,'' said Mr. Loomis of Battelle.</p>
        <p>HERE COMES THE ROTORLESS CHOPPER</p>
        <p>McDonnell Douglas flight-tested its first rotorless helicopter last month. The tail rotor, once needed to counter torque produced by the main rotor and help the pilot steer, is replaced in the new MD 520N by jets of air. It all relies on a phenomenon called the Coanda effect - the tendency for a fluid, like air, to flow around a rotating cylinder. A fan in the chopper's tail boom pressurizes air, which is then forced out of a slot, steadying the craft. A vertical tail, like that on an airplane, is a further stabilizer. By controlling the size of the slot openings and speed of the fan, the pilot can steer more easily than with the tail rotor. All of McDonnell's new choppers will use the system.</p>
