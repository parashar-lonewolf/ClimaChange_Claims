        <p>Moving past last year's Senate defeat, Tom Daschle, the former Democratic leader, is joining a law firm where he will be reunited with one of his old Senate adversaries, Bob Dole.</p>
        <p>The firm, Alston &amp; Bird, based in Atlanta, is to announce Monday that Mr. Daschle will become a special policy adviser in its Washington office, joining Mr. Dole and several other former senior government officials in providing clients with strategic guidance based on their political and policy expertise.</p>
        <p>''He was the first Republican leader I worked with, and it is like coming back home,'' said Mr. Daschle, who in 1995 clashed with Mr. Dole over the budget and other issues while Mr. Dole led the majority. In an interview, Mr. Daschle said he and Mr. Dole also developed a close friendship and that his former Senate colleague was among the first people to call him after his loss in November.</p>
        <p>The work at the law office is part of a new career direction for Mr. Daschle, who was stung by his loss in South Dakota as he sought a fourth term. He also said he would soon announce a teaching affiliation with a university. And he has been named chairman of the executive advisory board of InterMedia, an investment firm based in New York that will specialize in media ventures. He also intends to engage in a public-service project to benefit American Indians.</p>
        <p>At the law firm, Mr. Daschle said he expected to concentrate much of his time in the areas of renewable energy, health care, trade, financial services and agriculture.</p>
        <p>''I am not going to lobby but I am going to work with groups, businesses and organizations of all kinds to advance these issues and provide policy advice,'' he said. Mr. Daschle is prohibited from directly lobbying the Senate for a year.</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Dole first broached the subject of working under the same roof and that, though they were often pitted against each other in the Senate, they also worked jointly to promote agricultural issues and increase the use of the corn-based gasoline additive ethanol, a boon to their farm states.</p>
        <p>''While we may have differed on some political issues, I look forward to working together at Alston &amp; Bird,'' Mr. Dole, who represented Kansas, said in a statement.</p>
