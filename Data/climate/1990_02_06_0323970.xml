        <p>LEAD: SCIENTISTS have found evidence buried within the Greenland ice cap that although human activity is pouring sulfur into the atmosphere at a prodigious rate, sulfur emitted by marine organisms into the air has begun to decline sharply.</p>
        <p>SCIENTISTS have found evidence buried within the Greenland ice cap that although human activity is pouring sulfur into the atmosphere at a prodigious rate, sulfur emitted by marine organisms into the air has begun to decline sharply.</p>
        <p>Atmospheric sulfur has been indicted as a contributor to acid rain, but it may also have profound effects on climate. Some compounds of sulfur play a role in cloud formation, and clouds block sunlight, which might reduce atmospheric temperature and offset ''greenhouse'' warming. Some scientists predict that such warming will result from increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Dr. Eric Saltzman of the University of Miami in Florida and Pai Yei Whung, his graduate student, detected changing trends in atmospheric sulfur by analyzing samples of ice drilled from the Greenland ice cap. They reported in a university announcement that since 1900, the quantity of methanesulfonic acid (a compound of sulfur generated by microorganisms) in the atmosphere has declined by half. Over the same period, atmospheric sulfur created by human activity like burning fossil fuels tripled. Atmospheric sulfur is also produced by volcanoes and chemical reactions in the ocean.</p>
        <p>Dr. Saltzman said in an interview that he could not account for the change in phytoplankton production.</p>
        <p>''We know that some species of phytoplankton generate methanesulfonic acid while others do not, and it may be that proportions of the various species populations have changed,'' he said. ''But we don't know why, or even whether this is the correct explanation.</p>
        <p>''One of the problems we've just begun to tackle in looking at these ice records is in relating what we find in Greenland ice to atmospheric changes elsewhere,'' he said. The University of Miami is collaborating with Soviet and French institutions in drawing ice samples at the Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>''We know now that the great bulk of sulfur in the atmosphere comes from human rather than natural sources,'' he said.</p>
