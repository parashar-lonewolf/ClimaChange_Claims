        <p>LEAD: A NEW type of small, nuclear reactor, designed to be immune to meltdown, is being seen by experts as a safer alternative to conventional reactors and on coal- and gas-fired plants whose emissions are have been linked to environmental ills like acid rain and global warming.</p>
        <p>A NEW type of small, nuclear reactor, designed to be immune to meltdown, is being seen by experts as a safer alternative to conventional reactors and on coal- and gas-fired plants whose emissions are have been linked to environmental ills like acid rain and global warming.</p>
        <p>American and foreign companies are racing to bring the innovative design to market. The new machine is called a modular, high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor, and the Federal Department of Energy recently called for a unit to be built in Idaho to produce tritium for nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>The Idaho device, estimated to cost at least $2 billion, would also serve as a prototype for civilian reactors that would generate electricity.</p>
        <p>Designers of the new reactor say the machine is intrinsically safe because its physical characteristics make it immune to meltdown, the most feared reactor accident. It relies on laws of nature rather than complicated machinery and error-prone caretakers to prevent major accidents.</p>
        <p>All reactors rely on a chain reaction in which heavy atoms are split to release bursts of energy and heat. The strength of the reaction depends in part on the concentration of the fuel. The challenge is to keep the reaction under control.</p>
        <p>The key safety feature of the new design is that its fuel is more dilute than usual. It is made by forming uranium into billions of tiny grains and covering each of these with a tough ceramic shell that can withstand unusually high temperatures. This arrangement means that the fuel and its radioactive byproducts are tightly sealed from the environment. Most important, it also means that the fuel is less dense and reactive than the concentrated fuel rods in conventional reactors.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor is considered so safe that it can withstand the simultaneous failure of the rods that control the nuclear reaction, the pumps and all cooling systems.</p>
        <p>''It can survive that accident easily,'' said Lawrence M. Lidsky, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is investigating the new design.</p>
        <p>Robert D. Pollard, a nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group critical of the nuclear power industry, said Mr. Lidsky's statement was too sweeping, but he called the reactor ''clearly safer'' than the existing generation of nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>''We've got to change the industry so safety is dependent on physical laws rather than complex machinery,'' he said, adding that the new design was a step in the right direction.</p>
        <p>While many skeptics remain cool to nuclear power, calling it inherently dangerous, growing ranks of scientists, Federal officials and even environmental groups are re-examining nuclear power to see whether it might be more environmentally benign than fossil-fuel power plants. The burning of coal and oil produces gases that collect in the atmosphere, and most experts believe the gases trap heat as in a greenhouse, warming the earth.</p>
        <p>The allure of nuclear reactors is that they produce none of these gases.</p>
        <p>''The greenhouse effect has changed a major parameter in the anti-nuclear equation,'' said John F. Ahearne, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is now vice president of Resources for the Future, a Washington-based environmental group.</p>
        <p>So too, Senator Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat who has introduced legislation intended to deal with the new environmental ills, recently called for ''a fresh look at nuclear power,'' citing the threat of climatic destruction.</p>
        <p>The new interest in nuclear power comes a decade after the reactor business all but died in the United States. Since 1978, no American utility has ordered a new reactor.</p>
        <p>The nuclear power plants now operating in the United States are generally water-cooled reactors. Like high-powered racing cars, they are temperamental and require constant attention. Most important, their very hot nuclear fuel has to be carefully and continuously cooled to avoid accidents.</p>
        <p>In such reactors, half-inch thick rods of uranium-oxide fuel get yellow hot at their core, reaching temperatures of about 4,100 degrees Fahrenheit, according to ''A Guidebook to Nuclear Reactors,'' published by University of California Press. The metal casing around the fuel is cooled to the much lower temperature of about 650 degrees by circulating water. This water, which is under immense pressure, goes to a steam generator that drives turbines to generate electricity.</p>
        <p>If the water disappears for just seconds, hot fuel can rapidly destroy the metal casing. At 1,800 degrees the casing starts to break down, and at 3,370 degrees it melts. The danger comes when fuel starts to lump together in a molten mass that can damage or destroy the reactor. 'Defense in Depth'</p>
        <p>To avoid meltdowns, engineers have devised a series of safety systems. One major line of defense is emergency cooling loops of water to keep the fuel core from melting. Another is a series of concrete containment vessels that surround the fuel core so that, even during a serious loss-of-coolant accident, no radioactivity will escape.</p>
        <p>This ''defense in depth'' philosophy has proven to have serious drawbacks.</p>
        <p>''Complexity is the reason light-water reactors are so hideously expensive and hard to run,'' said Dr. Lidsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The complexity and expense of safety systems have forced utilities to build very large plants that can produce more electricity and thus more revenue.</p>
        <p>Yet all the precautions are sometimes insufficient, as shown by the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island reactor in Pennsylvania. In that accident a partial meltdown occurred and some radioactive gas was released into the environment.</p>
        <p>Critics have long called on industry to renounce the current generation of reactors, saying that no matter how extensive the safety measures are, the machines are disasters waiting to happen.</p>
        <p>''It's bad energy policy to rely on reactors that have the potential for accidents with enormous off-site consequences on the grounds that the probability is low,'' said Mr. Pollard of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Tiny Fuel Particles</p>
        <p>The main attraction of the modular, high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor is that it is far less sensitive to changes in fuel temperatures than the conventional reactors, a safety feature that industry experts say will aid its marketplace success.</p>
        <p>''We see a very bright future,'' said Richard A. Dean, senior vice president of General Atomics, a San Diego-based company that helped pioneer the technology.</p>
        <p>The design's secret lies in its tiny fuel particles, each the size of a grain of sand. These individual grains are encapsulated in multiple spheres of glassy carbon-based materials, which trap radioactive fission products and can transmit heat but remain intact up to temperatures of 3,300 degrees. The capsules each have a diameter of only 1 millimeter, dozens of them fitting atop a dime. For ease of handling, they are bound together into small rods or containers the size of billiard balls.</p>
        <p>Since the top temperature that fuel grains can achieve in such a matrix is about 3,000 degrees, there is no way for them to melt through the protective capsules, no matter what the accident, nuclear engineers say.</p>
        <p>In effect, the billions of tiny capsules act like the far more massive containment systems of conventional reactors. Greater Efficiency</p>
        <p>Instead of water, the coolant in the new reactor is helium, an inert gas that transfers heat from the reactor core to electricity-making turbines. The helium can be heated to much higher temperatures than water, the ''high temperature'' in the reactor's name referring to coolant temperature rather than fuel temperature. This relatively high coolant temperature allows the new reactor to operate with greater efficiency than water-cooled reactors.</p>
        <p>Typically, water-cooled reactors convert nuclear heat into electricity with an efficiency of about 33 percent, whereas gas-cooled reactors in theory can do the same at efficiencies of 40 to 50 percent.</p>
        <p>But there is a tradeoff in all this. Since the new fuel is less concentrated, and safer, the reactor's core would have to be quite large to achieve the same power output as conventional reactors, which typically produce about 1,100 megawatts of electricity. However, increasing the core size would also increase its top temperatures. So for safety's sake, designers limit the core size and reactor output to about 140 megawatts. Designs typically call for three or four of these small reactors to be strung together to make up one power plant, thus the term ''modular.''</p>
        <p>''We were concerned it wouldn't be economic,'' said Dr. Dean, whose company has studied larger high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors for decades. ''But when we saw that a lot of the engineered safety systems could be eliminated, and saw the cost savings, we realized it was very competitive.''</p>
        <p>For two decades, a very small, high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor has operated successfully in West Germany. Although its 15-megawatt output is too small to be of commercial interest, the reactor is ideal for research. 'Didn't Damage a Thing</p>
        <p>In a test in October, it was subjected to the worst possible accident: the withdrawal of all the rods that control the rate of the nuclear reaction as well as the simultaneous total loss of all coolant, actions that would destroy a conventional reactor in seconds. Instead, over the course of days, the natural processes of heat conduction and radiation kept the hottest part of the reactor core below the temperature at which the fuel would fail.</p>
        <p>''We'd play tennis, and then go back and see how the temperatures were doing,'' said John C. Cleveland, a nuclear engineer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who monitored the experiment in Germany. ''The test didn't damage a thing.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, a large high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor, rated at 330 megawatts, has operated for years in Fort St. Vrain, Colo., but has suffered problems unrelated to the design of its nuclear fuel. Its helium circulator has broken down frequently, allowing the plant to achieve only about 10 percent of its power potential. The plant was build before the advent of the modular designs.</p>
        <p>Despite such problems, the appeal of the modular version of the high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor is so great that Secretary of Energy John S. Herrington proposed in August that the department build one in Idaho to replace aging, breakdown-prone reactors that are at the heart of the nation's system for maintaining its arsenal of nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>To be built at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho Falls, the reactor would produce tritium for nuclear weapons and also serve as a basis for a civilian reactor. Its estimated cost is between $2 billion and $5 billion, depending on how many modules would be built. Some Idaho residents have protested the proposed project, saying the Energy Department's credibility is low and that the new machine might damage the environment and threaten public health.</p>
        <p>General Atomics, the only American company prepared to make modular, high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors and a likely winner of the Energy Department contract, said such fears were unfounded.  The Critical Change: Fuel Design  A new type of ''intrinsically safe'' reactor, instead of using concentrated lumps of fuel, relies on billions of tiny fuel grains, each encased in a tough shell that can withstand very high temperatures. In a small reactor, this relatively cool, less-dense fuel is seen as immune to meltdowns. To compensate for loss of heat-generating capacity, three or four small units are strung together to make a single power plant.  The Danger of a Meltdown  Conventional reactors have concentrated fuel that will melt into an uncontrollable mass if it is not carefully cooled. Backup safety systems include emergency cooling loops of water and concrete containment vessels that surround the fuel core so that no radioactivity will escape during an accident.</p>
