        <p>The Envionmental Protection Agency's first auction of rights to pollute the air attracted more participants than had been expected and reaped $21 million, according to a participant in the sale who declined to be named.</p>
        <p>The results, which are to be announced at a news conference here Tuesday, were less pleasing for utilities that tried to piggyback on the auction to sell pollution allowances that the Federal agency had previously granted them. The utilities set such high minimum prices that almost none of their allowances were sold, the participant said.</p>
        <p>At stake were more than 275,000 pollution allowances, each permitting a utility to emit a ton of sulfur dioxide, the chemical that causes acid rain. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. set strict "spot" emissions limits to take effect in 1995, covering 110 of the nation's largest, dirtiest power plants. Even stricter "advance" limits, applicable to about 800 plants, will take effect by the year 2000. The agency issued allowances to the plants based on the utilities' average emissions from 1985 to 1987. A Pollution Marketplace</p>
        <p>The act allows utilities that can reduce emissions below the permitted levels to sell the allowances they do not need to others that are having trouble meeting the limits. In theory, market forces will encourage utilities that can cut pollution the most for the least investment in scrubbers or fuel changes to lead the way. That would allow the nation to shave billions of dollars off the cost of meeting pollution-reduction goals.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. is said to have received 106 bids for the 50,000 spot allowances it offered, 36 of which were successful at prices ranging from $131 an allowance to $450. Utilities offered 95,010 spot allowances, only 10 of which were sold, the participant said.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. received 65 bids for the 100,000 advance allowances it offered. Rights were sold to 30 bidders at prices of $122 to $310. None of the 30,500 advance allowances offered by the utilities were sold.</p>
        <p>The annual auction is intended to help utilities figure out the value of the allowances, encourage trading, and spur investment by utilities that want to build up reserves of allowances for future trading. Experts said that the level of interest had been unexpectedly high.</p>
        <p>"It looked like a lot of utilities would stay out because they didn't have a pressing need to get in," said Michael Gildea, a regulatory analyst for the Edison Electric Institute, the Washington-based trade organization for the nation's large investor-owned utilities. "But it seems that people were hunting for bargains and just testing the water."</p>
        <p>Complete results will be announced by E.P.A. officials and the Chicago Board of Trade, which was selected to run the annual auctions for three years. The Board of Trade expects eventually to create a pollution allowance futures contract that will allow utilities to shift the risk of price changes in allowances to investors, just as farmers use futures markets to shift the risks of changes in crop prices. Finding the Right Price</p>
        <p>"This auction will be remembered as a classic case of the exchange's role in price discovery," said Richard Sandor, a director of the Board of Trade and an early proponent of pollution rights trading on established exchanges. "Up until now, you have only had a handful of small trades with wide ranges in prices."</p>
        <p>The lowest winning bids were well under Mr. Sandor's predictions last week. Private transactions in recent months have reportedly taken place at prices up to $400 per allowance. The auction will send "a clear price signal" to the market, he said, but it will involve so few allowances that utilities will want to see other trading before rethinking strategies.</p>
        <p>In general, falling prices would indicate that utilities have been investing more heavily in compliance than projected and expect to have more allowances than they need in 1995. But lower prices might also cause utilities that are planning such investments to reconsider, because it might prove cheaper to buy enough allowances to continue polluting at current levels -- or even higher.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one utility that bid in the auction, the Illinois Power Company, has already stopped construction on a $350 million scrubber and begun in private deals to stockpile permits that it will use between 1995 and 2000. "The state requires us to meet emissions standards in the least costly way, said John Dewey, a spokesman for the Decatur, Ill., utility. "Using the permits will save us at least $250 million over the next 20 years and save Illinois coal-mining jobs as well." Environmental Worries</p>
        <p>Such developments have led to growing unhappiness within some environmental groups. A coalition of five Wisconsin groups asked the E.P.A. last week to halt the auction.</p>
        <p>"It's not a good idea to jump-start a flawed system," said Christopher Blythe, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, a Wisconsin utility watchdog group that fears pollution trading will lead to higher costs and more acid rain in its state.</p>
        <p>One worry, currently running strongest in New York, is that Midwestern utilities blamed for pollution in the Adirondack Mountains will be able to avoid reductions in emissions by purchasing allowances from other regions. Such fears do not take into account the size of the reductions the Midwest must make, said Joseph Goffman, a staff lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington-based environmental group that has been a major backer of pollution trading.</p>
        <p>"Even if New York eliminated all of its emissions, which is impossible to imagine, it would only have 300,000 allowances to sell," Mr. Goffman said. "The utilities in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois have to cut three million tons."</p>
