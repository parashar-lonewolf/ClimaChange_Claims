        <p>Almost a quarter of the shareholders of the Southern Company, one of the nation's largest utilities, voted at the annual meeting today to require the company to analyze and report on the potential financial risks associated with its emissions of the pollutants that cause global warming.</p>
        <p>At the same time, shareholders of Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest oil company, meeting in Dallas, gave a similar level of support to several resolutions on environmental issues. One, which would require the company to report on how it would increase its investments in renewable energy, was backed by 21 percent of the shareholders, and another, on how it would respond to the risks of global warming, was supported by 22 percent.</p>
        <p>No one expected any of these resolutions to win majority support. But they are a measure of the increasing intensity of shareholders' challenges to corporations to respond to environmental concerns.</p>
        <p>Spurred on by a coalition of environmental and religious groups, shareholders have filed 31 global warming resolutions with 23 companies in the United States this year and 5 in Canada. The companies include auto manufacturers, electric power companies and oil companies.</p>
        <p>''It is a trend that I don't think is going to disappear,'' said Sister Barbara Aires, coordinator of corporate responsibility for the Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth in New Jersey, who introduced the resolution today at Southern's meeting in Georgia. ''I think more institutional investors are looking for assessments of the triple bottom line -- social, environmental and financial -- not simply financial.''</p>
        <p>Last year, resolutions concerning global warming won about 18 percent of shareholders' support at a dozen or so companies, according to the United States Public Interest Research Group, which has helped organize efforts for the resolutions. This year, they have averaged more than 25 percent at more than twice the number of companies, the group said.</p>
        <p>The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group in Washington that advises institutions on proxy issues, was more cautious in interpreting the numbers. Its overall figures were lower because they included a low of 5.2 percent for a resolution at Citigroup, which finances energy ventures. That resolution called for Citigroup to review the effect of these financial ventures on climate.</p>
        <p>Still, said Meg Voorhes, director of the center's social issues service, among electric utilities and oil and gas companies, the average support level was 22.6 percent in 2003, indicating investor concern about the risks that these companies face.</p>
        <p>''In the 32-year history of shareholder activism on social issues,'' she said, ''only board-diversity proposals have had average support levels topping 20 percent.''</p>
        <p>Last year, 9 percent of Southern's shareholders voted for a resolution to increase the company's commitment to renewable forms of energy to 20 percent of its portfolio by 2010.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we're way beyond that now,'' said Rebecca Stanfield, a lawyer with the research group. This year's measure, on the separate matter of financial risk but still perceived as a pro-environmental vote, received support from 23 percent of the shareholders.</p>
        <p>''If it's any indication of their concern,'' said Ms. Stanfield, who spoke at the meeting, held outside Atlanta, ''they treated us with kid gloves, shuttling us around and making sure we had coffee, anything we wanted.''</p>
        <p>''I think they're concerned'' about where these resolutions are headed over the long term, she said.</p>
        <p>Laura Varn, a Southern spokeswoman, said: ''Any time a resolution comes before the annual meeting, it is something we take seriously.''</p>
        <p>She said, however, that the company was pleased that 77 percent of its shareholders agreed with the board that the resolution on financial risk would be of little benefit.</p>
        <p>''The information that would be necessary to predict economic risk would be highly speculative and therefore unreliable to the investors,'' Ms. Varn said.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Stanfield said the votes suggested the ''increasing awareness that failure to address pollution issues can make a company vulnerable to changing regulatory landscapes, liability for damages and poor public image.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, reports from Europe and the United Nations have estimated that changes in climate could cost the world $300 billion annually by 2050 from weather damage, pollution and industrial and agricultural losses.</p>
        <p>The financial-risk resolution that was considered by Southern shareholders asked the board to submit a report to shareholders by August that would detail the economic risks to the company resulting from past, present and future emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury; report on the company's efforts to reduce these emissions; and detail the economic benefits of committing the company to a substantial reduction of emissions.</p>
        <p>The resolution is identical to ones that were filed at four other major utilities this year: the American Electric Power Company, Excel Energy Inc., the TXU Corporation and the Cinergy Corporation. Along with Southern, they are the top five emitters of carbon dioxide in the country. Votes have been held so far at American Electric Power, where 27 percent of shareholders approved the resolution, and at TXU, where 24 percent approved.</p>
        <p>Because the level of support at Southern was somewhat less than that, Ms. Varn was skeptical that the vote today indicated there was any forward movement for environmentalists.</p>
        <p>''Ours came in at the low end,'' she said of the 23 percent. ''They were hoping for more of an upswing so they could characterize it as growing momentum, but that wasn't the case.''</p>
        <p>While the managements of these companies have all opposed the resolutions, most have been endorsed by firms that advise institutional shareholders. The most successful so far was a global warming resolution earlier this year at ChevronTexaco, where 32 percent of shareholders voted in favor. This was more than three times the level of support that the last global warming resolution received at the company, which was 9.6 percent in 2001.</p>
        <p>Ms. Voorhes of the Investor Responsibility Research Center said, ''What we're seeing with these vote results creeping up is that people are saying maybe there is something to this idea that global climate change is a risk and the companies aren't preparing for it, they aren't discussing it forthrightly or in detail.''</p>
