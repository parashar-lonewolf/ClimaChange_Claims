        <p>LEAD: When the Three Mile Island meltdown began on March 28, 1979, it was more than the breakdown of a nuclear reactor - it represented the failure of the entire system of nuclear regulation.</p>
        <p>When the Three Mile Island meltdown began on March 28, 1979, it was more than the breakdown of a nuclear reactor - it represented the failure of the entire system of nuclear regulation.</p>
        <p>Ten years later, the reactor is still in ruins, but the regulatory system has been rebuilt. And while there is general agreement that nuclear power plants are safer, critics of the industry continue to maintain that they are not nearly safe enough and that the industry has not yet learned from Three Mile Island.</p>
        <p>Whether the lessons of the accident have been learned is now the subject of many symposiums, books and broadsides timed to the anniversary on the nation's worst nuclear accident. Driving the interest is a debate about whether new reactors should be built, after a decade of no orders and more than 100 cancellations. Demand for electricity rose sharply last year, and fears of the greenhouse effect are taking the luster off coal, the main alternative for generating power. Markedly Different Views</p>
        <p>The anniversary is being put to various uses by the partisans in the debate. A summing-up by the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, the industry's main lobbying group, said, ''Although initially seen as a major setback for commercial nuclear power, the accident in fact proved to be an impetus for change that has left the industry far stronger 10 years later.''</p>
        <p>But at the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmentalist group, Christopher Flavin, a vice president and longtime student of energy questions, said in his 10th anniversary study, ''In the years since the accident, U.S. nuclear plants have experienced nearly 30,000 mishaps, some with the potential to have caused even more serious disasters.''</p>
        <p>Industry supporters say managers and workers at the 111 licensed nuclear plants have embraced a new ethic: anticipating problems instead of reacting to them. There is stronger training and better attitudes, attention to detail and intense analysis of operating glitches, they say.</p>
        <p>The emergency shutdown system, for example, was once considered a cure-all safety device for a variety of equipment failures. But triggering that system is now seen as a bad sign, because it gives safety equipment an opportunity to fail.</p>
        <p>The critics contend that although the industry has set its sights higher, it has not taken steps to achieve its goals. They are also unhappy that some of the regulation has been handed over to an industry group, so that public scrutiny of the quality of equipment, personnel and management is less than they say it should be. And the condition of the plants is impossible to ascertain, they add.</p>
        <p>''It's beyond dispute that the plants are safer,'' said Robert D. Pollard, formerly a technical safety expert with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who is now with the Union of Concerned Scientists, the most technically adept of the watchdog groups. He added, ''The question is:, how much safer, and is that enough?'' Some Clear Improvement</p>
        <p>In some areas, the industry's operating statistics have shown clear improvement. According to the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, an industry group founded in response to the Three Mile Island accident, the number of unplanned automatic shutdowns in 1980 was 7.4 per plant; in 1987 it was 2.7. Workers' exposure to radiation is also down, the institute said. An important lesson of Three Mile Island was that the accident might have been prevented if operators had been aware of a similar mechanical failure a few months earlier at the Davis-Besse reactor, a near-twin of Three Mile Island, in Oak Harbor, Ohio, near Toledo.</p>
        <p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission created a new department in response to the Three Mile Island accident: the Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data, where a staff of 40 studies each abnormal incident, looking for trends. About 15 times a year, the office issues bulletins, some requiring written responses by the utilities, warning of potential problems. Hot Line and Control Center</p>
        <p>Since Three Mile Island, mishaps are reported by hot line from the utilities to a control center that is staffed around the clock. Bulletins are sent out over new electronic links. To increase reliability, satellite links are under construction to the 55 sites where reactors are operated. Eventually these will allow the regulatory commission's engineers in Washington to monitor 60 separate indicators at each reactor, including pressures, flows, temperatures and weather outside the plant.</p>
        <p>The commission also has some 155 ''resident inspectors'' at the sites.</p>
        <p>The commission is also more willing to flex its regulatory muscles. Rather than wait for a serious failure, it has closed plants for months or years because of poor management. At times, 10 percent of the nation's nuclear plants have been shut under Federal order. ''We hope we're shutting down today the ones that 10 years ago would have had the abnormal occurrences,'' said Harold R. Denton, the commission's chief official on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>But the last 10 years have also been far from accident-free, and some of the accidents have been disturbing.</p>
        <p>Three Mile Island began with the failure of the feed-water system, and in 1985 the feed-water system failed at the Davis-Besse plant. Much of the six years between the two accidents had been spent in an argument between the commission and the Toledo Edison Company about whether the system should be improved, and how.</p>
        <p>In addition, after years of emphasis on training operators, a few miles down the Susquehanna River from Three Mile Island, at the Peach Bottom nuclear station, the operators were found to be taking turns sleeping in the control room. On some occasions, they were all sleeping. Seeds of Future Accidents?  Mr. Pollard contends that the seeds of other accidents are probably being planted now because of the failure to resolve known flaws.</p>
        <p>He said that in 1985, analyses of containment structures, the steel and concrete buildings meant to hold in radiation released in an accident, identified flaws in some early General Electric designs. But the commission has determined that the risk of an accident is remote enough to allow the plants to continue to operate while improvements are debated, designed and installed.</p>
        <p>The Government's reasoning is faulty, he complained. ''Severe accidents are remote and speculative, until experience proves that's wrong,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But officials of the commission say that they now have a far more detailed knowledge of the risks, and that those risks are falling. Mr. Denton said the risk of public exposure to radiation has been cut by 90 percent.</p>
        <p>''At Three Mile Island, half the core melted,'' he said. ''We now appreciate that you can do that if the equipment fails, and if people perform poorly.'' But personnel will perform better now, he insisted, largely because of training.</p>
        <p>According to the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations, which all 54 companies that operate reactors have joined, the industry dedicated 460,000 square feet to training facilities in 1979; that figure is now more than 3 million square feet. 'Good Reports Are Ignored'</p>
        <p>Critics say that given the starting point, improvement in training was not difficult. But some think the ballyhooed developments of the last decade are overstated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollard cited the office of analysis and evaluation of operational data, which he said ''writes a lot of good reports, which are then ignored.''</p>
        <p>For example, the office wrote a detailed report on a troubling incident at Commonwealth Edison's LaSalle 2 plant, near Ottawa, Ill., in March 1988. A technician's error cut the flow of cooling water, after which the intensity of the nuclear reaction began to oscillate rapidly. The incident ended when one peak was measured at 114 percent of the maximum allowed, resulting in an automatic shutdown.</p>
        <p>The report called for a variety of steps, but another part of the commission staff, the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, eventually ordered more modest changes.</p>
        <p>That incident demonstrated another problem, Mr. Pollard said. After that mishap, all utilities operating similar plants were required to perform an analysis of their vulnerability. In the past, those analyses would have been sent to Washington, where they would have been available for public inspection, Mr. Pollard said. But now utilities are merely required to keep them on file. Mr. Pollard has used documents on public file to make numerous complaints, some resulting in new orders and rule changes. Regulatory Shift Criticized</p>
        <p>He and other critics also complain that the commission has handed over part of its regulatory function to an industry group, the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations.</p>
        <p>As the commission considered requiring more training in a variety of jobs, the industry itself formed an accreditation board for training programs and set detailed criteria. The commission accepted this move, because it meant faster action. ''It's much more fruitful when we can achieve a mutual understanding and cooperation,'' Mr. Denton said.</p>
        <p>''However we're accomplishing improving the safety of the plants, I'm all for it,'' said Victor Stello Jr., the executive director for operations.</p>
        <p>Of course, not only the regulators have changed in the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>''The big thing that Three Mile Island did for our utility is make us stop and take a big, overall view of what caused the accident and what we could do to insure the same thing did not happen to Trojan,'' said Steven P. Sautter, a spokesman for Portland General Electric, which opened the Trojan reactor, 32 miles north of Portland, Ore., three years before the Pennsylvania accident.</p>
        <p>Ten years later, he said, the changes have made the plant safer. But Three Mile Island also raised public concern in Oregon, and in 1986 opponents forced a referendum on whether to close the plant.</p>
        <p>It failed, and in the process, Mr. Sautter said, opinion surveys indicated that ''nearly 40 percent of the population of the state did not know Trojan existed.''</p>
        <p>''That does not say a lot for our public relations effort,'' he said, but ''it shows the plant has been operating quietly and efficiently.''</p>
        <p>The changes in regulation have brought on another shift, which may bode ill for the future of the industry: a direct cost, perhaps $50 million a reactor, according to the commission, for improvements ordered as a result of the accident. More important, the regulatory changes have also required larger staffs.</p>
        <p>As a result, operating costs have risen sharply. The Utility Data Institute Inc., a commercial firm that provides comparative data to electric companies, recently calculated that the variable cost of running a power plant - fuel costs plus operation and maintenance expenses - was up by one-third between 1983 and 1987, and is now higher for nuclear reactors than for coal plants. This is a troubling finding for an industry that has always argued that the high initial cost of these plants would be offset later by low operating costs.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 25, 1989, Saturday, Late City Final Edition</p>
        <p>A chart in Business Day on Thursday, with an article about the nuclear power industry, omitted the years corresponding to the number of automatic emergency shutdowns annually at the nation's nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>The chart showed the period from 1981 to 1988. The trend indicated a decreasing number of incidents, with an average of 7.4 per plant in 1980 and 2.1 in 1988.</p>
