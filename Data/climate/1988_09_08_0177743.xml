        <p>MARKETS  Drexel Burnham Lambert was charged with a two-year scheme of illegal insider trading, defrauding clients, stock manipulation and other securities violations. Some of the long-awaited charges by the S.E.C. were more severe than had been anticipated. Four Drexel employees were named, including Michael Milken, the head of its junk-bond department, whose lucrative deals have been responsible for the firm's enormous growth within the last decade. The complaint also accused the Miami industrialist Victor Posner and his son Steven of violating Federal securities laws.  [ Page A1. ]  In all but two of the 18 instances in which the S.E.C. found fault with Drexel, Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted arbitrager, served as a ''front'' for Drexel, the S.E.C. said. [ D6. ] The U.S. sold $2.93 billion in dollars at the end of June and in July to try to slow the dollar's summer rally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. That was the most concerted attack on the dollar since the second half of 1985. [ D1. ] Investors can tie C.D. deposits to the Presidential election, earning bonuses if their candidate wins. Several savings institutions are offering what they call ''Presidential C.D.'s.''  [ D1. ]  Yields rose on C.D.'s, bank money market accounts and money market mutual funds for the week ended yesterday. [ D17. ] French Government bonds will be traded as A.D.R.'s, starting later this month, on the New York Stock Exchange. [ D1. ] Stock prices edged higher as the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.53 points, to close at 2,065.79. It was the third consecutive gain for the Dow.  [ D10. ]  Prices of Treasury notes and bonds ended slightly lower, as market participants cast an apprehensive eye on the dollar. [ D16. ] Coffee futures prices rose sharply for the second day on fears that a dry spell in Brazil could lengthen into a drought. [ D18. ] Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr. pleaded guilty to charges that he engaged in an illegal insider trading scheme. [ D6. ] THE ECONOMY  A bill to limit the growth of imports of textiles, clothing and shoes cleared a major hurdle in the Senate, virtually assuring its passage later this week. That would set the stage for another trade confrontation with the Reagan Administration. The Senate voted, 68 to 29, to restrict debate on the measure, which would allow imports of textiles and clothing to increase 1 percent a year, compared with the 16 to 17 percent annual increases of most of this decade. [ A1. ] COMPANIES  G.M. reached agreements with the nation's major steelmakers on purchasing contracts. G.M., the nation's largest steel buyer, would not disclose the terms of the agreements, but steel industry officials said the increases averaged about 3 percent. [ D1. ] Gold Circle discount stores will soon cease to exist. Campeau said it had sold its 76 Gold Circle stores to Kimco Development, which in turn will sell most of them to Target and Hills. [ D1. ] R. J. Reynolds sent an extensive scientific assessment of its new ''smokeless'' cigarette to members of Congress. [ D5. ] Ireland's High Court delayed a ruling for at least a month on whether the handshake agreement between Irish Distillers' largest stockholder and one of its suitors is binding. [ D2. ] Goodyear paid $1 million in bribes to Iraqi officials several years ago, a company spokesman said. [ D5. ] Carl C. Icahn won overwhelming investor support to convert T.W.A. into a private company. [ D5. ] Southmark was found liable for more than $130 million in a suit brought by a San Diego businessman whose company Southmark bought. [ D8. ] A Federal judge temporarily blocked the acquisition of Lucky Stores by American Stores. [ D5. ] TODAY'S COLUMNS  Gillette carefully plotted its buyback, hoping to minimizing the difficulties of some partial tender offers. Talking Deals. [ D2. ] Fearful of the greenhouse effect? Some analysts identify ways to turn that problem into a profit. Market Place. [ D10. ]</p>
