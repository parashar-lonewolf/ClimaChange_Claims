        <p>The Bush administration today proposed opening up part of the nation's largest remaining block of unprotected public land to oil and gas development.</p>
        <p>The proposal affects nearly nine million acres of the Alaska North Slope in the government's National Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>Home to distinctive wildlife and tundra, the land is near the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which the administration still hopes to win the necessary Congressional approval to open up to oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Today's draft proposal was released by the Bureau of Land Management, which offered four alternatives -- including doing nothing -- for the area, which was set aside in the 1920's for possible energy development.</p>
        <p>Environmental organizations said they had long expected most of this land to be leased, but noted that the proposal would constitute the largest single on-shore offering to industry in the history of the American Arctic.</p>
        <p>Under three of the alternatives, the government would place the leasing rights for oil and gas exploration on up to 8.8 million acres of the 23-million-acre preserve up for bid. The Bureau of Land Management controls more than 200 million acres of land nationwide.</p>
        <p>Ed Bovy, a spokesman for the bureau, said that he did not know how much the leases could sell for, but that the most recent lease in the National Petroleum Reserve, for 579,000 acres, drew $63.8 million last June. In 1999, he said, $104 million was paid for leases to 867,000 acres.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bovy said that today's proposal was prompted by intense industry interest. Not only had prices for oil risen recently but some companies also have already found enough oil in the region to make commercial drilling worthwhile.</p>
        <p>''The price of oil has gone up, and our domestic supplies have gone down, so there's a renewed interest by industry in leasing,'' he said. ''This is one of the few areas in Alaska on federal lands that's available for leasing.''</p>
        <p>Public comments on the proposal are being accepted until March 18, and a decision is expected perhaps by the fall on which lands might be open to drilling and which might be protected.</p>
        <p>The bureau acknowledged that some of the land is ecologically sensitive, noting, for example, that the Kasegaluk Lagoon offers ''primitive recreation experience, is rich in wildlife, and features marine tidal flats,'' which are rare on the North Slope. It also is home to threatened species and provides subsistence living for local residents.</p>
        <p>One proposal would open the entire 8.8 million acres to oil and gas leasing. A second would make 96 percent of the land available, preserving the Kasegaluk Lagoon and providing some other protective measures.</p>
        <p>A third would make 47 percent of the land available, with additional protections. The fourth would do nothing.</p>
        <p>Deirdre McDonnell, of Earthjustice Juneau in Alaska, said the government proposal was ''about greed.''</p>
        <p>''No matter how much the oil companies get,'' Ms. McDonnell said, ''they keep coming back for more. And the Bush administration is only too happy to oblige.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration obliged as well, opening some of the reserve to oil and gas exploration in 1998.</p>
        <p>Melinda Pierce, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said, ''The Bush administration is busy scouring the American landscape for more places to punch holes and set up oil rigs, when instead we should be investing in renewable energy and working to permanently protect special places in the western Arctic.''</p>
        <p>The area was established in 1923 as ''Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4'' as an emergency oil supply for military purposes and administered by the Navy. Even during the 1973 oil embargo, it was reserved solely for national defense. But it has remained undeveloped mainly because it is so remote.</p>
        <p>The 23 million acres of the full reserve may contain 6 billion to 13 billion barrels of oil, while the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, 100 miles to the east, is believed to contain 3.2 billion to 11.5 billion barrels.</p>
        <p>Chuck Clusen, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Alaska Project, said, ''Any oil produced in the western Arctic would be only a drop in the bucket compared to the oil that can be saved with improved auto fuel efficiency.''</p>
