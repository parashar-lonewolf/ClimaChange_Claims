        <p>HARDING or Truman?" asks Paul D. Wolfowitz, Dean of the Paul H.

        <p>HARDING or Truman?" asks Paul D. Wolfowitz, Dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies and former Defense Under Secretary, in the new issue of Foreign Affairs; the article is entitled "Clinton's First Year." Will our President develop a decisive foreign policy like Truman, who stumbled at the beginning, only to become known as the President responsible for the Marshall Plan? Or will Mr. Clinton end up like the hapless Warren G. Harding, who set in motion a policy of retreat and isolation that was ultimately condemned by historians as a feeble capitulation "to the line of least resistance"?</p>
        <p>Clinton's first year: It's a milestone beloved by political commentators and journalists, one of those utterly artificial attempts to quantify the randomness of human experience, to give it order, shape. Like calendars and charts of historical epochs, the First Year in Office has a pleasing ring to it. Here is a measurable demarcation in time, something to grab hold of in the terrifying flux of events that dominate the headlines -- carnage on the Long Island Rail Road, chaos in Bosnia, pollution on the high seas. There is no disputing the fact that President Bill Clinton has been in office for a year, and in the coming weeks we're going to hear a lot about it.</p>
        <p>In his commemoration of this spurious temporal occasion, Mr. Wolfowitz has employed another hoary device: the analogy. In this, he keeps good company. "For years now," writes Dinitia Smith in this week's New York magazine, "critics have been comparing William Gaddis to James Joyce, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne." Harvard is to Yale, according to an undergraduate quoted in the January/February issue of Harvard Magazine, as the U.S.A. is to the former U.S.S.R. No, says a Yalie: Yale is to Harvard "as America is to Europe."</p>
        <p>The analogies multiply on a daily basis. Bosnia is our Czechoslovakia. Or is it our 1914? Russia is our 1789. Or is it our Weimar? The Sixties were our Thirties. If Mr. Clinton turns out to be like Truman, argues Mr. Wolfowitz, the 1990's will be like the 1950's: by wielding a big stick, the United States will once again have "made the world a safer place." 'Compare and Contrast'</p>
        <p>Why this hunger for corollaries, this need to "compare and contrast" (as the old exam phrase goes)? By citing precedents, comparing one thing to another, we tame our fear of the unknown, establish a reassuring sense that every new experience has a name. Journalism serves this human need. (You might call it the Certainty Principle.) The trait that Keats described as Negative Capability --"when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason" -- is not one many pundits possess.</p>
        <p>Sometimes an analogy is apt. A 19th-century Parisian newspaper magnate, writes Francine duPlessix Gray in her forthcoming biography of Louise Colet, was "the S. I. Newhouse of the July monarchy." George Bush, writes Sidney Blumenthal in The New Yorker, "played Hoover to Reagan's Coolidge." More often, it's used as a kind of shorthand, a way of not thinking. (Harvard is to Yale . . .) "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function," remarked F. Scott Fitzgerald. Analogies yoke two ideas together -- whether they belong together or not.</p>
        <p>The trouble is that history, like individual genius, resists analogy. (To what should we compare global warming or the fall of Communism?) One lesson of David McCullough's magisterial biography of Truman is the degree to which contingency rules human events. Truman was "a great believer in the parts played by luck and personality," writes Mr. McCullough, noting that "it was luck, good and bad, and the large influence of personality, that determined the course of events time and again." The same stubborn tenacity that enabled Truman to triumph over Thomas E. Dewey in 1948 made him fire Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War -- an act that helped destroy his Administration. Absence of Precedents</p>
        <p>At a recent lunch with editors at The New York Times, Mr. McCullough quoted an old dramatists' axiom: Keep your hero in trouble. Mr. Clinton's future biographer will have no trouble on this score. The one certain thing that can be said about his performance so far is that it's been full of surprises. In fact, there is no historical precedent for some of his ordeals. The persistent crisis over allegations of marital misconduct can be traced to a climate of obligatory candor on the part of the press that's never existed before. The situation is new and requires a new response. The rules have changed.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, emulation is both a guide to conduct and a form of solace; from childhood on, it informs our efforts at self-definition. Truman himself sought analogies for the decisions that confronted him, studying the relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Gen. George B. McClellan in the midst of his own troubles with MacArthur. Mr. Clinton's primary model, as he stressed throughout his campaign, is John F. Kennedy; when he got to the White House he installed Kennedy's desk in the Oval Office. But he's also drawn to Franklin D. Roosevelt; on a visit to Hyde Park, the President was visibly moved by the artifacts of Roosevelt's life. "I belong here," he said.</p>
        <p>The truth is, no one has a clue what kind of president Mr. Clinton will become, what problems he'll confront -- or when. The choices he faces in foreign policy are not unlike choices Truman faced: There's no shortage of tough adversaries around the globe. But the world Mr. Clinton has inherited isn't the world Truman inherited, even where the hot spots are the same. Mr. Clinton, like Truman, is saddled with deep worries about Korea. The difference is that North Korea has the Bomb (we think) this time. The analogy won't hold.</p>
        <p>It never does. Was the gulf war a vindication of the lessons learned at Munich, the ones so many columnists exhorted us to remember? Or was it a legacy of lessons learned at Suez? In retrospect, it was something else -- a momentary triumph that has left us, two years later, wishing the victory was more complete. (It wasn't even enough of a triumph to re-elect George Bush.) Is Understanding Enough?</p>
        <p>No meditation on the vicissitudes of history can be written without quoting Santayana's famous axiom that those who fail to understand the past are condemned to repeat it. So consider it quoted. But is understanding enough? The study of history deepens our sense of what it means to be human -- but it doesn't make us prophets. In "The Eighteenth Brumaire," Marx observed that history occurs the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. He didn't say what it occurs as after that.</p>
        <p>Just think: It was only four years ago that a State Department official by the name of Francis Fukuyama made his name with a controversial article in The National Interest -- later expanded into a best-selling book -- titled "The End of History?" What was happening in the world was nothing less than "the triumph of the West," argued Mr. Fukuyama -- the world was fast moving toward a global version of Western liberal democracy. Who invokes this dubious thesis now? Iraq, Haiti and Bosnia, to name a few, refute it. What we've witnessed is the end of the end of history. The thing itself is still around -- and just as unpredictable as ever.</p>
