        <p>As a member of the American Forestry Association, I must commend Pete Dunne on his indisputable contrast of lawns versus trees (''In the Natural State'').</p>
        <p>Yes! Why must houses be surrounded by stretches of or even scanty lawns? Just to keep those ''contracts'' working all summer? So it appears, as the stuff keeps growing yet provides neither shade nor refreshing relief from burning sun.</p>
        <p>In fact, when cut too close, it browns out, requiring hours of watering.</p>
        <p>Whereas a canopied cluster of leaves covers and cools an entire area. Trees are natural ''air-conditioners,'' serving yard and house. And every autumn, the colorful display of leaves both delights and benefits by becoming natural, nourishing mulch - the same as that sustaining our national forests.</p>
        <p>So, it is a pity that so much land is wasted in lawns, which can do little against the ''greenhouse effect,'' under whose dire destiny our planet lies.</p>
        <p>Therefore, nurture trees you may have, hasten to plant more and respect and cherish their enduring beauty. For while only God can make a tree, only we can treasure them!  BARBARA SCOTT JORDAN  Harrington Park</p>
