        <p>Judge Edmund A Sargus Jr rules that Ohio Edison violated Clean Air Act when it failed to install improved pollution controls at coal-burning power plant; ruling is major victory for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which have joined EPA in lawsuits over acid rain; nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides emitted by some 70 such power plants in Ohio Valley are blamed for 80 percent to 90 percent of acid rain deposits in Adirondacks (M)</p>

        <p>A federal judge ruled today that an Ohio utility violated the Clean Air Act when it failed to install better pollution controls at a coal-burning power plant. The ruling was an important victory for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which along with the Environmental Protection Agency brought the case decided today and have filed similar suits against some of the nation's largest power companies.</p>
        <p>The decision, by Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of Federal District Court in Columbus, not only was a defeat for the utility, Ohio Edison, but also could set a precedent for those other cases against a generation of aging power plants scattered throughout the Midwest and the Southeast that have avoided updating their pollution controls.</p>
        <p>Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides emitted from such plants drift to the Northeast, accounting for a large share of that region's air pollution. For instance, experts say, some 80 to 90 percent of the acid rain deposits in the Adirondacks are attributable to pollution from about 70 coal-burning power plants in the Ohio Valley.</p>
        <p>In all, lawsuits involving more than four dozen plants were brought against power companies by the E.P.A. and Northeastern states during the Clinton administration. While some of those defendants have settled, the case in which Judge Sargus ruled today is the first to be decided in court. Among the big power companies that remain defendants are American Electric Power, in a case also before Judge Sargus; the Southern Company; Cinergy; Duke; and Illinois Power.</p>
        <p>Though the E.P.A. remained a plaintiff after the White House changed hands, the decision today ran contrary to the Bush administration's effort to overhaul a part of the Clean Air Act called ''new source review.'' The administration deems that provision unclear and ineffective.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Northeastern states, on the other hand, argued that the Clean Air Act as it stood was written clearly and only needed to be enforced. In his ruling today, Judge Sargus, a Clinton appointee, generally sided with that view.</p>
        <p>''While the law has always been clear,'' the judge said, ''the enforcement strategies of the E.P.A. have not.'' He noted, however, ''The court finds that E.P.A.'s failures in enforcement do not absolve Ohio Edison from liability under a law that has always been clear.''</p>
        <p>The power industry played down the significance of the ruling. ''It's just a district court case in Ohio,'' said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council. ''While the Ohio Edison case is a disappointment, we do not believe it will have much of an effect on other pending cases.''</p>
        <p>But Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, said, ''The impact goes far beyond Ohio Edison, because the other utilities that have raised the same legal objections will realize that their legal arguments will not prevail.''</p>
        <p>And Richard Blumenthal, attorney general of Connecticut, declared: ''This decision shows very powerfully that other states and the administration cannot simply tell the Northeast to drop dead. They will be held accountable for pollution they cause in violation of the Clean Air Act.''</p>
        <p>The suits against Ohio Edison, a subsidiary of the FirstEnergy Corporation, and the other power companies centered on the Clean Air Act's ''new source review'' provision. The provision mandates that older coal-burning plants, ''grandfathered'' from some pollution control requirements when the act was adopted more than three decades ago, install modern controls whenever they significantly expand their energy production.</p>
        <p>The provision does not require the increased, and expensive, controls in the case of routine maintenance, and the suits maintained that power plants had long been doing substantive upgrades, some needing approval from company directors, under a routine-maintenance guise.</p>
        <p>A case in point was the one involving Ohio Edison. It dealt with the Sammis Plant in Jefferson County, Ohio, which accounts for over 11 percent of the sulfur dioxide and 6 percent of the nitrogen oxides emitted by all Ohio plants. The plaintiffs charged that Sammis had made substantial improvements over the years, but Ohio Edison called them routine.</p>
        <p>Responding to today's decision, Ralph ViNicola, a spokesman for FirstEnergy, said, ''These are the kinds of routine maintenance that every single coal-fired power plant does -- West Coast, Midwest, East Coast.''</p>
        <p>But the judge wrote that adoption of Ohio Edison's definition of routine maintenance would be ''in direct conflict'' with the ''controlling language of the Clean Air Act.''</p>
        <p>Mr. ViNicola said FirstEnergy had not decided whether to appeal.</p>
        <p>Judge Sargus's decision ended the first phase of the case, with the issue of remedies to be taken up in his court next March. Today he urged enforcement officials to resist the lobbying of power companies seeking lighter enforcement. ''What should be unexpected and condemned, however, is an agency unwilling to enforce a clear statutory mandate set forth in an act of Congress,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>But J. P. Suarez, chief of enforcement at the E.P.A., said: ''This is a great win for us in court. As we have been saying all along, E.P.A. has been enforcing the Clean Air Act.''</p>
