        <p>Those Days of Old</p>
        <p>With a life span of four weeks or less, the antler fly is no Methuselah. It's no Marco Polo, either, spending its adult days on the tossed-off antler of a moose or deer. But it is something of a Don Juan, mating for more than two hours at a time, on average.</p>

        <p>Those Days of Old</p>
        <p>With a life span of four weeks or less, the antler fly is no Methuselah. It's no Marco Polo, either, spending its adult days on the tossed-off antler of a moose or deer. But it is something of a Don Juan, mating for more than two hours at a time, on average.</p>
        <p>All of these qualities made the antler fly ideal, in the eyes of Russell Bonduriansky and Chad E. Brassil of the University of Toronto, for studying aging in the wild, and the deterioration that accompanies it. What they found, according to their report in the journal Nature, is that even though antler flies are short-lived, they get old and decrepit before they die.</p>
        <p>That may not seem like earth-shattering news. But it's the first time that aging, or senescence, has been shown in an insect in the wild.</p>
        <p>The researchers captured more than 600 male flies, painting identification codes on their backs so that they could be tracked individually when they were returned to their respective antlers. Then, every two hours, the researchers noted whether each fly was still present (and thus alive) and, if so, whether or not it was mating.</p>
        <p>The flies deteriorated over time, the researchers found, affecting their chances of living another day and of finding romance, both of which declined as they got older.</p>
        <p>This, the researchers say, is proof of senescence. Such aging has been shown in insects studies in laboratories, but those results are skewed by the lack of predators or other elements of risk for the insects.</p>
        <p>A Ho-Hum Eclipse</p>
        <p>The only total solar eclipse of 2002 takes place tomorrow, but it is unlikely to make anyone's list of all-time best eclipses.</p>
        <p>For one thing, it is viewable only in the Southern Hemisphere; the rest of the world will have to be content with watching it on the Web. But even most people in the Southern Hemisphere will not get to see much. The path of totality will sweep across only two land areas, southern Africa near the beginning of the eclipse and sparsely populated south-central Australia near sunset.</p>
        <p>Because of that timing, totality will be relatively short over land areas -- 60 to 90 seconds over parts of Angola, Zimbabwe, northeastern South Africa and Mozambique, and a paltry 30 seconds over Australia. You would have to be in the middle of the southern Indian Ocean to get the maximum duration, 123 seconds.</p>
        <p>The timing also means that the sun will be fairly low when the eclipse occurs -- particularly in Australia, where it will be shortly before sunset. Add to all of this the fact that it is the rainy season in southern Africa and it is a wonder that anyone is interested in this eclipse at all.</p>
        <p>Yet there are several eclipse expeditions in Africa and several in Australia, and some of them will present the event live on the Web, at eclipselive.com for the eclipse in Africa and at csiro.au/helix/eclipse for Australia. Totality in Africa will occur about 1:20 a.m. Eastern time. In Australia it will be at 4:10 a.m.</p>
        <p>Renewable Energy Test</p>
        <p>Connecticut residents who shopped by mail order in recent years were doing more than supporting the retail economy. They were also participating, in an indirect way, in research on the efficiency of alternative fuels.</p>
        <p>As part of a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, United Parcel Service trucks at two depots, Waterbury and Hartford, were evaluated over four years. Some trucks had diesel engines; the others ran on compressed natural gas (U.P.S. has the biggest private fleet of C.N.G. trucks in the country).</p>
        <p>The study found, as expected, that natural gas trucks polluted less. Carbon monoxide emissions were 75 percent lower than with diesels, and nitrogen oxides were 49 percent lower. C.N.G. trucks were as reliable as diesel trucks, although operating costs were either the same or higher, depending on location.</p>
