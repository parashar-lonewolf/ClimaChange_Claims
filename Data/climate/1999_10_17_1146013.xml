        <p>EVERYBODY knows that journalism thrives on bad news: natural disasters, wars, financial crashes. Where would newspapers be without them?</p>
        <p>So when a book comes along titled ''The Long Boom: A Vision For the Coming Age of Prosperity,'' the natural reaction of any self-respecting economics reporter or editor is to examine it with a jaundiced eye.</p>
        <p>For what if its message -- that the world stands on the edge of a ''global economic expansion on a scale never before experienced'' -- turns out to be true? In that case, the job of covering the economy in the future, I have to confess, would probably be a lot less engaging than it has been in the thrilling upheavals of the two decades I've been writing or editing articles about economics and business affairs.</p>
        <p>Who wants to write an unending series of upbeat stories? Who wants to read them? People pay a lot more attention to the economy, after all, when things are going badly than when they are going well. Even the current obsession with getting rich in the stock market is built on the fear that it may all fall apart at any moment.</p>
        <p>Despite my clear interest in finding fault, ''The Long Boom'' (Perseus Books, October 1999), is not so easy to dismiss.</p>
        <p>The book's central thesis, first propounded in an exceptionally long article written by Peter Schwartz and Pete Leyden in Wired magazine in 1997, is by now quite familiar. ''We have gone from an economy driven by the production of tangible things to one driven by intangible ideas,'' they argue. The global economy is in the midst of a ''40-year period from 1980 to 2020 encompassing a critical shift from an Industrial Age economy to an Information Age economy, or a Knowledge Economy, or what we simply call the New Economy.''</p>
        <p>WHILE still controversial among economists, this kind of thinking has been accepted for years in the technology centers on the West Coast. It is reflected in the writings of everyone from Peter Drucker to Paul Hawken, whose seminal 1983 book, ''The Next Economy,'' grew out of futurism scenarios developed at the Stanford Research Institute. Even Alan Greenspan is a convert.</p>
        <p>And it turned out to be more prescient than the fashionably pessimistic East Coast views of the 1980's, expressed in critically acclaimed books like ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' by Paul Kennedy, a professor at Yale. He predicted the decline of the United States as a world power only a few years before America's chief strategic rival, the Soviet Union, fell apart and its chief economic challenger, Japan, entered decade-long stagnation.</p>
        <p>But the pessimists have been swept from the field, and American optimism about the nation's technological and economic superiority is running rampant. So what now? ''If we do it right, it's an opportunity to build a vastly better world,'' said Mr. Schwartz, visiting New York the other day with Mr. Leyden, in a wide-ranging conversation. ''This is the reverse of World War II. This is about more than simply protecting what we've got against the sea of darkness.''</p>
        <p>The allusion to World War II is revealing. Millions of baby boomers harbor a not-so-hidden envy of their parents' great crusade. ''Saving Private Ryan'' and Tom Brokaw's paean to ''The Greatest Generation'' have touched a chord: Making money doesn't compare to ridding the world of Nazism.</p>
        <p>There's nothing wrong, of course, with recognizing the nobility of that heroic struggle. Self-sacrifice is morally superior to self-indulgence. But sometimes that wisdom slops over into a yearning for another war to fight, a hankering simply to risk death for a greater cause.</p>
        <p>And that's where ''The Long Boom'' gets interesting. For what the authors are really doing is trying to infuse that hoariest of cliches -- the moral equivalent of war -- with real meaning for generations who, one hopes, will never experience a real war.</p>
        <p>In essence, they offer an ideology for college-educated knowledge workers, who will soon be the largest class in America. They advocate globalization and open markets,  and while not particularly anti-government,  they are vaguely libertarian in outlook. They see rapid growth built on technologies like fuel cells and genetic engineering as capable of improving the environment rather than degrading it. ''It's an anti-Blade Runner vision of the future,'' Mr. Leyden said.</p>
        <p>The payoff from all this in 25 years or so, they argue, will be to pull perhaps half the world's population out of subsistence living into a vast, well-educated global middle class. The average life span would lengthen tremendously. The risk of global warming would disappear.</p>
        <p>I've got my doubts. They underestimate the threat of deep cultural conflict and a backlash against technology that would result from fast growth. They tend to congratulate the high-tech centimillionaires of Silicon Valley simply for doing what they do best: getting rich. And their vision is too New Agey for my taste.</p>
        <p>Still, their dream looks superior to the likely alternatives. Growth is indeed better than stagnation. Peace beats war. If that's not so good for reporters, so be it.</p>
