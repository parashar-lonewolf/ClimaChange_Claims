        <p>ABOUT 12,000 years ago, people living in what is now southern Peru camped on the Pacific shore and feasted on fish, seabirds and shellfish. The remains of stone tools, hearths and butchered bird bones found at two Peruvian sites are the earliest known evidence of maritime-based cultures in the New World, scientists reported last week.</p>
        <p>The findings, described in the current issue of the journal Science, also provide further proof that people were in America earlier than once thought. Of possibly even more importance, they support an emerging view of how the first Americans lived and how they migrated through the length of North and South America. This rethinking of the peopling of the New World is becoming one of the liveliest areas of research and controversy in American archeology.</p>
        <p>In the new view, it appears that the earliest Americans were not all hunters spearing big game like mammoths and bison, as they have long been portrayed in prehistoric studies. The Peruvian discoveries, along with other recent research, show that many of the people who first inhabited the Americas relied on diverse resources for survival: big game and small, plants and fruits, marine life and just about anything at hand.</p>
        <p>Dr. Daniel H. Sandweiss of the University of Maine at Orono, who directed research at one of the sites, said in a telephone interview: ''This finally makes it abundantly clear that these people had a very diverse subsistence system and were prepared to exploit all different kinds of food sources almost as soon as they arrived in America. We had thought this before, but we can prove it now.''</p>
        <p>Research by Dr. Anna C. Roosevelt, an archeologist at the Field Museum and the University of Illinois in Chicago, had already found that people living 11,000 years ago in the Amazon basin had opportunistic subsistence economies that seldom included big game. Likewise, the oldest confirmed settlement site in the Americas, at Monte Verde in southern Chile, was occupied 12,500 years ago by people who ate mastodon meat when available but more usually dined on potatoes, mushrooms, grasses, nuts, berries and freshwater shellfish.</p>
        <p>''Now there's recognition that early Americans did not live by mammoth alone,'' said Dr. David J. Meltzer, an archeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, commenting on the Peruvian findings.</p>
        <p>Until last year, when archeologists finally accepted the antiquity of the Monte Verde site, the earliest confirmed traces of human activity in the Americas had been 11,200-year-old stone spear points discovered in the 1930's near Clovis, N.M. The distinctive points were later found scattered throughout much of the two continents, creating the impression of the first Americans as almost exclusively big-game hunters. This led to the prevailing hypothesis that the New World was first populated in the last ice age when sea levels were low. Hunters walked across a land bridge at the Bering Strait in pursuit of game, then moved south through an ice-free corridor between glaciers in the continental interior and eventually made it by foot all the way to the tip of South America.</p>
        <p>Dr. David K. Keefer of the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., a geologist and leader of the team that explored the second Peruvian site, said the new evidence of such early maritime-oriented cultures bolstered the case for an alternative migration theory.</p>
        <p>''Our site,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''is about the best kind of evidence you're going to find for the idea of coastal migration -- not conclusively probably, but very strong evidence.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Knut Fladmark, an archeologist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, proposed the coastal migration hypothesis in the 1970's, but the idea gained few adherents until recently. Geologic and paleoenvironmental studies have begun showing that there probably was not a clear passage between the glaciers early enough to enable people to migrate through the North American interior in time to reach places as far south as Peru, Brazil and Chile when new archeological evidence establishes that they were there.</p>
        <p>New estimates, Dr. Fladmark said last week, indicate that the corridor between the glaciers, on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, did not open until 11,500 years ago. If the newcomers to America could not move south through the interior, they might have migrated along the western coast, on foot along the shore and by skin-covered boats for stretches.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sandweiss is reserving judgment as to whether the Peruvian sites support the coastal-migration hypothesis. At the site he studied, the people appeared to have occupied it seasonally and spent the rest of the year in the nearby highlands, possibly engaged mostly in hunting.</p>
        <p>''The coastal migration is possible, but neither site provides clear evidence for it at this time,'' Dr. Sandweiss said. ''We need a good number  more sites up and down the coast to establish anything about migrations.''</p>
        <p>An advocate of the coastal-migration hypothesis, Dr. Carole A. S. Mandryk of Harvard University, said the Peruvian findings ''make me really happy'' because they show a culture oriented to the sea and its resources that was living as far south as Peru early enough that their ancestors presumably could not have found a way through the interior glaciers of the ice age. Instead, she said, they would probably have taken the coastal route.</p>
        <p>Finding evidence of early coastal settlements and migrations was once thought to be hopeless. At the end of the ice age, melting glaciers raised sea levels and inundated what had been the ancient shorelines. But off Peru, the sea floor drops off so steeply that when the sea levels rose, not much land was submerged. Buried remains of settlements close to the ice-age coast might still be recoverable.</p>
        <p>Both discovery sites are in the arid south of Peru, near Arequipa. The site Dr. Keefer's group excavated, called Quebrada Tacahuay, was about a half-mile from the present shore. As a geologist, Dr. Keefer was originally looking for buried evidence of the effects of ancient El Ninos on early cultures. Layers of sediments revealed deposits of mud and rock from floods brought about by El Nino, a Pacific Ocean warm-water current that every few years generates storms and heavy rain along the western coasts of the Americas and droughts in Australia and Asia.</p>
        <p>Deep among the flood deposits, the geologists and archeologists found the charcoal and stones of a cooking hearth, radiocarbon dated at 10,700 years, or about 12,700 calendar years old. Further exploration turned up an abundance of seabird bones, particularly cormorants and boobies. Butcher marks suggest that the people were removing the meaty breast parts. The second most abundant remains were anchovy bones. Only a few bones of terrestrial animals were found.</p>
        <p>''The remains of such small, schooling fish at the site suggest the use of specialized fish-netting technology,'' the scientists reported in the Science article.</p>
        <p>The second site, called Quebrada Jaguay and worked by Dr. Sandweiss's group, was a few miles inland by the bed of seasonal stream flowing out of the highlands to the coastal desert. People occupied the site for a time 13,000 to 11,000 years ago, gathering clams and small fish of the drum family. Archeologists found some stone tools, petrified wood and small pieces of obsidian as cutting tools.</p>
        <p>In their Science report, Dr. Sandweiss and his colleagues said the bones and stones at Quebrada Jaguay suggest that the people there were foragers who spent part of their time in the highlands and part on the coast exploiting marine resources. While at the shore, they relied almost exclusively on the sea for food.</p>
        <p>''This conclusion supports other recent studies showing early diversification of subsistence beyond an economy based on the hunting of large game,'' the scientists wrote.</p>
