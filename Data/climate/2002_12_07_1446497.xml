        <p>Three environmental groups have gone to court in an effort to force the Bush administration to declare that auto emissions contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>In a lawsuit filed on Thursday in Federal District Court in Washington, the groups said the Environmental Protection Agency unlawfully failed to respond to their 1999 petition seeking restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Agency officials said yesterday that they could not comment on the suit because they had not yet reviewed it.</p>
        <p>The groups said their suit was intended partly to force the government to curtail auto emissions and partly to clear the way for states to take action on their own. California has a law restricting tailpipe emissions, and other states are considering such measures, but experts on climate policy say the laws cannot take effect unless the E.P.A. establishes that the gases are pollutants.</p>
        <p>The administration, along with the oil and auto industries, sees any such restrictions as unnecessary and harmful to the economy. President Bush has said he will support nothing beyond voluntary measures to slow the rate of growth of emissions until science shows more clearly that warming caused by humans poses a significant threat.</p>
        <p>Cars and other vehicles emit about a third of the gases that scientists have linked to a 50-year warming trend. The environmental groups' original petition said that under the Clean Air Act the emissions should be restricted as pollutants.</p>
        <p>As early as 1994, E.P.A. documents labeled carbon dioxide ''a pollution concern.'' But Republicans in Congress and industry lobbyists defeated any moves toward restrictions, and last year Mr. Bush, in abandoning a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide from power plants, said it ''is not a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Dan Becker, the director of climate policy at the Sierra Club, one of the plaintiffs, said it was ''time for the agency charged with protecting human health and the environment to begin to control carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases contributing to global warming.''</p>
        <p>The other plaintiffs are Greenpeace and the International Center for Technology Assessment.</p>
