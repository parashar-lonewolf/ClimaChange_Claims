        <p>LEAD: The buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, which might warm the earth's climate to dangerous levels, could be significantly reduced if governments took concerted action, a study by an environmental research group said today.</p>
        <p>The buildup of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, which might warm the earth's climate to dangerous levels, could be significantly reduced if governments took concerted action, a study by an environmental research group said today.</p>
        <p>The study, by the World Resources Institute, concluded that the temperature increase could be significantly limited by more efficient use of energy, restoring tropical areas that have been depleted and reducing chlorofluorocarbon emissions. . Chlorofluorocarbons are gases used in the manufacture of some insulations, in aerosols and in refrigeration.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that if carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons are allowed to accumulate in the atmosphere, they can keep infrared radiation from escaping into space and can cause a rise in temperatures around the world, leading to extreme weather fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Dr. Irving M. Mintzer, a scientist with the World Resources Institute, the author of the study, urged governments to impose a tax on fossil fuels to support the development of solar energy and to limit production of chlorofluorcarbons. Scientists say chlorofluorocarbons, in addition to contributing to the warming effect, also help deplete the atmospheric ozone layer that protects earth from harmful ultraviolet rays.</p>
        <p>''Without such measures,'' warned James G. Speth, president of the Washington-based institute, ''current trends and policies appear to have mankind on a course that could lead to very large and potentially devastating climatic changes in the next century.''</p>
        <p>The report concluded that the earth's temperature may go up as much as 7 degrees centigrade by the year 2075 and cited predictions by other scientists that, if current trends continue, by 2030 New York City will experience more than three times as many days over 90 degrees Fahrenheit each year. On the average, New York has 15 days over 90 degrees each year.</p>
        <p>The institute's study employed a computer to predict the effects of four approaches governments could take to controlling emissions of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gases. In each approach, researchers assumed the same rates of economic and population growth. Polar Ice Could Melt</p>
        <p>If there are no signifigant changes in government policies, the report said, global temperatures may rise 1.6 to 4.7 degrees centigrade in 30 years, an increase sufficient to melt some polar ice and cause sea level to rise one to four feet.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mintzer said such a rise could lead to severe coastal flooding, destruction of most beaches and dramatic climate fluctuations caused by changes in ocean currents. By 2075, the study said, global temperatures might be as much as 8.6 degrees centigrade higher than in the pre-industrial area.</p>
        <p>But the study said that, if the United States adopts strong measures limiting emissions of the climate-affecting gases, and if such measures are supported by other goverments, a devastating warming trend can be avoided.</p>
