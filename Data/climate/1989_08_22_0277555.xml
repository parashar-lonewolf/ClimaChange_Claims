        <p>LEAD: Nobody expected industry to love President Bush's clean air bill. It will cause great aggravation and cost billions. What's far more surprising is the passionate complaining of the environmentalists, who seek a more perfect bill. Yet especially in Congress, perfection has a way of becoming the enemy of the good.</p>
        <p>Nobody expected industry to love President Bush's clean air bill. It will cause great aggravation and cost billions. What's far more surprising is the passionate complaining of the environmentalists, who seek a more perfect bill. Yet especially in Congress, perfection has a way of becoming the enemy of the good.</p>
        <p>There's little doubt that the bill could be strengthened. And there's no doubt that the fine print in the legislation dilutes the promise of Mr. Bush's ringing speech in June. Yet whatever its flaws, the bill remains the first serious effort in 12 years to overhaul the Clean Air Act of 1970. It merits constructive refinement, not trashing. Holding out for an ideal law may diminish the chances of enacting any law at all.</p>
        <p>The bill would tackle three huge problems: ozone, which is the main component of urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals. The environmentalists' main complaint deals with the proposals on urban pollution. Mr. Bush would require states and cities to cut it by 3 percent every year; to that end, he would also require a 40 percent reduction in tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>Clean air advocates like Representative Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, argue that Mr. Bush has aimed far too low. Anti-pollution devices on cars, for example, are now required to last 50,000 miles. Mr. Waxman would double that to 100,000 miles, as California already requires. Industry argued that doing so nationally would expose it to costly recalls. Mr. Bush went along with industry.</p>
        <p>The President would also let auto makers ''average'' the pollution of all cars rather than keep each car below allowable levels. Critics think this would undermine the law; the Administration insists it would not. Mr. Waxman also complains that the bill leaves too much to the discretion of the Environmental Protection Agency, which has a distressing history of capitulating to industry pressure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers concede that compromises were made, and that William Reilly, director of the Environmental Protection Agency, lost more than one battle to the cost-conscious Office of Management and Budget. But even Mr. Reilly agrees that some trade-offs were required to win Congressional support and induce industry to begin building large numbers of cars that run on ''clean fuels.'' Set against these realities, Mr. Waxman's charge that the Administration cut a ''sweetheart deal with the auto makers'' strikes the White House as posturing from a man whose support it badly needs.</p>
        <p>In truth, the auto makers, while sullen, won't be the bill's main opponents; they seem to sense which way the public wind is blowing. Earlier this month, officials of eight Northeastern states, including New York, agreed to adopt California's strict standards on auto emissions beginning with the 1993 model year. Detroit complained - but largely because the plan would require the auto industry to respond to a patchwork of different emissions standards. The not-so-hidden message: Impose national standards, and we'll go along.</p>
        <p>The real opposition will come from the oil industry, which fears the costs of making alternative fuels; and the coal-burning electric utilities, which create much of the acid rain. Mr. Bush's bill would reduce harmful sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the year 2000 and cap emissions thereafter. Energy Secretary James Watkins argued ferociously that capping emissions would cripple future energy supplies. Mr. Reilly won that battle, but the industry is now beating the same drum loudly in the halls of Congress.</p>
        <p>Industry's formidable record of success on Capitol Hill is something the critics might remember. Mr. Waxman and a few others like him have been lonely, courageous voices in the movement for cleaner air. They now have a President on their side. That's reason enough for them to end their tactical maneuvering and join in a constructive effort to improve the bill.</p>
