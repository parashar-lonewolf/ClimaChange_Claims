        <p>LEAD: If changes in Federal policy are put into effect, the use of natural gas could increase by one-third during the next 20 years, cutting oil imports by two million barrels a day while reducing the trade deficit, acid rain and smog, a recent study concluded.</p>
        <p>If changes in Federal policy are put into effect, the use of natural gas could increase by one-third during the next 20 years, cutting oil imports by two million barrels a day while reducing the trade deficit, acid rain and smog, a recent study concluded.</p>
        <p>The study, released this week in Washington, was done by two former Reagan Administration officials who have ties to President-elect Bush. It was paid for by 28 companies that produce, transport or sell gas at retail.</p>
        <p>The directors of the study were Scott L. Campbell, a former planning director at the Energy Department, and William F. Martin, a former Deputy Energy Secretary, who has been described in trade publications as a leading candidate to be appointed Secretary of Energy by Mr. Bush. The two are partners at Washington Policy and Analysis, a consulting group.</p>
        <p>The study called for the Government to authorize the construction of new pipelines and encourage the development of new technologies to help find gas reserves. It also urged that natural gas be substituted for oil and coal, reducing air pollution, and that more cars and buses be built to run on natural gas. Rise in Oil Imports</p>
        <p>Petroleum policy has been the focus of more attention in recent months as a continued slump in the price of oil has resulted in lower domestic oil production and higher consumption, thereby raising oil imports. According to the American Petroleum Institute, imports reached 7.6 million barrels a day in October, or 42.7 percent of consumption. That compares with seven million barrels, or 41.3 percent of consumption, a year earlier. The October figure was the highest in eight years and near the record of 48 percent of consumption set in 1977.</p>
        <p>The prospect is for further declines in domestic petroleum production, and therefore higher oil imports. In mid-November, only 897 rotary drilling rigs were active, according to Baker Hughes Inc. of Houston; last year, the number was 1,102. The all-time high was 4,530 in December 1981. The rigs are usually looking for oil but may find gas instead.</p>
        <p>Like numerous previous studies, the report issued this week stressed that the nation should encourage the use of gas, which is both domestically produced and clean burning. But, it adds, ''As things stand, neither U.S. supply nor demand for natural gas would grow rapidly enough to do what political leaders, environmentalists, economists, energy analysts and academics now agree should be done.</p>
        <p>''This report suggests how a new national attitude about natural gas can be helped along.'' Plentiful Supply in U.S.  Natural gas is plentiful, the authors said. The United States has a 35-year supply, at today's prices and rates of consumption. If the price rises, additional supplies that are more expensive to extract would become practical to produce, the report says.</p>
        <p>It proposes tax incentives for new drilling and research into ways to find gas reservoirs that have been bypassed in initial development. Imports of liquefied natural gas - a technique tried briefly when oil prices peaked - could be resumed in the next decade, the study said, with supplies coming from Norway, Algeria and Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Liquefying gas for export by tanker is expensive, but many members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are eager to do so because they need more income. OPEC, which sets limits on how much oil its members pump, imposes no restrictions on gas. Need Seen for New Pipelines</p>
        <p>To increase use, new pipelines would also be needed, especially in the Northeastern United States, the study said, adding a recommendation that process for gaining Federal and state approval must be accelerated.</p>
        <p>More supply will lead to more use, the authors said, but they proposed additional steps to stimulate demand.</p>
        <p>One way to use more gas, make the air cleaner and make the economy more efficient, the authors said, is to change the way the Government enforces clean-air requirements. Incentives Proposed</p>
        <p>The study suggested that industries should be allowed to choose which operations they will clean up, by switching them to natural gas and earning ''points that they could transfer or sell to dirtier operations, like coal-burning plants.''</p>
        <p>An expert not affiliated with the study, George Lawrence, president of the American Gas Association, said his group believes that gas consumption would rise even without the measures the study recommends. But, he added, ''all of these things would move them along much quicker.''</p>
        <p>Increasing the supply and consumption of gas would have positive effects on the economy as a whole, the study said, citing that as a justification for offering tax incentives to producers. If consumption is increased by one-third by 2010, the study said, the annual difference in the trade deficit would be nearly $24 billion, and hundreds of thousands of jobs would be created.</p>
