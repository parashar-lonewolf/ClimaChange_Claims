        <p>As President-elect Clinton, his Cabinet and advisers prepare to take office, concentration on immediate and short-term issues would be scarcely surprising.</p>
        <p>Should the North American free trade agreement be accepted? Should more pressure be put on Serbia to cease its "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia? Can some troops now be withdrawn from Somalia? Should our profligate use of petroleum be curbed by a gas tax? How can the new Administration convince the markets it is serious about cutting the deficit?</p>
        <p>Add to these challenges the unpredictable crises of the year ahead, and it would seem almost impossible for Bill Clinton and his fellow world leaders to focus on anything other than the problems at hand.</p>
        <p>Yet, as we move toward the 21st century there is a compelling need for politicians and nations alike to raise their eyes from day-to-day issues, however pressing and tragic, and devote time to considering our global condition as a whole.</p>
        <p>The immediate crises -- among them, turmoil in foreign-exchange markets, ethnic unrest, trade tensions, refugees -- have to be set within a larger context and understood as local manifestations of the way different societies are responding to broad trans-national forces for change. Unless we grasp the larger picture, we have no chance of preparing for the problems ahead, and will most likely find ourselves limited to reactive, damage-control measures when a crisis occurs.</p>
        <p>But how, given the kaleidoscopic nature of contemporary world affairs, are we to distinguish the important from the ephemeral? It might help to consider an earlier time in this century when hopes of a new world order were also being overshadowed by economic fears, ethnic jealousies and political paralysis.</p>
        <p>In a remarkable article in October 1930 (after the Wall Street crash but before Japan's invasion of Manchuria and the Nazis' seizure power), the Economist of London somberly surveyed contemporary global problems and concluded: "The supreme difficulty of our generation . . . . is that our achievements on the economic plane of life have outstripped our progress on the political plane to the extent that our economics and our politics are perpetually falling out of gear with one another. On the economic plane, the world has been organized into a single all-embracing unit of activity. On the political plane, it has not only remained partitioned into 60 or 70 sovereign national states, but the national units themselves have been growing smaller and more numerous and the national consciousness more acute. The tension between these two antithetical tendencies has been producing a series of jolts and jars and smashes in the social life of humanity."</p>
        <p>This is not to imply that another Hitler is lurking around the corner but to suggest that those "antithetical tendencies" noted by the Economist are as much, or even more, in evidence today. With the Western colonial empires gone, the Soviet Union disintegrated and Yugoslavia torn apart, almost three times as many states exist as in the 1930's. All confront the task of reconciling technological change and economic integration with traditional political structures, national consciousness, socio-economic needs and habitual ways of doing things.</p>
        <p>As the forces for modernization and integration press against social groups desperately clinging to older ways (French farmers and Chinese bureaucrats, for example ) and in some places are countered by the forces of disintegration (in, say, Slovakia and the Sudan), it becomes clear that we are witnessing a global process, not random incidents.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the task of reconciling economic and political structures will be complicated by trends that were scarcely evident three generations but now threaten to worsen social tensions in all manner of ways.</p>
        <p>In the place of the Fascist threats of the 1930's, there are numerous volatile regimes in Asia and Africa, some striving to obtain weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>There is also the problem of growing demographic imbalances between rich and poor societies: 95 percent of the projected doubling of the world's total population, from five to 10 billion people, between now and the middle of the next century will take place in developing lands. This has profound implications for the environment, political and social stability, the prospects of sharing diminished supplies of water and woodlands and for migration patterns.</p>
        <p>The 1990's are unfolding with vast numbers of ambitious and desperate peasants moving from their strife-torn overpopulated homelands toward the prosperous societies of Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>At the same time, new technologies -- completely automated assembly plants, biotech farming and food processing, 24-hour-a-day futures trading -- make traditional jobs redundant, even in developed economies, while further eroding the economic sovereignty of countries. In sum, we again face a "series of jolts and jars and smashes in the social life of humanity," with every likelihood that such shocks will continue.</p>
        <p>Given the dimension, complexity and apparent inevitability of these technological and demographic forces, is there really anything that the Clinton Administration can do, especially in light of America's budget deficits, social needs, the shake-out of so many household names in the manufacturing industry, and spiraling health care costs?</p>
        <p>Don't U.S. politicians have enough on their hands in simply dealing with domestic problems, from downsizing the military to reviving the inner cities? Isn't grappling with the more than one million people who stream across the Rio Grande each year a task enough, without Mr. Clinton's being required to respond to demographic trends in Africa and Asia?</p>
        <p>Certainly, addressing internalneeds is critically important, not just for the Democrats' electoral chances in 1996 but because a more productive, vibrant and confident nation would also be in a better position to contribute to solving global challenges. This does not mean, however, that the U.S. can completely insulate itself from the world's problems.</p>
        <p>More than ever before -- much more than in the 1930's -- what happens in the world outside affects America's prospects, simply because we have become so much integrated economically, strategically and politically in global affairs over the past half-century. Unlike Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bill Clinton probably cannot afford the luxury of devoting his first few years of office to domestic renewal alone.</p>
        <p>Thus, the broad trans-national forces call for true leadership by the President and Congress and their equivalents elsewhere. Such leadership would display three critical, linked characteristics. The first is a willingness carefully to study and try to understand the truly global nature of the challenges we face. The second is an ability to articulate clearly why it is important to pay attention to external trends and, where necessary, to allocate resources to deal with pressing needs outside our own boundaries. And the third -- the most important of all -- is a commitment to evolve policies, in conjunction with our allies and the appropriate international agencies, to ameliorate and contain global trends that threaten instability and to support measures that encourage sustainable development.</p>
        <p>All three attributes -- understanding, explaining, carrying out -- are required. In the absence of one of them there is no prospect of progress.</p>
        <p>Supposing that the Clinton-Gore team can avoid being totally overwhelmed by the domestic agenda and is able to comprehend trans-national challenges and persuade America of the need for sacrifices to improve our global condition, what policies would really make a difference? What could be done to ease worries about long-term trends as against simply reacting to regional crises that are their manifestation?</p>
        <p>No doubt 100 different replies, involving policies, large and small, could be given in answer to those questions. The danger is that in trying to do everything at once an Administration's energies can become dissipated and attention become unfocused. It is far better to deal with only a few critical issues, giving them the attention they deserve and relegating other policies to a secondary order -- another sign of true leadership.</p>
        <p>What might the top four issues be?</p>
        <p>The first, admittedly long-term but arguably the most vital of all, is to encourage a reduction in the global population explosion, which is the cause of mass poverty and also feeds into social turbulence from Algeria to India. At a time when tens of millions of married women in the third world, already weakened by bearing three or four children, are desperate to gain access to benign contraceptives (like Norplant), it is unconscionable that our Government -- lumping sensible population-control measures with forced sterilization and abortion -- should continue to deny funds to assist efforts to reduce the demographic explosion.</p>
        <p>Improving the condition of women in developing countries, especially their access to education, would be the single most important move to bettering mankind's social condition. This will take time, so why not start now?</p>
        <p>Second, intelligent proposals are needed to head off the growing gap between the rich North and poor South, not just on humanitarian grounds but also because of urgent pragmatic reasons. It is inconceivable that Americans and Europeans, a mere 10 percent of the earth's population, will be able to exist as islands of prosperity in a sea of poverty and social strife as the next century unfolds.</p>
        <p>A North-South "grand bargain" that included environmental pacts, increases in overseas aid from today's pitifully low percentages, the maintenance of open access to the third world's exports and reduction of fuel use and greenhouse emissions is a fundamental requirement.</p>
        <p>Given the past record of failures and inefficiencies in development policies, selling such a deal to the public will be no easy task -- even if we have leaders willing to tell the nation that, while this will surely cost us large sums now, the results of neglect might be even costlier later.</p>
        <p>Third, there is need to address a more immediate and more traditional military danger -- namely, the proliferation of sophisticated weapons, some capable of long or medium-range delivery and mass destruction, into the volatile regions of the globe.</p>
        <p>What will be increasingly different about future politics as compared with the time when the Economist warned of "jolts" and "smashes" is that poorer countries will come into possession of such weapons and be able not only to inflict dreadful damage on their neighbors but also to carry that destruction farther afield. Do we want to wait until, say, the range of North African missiles extends to Paris and Frankfurt before waking up -- or join instead a serious campaign against proliferation, including sales by our own arms industry?</p>
        <p>Finally, because all these considerations will affect America's society and economy in a world of rapid technological change and the disappearance of many traditional jobs, we need to introduce apprenticeship and retraining systems like those in Germany and Sweden and to raise the numerical and literary skills of the noncollege population to those in other advanced economies. We need alterations in the school curriculums -- from grammar schools to elite universities -- to teach about global trends.</p>
        <p>More than that, we need politicians who will keep reminding the public of the truly significant developments in world affairs instead of appealing to short-term interests ("no new taxes") and pandering to anti-foreign and protectionist forces.</p>
        <p>There must be better ways of responding to the impacts of globalization than restricting food and textile imports from third world countries -- moves that only worsen their problems and send more illegal migrants streaming to our shores. All this involves costs both in money and in political popularity.</p>
        <p>Sixty years ago, the coming jolts and smashes in the social life of humanity eventually produced one leader who offered his country only blood, sweat, toil and tears. But Winston Churchill had it easy in one way, since the external threats had become so clear and the need for sacrifices so obvious that he offered the only real alternative.</p>
        <p>The challenge for the Clinton Administration is to convince America and our allies that today's global trends, while less immediate a threat to national security than Fascist aggression was, might be equally perilous to our well-being over the long term and thus require equally serious responses. If the new team can successfully respond to the new global agenda -- understanding, explaining and carrying out intelligent policies to meet the changed conditions -- it will indeed have demonstrated true leadership. But that is a big if.</p>
