        <p>Mild winter weather made 1990 the seventh warmest year on record in the United States. It might have been the warmest ever, meteorologists said, had not a December chill in the Midwest and the West offset record high temperatures in the East.</p>
        <p>The Southeast, encompassing Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Alabama, did have record warmth, Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the National Climatic Data Center at Asheville, N.C., said yesterday. The center is an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>In the Northeast, which comprises New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, 1990 was the fourth warmest year since the Government began collecting national weather data in 1895. The two eastern regions were the only ones in which 1990 ranked as one of the five warmest years.</p>
        <p>Climate experts also said that once global data had been collected and analyzed, 1990 would almost surely be the warmest year yet recorded worldwide, in spite of the fact that in the United States 1990 was not the warmest year.</p>
        <p>Dr. James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, an expert on global climate, said some regions of the world were bound to be cooler than the global average and some were certain to be warmer.</p>
        <p>The average temperature of the contiguous 48 states, although relatively high, was well within the range of natural variability as expressed in the 96-year record.</p>
        <p>The average temperature reached 53.94 degrees last year, according to Mr. Heim. That is well above the 96-year average of 52.5 degrees but somewhat below the record of 54.67 degrees in 1934. Except for that year, only 1921, 1931, 1953, 1954 and 1986 were warmer than 1990.</p>
        <p>Last year's high average was attributed largely to four unusually warm months at the beginning of the year, said Frederick J. Gadomski, a meteorologist in the weather communications group at Pennsylvania State University.</p>
        <p>"It was not the result of an extraordinarily hot summer," Mr. Gadomski said. Rather, virtually the entire country was warmer than normal, he added, "and in many cases spectacularly warmer than normal" from January through April. A Winter That Wasn't</p>
        <p>During that period, he said, an "unusually persistent and fast" flow of winds blew across the continent, bringing warm air from the Pacific Ocean. No big masses of Arctic air were able to breach this strong windstream and push south. "Hence," Mr. Gadomski said, "everybody shared in a year almost without a winter."</p>
        <p>In late spring and summer, he added, much of the nation's Southwest did experience record heat. But in the rest of the country the summer was moderate.</p>
        <p>The January-to-April pattern returned for a time in the fall before cold air masses finally did move down from the north, bringing frigid temperatures to the Midwest and the West.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a strong high-pressure system off the East Coast poured warm tropical air into the Eastern United States, bringing the region its unusually mild weather in November and December and enabling 1990 to become the warmest year on record in New York and Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>In Central Park in Manhattan, the average temperature last year was 57.2 degrees, breaking the earlier record of 57 degrees set in 1953. That year was also the warmest on record for the Northeast as a whole, as well as the fifth warmest for the nation.</p>
        <p>The outlook for the first three months of 1991 appears about the same as the December pattern, said Jim Wagner, senior forecaster in the prediction branch of the National Weather Service's Climate Analysis Center in Camp Springs, Md.</p>
        <p>"We're looking for a warm Southeast and a mostly cold West and northern half of the middle of the country," he said, adding that the eastern warmth should extend as far north as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Unsettled weather is likely to continue in New York and New England, Mr. Wagner said.</p>
        <p>Last year was also the 10th driest year in the California-Nevada region, a region plagued by a drought that is entering its fifth year. But Mr. Wagner said the drought was expected to moderate early this year.</p>
        <p>For the nation as a whole, 1990 was the 12th wettest year. For the Northeast it was the third wettest year, and for the central region of the country it was the wettest ever. In that region, comprising Indiana Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia, 52.9 inches of precipitation fell. In the central region's driest year, 1930, there were only 31.77 inches. More Warm Years Likely</p>
        <p>Scientists say that Earth's average surface temperature rose by about one degree Fahrenheit in the last century and that five of the warmest years on record worldwide were in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>This warming trend increases chances that the United States will have unusually warm years more often, Dr. Hansen said.</p>
        <p>"It is not going to be hot every year even if global temperatures are at record levels," he said, but the warming should be expected "to affect the probability of a warm season or a warm year."</p>
        <p>Dr. Hansen said the global increase in temperature has probably been caused by an increase in the "greenhouse effect," a condition in which some scientists believe that increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other man-made gases trap and retain heat from the Sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse. Such a warming could cause severe droughts and storms and severely disrupt the world's biological systems.</p>
        <p>Other scientists say it is too early to tell whether human-induced global warming is taking place or whether the higher global temperatures result from natural variations in climate.</p>
