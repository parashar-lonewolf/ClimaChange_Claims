        <p>HOBOS wandering the back roads used to sing about an imaginary place called the Big Rock Candy Mountain, ''a land of lemonade springs where the bluebird sings,'' where ''there's a lake of stew and of whiskey, too; you can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe.''</p>
        <p>Designers on the road to the future dream of similar technological pie in the sky in this year's rendition of the Design Challenge, a shoot-out of car concepts submitted by local satellite design studios at the Los Angeles auto show.</p>
        <p>This, the third edition of the battle, includes visions of a green Hummer -- just as the Governator has promised -- a wooden Mercedes and self-fabricating Volkswagens. The contest mandate focuses on green cars -- not just zero-emission ones but fully recyclable and sustainable vehicles. As befits the home of the film industry, the nine entries are not real cars but are star vehicles that exist only as glittering digital images.</p>
        <p>The studios took on the challenge with varying degrees of intensity and seriousness. BMW DesignWorks handed the task of creating a Mini entry to an intern designer, Gary Shiu. The Hummer 02 is credited to five designers at the General Motors West Coast Advanced Design Studio, including its chief, Frank Saucedo.</p>
        <p>The Hummer 02 is built of panels containing living algae that theoretically produce more oxygen than its engine consumes. They unfold when the boxy vehicle is parked and look like solar panels on a Mars lander. The Mercedes-Benz entry, the Recy, puts wooden wheel covers on a body inspired by Riva yachts, but it appears to have been covered in woodgrain contact paper. The Mini BioMoke is constructed of biodegradable panels impregnated with palm tree seeds, compostable after a five-year life cycle.</p>
        <p>To offset the resources consumed in designing its Dynamic Space Frame entry, Audi purchased wind power from Renewable Energy Choice and planted trees through Trees for the Future's Global Cooling Program. The Volkswagen Nanospyder is to be manufactured by ''submolecular assemblers'' of the sort envisioned by the nanovisionary Eric Drexler. Such assemblers could create objects from the atom up, without robots, workers -- or unions.</p>
        <p>Kia has taken the assignment with a bit of humor. It aims the Sandstorm, a dune buggy with a biodiesel plug-in hybrid, at beach bums and ''ecofashionistas.'' ''The renewable energy is yours,'' Kia declares.</p>
        <p>Toyotas' R.L.V., or renewable lifestyle vehicle, alternates between pedal drive and electric drive, saving on gym membership fees by turning the commute to work into an exercise session. Honda's Extreme is a life-stage vehicle designed for easy alteration of its body to keep up with the changing biography of its owner -- from an imagined single life in 2010, it cumulatively adds new polycarbonate panels as the male owner acquires girlfriend, then wife and then child and dog by 2015.</p>
        <p>These technologies are part fun, part silly, but all proof of the power of the dream of the ''green Hummer''-- the rolling embodiment of guilt-free gluttony. The hobo's song was born of an empty stomach. The car designers' dreams are born of a car culture running on empty, hungering for new ideas to let Angelenos (and the rest of us) keep pursuing our love affair with the automobile.</p>
        <p>The winner will be announced at the show on Nov. 30. The concepts are online at laautoshow.com.</p>
