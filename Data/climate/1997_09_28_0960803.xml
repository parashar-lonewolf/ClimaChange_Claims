        <p>They came from cyberspace, sporting ''My Favorite Martian'' haircuts and ''Star Trek''-inspired arm patches that read ''Heaven's Gate Away Team.'' The saucer-worshiping ''cybergeeks'' in the Heaven's Gate cult were ''never truly of this earth'' in the words of Andrea Peyser, a columnist with The New York Post.</p>
        <p>To many in the media, the cultists who committed suicide in an attempt to rendezvous with the U.F.O. they believed was lurking behind the Hale-Bopp comet were an object lesson in the evils of the Internet, that Black Lagoon of mind-control cults and conspiracy theories. They were made-to-order poster children for the anxiety many feel in the face of runaway technological and social change -- inscrutable, unpredictable machines that crash without warning, voice-mail hells whose endless menus never include a human being, and so forth. There was a revenge-on-the-nerds subtext to much of the Heaven's Gate coverage, a mixture of old-fashioned anti-intellectualism and a new-found resentment toward the self-styled ''digital elite'' surfing Alvin Toffler's Third Wave.</p>
        <p>But there was an element of cultural denial in the widespread insistence that the Heaven's Gaters were nerds, techies, geeks -- in short, not like the rest of us, who presumably know the difference between a ball of dirty ice hurtling through space and an alien mother ship traveling incognito. The truth, in this case, isn't so much out there as right here: the Heaven's Gate cult was a fun-house-mirror exaggeration of ourselves as a wired society.</p>
        <p>For example, Marshall Applewhite's contempt for the flesh and the mundane world is pervasive among computer scientists, hackers and others in the advance guard of digital culture. Of course, the late 20th century holds no patent on body loathing; stripped of its ''Star Trek'' jargon, Applewhite's credo sounds a lot like Gnosticism, a movement that flourished in the second century A.D. Fiercely dualistic, Gnosticism reviled the body as a ''corpse with senses'' and taught that freedom from the shackles of matter lay not in faith but in self-denial and esoteric knowledge. Despite zealous efforts to suppress it, Gnosticism left its stamp on Judeo-Christian thought.</p>
        <p>But there's no need to look to the second century for parallels to the cultists' belief that the body is just so much hardware, piloted by a mind whose destiny lies on what the Heaven's Gaters called the Evolutionary Level Above Human. In ''The Enchanted Loom: Mind in the Universe,'' Robert Jastrow speculates that, one day soon, a scientist will ''tap the contents of his mind and transfer them into the metallic lattices of a computer.'' Emancipating our minds from ''the weaknesses of the mortal flesh'' will transform us into a race of disembodied intellects, writes Jastrow, as evolutionarily suited for life in the future ''as man is designed for life on the African savanna.''</p>
        <p>Jastrow, director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, is no flake. Nor is Hans Moravec, who heads the Mobile Robot Laboratory at Carnegie-Mellon University. He goes even further, imagining the fusion of Jastrow's ''downloaded'' consciousnesses into a ''community mind'' that would spread through-out the cosmos, transforming matter into mind through some form of data conversion. In Nerdvana, all is cerebration; the ''mind'' half of the mind-body dualism will vanquish its much-detested opposite.</p>
        <p>Like Applewhite's vision of ''shedding the vehicle'' and beaming up to that great ''Enterprise'' in the sky, the science-fiction dream of ''downloading'' our minds is essentially a religious one, sheathed in technobabble -- Gnosticism with rocket fins. In Grant Fjermedal's ''Tomorrow Makers: A Brave New World of Living-Brain Machines,'' the computer scientist Charles P. Lecht asserts that ''when we do become mind. . .we will be given a boost, out of the physical, and from there into -- where else? -- the spiritual.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Lecht, Moravec and Jastrow are hardly household names. But the neo-Gnosticism that they share with Applewhite and his followers is creeping into our cultural conversation about who we are and where we're going as a high-tech society. For example, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a computer users' advocacy group, has written that cyberspace is ''the new home of Mind,'' a separate reality fashioned from ''thought itself.'' In his ''Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,'' written after Congress passed the much-reviled Communciations Decency Act of 1996, Barlow suggests that cyberspace secede from the physical world. Barlow proclaims: ''We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace.''</p>
        <p>In like mind, George Gilder, a breathless rhapsodist of technological progress, celebrates the ''overthrow of matter'' and the ''exaltation of mind'' by information technologies. He ends ''Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology'' with a homily that reconciles our national faith in science and technology with our Puritanical distrust of the flesh. ''Overthrowing matter,'' writes Gilder, ''humanity also escapes from the traps and compulsions of pleasure into a higher morality of spirit'' -- a line that would have gladdened the heart of Marshall Applewhite.</p>
        <p>The Heaven's Gate cultists are merely a cyberspace-cadet caricature of the growing alienation of our minds from our bodies in an information society where we spend ever greater portions of our lives sitting in chairs, staring at screens. Of course, the mind-body split -- the curious fact that we both have bodies and are bodies -- has always bedeviled us. But the sense that our bodies are dead meat, mere ''vehicles'' for the mind, is especially acute at a time when voice mail and E-mail are gradually supplanting face-to-face interaction and embodied experience is giving way to electronic immersion in virtual worlds.</p>
        <p>Obviously, most of us aren't going to be packing our carry-on luggage for a one-way flight to the Evolutionary Level Above Human any time soon. But as increasing numbers of people spend more and more of their working lives and leisure time on the other side of the screen, a neo-Gnostic alienation is beginning to haunt mainstream America. The relocation, in technology, of many of our mental and muscular skills -- what McLuhan called the ''self-amputation of our physical bodies''-- has made the supposedly obsolete body a source of gnawing anxiety, if not outright fear and loathing.</p>
        <p>Morbid and monstrous bodies are all the rage, from the body-bag fiction of Patricia Cornwell to the designer splatter of the movie ''Seven'' to books like ''The Hot Zone,'' a real-life thriller about a deadly virus whose subtext is the notion that the body and nature are hotbeds of disease. Our mass-media images of the Body Beautiful also bear witness to the information-age belief that mind has triumphed over matter: with the aid of Nautilus machines, plastic surgery and photographic retouching, celebrities remake the faces and physiques nature gave them in the image of a machine-tooled, post-human beauty.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, our collective dream life is filled with images of a better world than this, where the mind leaves the body behind like the booster stage of a rocket. Ours is a Brave New Age of alien saviors and guardian angels, near-death experiences and signs of the Rapture -- visions of incorporeal beings and immaterial realities that are eerily in tune with the digital Zeitgeist. The philosopher Mortimer Adler has suggested that our fascination with angels is essentially a fantasy about the lofty intellect freed from the lowly flesh. It's an insight that harmonizes nicely with the futurist Stewart Brand's belief that ''when you communicate through a computer, you communicate like an angel,'' by which he means that people who conference or chat on line communicate as ''disembodied intelligences of great intimacy.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, the Heaven's Gaters aren't unique; the information society as a whole seems to be dreaming of out-of-body experiences. But our escapist daydreams don't come cheap: visions of a cyber-rapture in which the mind scraps its broken-down ''vehicle'' and beams up from a trashed planet ''about to be recycled'' (as Applewhite put it) are a fatal seduction -- a weird mix of conspicuous consumption and divine assumption that distracts us from political action in the face of ecological crises, the unraveling of the social fabric and the widening chasm between the high-tech elite and the downsized masses. Barlow's talk of seceding from the physical world, into cyberspace, takes place amid a worrisome flight from civic life, into the electronic cottages of self-employed knowledge workers or the gated communities of an increasingly fearful upper class.</p>
        <p>Our neo-Gnostic exaltation of mind over body, cyberspace over ''meatspace'' (on-line jargon for the off-line world), dovetails a little too neatly with mounting anxieties about global warming, environmental pollutants, pesticides and growth hormones. A technology critic, Yaakov Garb, traces the roots of our ''enthusiasm for self-sufficient space colonies, disembodied intellects and cyborg futures'' to the growing recognition that our unshakable faith in progress and the profit margin has been rewarded by an increasingly lethal environment where ''toxins and radiation trickle into the most fundamental recesses of our cells and ecosystems.''</p>
        <p>If Applewhite's followers had taken a closer look in the mirror, they might have realized that the creatures they were seeking -- megabrained beings who disdain the messy reality of the material world and wander, disembodied, through the playgrounds of the mind -- were staring back at them. From the economic elite of software moguls and others who juggle information for a living to the data-entry workers in the low-wage service sector, our information economy requires brains, eyeballs and keyboard-hammering hands; the rest of the body is increasingly vestigial. Some, like the sociobiologist Richard Dawkins, believe that evolution will gradually adapt to the demands of a high-tech world that, more and more, values brain over brawn. On a Macintosh in his Oxford flat, Dawkins has a software program that morphs a human skull into the giant cranium of some far-future Homo Cyber. ''This is what our skulls might look like in thousands of years, should we be around that long,'' he told Wired magazine.</p>
        <p>Metaphorically, we already look like the brainiac on Dawkins's screen -- or, more immediately, the Whitley Strieber-esque ET on the Heaven's Gate Web site, with its bulging brain, big eyes and undersize, irrelevant body. We have met the alien, and he is us.  Mark Dery is the author of ''Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century.'' This is his first article for The Times Magazine.</p>
