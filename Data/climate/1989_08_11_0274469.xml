        <p>LEAD: Officials of eight Northeastern states have agreed to adopt strict emission controls on automobiles and light trucks in a long-term, multibillion-dollar effort to reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>Officials of eight Northeastern states have agreed to adopt strict emission controls on automobiles and light trucks in a long-term, multibillion-dollar effort to reduce air pollution.</p>
        <p>The action, which would take effect beginning with 1993 model year, would bring emission laws in New York, New Jersey and New England into line with those in California, which are significantly stricter than the Federal standards that apply everywhere else.</p>
        <p>Announcing the move yesterday, environmental officials from the eight states described the effort as the biggest assault on air pollution since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1977. But they added that the effort would remove only a third to half the pollutants needed to bring the region as a whole into compliance with Federal limits on smog and carbon monoxide.</p>
        <p>The rules would apply to new vehicles and would take effect gradually, starting with 40 percent of the 1993 models. The rules set lower emissions per mile for several pollutants and require that the anti-pollution equipment be designed to last 100,000 miles, as against the current standard of 50,000 miles. Auto Makers Disappointed</p>
        <p>Officials said it was unlikely that the rules would require any extra equipment on new cars, but added that the modifications and testing requirements would add about $150 to the cost of a new car.</p>
        <p>Officials in California said the rules there had not hampered cars' performance. At the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, Kelly M. Brown, executive engineer for fuel economy and emissions controls, said, ''Something has got to give somewhere,'' and added that sticker price and fuel economy were the likely casualties.</p>
        <p>Auto makers said they were disappointed by the Northeastern states' move and would oppose it. ''If auto manufacturers are forced to respond to a patchwork of different emissions standards throughout the nation,'' General Motors said in a statement, ''production, distribution and sales of vehicles will become increasingly complex and costly to consumers.''</p>
        <p>Environmental officials from Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York said they could impose the most important of the new rules by administrative regulation, but they added that they were seeking or would probably seek approval from their Legislatures. In New Hampshire and Rhode Island, officials said legislative approval would be needed, and in Connecticut all administrative regulations are subject to veto by a legislative committee. An official in Vermont said he did not know whether legislative approval would be needed there.</p>
        <p>''I would be very surprised to see any significant opposition when this goes to the Legislature,'' said Robert W. Varney, the Commissioner of Environmental Services in New Hampshire. ''The ozone levels and air pollution in general are a major concern in the Northeast.''</p>
        <p>The action by the Northeastern states comes as Congress considers amendments to the Clean Air Act, including a program proposed by President Bush that would be nearly as strict as the California rules in some ways.</p>
        <p>But officials of the eight states, who have been discussing this change for a year, say the Bush Administration proposal is inadequate because its emission limits are not as strict as California's and because it would not require the pollution control equipment to be as durable.</p>
        <p>''What we are saying is that if Washington refuses to, we will do what we must to protect the health of our people,'' said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, ''But it's still true it would be better for the nation if Washington would recognize its special responsibility.''</p>
        <p>But in Washington, Martha Casey, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said: ''What these states are calling for is essentially contained in the President's clean-air proposal. We believe emissions reductions are needed not only in the Northeast but nationwide; therefore we encourage quick Congressional action on the President's proposal.'' Pollution From Midwest</p>
        <p>The dispute between the Northeastern states and the Administration is not limited to what standards should prevail in the Northeast. Officials in New York, New Jersey and New England have argued for years that about 40 percent of their pollution is blown in on the wind, largely from the Midwest, and that the E.P.A. should do more to cut emissions from cars, factories and power plants there.</p>
        <p>''Even if we stopped economic activity in New York City, we would not achieve clean air,'' said Thomas C. Jorling, New York State's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>The rules proposed for the Northeastern states would follow exactly California's emission control regulations. Under the Clean Air Act of 1977, only California has the right to set its own standards for cars and light trucks. Other states were given the option of adopting California's system or following the national one.</p>
        <p>The California rules set lower emissions standards for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen than the Federal Government does, and require that the anti-pollution devices be designed to function for a longer period: 100,000 miles for the pre-production models tested by the state government, and 75,000 miles for the cars in customers' hands.</p>
        <p>The Federal standard is 50,000 miles. Officials say the higher mileage standard is important because most pollution comes from old cars. Inspections Are Required</p>
        <p>California also requires testing of the cars as they come off the assembly line and after several years of service, and the state can order recalls of whole classes of vehicles if their emission rates rise as they age.</p>
        <p>The additional cost in California is $100 a car, which is listed on the price sticker. Most of that pays for certification testing by the state.</p>
        <p>Of the 10.5 million new cars registered in this country in 1988, 1.9 million, or 18.5 percent, were in the eight Northeastern states. California had another 1.2 million, or 11.5 percent. No state has followed California's example until now, and many say the auto makers would not go to the trouble to meet the standards for a small market.</p>
        <p>''We've blown that argument out of the water,'' said John De Villars, the Secretary of the Environment in Massachusetts. He said other states with air problems are likely to follow the Northeast's lead. Emissions and Smog</p>
        <p>Auto makers said the California standards do not focus on the pollutants most important to the Northeast. The California standard sets lower limits on hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, which produce ground-level ozone, or smog, when baked in the sun. But under certain circumstances, if there is a great deal of nitrogen oxide, the gas can inhibit the formation of smog. ''Some cities would generate ozone faster under this proposal,'' said Mr. Brown, the Ford engineer. ''At best, they would break even.''</p>
        <p>But officials in the Northeast say that while this may be true in the cities, it is not the case in rural areas. In addition, said Michael Bradley, executive director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, nitrogen oxide contributes to acid rain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's group, made up of environmental officials from the eight states, organized the yearlong effort, The environmental commissioners say the eight states have a history of successful cooperation; two years ago the commissioners jointly resolved to impose strict controls on the content of gasoline sold within their borders in order to cut down smog. Despite opposition by the oil industry and resistance from the Environmental Protection Agency, those regulations took effect throughout the region this spring.</p>
        <p>The reductions proposed for the Northeast would be slow, gaining ground only as old cars are replaced by new ones. But a study done for Mr. Bradley's organization by Sierra Research of Sacramento, Calif., predicted that by 2010, carbon monoxide levels would be 39 percent lower, nitrogen oxides 27 percent lower and hydrocarbons 16 percent lower than they would be if the current Federal standard remained in effect. $600 Per Ton of Pollutants With 1.9 million cars sold last year in the eight-state area, the total cost to consumers would run into hundreds of millions of dollars each year. But Mr. Bradley and others said that for nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, the cost would be about $600 per ton removed. The eight states have forced factories to reduce emissions of those pollutants at costs of up to $5,000 per ton.</p>
        <p>In all American cars, the three pollutants can be controlled by reactions in the catalytic converter. All cars use a sensor in the tailpipe to measure the oxygen content of the exhaust. Working through a computer chip, the sensor then sends messages back to the fuel injection system (which has replaced the carburetor in most new cars) to vary the fuel-air mixture and improve combustion.</p>
        <p>In California, the microchip is programmed slightly differently, to cut pollution. In addition, the gears in some cars sold in California are designed so the engine will not work as hard.</p>
