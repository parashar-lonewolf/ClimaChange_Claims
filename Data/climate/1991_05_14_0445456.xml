        <p>HUNDREDS of rockets roar to life every year, some trailing clouds of toxic exhaust that chew up the life-protecting ozone shield high in the atmosphere. How much ozone is destroyed in this fashion is unknown, and may be small compared with indstrial pollution. But it is large enough to have worried some scientific and public-interest groups.</p>
        <p>For their part, rocket manufacturers and users contend that the problem is insignificant and that the cost of correcting it would far outweigh the possible benefits.</p>
        <p>The ozone is harmed by solid-fuel rockets, whose exhausts often contain large amounts of hydrochloric acid. Chlorine, when released from the acid, rapidly breaks down ozone molecules, letting more of the sun's ultraviolet light penetrate the atmosphere and raising the risk of skin cancer. In contrast, the exhaust from liquid-fuel rockets is typically composed of water and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>No one knows how many solid-fuel rockets are fired each year, or how many fly high enough to destroy ozone. The United States Space Command, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., which keeps tabs on global rocket launchings of all types, estimates that 500 to 600 rockets were fired every year during the 1980's, with the number peaking in 1989 at 1,500. These firings ranged from space shuttles and large American rockets to relatively small Scud missiles, which are liquid fueled.</p>
        <p>Despite the unknowns, some scientists have concluded that the ozone damage, though now perhaps slight, is worrisome because of the trend to increasing use of solid-fuel rockets around the world. In March 1990, a panel of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the Federal Government, called for a switch to liquid propellants, saying this would eliminate rocket-born "pollution of the atmosphere."</p>
        <p>In June 1990, the signatories to the Montreal Protocol, which seeks to ban substances that deplete ozone, directed the group's scientific panel to assess damage from rockets. That report is due in 1992.  Some See Hysteria</p>
        <p>"It's appropriate to begin a transition now to cleaner propellants," said Steven Aftergood, a specialist on ozone depletion with the Federation of American Scientists, a private group based in Washington. "There's enough evidence of the danger."</p>
        <p>But rocket makers and users disagree. "We're a very small, insignificant part of the problem," said Allan J. McDonald, vice president for space operations of the Thiokol Corporation in Brigham City, Utah, which makes solid-fuel rockets. Among the general public, he added, "there's an overreaction leading toward hysteria."</p>
        <p>Switching to new fuels, Mr. McDonald said, would cost billions. "It would be a waste," he said. "We ought to spend that money cleaning up the CFC problem." CFC's, or chlorofluorocarbons, are industrial chemicals that constitute the chief cause of ozone destruction.</p>
        <p>The main focus of the rocket debate is the shuttle, whose 149-foot twin boosters are the largest solid-fuel rockets in the world. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration estimates that each shuttle flight injects some 75 tons of chlorine into the stratosphere, the ozone-rich layer a dozen or so miles above the earth.</p>
        <p>A different type of large booster helps power the Titan 4, this country's largest unmanned rocket. Its twin boosters are 113 feet tall.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael J. Prather, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute in New York City, and his colleagues have calculated that the lofting of nine shuttles and six Titan 4's every year would add a mere 0.3 percent to the annual burden of stratospheric chlorine, which in turn would destroy far less than 1 percent of the ozone there.</p>
        <p>"As a point source of pollution, the shuttle is clearly large," Dr. Prather said in an interview. "But compared to any other industry -- refrigeration, foam blowing, solvents -- it's small."  Shuttle's Benefits Cited</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, some groups have attacked the shuttle as a serious environmental hazard, and the most caustic criticism has come from the Soviets. Aleksandr I. Dunayev, head of the Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, was quoted in a 1989 Russian publication, Literaturnaya Gazeta, as saying, "About 300 launches of the shuttle each year would be a catastrophe and the ozone would be completely destroyed."</p>
        <p>Western experts note that the Soviets are struggling to market their own rockets, which use liquid fuel more frequently than do those in the West.</p>
        <p>An American group known as the Military Toxics Network, based in Seattle, says in a report entitled "No Free Launch" that each firing of the American shuttle or Titan 4 destroys more ozone "than the annual ground-level emissions of chlorofluorocarbons from most individual industrial plants."</p>
        <p>Dr. Prather of NASA agreed, but said the shuttle's minor environmental costs had to be weighed against its great scientific benefits. For instance, in September the shuttle Discovery is to loft the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, a 7-ton, 32-foot spacecraft that will help scientists better fathom global climate shifts and ozone destruction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists cautioned that the environmental "costs" of global rocketry were far from clear because of uncertainty over the actual number of solid-fuel rockets fired every year and doubts over the chemistry of ozone destruction. He noted that the Environmental Protection Agency recently reported that the measured ozone loss at the latitudes of the United States was 4.5 to 5 percent in the last decade, more than twice what scientists had previously thought.</p>
        <p>"That means the models are wrong," Mr. Aftergood said. "A certain amount of humility is warranted."</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald of Thiokol said that about a dozen new solid-rocket fuels were under investigation in the industry but that each had drawbacks. Some were less powerful, some dangerously explosive and some difficult to handle. "We have alternatives," he said, "but the amount of money to develop them isn't worth the impact it's going to have."</p>
        <p>Mr. Aftergood disagreed, saying the cleanliness of fuels "ought to be an important factor in the selection of the next generation of rockets," adding, "It's just a matter of being environmentally responsible."</p>
