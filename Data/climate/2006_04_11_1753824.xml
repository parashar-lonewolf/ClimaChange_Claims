        <p>On a rare night for New York Democrats, former President Bill Clinton and his vice president, Al Gore, took the stage at a party fund-raiser -- albeit separately -- and painted, in their own distinct ways, political portraits of the country today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton delighted the audience of about 500 last night with one of his favorite stories, about a Pentecostal minister who ''confessed'' to him -- ''the world's greatest sinner,'' as Mr. Clinton called himself -- that he voted for President Bush partly out of a belief that Democrats were not connecting with him on a gut level.</p>
        <p>Democrats make ''a terrible mistake,'' Mr. Clinton said, if they do not think of themselves as ''values voters,'' a term that some political analysts use for voters who support candidates based on a sense of shared moral or religious convictions.</p>
        <p>''Every one of you is a values voter -- it you weren't a values voter, we'd be at the Republican dinner tonight,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''You are here because you're values voters, or you would not be here if all you could see was your narrow self-interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that Democrats showed their values by helping the poor, the sick and the elderly, and he said the party could take some comfort that a group of Christian evangelicals had recently raised concerns about climate change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, said he had come to the event straight from a movie theater that was showing a new film, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' about his efforts to combat global warming. Citing research by a NASA expert, Mr. Gore offered a grim outlook for the world if current environmental policy did not change.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate in 2000, avoided harshly criticizing Bush administration policies, saying that Democrats ''need to bring the Republicans along with us'' on clean-energy ideas he extolled, such as hybrid cars.</p>
        <p>The fund-raiser, at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Manhattan, which took in $1.3 million, honored Maureen White, who is stepping down after five years as finance chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Clinton left 20 minutes before Mr. Gore arrived, the night felt a bit like a unity event, for the two do not attend many of the same public functions. Mr. Clinton, among others, also praised Ms. White's husband, Steve Rattner, an investment banker who was among the prominent Democratic donors who supported the re-election campaign last year of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton praised Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, for pressing ahead to campaign in every state, including those where voters reliably support Republicans. Some Democrats have criticized Mr. Dean's strategy calling it a waste of time and money.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton said thanked Mr. Dean and said, ''Democrats should campaign everywhere with everybody.'' And Mr. Gore called him ''the ideal Democratic party chair.''</p>
