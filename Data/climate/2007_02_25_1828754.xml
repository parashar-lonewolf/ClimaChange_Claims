        <p>Is there any truly compelling reason not to conduct a thorough, independent safety inspection of the Indian Point nuclear plant?</p>
        <p>It's hard to think of one.</p>
        <p>The plant is old. Despite what the rosy ads insist, its safety, security and vitality are matters of intense debate. The plant's owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, wants to renew the licenses for its two reactors, which expire in 2013 and 2015. If past problems are any indication, that means we might be hearing about siren failures, tritium and strontium leaks, groundwater contamination, employee intimidation, inadequate evacuation plans and jitters about radioactive-waste storage, sabotage and terrorist attacks until at least 2035.</p>
        <p>A chorus of local lawmakers, from members of Congress to the county legislatures in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, has stepped up efforts to get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct what is known as an Independent Safety Assessment at Indian Point. That is a ramped-up version of normal inspection procedures, and a highly sought-after goal of those who want the plant to undergo the most rigorous examination possible.</p>
        <p>Legislation to require the assessment has been introduced in both houses of the newly Democratic Congress. The sponsor in the Senate is Hillary Clinton, who at about this time last year was prematurely boasting of her success in winning a personal commitment from the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct the Independent Safety Assessment, a commitment that later evaporated, if it ever existed at all.</p>
        <p>The nuclear agency just doesn't want to do it. It argues that existing methods of oversight are plenty, and that the public should trust it to know what is best. Entergy has gone along with what the federal agency says. But if Entergy were smart, it would call its critics' bluff and embrace the notion of a long, involved, gold-standard safety inspection. It would throw open its domes to outside scrutiny and then trumpet its clean bill of health to all the world. Such a move would wax and polish the company's reputation to gleaming, console shareholders and the general public, and quite possibly shut some critics up.</p>
        <p>There is little indication that Indian Point, at this moment, is unsafe or an immediate menace to the region. There is no proof that it is as horribly run as its critics contend, and there is surely no clear way to justify quickly pulling the plug on all the energy it provides. All the same, we are not comfortable in letting the plant's future rest entirely on the word of Entergy, the nuclear industry and Bush administration regulators.</p>
        <p>While we agree with one argument they make -- that nuclear power should remain part of the nation's energy grid, particularly in an era of global warming -- it is clear that pro-nuclear arguments are colored by very large doses of economic self-interest. The nuclear lobby's supposedly eco-friendly dream is for hundreds of new reactors to pop up across the continent like dandelions in a clean, carbon-free world. (The nation would need that many to wean itself from coal and natural gas.)</p>
        <p>That argument plays into the industry's desire for self-preservation and its assertive push to keep existing nuclear plants operating. Yet local concerns simply must be taken into account. As expressed in the nearly unanimous voices of their elected representatives, many people in the densely populated region around this badly situated nuclear plant badly want a thorough, independent review of safety at Indian Point. They want to put the debate to rest, and get on to worrying about other things.</p>
        <p>It is hard to imagine why a company that runs such a safe, secure and vital nuclear plant wouldn't want that, too.</p>
