        <p>LEAD: President Reagan declared tonight that he would veto any tax increase that Congress might pass, and he warned lawmakers not to relax the statutory goals for reducing the Federal deficit.</p>
        <p>President Reagan declared tonight that he would veto any tax increase that Congress might pass, and he warned lawmakers not to relax the statutory goals for reducing the Federal deficit.</p>
        <p>At a nationally broadcast news conference dominated by questions about the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Reagan sought to quash Congressional interest in higher taxes. The Speaker of the House, Jim Wright, has advocated a tax increase, saying, ''We need additional revenues to meet the statutory deficit targets.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reagan said tonight: ''My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid. It's time Congress cut the Federal budget and let the family budget alone.''</p>
        <p>In addition, he said Congress must not ''back away from our commitment'' to the 1985 budget-balancing law, which calls for the deficit to be reduced in stages and eventually eliminated. 'Fought the Good Fight'</p>
        <p>The law, whose sponsors were Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, Republicans, and Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, a Democrat, sets limits on the deficit: $108 billion in the current fiscal year, $72 billion next year, $36 billion in the fiscal year 1989, and zero in 1990.</p>
        <p>''For the last six years,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''we've fought the good fight to get Government spending under control, and it hasn't been easy. And as we've begun to rein in Federal spending, we've been able to bring taxes down and subdue the monster of inflation.</p>
        <p>''Our combined program of tax cuts, deregulation and spending cuts is working - in fact, is working miracles,'' he said. ''But now, even before Congress has drawn up their budget, some there are saying that they want to back away from our commitment to Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.''</p>
        <p>Some are even saying they want to raise taxes, he noted. 'That Isn't Going to Happen'</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan said: ''I'm sorry, but that just isn't going to happen. The American people worked long and hard to cut tax rates and win tax reform.''</p>
        <p>He said that ''the budget process at the Federal level is unworkable, and this yearly deficit-feeding process must stop.''</p>
        <p>''We must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''In the meantime, our elected representatives cannot break their promise to the American people and back away from the commitment to the deficit reduction goals of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan was also asked what the Administration was doing to reduce the problem of acid rain, which has become one of the biggest irritants in relations between the United States and Canada. He said the two countries had a joint commission working on the problem.</p>
        <p>But he said: ''We have found out that the further we've gone, the more complex the issue of the source of acid rain becomes. So what we've been trying to do is avoid going down some avenue that would disappoint us and we wouldn't really solve the problem, but we would have wasted our resources.''</p>
        <p>''We've made some progress'' in identifying possible solutions to the problem, of industrial pollutants from industrial smokestacks falling in the form of toxic particles, Mr. Reagan said.</p>
        <p>''There are others probably yet to come,'' he said. ''We're still investigating this.''</p>
        <p>He added that, at the moment, the discussions were focused on the private sector, but that ultimately such Government agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency would be more actively involved.</p>
        <p>Asked to comment on the wide criticism of his management style, Mr. Reagan called it a good policy. ''Most people in business think it's a proper management style,'' he said. ''You get the best people you can to do the job and then you don't lean over their shoulder. You set the policy - and I set the policy - and then you implement it.'' He Awaits the Answers</p>
        <p>He said he would not comment on the work of Rear Adm. John M. Poindexter, his former national security adviser, but would await the final reports of investigators. He said that ''I more than anybody'' want to know what the investgations will conclude.</p>
        <p>Asked his views on Energy Secretary John S. Herrington's study of American dependence on foreign oil, Mr. Reagan replied that it was a ''problem we are studying'' and that he was expecting reports ''momentarily.'' He added that, in response, the Administration has increased the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but ''we have to do more than that.'' He said he was again asking Congress for ''more acts'' to improve the situation, such as eliminating the ''windfall'' profits tax and completing the deregulation of natural gas. So far, however, Congress has not responded, he said.</p>
        <p>Questioned in a follow-up query about the sharp decline last year in United States oil production, Mr. Reagan said there could be a serious problem ''if we were faced with a crisis.'' American oil producers, he noted, would not produce at high enough levels if the world oil price did not make it profitable.</p>
