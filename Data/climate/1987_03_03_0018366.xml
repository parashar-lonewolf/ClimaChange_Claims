        <p>Federal agencies don't often radically reexamine their priorities. All the more credit to Lee Thomas, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, for asking how well his agency's efforts correspond with the real threats to health and environment. An E.P.A. report offers disturbing answers.</p>
        <p>Consider radon, the radioactive gas that seeps into homes in places like Pennsylvania's Reading Prong. Radon poses a high risk of lung cancer yet receives relatively little attention. Other problems of high risk and low effort, the agency's reviewers note, include destruction of the ozone layer by refrigerant chemicals that waft up to the stratosphere; the ozone layer absorbs and screens out ultraviolet light, which otherwise would induce skin cancer. Also neglected is the ''greenhouse effect,'' a feared warming of the atmosphere caused by carbon dioxide from coal combustion and burning forests. The warming could melt the Antarctic icecap, raise the sea level and flood coastal cities.</p>
        <p>The cleanup of abandoned hazardous chemical dumps, meanwhile, poses relatively low risk to the public yet commands high levels of E.P.A.'s time and money. Why the mismatch? E.P.A.'s priorities are set by Congress and, not surprisingly, correspond to public concern. Opinion polls list hazardous waste dumps as the public's leading worry, while the greenhouse effect ranks last.</p>
        <p>That's understandable: most people find a stench in the backyard to be more pressing than speculation that the ice sheets may start to melt away in a century or so. Yet Mr. Thomas makes eminent sense when he notes that resources should be matched to true risk as well as to public perceptions. The new report deserves Congress's attention as it sets E.P.A.'s future goals.</p>
