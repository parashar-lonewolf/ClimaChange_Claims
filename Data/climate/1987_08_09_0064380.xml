        <p>LEAD: ON shrinking beaches, the crowds are thicker than they used to be.

        <p>ON shrinking beaches, the crowds are thicker than they used to be. More than half of America's population lives within 50 miles of the ocean or Great Lakes, and that proportion is rising quickly. And despite erosion, pollution and proliferating condos, each year more people go to the beach.</p>
        <p>That can be difficult, however. In most coastal states the public owns the beach from the water's edge to the high-tide mark, but getting there, or staking out a piece of dry sand, is another matter. To those on the inside looking out, whoever owns the beachfront owns the ocean. Property owners and municipalities, unsettled by the summer crowds, generally budge only when they have to. And, increasingly, to provide facilities for outsiders, locally run beaches charge admission fees.</p>
        <p>As basic principles of private property and public trust clash, most states are favoring the public. Florida has acquired 22 miles of sandy beachfront since 1982, and has set aside $5.5 million to acquire paths to the water through private property. In New Jersey, municipal beaches can no longer turn away nonresidents. California's Coastal Commission, although it was brushed back recently by the Supreme Court, has opened rights of way to many beaches near private homes.</p>
        <p>All efforts are frustrated by the erosion of almost every mile of coastline, from the narrowing barrier islands of the Atlantic to Louisiana, which is losing 100 acres a day, to California, where miles of bluff have crumbled into the ocean. The process, a consequence of rising sea levels, is hastened by overdevelopment.</p>
        <p>But the tide of people is rising, too. Five state beaches in Massachusetts had 970,000 visitors in 1976, 2.7 million in 1986. In that period attendance at Florida state parks, most of them on the beach, rose about 40 percent and would have been higher if the parks did not turn away visitors. Connecticut state beaches have also been turning people away this year.</p>
        <p>Making more room for the crowds makes economic and political sense for most states. The following reports describe what several of them are doing.  PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE INTERESTS  On Jersey's Shore, Access Has Its Price</p>
        <p>FOR people who don't live in one of New Jersey's oceanfront towns, getting on to the beach these days is more difficult and expensive than ever.</p>
        <p>In recent years, state officials say, coastal municipalities have imposed regulations and beach fees with the unacknowledged intention of excluding out-of-towners. Parking is often remote or nonexistent, toilets and changing rooms scarce. Daily fees have reached $8 a person in some places. According to a recent report by the state's Public Advocate, beach fees in New Jersey are the highest in the nation, and procedures for nonresidents to buy inexpensive season passes are complicated and restrictive.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has some state beaches, and about 10 percent of the coast is privately owned, but most of the remainder is the domain of more than two dozen municipalities.</p>
        <p>New Jersey officials have been fighting a piecemeal battle against restrictive municipal policies since the 1970's, when a series of court decisions began to extend the visitor's toehold at the ocean's mean high-water mark. Rule by Rule</p>
        <p>First to fall were local laws reserving municipal beaches to residents. Then rules relegating outsiders to certain portions of the beaches were struck down, followed by those permitting higher fees for nonresidents than for residents. As a result, New Jersey's beaches generally have more liberal access policies than those in New York and Connecticut, though they remain more restrictive than those on the West and Gulf Coasts.</p>
        <p>Still, the battle continues. Several legislators have introduced a Fair Beaches Act, requiring state approval of local beach fees. And the Public Advocate's Office is suing five municipalities that it says charge excessive daily fees.</p>
        <p>''At the very least, beach fees have to relate to actual costs,'' said Richard Shapiro, the Public Advocate. ''But also, even if the costs are high, the beach fees still must be reasonable, to keep facilities accessible to the public.''</p>
        <p>Officials of the towns being sued - Sea Girt, Belmar, Bay Head, Avon and Spring Lake - defend their fee-setting formulas.</p>
        <p>''What it comes down to is, is Shapiro willing to accept our costs as chargeable beach costs?'' asked Fred McKnight, president of the Sea Girt Borough Council.</p>
        <p>Sea Girt charges $7 a person for a weekend beach badge, which Mr. McKnight said covers direct costs for lifeguards and litter pickup, as well as a portion of the borough's police and insurance expenses. ''These are expenses that we have because our beach is there,'' he asserted. ''I see nothing wrong with having the people who use the beach help pay to maintain it.''</p>
        <p>As for keeping ''inlanders'' out, Mr. McKnight said the borough had no such intent. ''Our beaches are totally open,'' he said. ''Anyone can come down and buy a badge and go on the beach. They don't even have to pay for parking.'' A decade ago, beach fees were almost unheard of. But since then, the perceived deterioration of such New York beaches as Coney Island has pushed more city dwellers to the Jersey Shore, while the rapid growth of the Washington area has driven that area's vacationers farther north. Some resort communities, such as Atlantic City, have welcomed the influx. In residential towns, however, homeowner sentiment has cut the other way. Residents of Sea Girt and Belmar, for example, outvoted local tourist businesses to force midnight bar closings to discourage late-night visitors.</p>
        <p>The controversy is also related to the changing character of the shore communties themselves. Commuters to New York and Philadelphia began some years ago to displace the old Jersey Shore families whose livelihoods depended on tourists.</p>
        <p>''The old families were used to the day trippers,'' the beach commissioner of one North Jersey shoreline community said privately. ''Then the commuters started moving in. They paid tremendous prices to be near the ocean, and now they see all these strangers running all over the beach. They say, 'What's going on? We paid for those beaches.' ''</p>
        <p>Another beach commissioner, Robert Furlong of Sea Bright, said, ''You've got a real circle-the-wagons reaction from people where their beaches are involved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Furlong and the state recently worked out an agreement that could provide the basis for others. In exchange for state help in pumping sand back onto Sea Bright's badly washed-out beaches, the town agreed to limit fees to $2 and to provide public bathing facilities.</p>
        <p>In the study of beach access, Mr. Shapiro urged the State Legislature to mandate uniform beach fees, ideally around $2 a person - a recommendation that was incorporated in the proposed Fair Beaches Act. Ultimately, Mr. Shapiro wrote, Trenton should consider putting all of the shore under state control.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKnight of Sea Girt agreed. ''If the borough can't recover its costs,'' he said, ''the alternative would be for the state to take over.''  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
