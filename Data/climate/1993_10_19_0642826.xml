        <p>The Clinton Administration, in a new plan to reduce the waste gases that threaten to warm the global climate, has decided to avoid most mandatory controls in favor of voluntary goals and incentives, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups attacked the plan, whose outline had been known for a week and which is expected to be presented by President Clinton and Vice President Gore at the White House on Tuesday. They said the plan favored industry groups worried about the costs of controlling carbon dioxide and other polluting gases that can trap heat within the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>But Administration officials said they had found that they could meet their pollution targets without relying on the most divisive options they had been considering, like higher fuel efficiency standards for cars.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary said in an interview that the Administration had vigorously debated adopting more stringent directives. But she said that many electric utilities, for example, had already pledged to reduce their own emissions unilaterally and that the Administration had decided that this approach "made the most sense, because it is the most cost effective."</p>
        <p>She and other officials said some mandatory measures would be included in the plan. For example, by the end of this year, the Environmental Protection Agency will propose strict new standards under the Clean Air Act calling on municipal landfills to remove organic waste that releases methane, a greenhouse gas, when it decomposes. The rule will account for reductions of up to five million tons in emissions by the year 2000, a draft of the plan estimates.</p>
        <p>Another five million tons of emissions might be eliminated by increasing the efficiency standards on many household appliances.</p>
        <p>In an effort to avoid pollution-induced global warming, popularly known as the greenhouse effect, President Clinton has promised to take steps that by the year 2000 would reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by about 110 million tons, to the 1.5 billion tons that were emitted in 1990. Emissions would be reduced further in later years.</p>
        <p>The pledge would meet American obligations under an international treaty on global warming adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last year. The promise was a significant departure from the policy of the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>The Administration said it would review progress every two years, but some environmental groups were skeptical.</p>
        <p>"When it comes to cutting pollution, voluntary measures don't cut it," said Dan Becker, who works on climate change issues at the Sierra Club. "We don't believe that this plan will necessarily achieve the President's laudable goals." Moderates Also Skeptical</p>
        <p>The Environmental Defense Fund, which has a reputation for taking moderate positions and favoring market-based approaches to pollution control, also responded skeptically, saying the plan did not provide powerful incentives or contain backup measures that could be imposed if voluntary efforts prove inadequate.</p>
        <p>"What they are doing here is putting the country's global climate policy out on a tightrope," said Joseph Goffman, a senior lawyer for the group. "The rope is taut and the poles are stable, but there is not really a safety net underneath it."</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they expected to spend at least $200 million a year to encourage energy-saving technologies and the use of energy sources that give off relatively little carbon dioxide, like natural gas and hydroelectric power.</p>
        <p>Secretary O'Leary and other officials said that the Administration supports the goal of producing more efficient cars, and has not ruled out using fuel efficiency standards as a tool if absolutely necessary. But the Administration is hoping instead to use a new cooperative technology program with the big auto makers to build vastly more efficient cars early in the next century.</p>
