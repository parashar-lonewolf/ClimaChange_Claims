        <p>KPMG RULING In a case involving KPMG, a federal judge ruled that a tactic used by prosecutors to crack down on corporate corruption violated the constitutional rights of employees, a decision that may change the way the government pursues white-collar cases. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>ANGER OVER UNIVISION OUTCOME A consortium of private equity firms won an auction for Univision with a $12.3 billion bid, prompting a rival suitor, Grupo Televisa of Mexico, to contend that it had been deliberately shunned in favor of a lesser bid. What Televisa plans to do next is unclear, but inside the company the anger is boiling. [C1.]</p>
        <p>DOCTORS AND CHARITIES Around the country, doctors in private practice have set up tax-exempt charities into which drug companies and medical device makers are, with little fanfare, pouring donations -- money that adds up to millions of dollars a year. And some medical experts see that as a big problem. [A1.]</p>
        <p>ZERO PERCENT FROM G.M. General Motors will offer zero percent financing on most 2006 models over the Independence Day weekend. [C6.]</p>
        <p>NEW WELFARE RULES The Bush administration plans to issue rules that will require states to move much larger numbers of poor people from welfare to work. [A14.]</p>
        <p>TREASURY NOMINEE TESTIFIES Henry M. Paulson Jr., President Bush's nominee for Treasury secretary, cautiously avoided any hints yesterday about the administration's economic priorities for the remainder of Mr. Bush's term. [C3.]</p>
        <p>NO HARVARD DONATION Lawrence J. Ellison, chief executive of the Oracle Corporation and one of the world's wealthiest people, has decided not to donate $115 million to Harvard as he announced he would last year, the company confirmed. [C5.]</p>
        <p>PRESSURE ON JAPAN BANK Toshihiko Fukui, the governor of the Bank of Japan, is under mounting pressure to resign after revealing that he invested in a stock fund run by an executive who was later indicted for insider trading. The scandal has threatened the reputation of the bank. [C3.]</p>
        <p>STOCKS SLUMP The Dow dropped 120.54 points, to 10,924.74, on fears about interest rates. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.36 points, to 1,239.20, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 33.42 points, to 2,100.25. [C13.]</p>
        <p>GAME MAKER'S WOES The video game publisher Take-Two Interactive, which surprised investors by disclosing it had received criminal grand jury subpoenas inquiring into a range of its business practices, has shown signs since early this year that it continues to struggle with problems that have plagued it since 2001. [C7.]</p>
        <p>NORTEL PLANS TO CUT JOBS As part of a continuing struggle to restore its financial health, Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications equipment and software company, announced that it would cut a net 1,100 jobs while creating 800 jobs, mainly at new, lower cost-facilities in Mexico and Turkey. [C6.]</p>
        <p>CO-OP PRICE DISCLOSURE The prices paid for co-op apartments in New York City could be made public for the first time under a bill passed last week by the state Legislature. [B1.]</p>
        <p>UNIONIZING CHILD CARE WORKERS The New York Legislature is poised to override Gov. George E. Pataki's veto and give 52,000 home child-care providers, now independent contractors, the right to organize. [B1.]</p>
        <p>HONDA PLANT IN INDIANA Indiana has apparently emerged as the winner in the race to land Honda's newest plant in North America. [C6.]</p>
        <p>MINICAR FOR THE U.S. DaimlerChrysler, which shelved an earlier plan to bring its Smart minicar brand to the United States, plans to announce that it will introduce the tiny two-seat vehicle to the American market early in 2008, according to executives at the company. Dieter Zetsche, left, the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, had considered selling the Smart brand before settling for yet another overhaul last March. [C1.]</p>
        <p>NETWORK AD FORECAST Advance advertising sales for the fall television season are likely to be down for a second year in a row, reflecting the impact of new media outlets. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]</p>
