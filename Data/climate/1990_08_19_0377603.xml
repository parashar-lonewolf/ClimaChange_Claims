        <p>LEAD: For oil companies, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has created a host of uncertainties about prices and supplies. But there is no question that the Mideast crisis, however it is resolved, has the potential to reshape the industry.</p>
        <p>For oil companies, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has created a host of uncertainties about prices and supplies. But there is no question that the Mideast crisis, however it is resolved, has the potential to reshape the industry.</p>
        <p>Not since the embargoes and sharp oil-price increases of the 1970's have oil companies faced the prospect of coping with a new, if as-yet-undefined, order among their major crude suppliers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And not in a decade or more has the industry had as promising an opportunity to influence critical decisions on how and where the United States will meet its energy needs in coming decades and to reverse what it considers excessive sensitivity to environmental issues.</p>
        <p>''There is the potential for a changed environment for the industry, more so than at any time in the past 10 years,'' said Bernard J. Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''The issues have now captured the attention of everyone in Washington and of the man on the street.''</p>
        <p>For the first time in more than a decade, Congress and the Administration are likely to focus seriously on whether the United States has endangered its own security by becoming overly reliant on foreign oil - the country imported half of its oil needs in the first half of this year, a record - and on whether the industry should be provided with financial incentives to reverse a decline in domestic exploration and production.</p>
        <p>After years of seeing new domestic drilling projects thwarted by environmental concerns, and despite a public image badly damaged by recent oil spills, the industry could get a renewed and possibly more receptive hearing for its argument that a fear of accidents should not cripple the nation's ability to supply more of its own energy.</p>
        <p>''The national security aspects of oil had been completely subordinated in recent years to the environmental concerns,'' said John H. Lichtblau, head of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ''Now you have the emphasis coming back to the security aspects. If there is a conflict between the two, it may no longer be automatically resolved in favor of the environmentalists.''</p>
        <p>Investing the Profits</p>
        <p>Assuming that crude oil prices remain relatively high, the crisis will have the immediate effect of generating more profits for many oil companies, although lower earnings from refining operations could hold down their gains. Companies will have to decide how much of those profits to invest in new exploration and production - and where that investment should go. The Chevron Corporation, for one, decided earlier this month to spend an additional $100 million this year to produce more oil in existing domestic fields. Others are seeking new places to drill abroad, including the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Analysts and industry executives say some companies might respond by putting more emphasis on their production and marketing of natural gas, which although plentiful and inexpensive relative to crude oil is still the poor relation of the industry. Other companies might make more extensive commitments to developing alternative-fuel businesses. None seem likely to diversify outside of the energy field. The momentum for change could evaporate if the crisis is resolved quickly. And barring widespread shortages or dramatically higher prices, the Federal policy formulation process is likely to move slowly. Congress, which virtually ignored energy policy issues while oil flowed abundantly and relatively inexpensively over the past decade, has an understandable aversion to adopting any measures to help the industry at a time of rising prices.</p>
        <p>Oil company rhetoric notwithstanding, policy changes in Washington to encourage more domestic production could never eliminate the nation's need for foreign oil. New domestic production is unlikely to offset the decline in output from sites that are slowly being pumped dry. At the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska, for example, production is expected to decline from 1.3 million barrels a day to 500,000 in 10 years. In any case, the major companies continue to see more potential for new finds abroad.</p>
        <p>''I don't care how much you drill in this country, you will never be able to replace imports with domestic sources,'' said Robert K. Watson, a New York-based energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental activist group.</p>
        <p>Still, there are some indications that the pendulum is beginning to swing back in favor of whatever domestic sources can be found. Just a few days after the invasion of Kuwait, the Senate approved an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill requiring that the President take steps to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Among the steps required by the amendment, offered by Senator Frank Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, would be opening to exploration and production Federal lands that have previously been off limits, including the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. (See box.) Avoiding Hard Choices The legislation, which still faces a long battle before it could become law, also calls for oil import fees, tax and other incentives for domestic production and further conservation efforts. The actions, virtually all of which are supported by oil companies, would be required whenever imports exceeded 50 percent of the nation's oil needs.</p>
        <p>''We are now relying on military force rather than energy policy for our energy security,'' Senator Murkowski said. ''Americans find it unacceptable to put American lives at risk because we have not made the hard choices to formulate a policy.''</p>
        <p>After years of standing on the sideline, the Federal Government also decided last week to involve itself in a long-running environmental dispute over when the industry will be able to start pumping oil from a large field off the central California coast.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department started trying to mediate the battle between Chevron, which leads an industry consortium, and local residents, who have held up production by pressuring state officials to deny the oil companies permits to transport the oil by tanker to refineries in Los Angeles. The project could eventually produce 100,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 15 percent of the amount the United States had been receiving from Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
        <p>The industry's foes have by no means disappeared. Environmentalists continue to make forceful arguments against giving any breaks to oil companies, citing the damage that can be done by a single accident like the Exxon Valdez spill last year and the industry's spotty record of concern for the coastal and wilderness areas where most potential new oil finds are located.</p>
        <p>Other critics say the answer to the nation's energy problems lies not with propping up the oil industry but in promoting alternative sources, including everything from nuclear power and natural gas to solar power, or in doing more to promote conservation and fuel efficiency.</p>
        <p>''Energy efficiency is America's largest and least expensive energy resource, and we need to do more to tap it,'' said Mr. Watson of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The future is in using energy efficiently and getting it from alternative sources. Any additional drilling in environmentally sensitive areas would be a drop in the bucket in terms of the total amount of energy consumed in the United States.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the expressions of outrage among consumers and politicians earlier this month over the gasoline-price increases that followed so quickly on the heels of Saddam Hussein's grab for Kuwait were a reminder that Big Oil has never had many friends.</p>
        <p>Several companies, led by the Atlantic Richfield Company, responded to complaints about price-gouging and to President Bush's call for restraint by capping wholesale gasoline prices temporarily. Fearful that allegations of profiteering could lead Congress to impose another windfall-profits tax on the industry, oil executives embarked on a public relations blitz to explain the complex oil markets and defend their actions.</p>
        <p>Industry executives also tried again and again to reframe the debate in terms of national security instead of fouled beaches and exorbitant profits. But they clearly have a long way to go.</p>
        <p>''The oil industry is one of this country's great assets,'' said George Babikian, president of ARCO's refining and marketing division. ''But these days, you mention oil company and people see some big, fat, greedy guy with a cigar and dirty fingernails counting his money. We don't have a hell of a lot of credibility.''</p>
        <p>Greedy or not, the industry will have plenty of additional loot to count if prices stay up. Higher crude oil prices can have a dramatic impact on the bottom line, especially for those companies that produce more of their crude than they purchase from OPEC or other suppliers. ARCO, for example, produces virtually all of the crude oil that it refines into gasoline, jet fuel and other products. As a result, it stands to benefit substantially from higher crude prices. For every $1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, ARCO's after-tax profits would rise by $140 million, or 83 cents a share, over the course of a year, according to the First Boston Corporation. Since early July, prices have soared $10 a barrel, to more than $28 on Friday.</p>
        <p>For companies like the Exxon Corporation and the Mobil Corporation, which purchase roughly half of their crude oil from foreign sources, the benefits are not as dramatic, but they are still important. Exxon, for example, would reap an additional $272 million in after-tax profits, or 22 cents a share, for each $1 increase.</p>
        <p>Higher profits mean the companies would have more money available for exploration and development projects or to make existing projects more efficient.</p>
        <p>''I know we would take those profits and plow them back into exploration and bring more oil to the market,'' said Mr. Babikian of ARCO. ''We could do that at a faster clip to help find oil or develop oil fields that we know have more oil in them.''</p>
        <p>Texaco Wish List</p>
        <p>James W. Kinnear, Texaco Inc.'s chief executive, said that if more money becomes available for capital spending, the company would like to increase its investments in areas like coal gasification. Mr. Kinnear said the company would also like to spend more on recovering additional oil from nearly depleted fields.Processes like injecting water or carbon dioxide underground can force more oil to the surface.</p>
        <p>''Each one of those things has the effect of bringing more energy on stream for the United States,'' Mr. Kinnear said.</p>
        <p>Many companies had already begun to increase capital spending modestly because the nation's energy demands have been rising steadily. Most analysts and executives said sustained prices above $25 a barrel would be enough to spur significant additional drilling activity.</p>
        <p>But industry executives and analysts say that in the absence of new incentives to drill in the United States, most new projects will continue to be abroad. The United States no longer has the equipment to support a return to the level of drilling activity experienced during the early 1980's. The most promising regions for new oil finds are overseas, and even if environmental concerns in the United States abate, the delays and expense they cause are unlikely ever to completely disappear.</p>
        <p>''It will be much easier to explore for oil in parts of the world that do not have the luxury of worrying about environmental concerns,'' said Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington.</p>
        <p>Boost for Natural Gas</p>
        <p>For all these reasons, some analysts believe that oil companies will now be willing to spend billions of dollars on pipelines needed to develop the country's mammoth natural gas reserves, although any such efforts may encounter their own environmental obstacles. The huge costs of building a national delivery and storage network have greatly limited the use of natural gas.</p>
        <p>''I think you'll find a very strong push for a pro-active natural gas policy,'' said Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge, Mass. ''You'll see oil companies making themselves into oil and gas companies, with non-gas players making alliances with gas players.''</p>
        <p>William L. Randol, an analyst at First Boston, said companies such as Chevron and Amoco that have large natural gas reserves may start pushing for legislation to mandate more use of natural gas in industries where either gas or oil can be used as fuel.</p>
        <p>''I do think there is the possibility of fuel switching and I think the price of natural gas will probably increase,'' said Mr. Kinnear of Texaco.</p>
        <p>Of course, the pace and nature of change in the industry will depend to a large extent on Arab and OPEC politics, and no one at this point has a clear idea of what that might entail.</p>
        <p>''The old OPEC is dead,'' said Mr. Stanislaw. ''The new OPEC could have many faces.''</p>
        <p>THE POTENTIAL ALONG THE BEAUFORT SEA</p>
        <p>The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge runs for 100 miles along the Beaufort Sea in the northeast corner of Alaska, a desolate region that is home to caribou and other tundra wildlife and is virtually untouched by man.</p>
        <p>But the area is also widely considered to be the most promising in the nation for a major new oil find, putting it squarely in the middle of the debate over how to balance environmental concerns with the nation's need for more energy sources.</p>
        <p>So far, Congress and the Bush Administration have turned a deaf ear to the industry's calls for opening the coastal plain first to limited test exploration and ultimately, if enough oil is found, to full-scale development and production. In the wake of the Iraq crisis, however, the industry is intensifying its lobbying efforts, and some in Congress, including Senators Frank Murkowski and Ted Stevens of Alaska, are calling for the issue to be placed back on the national agenda.</p>
        <p>No one knows for sure how much oil there might be below the coastal plain. A report by the Energy Department estimated that the area could yield between 600 million barrels of recoverable oil - a relatively small find - and 9.2 billion barrels, roughly the equivalent of the giant Prudhoe Bay field just to the west.</p>
        <p>''It's the only place we could expect to make a find that would add significantly to the country's reserves over the next few decades,'' said Tom Cook, an exploration representative for the Chevron Corporation in Alaska.</p>
        <p>The companies that most need oil from the coastal plain are those that have the biggest existing investments in Alaska's North Slope, primarily the Atlantic Richfield Company and British Petroleum. They have already invested billions in building the trans-Alaska pipeline to carry oil south from Prudhoe Bay; the companies say it would be relatively easy to build a spur line 100 miles or so into the coastal plain to feed new oil into the existing system.</p>
        <p>''The technology is there to do it with minimal impact and very low risk to the area and to wildlife,'' Mr. Cook said. Environmentalists are aghast at the very idea. ''We have a 20 percent chance of finding a significant amount of oil, and a 100 percent chance of trashing one of the environmentally pristine areas of the country,'' said Robert K. Watson, an energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Mr. Watson said the idea that the companies could develop the coastal plain in an environmentally sound manner is absurd. ''If you've ever been to Prudhoe Bay, you've seen that they've completely steamrollered it,'' he said. ''They've completely ignored any environmental sensitivities.''</p>
        <p>LITTLE HOPE IN SYNFUELS</p>
        <p>It seemed like a great idea at the time. At the behest of President Jimmy Carter, the Federal Government in 1980 undertook what was supposed to be a massive effort to promote the development of synthetic fuels to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. With oil prices at $32 a barrel and the economy suffering from its second oil-price shock in seven years, the effort seemed justified, and Congress authorized the expenditure of as much as $88 billion. By the 1990's, synfuels were supposed to account for 25 percent of the nation's energy needs.</p>
        <p>Within a few years, though, oil prices started tumbling and synthetic fuels - like gas produced from coal or oil produced from shale - no longer made much economic sense. Companies started bailing out of development projects, the Reagan Administration turned hostile to the program and the entire effort eventually died.</p>
        <p>Today, with oil prices rising again and the nation once more concerned about reducing its oil imports, synthetic fuels remain a tantalizing but probably unrealistic solution.</p>
        <p>A few companies, including Texaco Inc., are still investing in coal gasification and other synfuels projects. But most experts believe there will not be any major push into synthetic fuels unless oil prices go much higher and stay there for a long period.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of projects that could get off the ground with a lot of Government funding,'' said John C. Sawhill, who headed the program as Deputy Energy Secretary during the Carter Administration. ''But frankly I think it would be a mistake. As far as making a dent in the U.S. energy supply, I think we ought to forget about synfuels in the 1990's.''</p>
