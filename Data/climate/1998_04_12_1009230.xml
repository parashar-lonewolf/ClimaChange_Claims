        <p>IT'S a fact that 99 percent of all species on earth have become extinct. And because man is a species, the question is not ''if'' so much as ''when.'' Anyway, if, like me, you grew up a few radioactive Day-Glo orange puddle-jumps away from Love Canal, the upstate New York  town turned toxic dump site, you're entitled to think that if some natural force doesn't get us, we'll probably just do ourselves in.</p>
        <p>When people in my neighborhood said, ''You look radiant,'' they weren't necessarily being complimentary.</p>

        <p>IT'S a fact that 99 percent of all species on earth have become extinct. And because man is a species, the question is not ''if'' so much as ''when.'' Anyway, if, like me, you grew up a few radioactive Day-Glo orange puddle-jumps away from Love Canal, the upstate New York  town turned toxic dump site, you're entitled to think that if some natural force doesn't get us, we'll probably just do ourselves in.</p>
        <p>When people in my neighborhood said, ''You look radiant,'' they weren't necessarily being complimentary.</p>
        <p>So musing over doomsday does not mean that you're crazy or cranky or that you gave up hope for Lent instead of Haagen-Dazs. And you're certainly not alone. In a recent Gallup Poll, 61 percent of adults and 71 percent of teen-agers said they believed that the world would come to an end or be destroyed. It did not help to find out last month that an asteroid might be crashing into the planet, even if the next day's headlines read,  ''Whoops, just kidding!''</p>
        <p>A short catalogue of potential calamities: nuclear accidents, environmental devastation (ozone layer, greenhouse effect), plague (resistant new strains of tuberculosis, Ebola virus, H.I.V.), doom prophesied by religious groups, and the latest cause for collective concern, the year 2000 computer glitch, or Y2K.</p>
        <p>Given all this, some people want to  prepare for whatever tribulation they envision. In these days of do-it-yourself investing, that means girding your finances, as well as the usual apocalyptic tasks like building a bunker or putting your soul in order.</p>
        <p>Consider Y2K. The predictions for Dec. 31, 1999, range from simple bank errors, disappearing stock certificates and Social Security checks to a Government shutdown, mass social unrest and global economic collapse. The alarums are not just conjectures in Internet chat rooms but the genuine fears of techies charged with finding a solution before the gong strikes midnight.</p>
        <p>Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York, says there is a 60 percent chance of a global recession from Y2K problems. He advises having cash on hand, putting money in Treasury bonds and steering clear of airline stocks. The reason for the last is that today's air traffic control computers are not ready to handle the change, he believes.</p>
        <p>''No one knows what's going to happen, but it's a systemic problem'' that Y2K poses, says Robert Forrester, managing partner of the Forrester Network, a consulting firm in Norwalk, Conn. His advice: Collect  six months' worth of hard copies of all financial statements and bills.  Make sure you have written copies of your birth certificate, college transcripts and insurance policies. And get a letter from Social Security stating your benefits; most experts believe that the Government is less likely to ready its computers for Y2K than is the private sector.</p>
        <p>Bert Dohmen, president of Dohmen Capital Research in Honolulu,  advises steering clear of stocks like Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other companies with substantial Government business. He also worries about Washington's computers crashing.</p>
        <p>Howard J. Ruff, publisher of The Ruff Times, a newsletter, writes about the silver lining in this computer cloud, although he agrees that the Y2K problem may be dire. He recommends investing in ZMAX, a venture that prepares companies for the transition, and Home State Year 2000 (800-232-0224), a mutual fund that invests in businesses working on the Y2K problem. Gold is also a good bet, Mr. Ruff said.</p>
        <p>What about those like Donald S. McAlvany, editor of The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor, who worry about drug-resistant viruses, germ warfare and anthrax attacks? Mr. McAlvany suggests that, for survival, people study up on nutrition, alternative medicine and the like. For investments, analysts would look into the same areas.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Ackler, a financial counselor at Tucker Anthony in Manhattan, does not herself fret much about these dangers, but those who do might explore companies like General Nutrition, Celestial Seasonings and Lincare, a provider of respiratory therapy, she said.</p>
        <p>INSURANCE, the next stop on our financial doomsday tour, offers something for everyone. Although most homeowner and business policies cover any objects that fall from the sky, for instance, the especially fearful can buy anti-asteroid insurance as well. For a one-time premium of $19.95, the St. Lawrence Agency in Altamonte Springs, Fla., sells a policy paying up to $10 million for asteroid damage. Reimbursement for treatment of cirrhosis of the liver resulting from panic-induced alcoholism is included. Honest.</p>
        <p>If your mind turns to those 10 or 12 Chernobyl-type nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union that have not yet been decommissioned, you may want mushroom-cloud coverage. The three primary insurers of nuclear risks are Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd. and American Nuclear Insurers, which paid out $60 million in claims related to the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island.</p>
        <p>Indeed, nuclear-reactor perils are one reason that Mr. Dohmen advises steering clear ''of any investment in the former Soviet Union unless you like playing Russian roulette with five cylinders loaded.''</p>
        <p>Douglas S. Land, a venture capitalist with the Chesapeake Group in New York, says he is not himself convinced that the end will come with a nuclear blast, but he has investment  advice for those who do. Go with Bausch &amp; Lomb and Sunglass Hut International (eye protection), Brookstone (back-to-the-earth garden tools) and Glaxo Wellcome and other drug giants (sun screens). Or, because retailing may be wiped off the face of the earth, invest in Orbital Sciences, a satellite maker, he says.</p>
        <p>Back on the insurance front, the spiritually optimistic may be interested in a reincarnation policy. The St. Lawrence Agency offers one that reimburses holders for lost property when they return after death.</p>
        <p>Also, several companies sold ''rapture insurance'' over the years but, after a concerted effort, the industry  successfully vanquished such coverage a few years ago. In the rapture, some Christians believe, the living faithful will be spirited to heaven, leaving others behind to face the Antichrist on earth. The policies granted the faithful the same status as deceased clients, with the moneys  duly paid out to the beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Do religious groups that believe in  apocalyptic doom as prophesied by the Bible invest only, say, in precious metals? The answer for many is no. The Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists and others are as stock-oriented as any large institutions.</p>
        <p>''Though this could easily be considered a contradiction, realistically it isn't,'' said Milton Erhart, a stockbroker in Boise, Idaho, who advises the Adventist church. ''Most religious organizations realize they must be in the equity markets if for no other reason than to fund the pension liabilities.''</p>
        <p>Of course, in thinking about the financial implications of doomsday, don't overlook stockpiling and other  standard Armageddon preparations. It is always prudent to have food and water for emergencies, said Mr. Ruff, a Mormon, who suggests living off what you have in the house for a week right now, just to get an idea of your stockpiling needs. Having myself survived a few noteworthy Buffalo blizzards, I would agree that you can never have too many cans of creamed corn in the pantry.</p>
        <p>True, the apocalypse may never come. But remember that preparing for it has yielded numerous contributions to society. It was the Adventists' interest in alternative diets and millennial bodily perfection, for instance, that led them to invent three food pillars of modern life: peanut butter, graham crackers and cold breakfast cereal.</p>
        <p>So it's not all gloom and doom. Many prophecies are very optimistic. Just ask the pastor of the First Church of Elvis. This ''Presleyterian'' denomination predicts that the singer will make his second coming at the end of the millennium.</p>
