        <p>Based on the principle that almost any fuel can be burned more cleanly and efficiently if first turned into a gas, engineers are developing ways to produce electricity with fuel gas made from coal, wood chips, sugar cane leftovers -- even sewage sludge.</p>
        <p>The process employs systems known as gasifiers, which can cook organic material into a fuel for gas turbines, the most efficient electricity generators available. While utilities currently burn natural gas in their turbines, coal is more plentiful and may eventually be cheaper.</p>
        <p>Indeed, gasifying coal could be economically attractive in the United States in the near future, many energy experts say. Extracting more electricity from a ton of coal, by burning it as a gas in a turbine instead of as a solid in a boiler, would make it easier to remove conventional pollutants, like sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. Possibly more important, it would also mean less carbon dioxide, a "greenhouse" gas associated with global warming.  But energy experts predict that another approach may become even more environmentally important: gasifying a "renewable" fuel like wood. In the developing world, particularly, using wood or crop wastes in utility power plants could be a key to electrifying less-developed nations and making better use of forests than burning trees as firewood.</p>
        <p>True, burning a tree for fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But it also opens up space for the growth of a new tree, which will absorb carbon dioxide as it grows. By contrast, digging up and burning coal -- the repository of eons of carbon accumulation -- neither encourages the formation of new coal nor recycles the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Irving Mintzer, coordinator of the Climate Change and Sustainable Development Program at the Stockholm Environment Institute, said turbines running on wood or other organic matter -- known generically as biomass -- "could be part of a systematic response to global warming." Perpetual Wood Supply</p>
        <p>Most undeveloped countries burn wood at rates far faster than forests can be regrown. But a 30-megawatt plant, sufficient to meet the needs of about 15,000 American households and an even larger number in a less developed country, could use 27,000 acres of tree farms to supply it into perpetuity. That assumes the harvesting of an average of 5.5 tons of wood from each acre each year, and the planting of new trees.</p>
        <p>A gasifier works by heating solid fuel with steam in the presence of a carefully regulated amount of oxygen. "Dirty" solids like coal, which is filled with impurities, or solids with a low energy density, like wood or crop wastes, can be gasified, producing hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and other combustible gases.  Utility companies in industrial nations are increasingly turning to gas turbines, sometimes paired with steam turbines that use the gas turbines' waste heat to make even more electricity. These are replacing old-fashioned generating stations that burn fuel in a boiler furnace to make steam, and then run the steam through a turbine to make mechanical power, which turns a generator.</p>
        <p>Burning a fossil fuel like coal in a boiler, a generating station converts, at most, only 32 percent of the fuel's heat into electricity; the rest of the heat energy escapes up the stack or into a cooling tower or condenser. The best gas-turbine plants, by contrast, are 53 percent efficient.</p>
        <p>"We see gas turbines evolving, for as far out into the future as we need to care about," said James C. Corman, general manager of advanced technologies at the power generation engineering section of General Electric's Research and Development Center here.</p>
        <p>As a manufacturer of power-plant generating systems, G.E.'s primary interest in gasification is in a coal-fired technology that will replace the current standard -- burning pulverized coal to produce steam. G.E. estimates that between now and 2005, the worldwide market for new coal-fired power plants will exceed $300 billion, representing a combined generating capacity of 300 billion watts. The company believes a substantial portion of that capacity could be met with gasifiers instead of boilers.</p>
        <p>With help from the United States Department of Energy, the Electric Power Research Institute and other organizations, General Electric and Texaco Inc. built a plant called Cool Water, in Daggett, Calif., in the desert northeast of Los Angeles, that ran for five years in the late 1980's. It demonstrated that coal gasification worked reliably enough to supply electricity.</p>
        <p>But it was not designed to show it was financially feasible, and in fact, it did not prove to be. Among Cool Water's disadvantages was that the temperature of the fuel gas had to be reduced before the gas could be cleaned, increasing equipment costs and wasting some energy.</p>
        <p>At its research and development center, however, G.E. is now running a high-temperature system that cleans up the gas while it is hot by spinning it in an artificial cyclone.</p>
        <p>In addition to improving the energy properties of coal, gasification might turn useless agricultural waste, like the stalks of harvested cotton plants, into valuable fuel. Researchers are even considering converting the Cool Water plant to use sewage sludge.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, G.E. tried again, using two biomass fuels -- wood chips and then bagasse, the residue of sugar cane after the sugar juice has been squeezed out. The work was carefully reviewed by the State of Vermont, which wants to create jobs for foresters; the Agency for International Development, which is seeking technology for use in the third world; the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>In some ways, biomass fuels were superior to coal, because they have little sulfur, simplifying cleanup.  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
