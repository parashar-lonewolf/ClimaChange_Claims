        <p>Duke Power, the nation's second-largest operator of nuclear plants, filed an application yesterday to extend the life of its biggest nuclear plant, which has been producing power for 25 years.</p>
        <p>No utility has gone through the long, laborious and expensive process of having a license renewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the application by Duke Power, a unit of the Duke Energy Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., is seen as an initiative whose outcome could determine the future of nuclear energy in the United States.  Duke's progress in getting the license renewed, which would enable it to operate the three-unit Oconee nuclear power station in western South Carolina another 20 years, will be watched by other utilities that must decide whether to seek renewal or decommission their nuclear plants and build nonnuclear operations to replace them.</p>
        <p>There are big stakes involved for utilities, consumers and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>For many utilities nuclear plants are the cheapest generators of electricity and have become more attractive as the industry deregulates.</p>
        <p>Joe F. Colvin, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade and lobbying group, said most nuclear plants could produce electricity at about 1.9 cents a kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than natural gas plants, which average about 3 cents a kilowatt-hour.</p>
        <p>''You can beat any competitor coming at you,'' Mr. Colvin said.</p>
        <p>Some utilities have chosen to decommission their aging nuclear plants, which can be very costly. Building new plants is also expensive. Consumers would probably bear most of the cost through higher rates.</p>
        <p>For environmentalists, closing older plants would reduce the amount of nuclear waste that must be disposed of. It could also result, however, in building more coal-fired plants, which emit carbon dioxide, a gas linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>With so much riding on the outcome, Duke has given itself a great deal of lead time. By filing for a license renewal with the N.R.C. now, it hopes to complete the process in three years, well before its 40-year license to operate the three units of its Oconee Nuclear station expires in 2013.</p>
        <p>Oconee, which was built in 1973, is capable of producing 2,538 megawatts of power. It has produced 24 percent of the electricity used by Duke's two million customers in North and South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Michael S. Tuckman, the executive vice president for nuclear generation at Duke, said in a telephone conference yesterday that the plant would be a test case for the industry in how the licensing procedure would work and whether the standards set by the commission would be economical to meet.</p>
        <p>He said that before filing for its application, Duke had asked other utilities to review and comment on it because they would have to decide whether to seek renewals as well. If Duke encounters difficulty in the renewal process, other utilities might decide not to try a similar effort.</p>
        <p>In April, another utility, Baltimore Gas and Electric, filed to renew the license for its Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, which can produce 1,875 megawatts of electricity.</p>
        <p>And the largest operator of nuclear plants, Commonwealth Edison of Chicago, a subsidiary of the Unicom Corporation, said yesterday that it would sell its six coal-fired plants, which have a book value of about $1.1 billion, and use the money to improve the performance of its nuclear plants.</p>
        <p>The N.R.C. oversees 107 working nuclear plants that produce 22 percent of the nation's electricity.</p>
        <p>Duke has prepared for its renewal effort by consulting with the staff of the commission on how to measure the wear and durability of equipment in plants. Mr. Tuckman, however, said the process could extend another three years, through hearings, inspections and tests.</p>
        <p>He said the utility had already spent $8 million preparing its filing, which will be delivered to the commission in Washington today. He said the utility expected to spend another $8 million before a decision was reached.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tuckman added that the plant had been continually upgraded during its life and that the utility must demonstrate that it could be maintained in good condition another 20 years after its license expires in 2013.</p>
        <p>The plant has generally had a solid safety record, but it had some accidents in recent years. A steam line ruptured in 1995 and seven workers were injured, several seriously. In 1990, a line became disconnected from a reactor head and radioactive water leaked but was kept and treated in the containment building.</p>
