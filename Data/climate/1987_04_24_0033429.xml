        <p>A few man-made chemicals are gnawing at the ozone layer, the invisible shield in the stratosphere that protects life from ultraviolet rays. The State Department hopes Europe and Japan will phase down production of the ozone-destroying chemicals, starting with a 50 percent cut. But just as negotiations are to resume, the department's position is being undermined by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>Budget and other officials want State to demand only token reductions. They pooh-pooh the scientific warnings and contend the economic costs of phasing out the chemicals would be too high. But the Environmental Protection Agency has determined the hazard is real and cumulative; the destructive chemicals last for decades. The O.M.B. position would compel a humiliating American withdrawal from a position of leadership on a vital issue.</p>
        <p>The threat to the ozone layer is hard to quantify but a substantial increase in ultraviolet radiation would provoke more skin cancer and eye damage and immeasurable disruption to other animal life. The State Department deserves support, not subversion, from the White House.</p>
