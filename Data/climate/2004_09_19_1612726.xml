        <p>AMY SCHWARTZ and Rosemary Wells are accomplished writers and illustrators whose stories for young children are rightly renowned. Their words and pictures have delighted and reassured more than a generation of youngsters (and their parents) as they took their first giant steps into the unfamiliar territories of Life and School. While Schwartz and Wells have been honored and celebrated with awards, their books have earned the higher honor of being worn and tattered by continual reading.</p>
        <p>For over 20 years Amy Schwartz, the author of the popular ''Annabelle Swift, Kindergartner,'' has created stories that enchant with gentle humor, using a range of impressive artistic styles. From the bold black-and-white lines and shadings of ''Bea and Mr. Jones'' to the luminescent pages of ''How to Catch an Elephant'' to the precise yet fluid lines and colored shapes that leap from white backgrounds in ''A Glorious Day,'' Schwartz experiments with hues, patterns and contours that engage both the untutored and the expert eye. Simple dots, lines and circles convey emotion. The curve of a shoulder or leg reveals energy or fatigue. Without ever cluttering the page, Schwartz supplies new discoveries with each reading.</p>
        <p>She is the master of the perfect ending -- unexpected yet graceful, swift but never abrupt. If the ending is the target and the arrow is the story arc, the marriage of Schwartz's words and pictures hits the bull's-eye every time.</p>
        <p>''Things I Learned in Second Grade'' is her new school story. Its then-and-now motif makes it a good choice for its intended readers who are, in fact, entering second grade, on the far side of picture books.</p>
        <p>When Andrew starts second grade, he says, ''I couldn't spell 'should.' I couldn't subtract 348 from 411. . . . Or read a chapter book. . . . I wasn't friends with Joseph. Or William or Tommy. . . . Now I am.'' As the year progresses, Andrew learns the essentials: how to spell big words, how to subtract large numbers, and even how to resolve classroom conflicts. He reads, among other books, ''Fudge-a-Mania,'' ''Beezus and Ramona'' and ''Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets.''</p>
        <p>Though ''Things I Learned'' features Schwartz's signature humor, the story stumbles in a few places. Certain inconsistencies trouble me. Andrew's poem seems too sophisticated. The classroom is diverse, but the historical figures on the wall aren't. And Andrew argues with his friend Ryan because Ryan is ''always trying to be Einstein,'' but two pages later, Einstein appears as a hero. Also, much to my surprise, the illustrations are uncharacteristically static and the story seems less spirited than I've come to expect. Nonetheless, Andrew's imaginative and kid-friendly alien invasion scenario charmed me.</p>
        <p>From a child's perspective, ''Things I Learned in Second Grade'' offers curious first-grade graduates an authentic sense of second grade's challenges and accomplishments. And of course the story ends perfectly. I remain a Schwartz enthusiast.</p>
        <p>Rosemary Wells writes for tots, teenagers and in-betweens. Given her deadpan humor and her profound understanding of children, you might think she had logged years as a stand-up comedian or a psychologist. In fact, her writing career spans almost four decades and is still picking up steam.</p>
        <p>Her respect and compassion for children's needs, feelings and dilemmas are boundless: for fear (''Edward the Unready''), for embarrassment (''Timothy Goes to School''), for anger (''Noisy Nora''), for reassurance (''Hazel's Amazing Mother'') and always for feeling cherished and for possessing a natural talent or ability worth acknowledging. No wonder her fictional parents and teachers are invariably models of wisdom, forbearance and humor.</p>
        <p>Beginning in 1981, with ''Timothy Goes to School,'' Wells introduced what became a succession of books set in classrooms and featuring her familiar animal characters. ''My Kindergarten'' joins them with an entire year's curriculum that bursts from dazzling oversize pages. Populated by old and new friends, the class is shepherded by the unflappable Miss Cribbage, a veteran of ''Emily's First 100 Days of School.''</p>
        <p>Arranged by month from September to June, the chapters spotlight activities that offer opportunities for learning, including mapping, adopting a tree, playing musical instruments, learning a poem by heart, reading a thermometer and plenty more. No list, however, can do justice to the cheerful ''lessons'' or the expressive illustrations. I even learned a new word, ''samara.''</p>
        <p>''My Kindergarten'' inspires creativity, resourcefulness and flexibility in children and adults alike. The book is set in New England; if you live in a tropical climate, change the seasonal details. If you celebrate winter holidays other than Christmas, Hanukkah or Kwanzaa, substitute your own. If you favor ''The Lady With the Alligator Purse'' over ''Miss Mary Mack,'' chant that instead. ''My Kindergarten'' is rhythmic and lighthearted, with some singularly diverting moments. My favorite involves Roger, whose stubborn devotion to his toys with wheels is captivating and amusing. On ''widen our horizons'' day Roger balks at attempting anything new: He ''stays in the car-and-truck corner. He does not want to build blocks, or dress up or paint. Roger does not go near the science table. Roger makes gearshift noises and says words like 'generator.' ''</p>
        <p>If you are a new kindergarten teacher, or a veteran teacher looking for fresh ideas, the parent of a preschooler or a kindergartner, find this book. And if your own childhood was blighted by a wretched teacher and you want to erase your bad memories, get it purely for yourself. Both ''Things I Learned in Second Grade'' and ''My Kindergarten'' show the core values of caring and sharing, cooperation and community, imagination and initiative. While once upon a time many of us took good public education for granted, today we know better. Bringing a child together with the right books at the right time can sometimes generate a magical response. Just think of Amy Schwartz and Rosemary Wells as honorary fairy godmothers, opening doors.h BookshelfSKY. By Roderick Townley. Richard Jackson/Atheneum. $16.95.
