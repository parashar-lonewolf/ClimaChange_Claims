        <p>Banning widely used chemicals is hard enough, especially in advance of proven harm. Environmentalists have long wondered whether political leaders could find the will to curb the chemical threat to the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere. But within the space of two days, the European Community and the United States, each of which accounts for roughly a third of global production, have taken giant strides toward such a ban.</p>
        <p>It's now up to countries like China, which plans to boost its production of the pernicious chemicals by 20 percent, to re-examine the threat and join the rest of the world in averting it.</p>
        <p>The Montreal protocol of 1987 requires signatories to impose an immediate cap on production of the chemicals, known as chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, and then cut it by half by 1998. But studies of the recently discovered ozone hole that opens up over the Antarctic every year have persuaded many scientists that a 50 percent reduction is not enough.</p>
        <p>On Thursday the 12 countries of the European Community, some of which once resisted the United States' campaign for the Montreal treaty, announced it should be even stricter. They will try to cut their production of CFC's to 85 percent as soon as possible, and phase out the chemicals altogether by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>William Reilly, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, then persuaded President Bush to announce the next day that the United States would also try to ban CFC's by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>The phaseout of CFC's will be a major undertaking. The chemicals are used as refrigerants, for blowing foam, as cleaning agents in the computer chip industry and in Europe as aerosol propellants.</p>
        <p>Acceptable substitutes have already been developed for some uses, but many manufacturers face difficult adjustments. Makers of refrigerators use CFC's both as the refrigerant and in insulating material, and available alternatives are less efficient. Still, the evidence against the chemicals is so persuasive that even Du Pont, the world's largest producer, has already said it will phase them out.</p>
        <p>The new initiatives against CFC's are a notable triumph both for the European Community and the new Administration in Washington. They draw the world's attention to the urgency of the ozone threat, and should encourage other countries to sign and ratify the Montreal treaty. They also set a favorable precedent for international action against another global threat, the greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.</p>
