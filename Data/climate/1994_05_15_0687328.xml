        <p>AS the weather grows warmer, more drivers will be rolling up their windows and turning on their air-conditioners. Some will be disappointed when nothing but accelerated warm air flows from the vents.</p>
        <p>In the past, repairing an auto air-conditioner was often easy. A technician would pump in new refrigerant to replace any that leaked away in the winter, and check for leaks.</p>
        <p>But tuning up an air-conditioner has become much more complicated, because of concern over depletion of the protective ozone layer in the atmosphere. The refrigerant used until recently in almost all car air-conditioners, R-12, is part of a class of chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons, that have been blamed for destroying the ozone layer. By international agreement, all chlorofluorocarbon production is to end by Dec. 31, 1995.</p>
        <p>A new refrigerant, R-134a, has been developed that does not include chlorine and does not pose a threat to the ozone. Unfortunately, the two refrigerants are not compatible. If a car was designed to use R-12, R-134a cannot be substituted unless the system is modified. In fact, automotive engineers say, there are no "drop in" replacements for R-12.</p>
        <p>The main reason for the incompatability, said Douglas E. Mark, an emissions engineer for the General Motors Corporation, is lubrication. In most cooling systems that use compressors, a lubricant is mixed with the refrigerant to reduce friction where mechanical parts rub together.</p>
        <p>The problem is that mineral oil, the lubricant used with R-12, does not flow properly with R-134a. A different type of lubricant, polyalkylene glycol, is used with R-134a.</p>
        <p>If R-134a is injected into a system designed for R-12, will the air-conditioner work? "Not for long," Mr. Mark said. "Without lubrication, the compressor would seize," shutting down the entire system.</p>
        <p>Conversion to the new refrigerant was begun by most manufacturers about two years ago and will be completed by the end of this year. A label on the air-conditioner compressor will tell which refrigerant a car uses.</p>
        <p>Owners of older cars must make some choices. Since production of R-12 has been declining, its price -- once as low as 88 cents a pound -- has been rising. (R-12 is also subject to a Federal tax.) Until recently, the bill for servicing an auto air-conditioner would be about $30, including the cost of labor and a few ounces of refrigerant.</p>
        <p>But the cost of servicing a system has soared. "Last summer, the street price was about $100," Mr. Mark said. "It will be interesting to see what happens this summer." The cost is likely to be even higher next year.</p>
        <p>Because of the ozone issue, Federal officials are pressuring car dealers and service shops not to simply refill leaky systems, but to detect the leaks and plug them.</p>
        <p>Once production of R-12 ceases entirely next year, it will be available only from air-conditioning industry stockpiles and whatever is recovered from junked cars. That is why service specialists say it is important not to contaminate R-12 by adding another refrigerant like R-22, which is used in window air-conditioners. Once contaminated, R-12 cannot be recycled.</p>
        <p>"People are coming into shops with R-22 in their systems, and flammable materials like propane and butane," said Simon Oulouhojian, president of the Mobile Air Conditioning Society Worldwide.</p>
        <p>All auto manufacturers are developing conversion kits so that systems designed for R-12 can be modified to use R-134a. Some will be relatively simple, others more complicated and expensive. Nevertheless, as R-12 becomes more scarce and costly, auto executives say the conversions will increasingly become the more economical choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oulouhojian said most conversion kits had not yet been developed; their prices are estimated at $200 to $800. He said costs were likely to be lower for newer cars with more modern cooling systems.</p>
        <p>The cost of completely converting an older car may not make economic sense, he said. But there may be some alternatives, like a partial conversion. "If a customer is willing to accept air that is a few degrees hotter than in the past, the cost may be considerably lower," Mr. Oulouhojian said.  DRIVING SMART</p>
