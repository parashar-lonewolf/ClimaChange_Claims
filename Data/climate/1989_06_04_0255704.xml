        <p>LEAD: THE day may well come when motorists pulling into a service station in this country will say, ''Gas it up,'' and mean real gas, not gasoline. If that happens, Dr. Enoch J. Durbin, a 66-year-old professor of engineering at Princeton University, will not be surprised.</p>
        <p>THE day may well come when motorists pulling into a service station in this country will say, ''Gas it up,'' and mean real gas, not gasoline. If that happens, Dr. Enoch J. Durbin, a 66-year-old professor of engineering at Princeton University, will not be surprised.</p>
        <p>The benefits of natural gas as an automotive fuel, he says, are substantial: Natural gas is abundant. It burns cleanly and can end the air-pollution problems caused by gasoline fuel. It is cheaper than gasoline. It is safer. It is kinder to the car's engine.</p>
        <p>Would a motorist like to drive a car a half million miles and never need an engine overhaul? It has been done with natural gas.</p>
        <p>Yes, there are some disadvantages, especially the difficulty of storing enough of it to travel as far as with a tank of gasoline. But with American cities facing growing smog and air-pollution crises, the search for alternative motor vehicle fuels is becoming urgent. And compared with other widely discussed alternatives, natural gas is superior, Dr. Durbin says.  Saw Its Use in Canada</p>
        <p>Eight years ago he got in on the ground floor of what is now a creeping movement in North America to use natural gas, or a main component, methane, as a motor vehicle fuel. He was about to start a sabbatical leave at Princeton, and the father of one of his students invited him to spend part of the year in Vancouver, British Columbia, studying fuels besides gasoline that motor vehicles might burn. The father, Dr. Patrick L. McGeer, an educator, was Minister of Universities, Science and Communication in the British Columbia government at the time.</p>
        <p>Dr. Durbin, observing that natural gas was plentiful in the region, organized a research center at the University of British Columbia and in time helped persuade a taxi company to convert 128 cabs in its fleet to burn natural gas. The company invested $900,000 in the project and got back its capital in a year through savings of $75,000 a month in fuel costs.</p>
        <p>Today at least 8,000 vehicles in British Columbia burn natural gas, and their drivers can tank up at about 50 service stations that have converted to the new fuel. The movement is spreading easterly through Canada, Dr. Durbin says.</p>
        <p>Now that he is hooked on the concept, Dr. Durbin speaks of it with the impatient zeal of a crusader who is ahead of his time. He notes with gloom that the swing to automotive natural gas has yet to catch on significantly in the United States.</p>
        <p>According to the Federal Department of Energy, about 25,000 vehicles owned by utilities in this country now use the technology. In addition, a few experimental buses are being tried in Tacoma, Wash., central Ohio and Brooklyn. No automotive service stations sell natural gas.</p>
        <p>''We, in general, have zero interest in the future,'' Dr. Durbin said in a recent interview in his campus office. ''The auto industry is interested in the next 10 days - how many cars am I going to sell?</p>
        <p>''It's our lack of interest in the future that's causing trouble in all industries. The Japanese make an investment that won't pay off for 10 years; we won't make an investment unless it pays off in three months.''</p>
        <p>The auto makers take exception. A General Motors spokesman in Manhattan, Peter J. Peterson, said: ''All the auto companies are doing a lot of research on alternate fuels, including natural gas. But right now, gasoline is the most practical fuel to use in an automobile. It works the best.''</p>
        <p>The industry's hand may be forced. The days of uninhibited use of gasoline are already numbered in some ways.</p>
        <p>Last month regional officials in Southern California adopted a strict air-quality program that could, by the year 2007, ban all motor vehicles that burn gasoline or diesel fuel. The plan is widely regarded by environmental leaders as a forerunner of measures that other urban regions will have to take.</p>
        <p>In 1991 the Federal Environmental Protection Agency will put into effect air-quality standards for buses that no diesel engine now on the market can meet. Similar rules for trucks are due in 1994.  Asked to Help West Virginia</p>
        <p>West Virginia is moving to set up a National Center for Alternative Transportation Fuels, Dr. Durbin said, and Representative Bob Wise of that state has asked him to become part of a steering committee to organize the center. Dr. Durbin, who goes on another sabbatical next year, plans to accept.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, he observed, other countries are pressing forward with natural-gas fuel. Italy leads the world with 400,000 cars that have been converted to burn it, he said. Natural gas has been an alternative motor fuel in the Netherlands for more than 20 years, environmentalists report, and in New Zealand about 10 percent of the cars are said to use it.</p>
        <p>''The Russians,'' Dr. Durbin said, ''have announced a plan to convert one million vehicles to natural gas - by 1991, I believe. They have gas coming out of their ears.''</p>
        <p>The supply in the United States is by no means meager, he noted, citing Energy Department estimates that there is enough natural gas for 5,000 years from well-drilling alone. Coal gasification could yield a 1,600-year supply, the department says. And if communities would tap the methane gas in their garbage dumps, their supplies would be replenished every year.</p>
        <p>''It's a far better potential than oil,'' Dr. Durbin said. ''In 20 years the world will be getting all its oil from the Mideast and the Soviet Union.''  Oil Industry Reaction</p>
        <p>The American oil industry does not appear to feel threatened. A spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute in Washington, Arthur E. Wiese, said: ''We support the development and use of all of these alternative fuels. We're in the natural gas business, too.''</p>
        <p>The distribution system for natural gas is already in place in this country. ''We have about 1.1 million miles of pipeline in the U.S. distributing this stuff,'' Dr. Durbin said.</p>
        <p>The gas flows largely into homes for heating and cooking. If cars were converted to burn this fuel, and ''if someone would invent an inexpensive home compressor that would sit in my garage,'' Dr. Durbin said, ''then I'd fill my car every night with compressed natural gas.'' Service stations could, of course, also hook into the existing pipeline system.</p>
        <p>With natural gas, Dr. Durbin said, there would be these advantages:</p>
        <p>* Fuel that burns leaner and cleaner than gasoline. This would mean enormous reductions in the air of poisonous carbon monoxide; oxides of nitrogen, which contribute to acid rain; carbon dioxide, which has been linked to the ''greenhouse effect,'' or abnormal warming of the earth, and hydrocarbons, which contribute to smog.</p>
        <p>* Cheaper fuel. Because the supply of natural gas is plentiful and it does not require processing or refining, it costs 60 percent less than gasoline.</p>
        <p>* Fuel with an octane rating of 130, compared with 92 for top premium gasoline and 87 for economy. The higher octane would permit the design of a more efficient engine.</p>
        <p>* Fuel that burns cooler than gasoline and does not ignite readily in vehicle accidents. ''It is the safest fuel you can possibly ride with,'' Dr. Durbin said.</p>
        <p>* Less engine wear. Most of the wear in a gasoline-powered car engine comes from cold starts with use of the choke; the gasoline washes the lubricants off the cylinder walls. With natural gas, there is instantaneous starting without a choke. One taxi in British Columbia has run 545,000 miles on natural gas without an engine ring or valve job, Dr. Durbin said.</p>
        <p>The biggest drawback is that natural gas, in its original state, takes up 1,000 times the space of equivalent gasoline, so the gas must be compressed. Even then, ''the energy in the tank occupies about five times the volume of gasoline,'' Dr. Durbin said. This limits the fuel that can be carried and the driving range.</p>
        <p>For example, the professor said, he converted a Toyota Corolla station wagon to run on natural gas. With two cylinders of gas in the back, ''I could go only 200 miles on a filling,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One remedy is to have a dual-fuel car, so when it runs out of natural gas, the driver can switch to gasoline until the natural gas cylinders can be refilled. But that would mean a more expensive car, and the extra cylinders would cut into passenger and cargo space, said another General Motors spokesman, Don Postma, in Detroit.</p>
        <p>''The most promising alternate fuels, if we need them,'' Mr. Postma said, ''look to be variations of alcohol - methanol and ethanol.''</p>
        <p>G.M., he said, has developed a multifuel sensor that would permit a car to burn either of these fuels or gasoline. Alcohol and another widely discussed alternative to natural gas - battery power - do not impress Dr. Durbin.</p>
        <p>In the case of electric cars that run on batteries, the batteries weigh too much to get the same energy that a gallon of gasoline gives, he said.</p>
        <p>''Stored in a lead battery, like you have in your car now, it's 1,200 pounds of battery per gallon of gasoline,'' he said. ''Using a fancy, very expensive battery, you'll drop it to 500 pounds per gallon. Forget it.''  'A Lousy Choice'</p>
        <p>Dr. Durbin said that alcohol fuels, like methanol, ethanol and gasahol, are ''a lousy choice.''</p>
        <p>These fuels are ''highly corrosive,'' so ''engine life goes way down,'' he said, adding that they make ''new pollutants that we never thought about - formaldehyde, a terrible pollutant.'' That leaves ''the marvelous properties'' of natural gas as the logical choice, the professor suggested. The pity is that the gas is so little valued today that companies drilling for oil burn it to get rid of it, he said.</p>
        <p>''If you got into a satellite,'' Dr. Durbin said, ''and circled the earth, what's the brightest spot on earth that you would see?'' New York? London? Paris? ''No, it's the Saudi Arabian oil fields, because they're burning the gas,'' Dr. Durbin said. ''The Saudis are flaring enough gas to fuel two-thirds of the road transport of Western Europe. They try to pump some of it back into the ground, but they can't - it's too much. So they flare it - 130-octane fuel being flared away.''</p>
