        <p>Strong Satire -- On the subjects of Hollywood ("The Player," "Mistress") and politics ("Bob Roberts"). Silly Ratings -- Three major misfires: "Home Alone 2" (a sadistic PG), "Batman Returns" (PG-13, nice for the tie-in toy market but not representative of the film's double-entendres and mean-spirited mood) and "Basic Instinct" (if this is an R-worthy thriller, Sharon Stone is Santa Claus).</p>

        <p>Strong Satire -- On the subjects of Hollywood ("The Player," "Mistress") and politics ("Bob Roberts"). Silly Ratings -- Three major misfires: "Home Alone 2" (a sadistic PG), "Batman Returns" (PG-13, nice for the tie-in toy market but not representative of the film's double-entendres and mean-spirited mood) and "Basic Instinct" (if this is an R-worthy thriller, Sharon Stone is Santa Claus).</p>
        <p>A Deadlier New Strain of Femme Fatale -- Sharon Stone and her various weapons, the vengeance-minded Kati Outinen in Aki Kaurismaki's "Match Factory Girl," Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn stretching the limits of self-improvement in "Death Becomes Her." Special breed of femme fatale: Jaye Davidson's one-of-a-kind performance in "The Crying Game." Home Video Alert -- "Far and Away," "The Power of One," "Memoirs of an Invisible Man," "Gladiator," "Straight Talk," "Year of the Comet" and "Man Trouble" are part of the Hollywood effluvia that will wash up on unsuspecting VCR's long after 1992 is gone. Strange Bedfellows -- Malcolm X and the Baroque composer known only as Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, subjects of the year's most surprising screen biographies, "Malcolm X" and "Tous les Matins du Monde." Both films are surprising for many reasons, not least the fact that they actually exist. Proof That There Are Limits to Prurient Interest -- The weak box-office performance of "Husbands and Wives," a troubling work but also one of Woody Allen's best films. Possible explanation of the public's reluctance: Mr. Allen's "Shadows and Fog," released several months earlier. Global Warming -- Crowd-pleasing films from Ireland ("The Playboys," "Hear My Song") and China ("Raise the Red Lantern") change the shape of the foreign film market. Thanks to Aki Kaurismaki, frozen Finland looks equally hot. Racial Harmony -- A major topic in many films this year, handled most successfully when dealt with head-on. Better tough talk ("Malcolm X," "White Men Can't Jump") or well-observed characters ("One False Move," "Love Field") than no talk at all ("Sister Act," "The Bodyguard"). Even "Lethal Weapon 3" managed to be smart about this.</p>
