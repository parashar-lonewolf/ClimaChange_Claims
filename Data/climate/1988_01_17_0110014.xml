        <p>LEAD: I DON'T know about anyone else, but I'm very impressed with all the information we get from the Government in Washington. I'm especially impressed with statistics about the Gross National Product, the percentage of unemployment, the trade deficit, personal income and the like. Just think about the amount of work it takes to compile those figures and the number of people who must be involved.</p>

        <p>I DON'T know about anyone else, but I'm very impressed with all the information we get from the Government in Washington. I'm especially impressed with statistics about the Gross National Product, the percentage of unemployment, the trade deficit, personal income and the like. Just think about the amount of work it takes to compile those figures and the number of people who must be involved. No wonder they can't reduce the Federal payroll.</p>
        <p>Take the Gross National Product, otherwise known as the G.N.P., for example. Think how difficult it must be to gather the figures necessary to compile the sum total of the value of all the goods and services produced by the whole country during a given period of time. Getting all that information from all the companies and individuals in the country who make something to sell must be a tremendous undertaking. Especially when you consider people like my Uncle Seth, who whittles small animals and sells them to neighbors.</p>
        <p>I know Uncle Seth would never fill out a monthly report on how many animals he made or sold and send it to Washington or anywhere else.</p>
        <p>Maybe, if people don't send in reports, they call them up. But that brings up the question of how they would know about people like Uncle Seth? Maybe the F.B.I. is involved. See what I mean about its taking a lot of people to do this?</p>
        <p>And we've just been talking about the goods produced. How about all the services? How do they know how much the paperboy made last month or the man who mows your lawn, or the baby-sitter? I'm sure this must take a lot of doing, especially when you're dealing with a lot of people like Uncle Seth who consider it an invasion of privacy if you ask him, ''Isn't it a nice day?''</p>
        <p>Another thing I've wondered about is why I never got asked for a report or called or anything. I was in a service profession and not only wasn't I asked, neither were any of my colleagues in the same profession. Somebody goofed and I think that it's demeaning to be left out of such important data.</p>
        <p>Often the figures are so precise that you know they have to be accurate. The other night the man on the television news said that personal income was up 0.7 percent in September. Now that's what I call accuracy. How they ever came by that figure is a real mystery. Again, I wasn't asked what my income was in that month and none of my friends were asked either. F.B.I. again?</p>
        <p>Sometimes I find nongovernment statistics puzzling. I read the other day in a medical journal that 50 percent of all pregnancies miscarry in the first two weeks after conception. I can't figure out how they know that because at this time even the potential mother doesn't know that she is pregnant and if she doesn't know, who does? Maybe this has something to do with the business of the Government invading the privacy of the bedroom that everyone was arguing about recently.</p>
        <p>A recent press release from a Congressman's office mentioned a health statistic from Government sources. ''Fifty thousand lives are ended prematurely due to the airborne chemical precursors to acid rain,'' it said. ''That's 140 American lives per day.'' Come, come, Government, you can do better than that. Fifty thousand per year would actually be 136.98 or 136.61 a day depending on whether it's leap year or not.</p>
        <p>Diagnosing a death that is due to the precursor of air pollution is another matter. The release didn't say how that is done. I should make it clear that I am on the Congressman's side when it comes to acid rain and air pollution. I am sure that it is inimical to some people's health; I'm just not clear about the statistics. Maybe they need a few more people in the department of statistic gathering.</p>
        <p>When it comes to that, perhaps this isn't the way it's done at all. Perhaps no one is chasing Uncle Seth or has overlooked me or my friends. Perhaps the whole thing is done by a few bureaucrats sitting in a back room somewhere. I can see it all in my mind's eye.</p>
        <p>It's morning and they're sitting around drinking coffee when someone pipes up and says, ''Say, isn't today the day we have to give out the unemployment figures?''</p>
        <p>''Oh, yeah,'' someone else says, ''I did it last month. This time it's Tom's turn.''</p>
        <p>''O.K,'' Tom says, ''anyone know someone who lost his job or got one last month?''</p>
        <p>''I do,'' says one of them who is sitting in the corner. ''My cousin Hugo was out of work for over a year and last week he got a job at MacDonald's.''</p>
        <p>''Great,'' Tom replies, ''I think things are looking up. Let's make it 5.9 percent this month. While we're thinking about that, remember that tomorrow the figures on personal savings are due. Why don't one of you jokers call up a couple of banks and ask them if the balance in their savings accounts went up or down in November?''</p>
        <p>On thinking it over, I believe that this is probably the best way to do it. No one has to send in reports, no one gets called on the telephone during dinner and asked if his bank balance is up or down this month, and best of all, the Government payroll doesn't have to go up.</p>
        <p>Speaking of getting called on the telephone, I always wonder who the people are who get to answer all the questions on the public opinion polls. I ask everyone I meet about getting called and so far no one I know has been.</p>
        <p>The respondents are supposed to be a representative sample of the population so I guess that makes me and my friends some kind of nuts. I'm sure that if I were called, it would be at a very inconvenient time and I would say the first thing that popped into my head.</p>
        <p>For instance, if I was called and asked whom I liked in the Presidential race, I would blurt out the first name that came into my head or I'd say, ''None of the above.'' Come to think of it, I might say, ''I'm sorry but the baby just ate the dog's dinner and I can't talk'' and then hang up. Maybe that's a common reaction and perhaps that's why we shouldn't pay any attention to the polls that inundate us.</p>
        <p>Better yet, maybe we should all swear off paying attention to any numbers that are tossed at us in a constant stream. As they say, it's better not to know than to know something that's wrong.</p>
