        <p>It was just the kind of phone call the New York City Health Department welcomes, however troubling: Dr. Deborah S. Asnis, an infectious disease specialist at Flushing Hospital in the Queens, reported she had two elderly patients with symptoms suggesting  neurological illness. It might be botulism, a deadly form of food-borne illness, or Guillain-Barre syndrome, a form of paralysis. But it looked more like encephalitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain.</p>
        <p>Health Department officials encourage calls like this, in hopes they will reduce chances of missing an outbreak of an unusual or dangerous disease. This call set in motion intensive medical sleuthing that led to the discovery of the first cases of St. Louis encephalitis ever in New York City. The detective work is expected to continue for weeks as baffled Federal and local health officials try to learn how the outbreak occurred and how to prevent its recurrence.</p>
        <p>Last night, the Health Department said another death from the virus had been confirmed, bringing the total to three. In all, 9 cases of St. Louis encephalitis have been confirmed, and 48 more cases are under investigation. [Page B7.]</p>
        <p>Dr. Marcelle Layton, the head of the Health Department's Bureau of Communicable Diseases, took that first call on Monday, Aug. 23. Dr. Asnis told her that tests of the patients' spinal fluid suggested a viral infection, either meningitis or encephalitis. Dr. Layton urged Dr. Asnis to send specimens of the patients' spinal fluid and blood to the New York State Health Department laboratory in Albany for additional tests to detect a virus.</p>
        <p>Summer is the season for certain infections of the central nervous system caused by viruses like ECHO or Coxsackie. One possibility was Eastern equine encephalitis, a type occasionally seen in the New York area. That afternoon, Dr. Layton sent an epidemiologist to the hospital to review the charts of the two patients and to try to find a link between them.</p>
        <p>The next day, Aug. 24, Dr. Layton's staff discussed the cases at its regular weekly review of ongoing investigations of outbreaks. But even as they were reviewing the information they had, more cases were occurring, unbeknown to them.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Aug. 27, Dr. Layton and her associate, Dr. Annie Fine, called Dr. Asnis to discuss her two patients. There has been a third, Dr. Asnis told them, and even as the three doctors were speaking, another doctor interrupted to tell Dr. Asnis about a fourth case.</p>
        <p>That afternoon, Dr. Layton called the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to discuss the possibility of botulism. She considered the diagnosis unlikely because most of the patients had a fever, which generally is not a feature of botulism. C.D.C. experts agreed. But a test was done to be sure.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Aug. 28, a fifth case was reported from another hospital.</p>
        <p>Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine, concerned about the small but growing number of cases, went to Flushing Hospital to review the patients' charts firsthand.</p>
        <p>''As we were sitting in the hospital we heard of another case,'' the sixth, Dr. Layton said.</p>
        <p>The six patients' symptoms were not identical. Nevertheless, Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine said they were struck by certain similarities of clinical and laboratory findings among the patients. All had been active and healthy with only minor medical problems before developing this new illness. Now muscle weakness was a striking feature. Fever and mental confusion were also present, but in varying degrees.</p>
        <p>By now the Health Department doctors were worrying about a possible widespread problem. They issued an E-mail bulletin asking doctors at other hospitals in New York City to report patients with a similar illness.</p>
        <p>That Saturday, Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine interviewed patients' families. But there were no common threads -- no other illnesses in the same household or among their friends, no recent travel, trips to the same beaches, or shopping, eating or socializing at the same place.</p>
        <p>''The only common thread was they spent time outdoors in their backyards,'' Dr. Layton said. ''Some were gardeners.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Layton went to her office that Saturday night to consult textbooks for information on encephalitis, so she and Dr. Fine could review it.</p>
        <p>Gradually, St. Louis encephalitis virus became a strong suspect in part because of its tendency to cause more severe illness among older people. It is most common in the Southern and Western states, although a small number of cases of St. Louis encephalitis have been reported in upstate New York as far north as the Canadian border over the years. But it had never been reported in New York City. The infection is usually transmitted by certain breeds of mosquitoes that usually feed on migratory birds. Humans become infected as bystanders.</p>
        <p>By Sunday morning, Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine were on the phone to the C.D.C.'s emergency number, and then to Dr. Duane J. Gubler, an expert in arboviruses, which are spread by insects, at C.D.C.'s field station in Fort Collins, Colo.</p>
        <p>Their suspicions were focusing on St. Louis encephalitis, and tests of blood and spinal fluid confirmed them last Friday.</p>
        <p>Now that they know what caused the outbreak, the doctors want to know why it happened here, and why now. ''Queens is not where you expect it to occur,'' Dr. Gubler said in an interview. ''The key question is: Why did it occur in the summer of 1999?'' To help solve the mystery, the Federal center is joining with New York State and City health officials to expand the team of epidemiologists, virologists, entomologists and other scientists. This week they are studying the ecology of mosquitoes and birds and trying to determine the extent of the outbreak in the region.</p>
        <p>Usually, such investigations are aided by information from Health Department surveillance programs aimed at detecting unusual activity of birds and the insects that transmit viral diseases to them and humans. New York City, however, has not had an arbovirus surveillance system in place because of the rarity of transmission of such viruses in the city, the health officials said.</p>
        <p>Scientists will go into the areas of known and suspected viral transmission to determine the density and distribution of mosquitoes there and to collect a variety of bird species. The collections will be sent to Albany and Fort Collins for viral tests.</p>
        <p>The aim of all the testing is to document the species of mosquitoes and birds involved in the transmission of the virus, determine whether spraying efforts have been effective, and find out what environmental factors might have led mosquitoes to breed in larger numbers this year.</p>
        <p>The most likely culprit is the Culex pipiens mosquito, Dr. Gubler said; the hypothesis is that mosquitoes in New York City bit infected birds migrating from Southern states.</p>
        <p>Textbooks say that the following climatic scenario favors the transmission of St. Louis encephalitis virus: a relatively mild winter, wet spring and hot, dry summer. Although they fit the conditions in New York City this year, many places have had similar weather, abundant mosquitoes and no encephalitis.</p>
        <p>Whether the St. Louis virus was introduced into the New York City area for the first time this year or whether it has been lurking undetected for several years and suddenly exploded this summer because of unusual weather conditions is not known, the health officials said.</p>
        <p>''Global warming has nothing to do with'' the outbreak in New York City, Dr. Gubler said.</p>
        <p>The team hopes to conduct a study among residents of Queens and other infected areas, testing their blood for, among other things, proteins known as immunoglobulin G and M, signs of infection with the St. Louis virus. The M protein usually lasts about 60 days after infection, while G persists for life. Comparisons of the frequency of the two proteins among the participants should provide ''a good estimate of how much transmission occurred,'' Dr. Gubler said.</p>
        <p>By correlating the findings with the ages of the participants, the scientists can estimate when the infections occurred. Also, they can learn how many people were infected but did not become ill from the virus.</p>
        <p>Although infected mosquitoes can carry the virus during the winter and transmit it again next year, it is impossible to predict whether St. Louis encephalitis will reappear next summer, although an active surveillance program could provide a warning, Dr. Gubler said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Layton and Dr. Fine cautioned against overburdening laboratories with requests for tests for the St. Louis virus. They said that it was highly unlikely that the many individuals with a history of mosquito bites who were seeking medical care for mild headaches had St. Louis encephalitis, because experience in previous outbreaks has shown that only one in 1,000 mosquitoes carried the virus. Most such individuals do not require a blood test for the infection, the health officials said.</p>
        <p>Laboratories at the New York State Health Department and Fort  Collins will have to work overtime just to test all the specimens from seriously ill patients in hospitals and the surveys to determine the extent of infection among birds and insects, the health officials said.</p>
