        <p>Now that that the right to pollute can be bought, sold or traded like baseball cards, a Connecticut utility has found another approach: donating it to charity.</p>
        <p>The company, Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and large parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, announced that it would donate 10,000 tons of emissions allowances, worth about $3 million, to American Lung Association chapters in those states. The donations amount to about 7 percent of the company's total allowances.</p>
        <p>The association, as a fund-raising gimmick, will turn around and give donors and volunteers what it is calling "Atmosphere Savings Bonds," each worth one ton of pollution, but these are symbolic. In practice the allowances will be retired, so the pollution will never be emitted.</p>
        <p>The Lung Association believes the arrangement is the first of its kind, although a small environmental organization in Cleveland has been soliciting donations so it can buy emission allowances and then rip them up. Opposition to Sales</p>
        <p>Sales of allowances, including a proposed deal between the Long Island Lighting Company and a Midwestern coal supplier, have angered some environmentalists, who say that the result may be to concentrate the pollution, mostly acid rain, in vulnerable areas, and that the right to pollute should not be a commodity.</p>
        <p>But Bernard M. Fox, the president of Northeast, said the company also sees the allowances as a commodity of a sort. "We have a certain corporate asset, and we decided to dispose of a certain part of it in a certain way," he said.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who announced the donation at a ceremony here, said that when Congress wrote the trading scheme into the Clean Air Act of 1990, "frankly, we didn't think about the possibility that some allowances might be donated to charity. But charitable contributions are part of the market."</p>
        <p>In fact, Northeast has a far larger stock of allowances, some of which it will sell, and even this donation will not cost it much. "In the great tradition of the United States, we will be taking a tax deduction," Mr. Fox said. If the company sold the allowances it would pay about 41 percent of the proceeds in state and Federal tax, but if it donates them it will reduce its tax bill by 41 percent of the the value of the donation. 'A Bold New Step'</p>
        <p>Whatever the motive, the Lung Association was delighted. The contribution "signals a bold new step toward cleaner air," said Dr. Lee B. Reichman, the association's president.</p>
        <p>Asked what he thought of Lilco's sale of allowances that might end up increasing emissions in the Midwest, which would then blow back into the Northeast, he said, "I'm sure that the Nassau-Suffolk chapter of the American Lung Association would be pleased to receive a similar donation."</p>
        <p>The plan to reduce acid emissions, which come mostly from high-sulfur coal, was adopted mainly to protect forests and lakes from acid rain.</p>
        <p>The precise value of the allowances is not certain, but should be clear on March 29, when the Chicago Board of Trade is to announce the results of a computerized auction of allowances held under the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>Lilco, in a deal made public earlier this week, has sold an option to a fuel supplier, Amax Energy, to buy allowances, but the price and volume were not disclosed. United Illuminating, which serves the Bridgeport and New Haven areas, has sold a similar option.</p>
        <p>Northeast has a huge windfall of allowances because of the way the Clean Air Act was written. The act aims to cut the 1980 level of emissions in half by 2000, and assigns allowances to utilities based on the fuel they used in 1985 and 1986. But since then, Northeast has opened two nuclear reactors and concluded an agreement to buy power from Hydro Quebec. All those sources are sulfur-free, so it has allowances left over.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said the company would use most of the revenue from allowance sales on conservation and other environmental activities.</p>
