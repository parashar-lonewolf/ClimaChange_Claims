        <p>On an industrial strip of land hemming Newtown Creek, pipelines snake low to the ground, connecting an array of giant beige oil tanks.</p>
        <p>From outward appearances, this little patch of Texas in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, would not seem to easily fit into Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan for a greener, less petroleum-dependent future.</p>
        <p>But this fuel terminal may soon be home to one of the largest biodiesel fuel manufacturing plants in the country. The terminal's owner, the Metro Fuel Oil Corporation, is awaiting city approval to produce 110 million gallons of fuel a year from raw vegetable oils. The output would amount to more than 40 percent of the biodiesel fuel produced in the country last year.</p>
        <p>The Greenpoint plant and a smaller proposed plant in Red Hook, Brooklyn, both scheduled to open next year, would be the first biodiesel refineries in the city, hitching onto an industry that has been concentrated in the Midwest and the South.</p>
        <p>The growth and eastward expansion of the industry are being driven by high petroleum prices and government programs aimed at reducing pollution and demand for foreign oil. But these changes are also creating concerns that the push for alternative fuels, if not managed carefully, could have unintended consequences like deforestation and higher food prices in the race to convert more land for fuel crop production.</p>
        <p>''We have to pick the right policies and the best technologies,'' said Ron Pernick, co-founder of Clean Edge, a Portland, Ore., research and consulting company. ''But when done right, the move to biofuels addresses a number of issues, from the volatile prices of fossil fuels, to reliance on foreign supplies, to climate change, to job creation.''</p>
        <p>Metro, a family-owned company that employs about 130 people (another 35 would come on when biodiesel production begins, officials say), added biodiesel fuel to its traditional petroleum line about two years ago, trucking it in from out of state.</p>
        <p>As oil prices spiked last summer, soaring to $78 a barrel, the demand for alternative fuels like biodiesel shot up. ''You just couldn't get enough of it,'' said Tom Torre, the company's chief operating officer. He and the company's owners, Paul J. and Gene V. Pullo, envisioned barges steaming up the East River loaded with soybean oil from crushing plants in Maryland and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''The cost factors were there,'' Mr. Torre said. ''And we thought, 'You know, we could put a plant right here in the city.' ''</p>
        <p>Supporters of biodiesel fuel say it is attractive because it comes from renewable sources, like soybeans, palm and seed oils and animal fats. It emits fewer greenhouse gases, which are linked to rising global temperatures, and less particulate matter than conventional diesel. Typically blended with conventional diesel, it can be used in most diesel engines and oil furnaces with little or no adjustment. On the downside, it typically costs more than regular diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>Tri-State Biodiesel, the other New York operator scheduled to begin production next year, plans to use recycled restaurant grease as its feed source, said Brent Baker, the company's chief executive. The company is awaiting state and city permits to begin producing 3 million gallons of biodiesel a year on an industrial site in Red Hook. Mr. Baker said he had agreements with some 400 restaurants in Manhattan to collect their used grease at no cost.</p>
        <p>Oil refineries once crowded the banks of Newtown Creek in Greenpoint, belching smoke and noxious fumes until the last of them closed in the 1960s. Left behind was a terrain and waterway so contaminated that lawsuits over their cleanup continue to this day.</p>
        <p>By contrast, biodiesel fuel makers say their production methods are vastly cleaner, and safer. The refining process is emission-free, typically mixing raw vegetable oil with an industrial alcohol like methanol and a catalyst, typically sodium hydroxide, to cause a chemical transformation. The byproducts include some methanol, which can be reused, and glycerin, which can be sold for use in soap and other products.</p>
        <p>While the process is not entirely benign -- the methanol is explosive -- the National Biodiesel Board, a trade group, says biodiesel is no more toxic than table salt and biodegrades faster than sugar.</p>
        <p>Community response for the Red Hook plant has been largely supportive, according to Tri-State. Fewer know about the plans for the Greenpoint plant, said Gerald A. Esposito, district manager of Community Board 1.</p>
        <p>''The board hasn't taken a position on it, but I'm kind of excited about it,'' Mr. Esposito said. ''It'll bring jobs, and from what I understand there's no odor; if there's anything that spills it would be negligible.''</p>
        <p>With plans for the New York refineries under way and others popping up or planned in New Jersey, Washington State and elsewhere, production of biodiesel could reach 1.7 billion gallons next year, up from 250 million gallons in 2006, according to the National Biodiesel Board.</p>
        <p>While biodiesel is mainly used in transportation, Paul Nazzarro, a consultant with the biodiesel board, sees home heating as the next big growth sector, particularly in the Northeast, where heating oil has lost customers to natural gas.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Torre and Mr. Baker say building a New York market will be a challenge, heightened by the price difference and the unfamiliarity of the product. And diesel cars do not meet New York State emissions standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg's environmental sustainability plan could help build the market, city officials say. Called PlaNYC, it includes a raft of measures, including the use of alternative fuels like biodiesel.</p>
        <p>''By introducing things in New York, or by doing them ourselves or giving incentives, we also create a market,'' said Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding. ''When you create a market, the price comes down, and as price comes down more people use the product, so you create a virtuous cycle.''</p>
        <p>Elements of the plan call for eventually using biodiesel in school boilers, and in the city's entire heavy-duty truck fleet, numbering in the thousands of vehicles. The city's Parks and Recreation and Sanitation Departments are already using it.</p>
        <p>The state requires a biodiesel content of at least 2 percent in the fuel used in all of its buildings and trucks. And last year, lawmakers in Albany enacted a tax credit that pays people up to 20 cents per gallon if they blend biodiesel fuel with home heating oil in their furnaces.</p>
        <p>But as the biofuels market broadens, some industry watchers say there are downsides. Environmentalists warn of forests being razed, as is happening in Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia, to clear land for palm oil plantations used in biodiesel and sugar cane used in ethanol.</p>
        <p>Some also worry that farmers may devote more land to fuel crops and less to crops meant to feed people and cattle, driving up prices of vegetables and meats.</p>
        <p>Janet Larsen, research director for the Earth Policy Institute, an environmental group, says the amount of grain it takes to fill a sport utility vehicle's 25-gallon tank with ethanol would feed a person for a year.</p>
        <p>''Turning food crops into fuel crops does not make sense, economically or for the environment,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker says the concerns highlight the need for more fuel-efficient vehicles, and more research into resources like algae, which can yield more oil per acre than soybeans.</p>
        <p>''I think anyone who looks into the question of sustainability will hear again and again that there is no silver bullet,'' Mr. Baker said. ''We have to be more efficient, we have to use less and we have toget more renewable fuels with fewer acres.''</p>
