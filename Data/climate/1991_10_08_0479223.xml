        <p>The people are going to the polls this Tuesday in a bitterly contested election, but no one here in Vermont's largest city is talking about schools or crime or throwing a rascal out of office. In fact, no one is even running for office.</p>
        <p>In a referendum that has citizens debating human rights and analyzing energy-demand forecasts, residents of Burlington will decide a single question: whether to buy hydroelectric power generated in the Canadian subarctic.</p>
        <p>A similar debate is unfolding in neighboring New York State, which has signed a tentative accord to buy 1,800 megawatts of Quebec hydropower despite environmentalists' complaints that it would contribute to the devastation of both the wilderness and the Cree Indian culture in the remote James Bay region, where the electricity is generated.</p>
        <p>But unlike New York, where the final decision is left to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and officials of the New York Power Authority, Burlington and several other communities in Vermont, a state where town meetings are still used to resolve many local questions, are letting the people decide.</p>
        <p>And like it or not, residents here are scrutinizing the hydropower issue, which in both states pits claims of cleaner air at home against protests that buying the power would contribute to environmental degradation elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The amount of electricity at issue in Burlington's 25-year, $92 million contract, 15 megawatts, is 20 percent of this city's total electricity demand, although it is minuscule by New York standards, less than half the amount needed to supply one of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. But in a city that has conducted advisory referendums on United States aid to the El Salvador Government (the no's won) and to the Nicaraguan contras (again, no), many people appear eager to weigh in on a matter that could involve the fate of the Cree Indians and the Canadian wilderness hundreds of miles to the north.</p>
        <p>What is perhaps more surprising is that there is no unanimity on the issue. While virtually everybody here claims progressive credentials and respect for the environment, there are strong proponents on both sides.</p>
        <p>In a similar referendum taken in March, the people voted 54 percent to 46 percent in favor of buying the Quebec hydropower. But those results were thrown out by a state judge who determined that copies of an analysis by the Burlington Electric Department favoring the contract had been placed in many voting booths. The judge called a new election.</p>
        <p>This new election seems to have generated far more publicity, as well as more friction. Mayor Peter Clavelle strongly opposes the contract, arguing both that it would be more expensive than alternatives within the state and that it would make residents complicit in altering the way of life of the Crees, who say that the planned flooding of the Great Whale River in their homeland near James Bay would destroy traditional hunting and fishing grounds.</p>
        <p>Interviews with two dozen people at lunchtime in downtown Burlington recently found many more who said they would vote "no" on Tuesday than those who planned to vote for it. Most cited concerns about the Indians, while others said they thought conservation would be cheaper.</p>
        <p>Brian McCrae, a 31-year-old portrait artist, said he found the issue to be a "close call" because not buying the power might mean more pollution here from fossil fuels if people are "too lazy" to pursue more aggressive conservation. But, he said, he had decided to vote no, because "otherwise you're going to be contributing to something that will wreck the environment and the Indian lands in Quebec."</p>
        <p>But others, like Paul Cuddyer, an optician, said it was "Canada's problem" to conduct environmental studies on James Bay. In the meantime, he said, Burlington should complete the contract because he believed it would bring lower electric rates.</p>
        <p>Although both sides generally agree that there is no short-term benefit to buying hydropower because of the current glut of energy in New England, Samuel H. Press, a member of the Burlington electric commission and a proponent of the contract, said he was certain that eventually the price of oil, gas and other sources would rise, making the hydropower a bargain.</p>
        <p>"It's just unwise to think the glut is going to continue," he said.</p>
