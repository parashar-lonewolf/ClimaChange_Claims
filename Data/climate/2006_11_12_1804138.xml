        <p>PATIENCE, humility and a disdain for the pink flamingo may be the keys to a well-kempt lawn. But in some towns, a good set of earplugs is also required.</p>
        <p>The roar of leaf blowers is ubiquitous in suburbia. And over the last 30 years, scores of cities and towns have moved to muffle them -- adopting restrictions or outright bans, particularly in the summer, when they are deemed less than necessary.</p>
        <p>In Greenwich, Conn., landscapers can use just one machine per property from Memorial Day to Labor Day. In Montclair, N.J., leaf blowers are banned in the summer and winter.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the restrictions have been more about curbing noise than cutting hydrocarbon emissions. But now, in Westchester County, officials are taking an environmentally driven approach.</p>
        <p>Andrew J. Spano, the county executive, has introduced legislation that would require county officials and home improvement contractors operating in Westchester to replace their old leaf blowers with newer, cleaner models by Jan. 1, 2009.</p>
        <p>The average gas-powered leaf blower produces as much pollution in an hour as the typical passenger vehicle during 2,000 miles of travel, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. And Westchester officials said the Spano measure would slash local emissions by 10 tons per year.</p>
        <p>The bill is the latest effort in a series of small-bore initiatives intended to improve Westchester's environmental record. In recent years, the county has purchased hybrid vehicles and installed high-efficiency lighting in its buildings. And last month, Mr. Spano announced the formation of a global warming task force, charged with crafting a 10-year greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I can solve global warming,'' said Mr. Spano, a Democrat, in a recent interview. ''I just think we can demonstrate, by our actions, what local government can do.''</p>
        <p>George Oros, a Republican who is minority leader in the Westchester County Board of Legislators, said he supported efforts to curb global warming. But he questioned Mr. Spano's priorities.</p>
        <p>''I wish we had a panel on how to reduce property taxes before we worry about global warming,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The county executive's leaf blower initiative is not entirely unprecedented. In February and March, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, a pollution control agency with jurisdiction over Orange County, Calif., and large parts of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, sold 1,500 low-emissions leaf blowers at a reduced price to landscapers who turned in older, dirtier models. The district plans a similar exchange next year.</p>
        <p>Joseph Tinelli, president of the New York State Turf and Landscape Association, said he favored the development of low-emissions leaf blowers. But Mr. Tinelli, who is also president of a Yonkers-based landscaping business, said contractors should not have to pay for the newer, cleaner models.</p>
        <p>''I think the onus of responsibility lies between the feds and the manufacturers,'' he said. ''Why, as contractors, do we have to throw out our machines?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tinelli acknowledged, however, that most landscapers replace their leaf blowers every two or three years anyway. And Mr. Spano said a phase-in provision of the bill, requiring contractors to replace half their leaf blowers by 2008 and the rest by 2009, should cushion the blow. He said leaf blowers, including the newer models, cost about $500.</p>
        <p>If the bill passes, county officials will start spot-checking contractors' work sites to verify compliance in 2009. Violators could face fines of $1,000 or revocations of their licenses to operate.</p>
