        <p>President Clinton used a gathering of Pacific Rim leaders here to reassure the world today that the current financial turmoil in Asia is temporary and that leaders were acting aggressively to stem it.</p>
        <p>The President also said that the United States would exercise its economic muscle to promote sound economic policies in the region and to pry open global markets for a range of goods and services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, appearing at a news conference with Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, said that despite the sharp strains being suffered by a number of Asian countries, the overall economic future of the region remained promising.</p>
        <p>''I think this is a time for confidence in the future of Asia and confidence in the future of our relationship with them,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''We have a few little glitches in the road here; we're working through them.''</p>
        <p>Those ''glitches'' include South Korea's call last week for a huge loan from the International Monetary Fund to stem a spiraling financial crisis, as well as earlier bailouts for Thailand and Indonesia. Currencies in the region have plummeted and markets around the world have gyrated in recent weeks as investors worried that the Asian contagion might spread.</p>
        <p>As if to signal that he felt that the Asian financial problems could be contained without a large-scale economic meltdown, Mr. Clinton spent the afternoon today playing golf with Mr. Chretien and Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of Singapore.</p>
        <p>In what is likely to be the most concrete outcome of the three-day economic conference of Pacific Rim nations, the President also hailed  new, American-backed market-opening initiatives as evidence that Asian nations remain willing to work with the United States to liberalize trade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton passed up a chance to use the trade proposals -- potentially covering $1.5 trillion in trade in items from toys to medical devices -- to renew his call for new negotiating authority known as ''fast track.''</p>
        <p>His aides said that Mr. Clinton cannot hope to achieve the tariff reductions outlined here unless Congress grants the President the new trade-negotiating authority that it withheld from him earlier this month. Fast-track authority would allow the President to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could approve or reject, but not amend.</p>
        <p>But these aides said the potential deals outlined here would show recalcitrant Democrats in the House of Representatives how much the United States has to gain from pushing other nations to drop trade barriers.</p>
        <p>The trade initiative is ''the best possible argument to the United States Congress as to why we have to stay engaged,'' said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>Trade ministers from the 18 members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or Apec, agreed late on Saturday to work to phase out tariffs on nine categories of products and services within two years, and to persuade the European Union and other major trading partners to go along as well.</p>
        <p>The largest categories, from an American perspective, are chemicals, which accounted for $61.8 billion in exports from the United States last year; energy-related goods and services, which had exports of $51.6 billion; and medical equipment, which accounted for $20 billion in exports.</p>
        <p>The ministers also agreed to work in coming years to reduce tariffs on other types of goods and services, although they did not immediately set a timetable for action. The categories include rubber, food, fertilizers, cars and civil aircraft.</p>
        <p>American officials had been concerned that Asian nations would be unwilling to take steps to open their markets and expose their troubled economies to more competition.</p>
        <p>But officials said that at a meeting of trade officials on Friday, representatives of Thailand made a strong plea to other Asian countries to agree to more free trade as a way of reassuring investors that they were committed to economic reform. That plea, they said, helped bring along nations that might otherwise have been reluctant to commit themselves to further trade deals.</p>
        <p>Still, it remains unclear whether either the United States or the other nations here will be able to follow through and reach final agreements. In nearly all of the biggest product categories discussed here, the Administration would need fast-track authority to complete a deal, and despite the optimism expressed here by Administration officials, there is no assurance that the White House will have the votes it needs in Congress.</p>
        <p>Moreover, some nations, including Japan, said they would not go along with the tariff reductions in all categories. And any further economic problems in the region could lead governments to postpone or reconsider their trade commitments.</p>
        <p>In a matter unrelated to the conference's agenda, Mr. Chretien today again lobbied Mr. Clinton to join a global treaty banning anti-personnel land mines. Canada has been a leader in calling for the abolition of the weapons but the United States has resisted, saying it needs mines to protect its troops along the border between North and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton noted that the United States was rapidly destroying obsolete mines and those intended solely to kill people, rather than to slow the advance of tanks and artillery.</p>
        <p>However, he said, ''My first responsibility, since I may have to send our troops into conflict situations on behalf of a lot of the nations that have signed on to this treaty, is to make sure that if I do that I can protect them. Now, that is my position.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chretien vowed goodnaturedly to ''keep the pressure, gentle pressure, on the President.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that while global warming is not on the list of formal Apec topics, he would take the occasion to offer reassurance to developing nations that the industrial world would not seek to cripple their growth by imposing harsh limits on emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
