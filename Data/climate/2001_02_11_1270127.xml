        <p>The terrifying shark attack and the victim's courageous escape might have rated an extreme episode on this season's ''Survivor,'' where the participants navigate the hazards of Australia.</p>
        <p>Richard Butler, 48, was surfing about 100 yards off Brooms Head, 450 miles north of Sydney, when a six-foot bull shark attacked. Unlike five other men -- three surfers and two fishermen -- who have been mauled to death since August, Mr. Butler managed to get away.</p>
        <p>Over the past 30 years, the annual average shark toll has been one dead, according to John West, an official who maintains the National Shark Attack File. The last six months have been the bloodiest period ever recorded. Experts on sharks seem at a loss to explain the fatalities, which have occurred in both the Pacific and Indian Oceans, along a stretch between the Great Barrier Reef and Australia's western coast -- a distance comparable to that between New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Peter Benchley, whose novel ''Jaws,'' about shark attacks off Long Island, became a scary 1975 movie, wrote in a recent article that the spate of attacks was a ''freak occurrence'' of ''tragic mistakes without malice to man'' -- though he said that commercial fishing endangered shark populations worldwide.</p>
        <p>A leading authority on sharks, Dr. John Paxton of Sydney's Australian Museum, says the rise in attacks is no more than a spike in the averages -- and could even be expected, given the 50 percent increase in population on the coasts, where most of the country's 19 million people live, and the doubling of foreign tourism since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paxton, an American researcher who has worked here for 30 years and swims daily in Sydney Harbor, wrote the shark danger analysis for the mile-long Olympic swim in the harbor last September, giving the assurance that the 100 triathlon swimmers were racing at ''virtually nil risk.''</p>
        <p>''The only feeding frenzy is by the media,'' he said, alluding to headlines testifying to the fascination and fear engendered by shark attacks.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paxton says shark populations are hard to track and that research does not yet confirm anecdotal evidence that global warming and coastal uses are changing their habits and movements.</p>
        <p>Another authority, Dr. John Glaister, fisheries adviser to Barrier Reef officials, said some declining species warrant protection. Two of the largest sharks -- the white pointer, which grows to 18 feet in length, and the gray nurse, up to 9 feet -- have been protected since 1997 by federal laws on endangered species. Dr. Paxton and other researchers said this status should be maintained, although pointers are blamed for three of the latest fatal attacks.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the news media have feasted on the dramatic tale of Mr. Butler, a vacationing schoolteacher who has surfed for more than 30 years. His attacker gouged a fist-size hole in his left calf, which required 80 stitches to close.</p>
        <p>''The shark musn't have liked my taste and a mouthful of fiberglass from my surfboard, because he let me go,'' he said. Smacking the water with one hand in the hope that his attacker ''wouldn't come back and have another go,'' Mr. Butler paddled his board to within 50 yards of the shore then caught a ''beautiful wave'' to a deserted beach.</p>
        <p>There, Mr. Butler said, he used his surfboard rope to make a tourniquet above his left knee. He held bleeding muscle in place and staggered 500 yards to a village to find help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butler plans to resume surfing when he recovers. ''I was terrified, but I don't blame the shark,'' he said. ''I was the intruder in his space.''</p>
