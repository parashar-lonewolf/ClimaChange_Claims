        <p>LEAD: AH, SPRING, a time of rebirth and renewal. Also a time of cleaning and mending. And on scales grand and small, cleaning and mending - as well as hauling, painting and waxing (hot waxing at that) - are going on all across the state.</p>

        <p>LEAD: AH, SPRING, a time of rebirth and renewal. Also a time of cleaning and mending. And on scales grand and small, cleaning and mending - as well as hauling, painting and waxing (hot waxing at that) - are going on all across the state.</p>
        <p>AH, SPRING, a time of rebirth and renewal. Also a time of cleaning and mending. And on scales grand and small, cleaning and mending - as well as hauling, painting and waxing (hot waxing at that) - are going on all across the state.</p>
        <p>Nikki O'Neill, the Governor's wife, has been looking at windows. At the Governor's Mansion in Hartford, state workers have put up scaffolding so they can recaulk, repair and wash every window of the three-story house. And, said Mrs. O'Neill: ''I've been home in East Hampton, washing windows. Two girlfriends came over to help me.''</p>
        <p>At Mystic Seaport, outdoor bronze statues - of dolphins, seals, and a boy and a seagull - are getting their annual hot wax treatment.</p>
        <p>''It's to protect the bronze from the corrosive activities of acid rain,'' said the collections supervisor, David Mathieson, as he described how staff members wash the statues with soap and water each spring, dry them and then use an acetylene torch to apply molten wax over every inch and into every crack and crevice.</p>
        <p>Vacuuming and sweeping are also under way at the museum on the Mystic River, particularly in exhibit buildings that are partly open to the elements.</p>
        <p>''They get a lot of dirt blown in in the winter,'' said a curator at Mystic Seaport, Benjamin Fuller. ''We have to go in with industrial-strength vacuums and get off the grit.'' In one large, shedlike building, volunteers are vacuuming and sweeping the hulking, ghostly remains of the Australia - a 70-foot 1862 schooner, damaged and unrestored, whose exposed frames and other bare timbers serve as an exhibit on ship construction.</p>
        <p>Sweeping is sweeping other parts of the state, too.</p>
        <p>''We sweep 12 miles of walks and 50 parking lots,'' said the grounds manager at Yale University, William Ohr.</p>
        <p>And at Hammonasset State Park in Madison, a device known as the beach sweeper is combing Hammonasset's beach, which is 2.9 miles long and laden with a winter's worth of seaweed and washed-in debris. A recreation manager at the park, Gary Thomas, described the beach sweeper as '' a big machine with tines, pulled by a tractor.''</p>
        <p>Other things are going on in state parks besides sweeping beaches. Donald Goss, a unit manager at the Department of Environmental Protection's eastern headquarters in Marlborough, there were picnic tables and fireplaces to be built and outhouses to be refurbished.</p>
        <p>Some state parks must deal, as the Seaport does, with statuary. Each spring some 30 limestone statues (of graceful goddesses, chunky flower baskets and more) and several limestone urns are hauled from storage inside the mansion at Harkness Memorial State Park in Waterford.</p>
        <p>''We put some in the breakfast room, some in the garage,'' said the park manager, Theodore Tetrault. ''We used to store some of them in the water tower.'' Each April, the limestone objects get a scrubbing and emerge to grace the Harkness gardens, just as they did early in this century when Edward and Mary Harkness held forth at their seaside estate, which later became the park.</p>
        <p>The State Department of Environmental Protection is doing some of the spring's hauling; its cargo is trout.</p>
        <p>''It's a busy season for us,'' said David Sumner, the manager of the state's Quinebaug Valley trout hatchery in Plainfield. ''Each year, we stock about 600,000 trout into public waters to be fished.'' Trout season opened yesterday, and Mr. Sumner noted that every day, from the first of March until mid-May, four trucks -each carrying from 2,500 to 3,000 trout - leave the Quinebaug Valley hatchery, bound for streams and ponds all over the state. An additional 200,000 trout, he added, come from the state's other trout hatchery, in Burlington.</p>
        <p>At the Valley Railroad in Essex, a steam locomotive is getting steam cleaned. ''We're sprucing up Engine 97, with steam cleaning,'' said a member of the Valley Railroad Company, George Cassidy. He noted that Engine 97 was built in 1923 as a stock locomotive for the Cuban sugar trade, but lately has been making excursions between Essex and Chester.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cassidy said staff members and volunteers at the tourist railroad were reassembling another 1920's locomotive, which was apart for cleaning and other work during the winter, and were also refurbishing a 1930's coach car. The line's trains begin running April 30.</p>
        <p>Spring is also the season when virtually every town in Connecticut schedules a day for residents cleaning out their homes to put large, bulky items out for regular municipal trash pickups.</p>
        <p>''Everything in your imagination'' comes out for collection, said Ernest Grant of Groton's public works department. He cited, as examples, ''stoves, stumps, sheds and shipwrecked boats.''</p>
        <p>Today in Hartford, Trinity College students and others are cleaning, painting and raking for the second annual Hartford Hunger Cleanup. The students' efforts will not only spruce up school playgrounds, neighborhood streets, Salvation Army buildings and other spots, but will also raise money for education and relief projects.</p>
        <p>''Last year about 150 students worked, and we raised $3,000,'' said the student chairwoman of the event, Laura Kearney of Trinity. ''This year it's expanded.'' Ms. Kearney noted that about 300 participants, from Trinity, other colleges and area high schools and Scout groups, were expected to work this year, and that a successful day was expected despite a gap in arrangements for a post-cleanup picnic. ''Someone donated 300 hot dogs,'' she said, ''but we have no buns yet.''</p>
        <p>The cleanup is sponsored by the National Student Campaign Against Hunger, a program of the Public Interest Research Groups, a consumer and environmental advocacy organization.</p>
