        <p>Nassau County is considering a ban on plastic containers, like the law Suffolk County passed last spring. The intent is to have them replaced by biodegradable forms of plastic or paper that will reduce the volume of waste in landfills. But it's based, at least in part, on a misconception.</p>
        <p>Municipal garbage dumps don't decompose like the compost heaps in the backyards of Long Island's suburbanites. Compost heaps get watered and aerated, ideal conditions for the bacteria and molds that do nature's recycling. Landfills are different: the trash is heavily compacted and mostly too dry for composting.</p>
        <p>Journalism is ephemeral but these very words, when they reach the bottom of a landfill 10 years hence, might still be legible. Those who have excavated old garbage dumps report finding newspapers, food waste, even bread without mold.</p>
        <p>There are good and bad reasons for worrying about plastics. Berkeley and Massachusetts have recently banned polystyrene cups, made with chlorofluorocarbons that destroy the ozone layer. Those are well-aimed shots: manufacturers have already announced they will seek alternatives to these harmful chemicals.</p>
        <p>But criticism of plastics, particularly PVC, for providing the chlorine that helps generate dioxin in incinerators, is probably misplaced; there are many other sources of chlorine in the waste stream, like bleached paper. And banning plastics in order to save space in landfills is a technically unsound proposition that could deprive consumers of useful products.</p>
        <p>Better than laws favoring one material over another would be requirements making all disposable items either reusable or safely burnable. The recycling of plastics has lagged far behind that of other materials like glass and aluminum, even though manufacturers assert that plastics are easy to recycle. Long Island's plastics ban and Mayor Koch's assault on McDonald's polystyrene containers at least focus attention on this lag.</p>
        <p>The next step, much harder, is to develop the expensive recycling systems that can separate and collect used plastics. New York State has already passed a law requiring mandatory recycling by 1992. Plastics that cannot be recycled need to be made free of lead and cadmium, toxic metals that are liberated when plastics are burned.</p>
        <p>Requiring plastics to be biodegradable or at least degradable by light would help reduce unsightly litter. Still, that's a different issue from the shortage of landfill space. The real solutions to the garbage crisis are waste reduction, recycling and incineration, not quick-fix laws that make litterbugs' lazy habits more acceptable.</p>
