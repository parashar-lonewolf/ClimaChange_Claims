        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the possible effects of the Kuwait oil well fire pollution on the world climate (perhaps including the cooler than normal summer experienced in the Northeast), it is reassuring to note that a group of 50 scientists from 14 countries has concluded the fires caused no long-term weather effects.</p>
        <p>These experts in oil combustion, atmospheric monitoring and modeling of air pollution met under auspices of the World Meteorological Organization. They found that the smoke was confined by the region's weather and geography to a horizontal layer at an altitude of 10,000 feet over the Arabian Peninsula.</p>

        <p>Regarding the possible effects of the Kuwait oil well fire pollution on the world climate (perhaps including the cooler than normal summer experienced in the Northeast), it is reassuring to note that a group of 50 scientists from 14 countries has concluded the fires caused no long-term weather effects.</p>
        <p>These experts in oil combustion, atmospheric monitoring and modeling of air pollution met under auspices of the World Meteorological Organization. They found that the smoke was confined by the region's weather and geography to a horizontal layer at an altitude of 10,000 feet over the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The stable weather conditions left much of the sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide cloud floating with little or no mixing into the upper or lower atmosphere. The cloud was never observed above 18,000 feet. Had the smoke risen above this level the winds would have spread the pollution around the globe with perhaps some possible climatic effects. But it did not.</p>
        <p>This report confirms initial estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that the pollution, while very bad locally, should not affect global weather patterns. JOE WITTE  Meteorologist, NBC News New York, Sept. 15, 1992</p>
