        <p>CONNECTICUT is coming late to the table of deregulation concerning the electric utility industry within its borders. But, though the issue may not spark wild enthusiasm among most state residents, legislation now under consideration could have a profound impact on consumers' wallets, as well as the state's environmental quality.</p>
        <p>Electric rates in the state are 35 percent higher than the national average. The question is whether restructuring of the industry will wind up costing the customer more or less than the current system. It depends entirely on the details of legislation now under consideration in the state.</p>
        <p>One group that is not waiting passively, but rather is hoping to determine the outcome is PACE, People's Action for Clean Energy. The 20-year-old, state-wide, all-volunteer organization has submitted a 30-page working paper to members of the legislature and other interested parties.</p>
        <p>At this time, electric power is a monopoly, held by the United Illuminating Company in south central Connecticut and in the rest of the state by Northeast Utilities. Each controls the generation, transmission and distribution of power in its service area.</p>
        <p>But recent Federal regulations require that the utilities move toward providing access to their transmission lines by other generating companies, thus opening up the possibility of competition. Recent technological advances have enabled smaller generating companies to set up and run power plants to take advantage of this opening.</p>
        <p>The crux of deregulation -- or restructuring, as it's being called -- is separating the generation function from the transmission and distribution functions.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest unknowns in the restructuring mix is what will happen to the up to $5 billion in ''stranded costs'' that are the result of past decisions by the utilities. These costs derive from the excess capacity that was built into the system to serve peak energy needs, and from the construction and operation of nuclear power plants, all four of which in Connecticut are now shut down, one  permanently.</p>
        <p>Northeast Utilities, which owns part or all of the four plants, wants to delay deregulation for at least six years and have business and residential customers pay for 100 percent of  ''eligible'' stranded costs -- i.e., those costs that the utility says are related to the ''regular running of the plants, costs that were approved by the state's Department of Public Utility Control,'' according to Mary Jo Keating, a spokeswoman for Northeast Utilities.</p>
        <p>She adds that the company does not expect to be reimbursed for the portion of stranded costs that is due to mismanagement -- a figure that has not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>As for the post-deregulation future, Peggy McLeod and James Newberry, both members of PACE and authors of ''Clean Energy for Connecticut: The 'Least Cost' Option for Electric Utility Restructuring,'' argue for a system of renewable, locally produced energy that they  say will provide more jobs per dollars spent, be more reliable and cause less environmental damage than the existing system. But the authors are not sanguine about their chances of succeeding.</p>
        <p>''Right now the way restructuring is happening in Connecticut, it's going to be a bailout for the nuclear industry,'' says Ms. MacLeod. ''In California the nuclear industry got a $28 billion bailout and renewables got $500 million.'' She's afraid that's what will happen here. ''Crumbs are going to go to renewables, if we get anything,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Connecticut had depended on nuclear power for 45 percent of its electricity -- making it one of the most nuclear-dependent states in the nation. Now it depends on fossil fuels (natural gas, oil and coal), which are not renewable and whose emissions cause pollution and climate change.</p>
        <p>The principal elements of PACE's proposal are:</p>
        <p>* A dramatic reduction in energy consumption.</p>
        <p>* Sustainability, meaning a shift away from depletable fuels to renewable technologies.</p>
        <p>* Providing more reliability and security by, among other things, moving away from nuclear energy and away from centralized, large-scale generators toward small plants.</p>
        <p>* Independence through small, decentralized distributors.</p>
        <p>* Price stability.</p>
        <p>Proposals that would stress low costs at first are not in PACE'S agenda. PACE and other critics say that if lowest first cost is given precedence over other concerns, then deregulation in Connecticut will mean importing energy from coal-fired plants in the Midwest -- even though those plants create pollution and, since they are not locally based, can't provide local jobs or respond to local needs.</p>
        <p>PACE's paper includes a detailed section on the advantages of photovoltaics for electricity generation, noting that its energy source (the sun) is virtually unlimited and that it is very clean, causing almost no environmental or health damage. It calls for supporting the nascent photovoltaic industry in Connecticut through tax measures and other government action in order to increase the output to make it cost effective.</p>
        <p>A lot of this is nothing new. The state's own planning and energy policy, first codified in 1978 and amended in 1979, 1982 and 1992, finds that Connecticut ''is severely disadvantaged by its lack of primary energy resources'' and calls on the state to address the problem of dependency on fossil fuels by ''conserving energy, increasing the efficiency of energy utilization and developing renewable energy sources.''</p>
        <p>But as Joel Gordes, a former state representative and now an energy consultant, put it, the policy ''exists on the books but is not enforced.'' An adviser to PACE, he helped shape its working paper.</p>
        <p>Ms. MacLeod says there are three options she would like to see included in any restructuring. ''We would like the state to create a not-for-profit structure, alongside other competitive models, in which the board of directors would be from the community and they would be dedicated to the welfare of the community. We would like to see buying co-ops, and financial incentives for the development of solar and other renewable energy.''</p>
        <p>Some critics see deregulation as an opportunity for big energy consumers, i.e. big businesses, to use their clout to negotiate reduced rates, while residential customers' bills could go up and the quality of their service could go down as utilities cut costs. That has happened in other states under deregulation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gordes says if legislation  allows small customers to band together into buying co-ops, ''we could do okay.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordes also wrote a position paper, ''Energy Efficiency and  Renewables in a Competitive Environment,'' in which he emphasized the need to move away from fossil fuels for two reasons: Connecticut is already a non-attainment area under the Federal Clean Air Act, and the insurance industry has become very concerned about catastrophic losses due to violent weather. Such concern might usher in a carbon tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordes says that under the current system, utilities have an incentive to sell more power to make more money for their shareholders, and a disincentive to conserve or manage the load in a way that spreads out energy use, lowers the maximum energy needed at any one time and thus limits the need for new plants. Depending on how restructuring is accomplished, he says it's possible that this won't change.</p>
        <p>The legislature's energy and technology committee held hearings at the end of February on House Bill 6774, which consolidates many previously submitted bills and would allow all electricity customers to choose their own suppliers as of Jan. 1, 2000.</p>
        <p>It would also require utilities to submit plans to separate the generation function from the transmission and distribution functions, provide for the continued regulation of distribution, provide for recovery of 75 percent of eligible stranded costs, and require the Department of Public Utility Control to establish, by Dec. 31, 1998, a systems benefit charge payable by all customers to pay for consumer education, energy conservation programs and hardship protections.</p>
        <p>State Senator Melodie Peters, Democrat of Waterford and a chairwoman of the General Assembly's energy and technology committee, said, ''For me the most exciting part of competition is that it offers the best situation for renewables. Consumers will have a choice; there are consumers who will be willing to pay more for clean energy, and the costs will eventually become more competitive.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McLeod worries that the systems benefit charge could be the loophole through which true savings on electric bills could slip. ''Out of that will come the bailout money, energy efficiency programs, low income assistance and money for renewables,'' she said. ''The D.P.U.C. will decide how the money gets spent. The rate per kilowatt hour will go down, but when you add up the other charges, the overall cost to consumers could stay the same.''</p>
        <p>Still, she says she is ''optimistic that we can help tweak the law to get more in about renewables.'' And the concluding paragraph of the PACE paper is equally optimistic: ''If the public is proactive now, we can usher in a new era by starting the 21st century with programs promoting sustainable green business and widespread support for one of the largest international emerging growth enterprises. Our downsized work force -- both military and non-military -- can be upsized into meaningful and  truly ECO-nomical work that will help preserve this precious world  and provide healthy income for our people.''</p>
