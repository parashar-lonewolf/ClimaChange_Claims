        <p>LEAD: PSSST. Have you heard? Mark and Brigitte are splitsville, just like the Boss and Julianne. Gastineau and Nielsen seemed so right for each other too, a hunk and hunkette, pumping iron till death do us part. It lasted six months.</p>
        <p>PSSST. Have you heard? Mark and Brigitte are splitsville, just like the Boss and Julianne. Gastineau and Nielsen seemed so right for each other too, a hunk and hunkette, pumping iron till death do us part. It lasted six months.</p>
        <p>And did you hear about Wade Boggs? He's being sued for $6 million for breach of contract by a woman who says she was his constant companion on road trips. Boggs, who is married, admitted to having an affair with Margo Adams, whom his agent now accuses of ''prostitution and extortion.''</p>
        <p>By the way, doesn't it seem as if you are among perhaps a half-dozen people in North America who will not be attending the Gretzky wedding? The Edmonton police department will be there, even the Prime Minister of Canada. Shouldn't he be badgering Ronald Reagan about acid rain? This has become hockey's version of Charles and Diana.</p>
        <p>And did you think that you would ever see the day when Robin Givens and Madonna had something in common? Both, it appears, married pugilists. The difference is that Mike Tyson gets paid to fight; Sean Penn gets arrested.</p>
        <p>For those of us with inquiring minds, it is getting increasingly difficult to tell the players without a scorecard. Sports is not immune from the issues confronting the real world, as player strikes, racial tension and drug problems have amply shown. But whatever happened to the all-American boy who married the Homecoming Queen and settled in suburbia, with two children and a dog named Slam Dunk?</p>
        <p>Sure, there has always been a glamorous side to athletics. Joe DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe and that is as glamorous as it gets. On a lower scale, Saturday's hero usually dated the prettiest woman on campus. For the most part, though, wives of professional athletes were rarely seen or heard. They remained in the backround, dutifully raising the children, being active in the community, the First Ladies of sports.</p>
        <p>Although that may still be the rule, there are enough exceptions now to place athletes on equal footing with rock stars and actors in the celebrity pecking order. People magazine recently featured Tyson and Givens on the cover in a romantic pose. The reports about Bruce Springsteen's separation from his wife Julianne Phillips played second fiddle.</p>
        <p>Mark Gastineau's brief fling with Brigitte Nielsen, Sylvester Stallone's former wife, introduced the Jets defensive end to a new audience, making him a fixture on the gossip pages.</p>
        <p>Darryl Strawberry's past marital problems were front-page news for some newspapers. Keith Hernandez talked openly about his divorce, which was especially acrimonious. Bobby Knight, the Indiana basketball coach, went through a fairly well-publicized divorce and is now remarried. She is a high school basketball coach. Some of the details of Chris Evert's marriage, separation, reconciliation and divorce from John Lloyd were better known than her results on the tennis court. Soon, she will marry Andy Mill, a onetime Olympic downhill skier. But it hasn't all gone smoothly. Mill's former wife contacted several reporters in Calgary during the Winter Olympics, asking whether they would be interested in her side of what she said was a sordid story. Sportswriting was never like this.</p>
        <p>There are other high-profile marriages and relationships as well. Jimmy Connors' wife, Patti, posed in the nude for a reputable magazine, as did Gretzky's fiancee, Janet Jones. John McEnroe and Tatum O'Neal are not exactly the low-key couple of the month. Then, there are Nancy Lopez and Ray Knight, and Robert Seguso and Carling Bassett, marriages of athletes.</p>
        <p>Ron Darling's wife is a cover-girl model, and Ron Greschner, the quiet Ranger defenseman from bustling Goodsoil, Saskatchewan, is married to Carol Alt, a top model whose picture has probably been in Sports Illustrated more often than her husband's.</p>
        <p>Exposure and big money have made sports figures part of the jet set, their lives like open books. When Ivan Lendl lost in the semifinals at Wimbledon, he was on the next Concorde home. That is quite a change from the pre-open days of tennis when barnstorming pros traveled by automobile night after night to make a few dollars.</p>
        <p>Television has also brought athletes into our homes on a regular basis. You can see Strawberry, Dwight Gooden or Don Mattingly play as often as you can see a Springsteen video on MTV. Athletes are in commercials. They get bit parts in movies and make guest appearances on weekly sitcoms and late night shows.</p>
        <p>It used to be that the only way to see DiMaggio or Babe Ruth or Willie Mays was to go to the ball park. And as more and more women become interested in sports, the recognition factor of an athlete increases accordingly. They will tend to be portrayed more as sex objects, too.</p>
        <p>What's more, athletes are no longer put on pedestals by the news media. In the good old days when salaries were low and many athletes worked during the off season, sportswriters were more inclined to be protective. These were role models for just about every young boy.</p>
        <p>Ironically, Jim Bouton, the onetime Yankee pitcher, probably had more to do with that era's ending than did any sportswriter. Bouton's book, ''Ball Four,'' was a behind-the-scenes look at what the world of a professional athlete was really like. Bouton was ostracized for writing what would be labeled a kiss-and-tell book today, but was intended to be a boys-will-be-boys account of life on the road.</p>
        <p>The material in ''Ball Four'' is mild compared with what has been written since and what appears in newspapers almost every day now. It's not even safe for a 12-year-old to peruse the box scores for fear of reading about an affair or wife beating.</p>
        <p>It is not a perfect world, not even for role models. And as those with inquiring minds already know, that news is no longer confined to just the sports pages.</p>
