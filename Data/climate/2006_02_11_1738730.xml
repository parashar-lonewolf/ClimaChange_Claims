        <p>Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International said yesterday that they were planning to build a power plant that would run on oil residues, and that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oil field, where it would help push more oil to the surface.</p>

        <p>Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International said yesterday that they were planning to build a power plant that would run on oil residues, and that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oil field, where it would help push more oil to the surface.</p>
        <p>The $1 billion plant would be adjacent to a BP refinery in Carson, Calif., about 20 miles south of Los Angeles, and would be the first such plant in the country, the companies said. BP is already drawing up engineering plans for a plant in Scotland that would sequester its carbon dioxide in an underground oil-bearing formation; that plant is to run on natural gas.</p>
        <p>The companies said they hoped to make a final decision on the plant in 2008 and have it running in 2011. It would qualify for a tax credit as a carbon-free energy source under the 2005 energy bill, company executives said.</p>
        <p>The plant would run by mixing an oil residue, petroleum coke, in a chamber with steam and a controlled amount of oxygen. In this technique, called gasification, both the fuel and the water give up hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen gas. This process also produces carbon monoxide, which is converted to carbon dioxide, giving off heat to sustain the reaction.</p>
        <p>The hydrogen is then burned in a turbine engine, the kind that electric companies normally run on natural gas, and the dominant combustion product is water. The carbon dioxide is compressed into a liquid and injected into an oil field.</p>
        <p>Although the fuel is an oil residue, and not coal, the technology is the same as one mentioned by President Bush in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 31, in which he said, ''We will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants.''</p>
        <p>When coal or other fuels are gasified, conventional pollutants like sulfur and carbon dioxide, which is believed to be responsible for climate change, can be removed before combustion, while the volume of gas is still relatively small.</p>
        <p>Petroleum coke from the Carson refinery is usually trucked to the harbor and shipped to China, where it is burned for fuel.</p>
        <p>As a nearly carbon-free source of electricity, the plant would compete with wind power. Its construction cost is about double the cost of a wind turbine, according to Theodore F. Craver Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Edison Mission Energy, an unregulated subsidiary of Edison International.</p>
        <p>But the production of wind turbines cannot be scheduled, and they generally produce only about 30 percent as much electricity as they would by running around the clock; this plant will run 90 to 95 percent of the hours in a year, he said. And the Los Angeles Basin, where it is situated, is often short of power, he said.</p>
        <p>Steve Westwell, chief executive of BP Alternative Energy, said that all of the technologies had already been demonstrated individually, including separating carbon dioxide from hydrogen, and pumping the carbon dioxide under pressure into the ground. One area in which the project would stretch existing technologies is in the turbine; hydrogen burns hotter than natural gas, and tends to make turbine blades brittle.</p>
        <p>BP is seeking to put the carbon dioxide in oil fields owned by Occidental Petroleum.</p>
        <p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attended the project announcement, said, ''This will be the first plant of its kind in the whole country, and I think it is a perfect fit for our state.''</p>
