        <p>ARE Americans preoccupied with relatively modest environmental threats while neglecting big ones that could unleash catastrophe?</p>
        <p>To a large extent, some scientists and Government officials believe, the answer is yes. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee in Washington on Friday that in many cases, the public and Congress are at odds with scientists over which environmental threats are the most serious.

        <p>ARE Americans preoccupied with relatively modest environmental threats while neglecting big ones that could unleash catastrophe?</p>
        <p>To a large extent, some scientists and Government officials believe, the answer is yes. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee in Washington on Friday that in many cases, the public and Congress are at odds with scientists over which environmental threats are the most serious. He has begun a campaign to reassess those priorities, and he leaves no doubt that his money is on the scientists.</p>
        <p>"Sound science is our most reliable compass," he says in speeches calling for the nation to establish environmental priorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly's campaign is intended to stimulate a national debate over environmental goals. And at a time when many of the most obvious and clear-cut environmental threats like air pollution and water pollution have been addressed and more subtle, complex problems are coming to the fore, the campaign may usher in a new, more complicated and more contentious phase in the national environmental struggle. Mismatch of Perceptions</p>
        <p>There seems little doubt of a mismatch between public perceptions of environmental risk and those of the scientists. Oil spills, hazardous waste, underground storage tanks and releases of radioactive materials, for instance, have aroused high emotions, generated reams of reports and prodded Congress to spend billions of dollars. Opinion surveys place them in the front ranks of public concern about the environment.</p>
        <p>But in terms of the actual magnitude of risk they pose, scientists advising the E.P.A. rate them near the bottom of a broad array of environmental threats. This, the scientists say, is because their effects are relatively limited or short-lived or both.</p>
        <p>At the same time, global warming and the destruction and alteration of natural habitats rank relatively low in public perception, polls show. But the scientists place them among the top risks because their potential consequences appear to be so damaging in the long run and their effects so widespread and difficult to reverse.</p>
        <p>Federal environmental laws "are more reflective of public perceptions of risk than of scientific understanding of risk," the E.P.A. Science Advisory Board said in a report on environmental risks last fall. The scientists' report was the basis for Friday's hearings. Mr. Reilly and others say environmental problems are addressed unevenly, usually on the basis of episodic, momentary public anxieties about problems that, while frightening, represent a relatively limited threat: contamination of a local waterway by hazardous wastes, for example.</p>
        <p>No one is suggesting that these problems should be ignored. Oil spills and other low-ranking risks can cause "real damage where and when they occur," Mr. Reilly told the senators. But, he said, "they are in a different league compared to some of our other problems, such as stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change, which have the potential to affect life everywhere, and for many years to come."</p>
        <p>The advisory board identified four environmental threats to health that it said were in the front rank: outdoor air pollution, exposure of workers to chemicals, indoor air pollution and pollutants in drinking water. Major Environmental Threats</p>
        <p>It established three categories of risk for threats that humans pose to the environment. Relatively high-risk problems of this nature included the global warming that many scientists predict will result from an increase in heat-trapping atmospheric gases produced by human activity; depletion of the ozone shield that protects Earth from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, and destruction and alteration of natural habitats and the extinction of species, with an accompanying loss of biological diversity.</p>
        <p>A middle rank includes herbicides and pesticides, pollution of surface waters, acid precipitation and airborne toxic substances. Relatively low risk was assigned to oil spills, escape of radioactive materials, acid runoff to surface waters and pollution of groundwater.</p>
        <p>Risks in this area of ecological threats were assigned largely on the basis of how many people a problem affects, how wide a geographical area is involved, and how serious and long-lasting the harm might be, said Dr. William Cooper, a zoologist and aquatic ecologist at Michigan State University who headed the board's panel on ecological risks.</p>
        <p>On that basis, oil spills, for example, ranked low because their effects on coastal areas are relatively short-term and local. "The public doesn't perceive it that way," Dr. Cooper said, "but those ecosystems bounce back real fast."</p>
        <p>By contrast, he said, the loss of natural habitats and the disappearance of species are top risks because they affect the economic welfare of future generations worldwide and because the loss is "virtually irreversible." Similarly, ozone depletion and global warming were placed in the top rank because they are worldwide problems and because their effects are potentially catastrophic and reversible only over decades.</p>
        <p>Given the substantial cost of environmental protection, Mr. Reilly argues, it is all the more important to set sensible priorities as the next phase of environmental protection begins. The E.P.A. estimates the United States will spend nearly 3 percent of its gross national product on environmental protection by the end of this decade. The nation "can probably afford to spend 3 percent," Mr. Reilly said, "but we're not rich enough to spend it in the wrong places." Doubts Are Raised</p>
        <p>While many environmentalists and politicians say it is a good idea to set priorities, doubts and possible points of dispute are cropping up.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists who have devoted themselves to causes ranked low on the priority list are unlikely to stop pushing their interests. Others resist anything that might look like an effort to practice environmental triage, concentrating on some problems to the exclusion of others.</p>
        <p>"I don't quarrel with the conclusion that global warming is the No. 1 threat," said David Doniger, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But I don't think the only way you can tackle global warming is by not tackling hazardous wastes. We can and should, and can afford, to do it all."</p>
        <p>Several Senators questioned on Friday whether scientists knew enough to set priorities confidently. Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, asked whether science was as good a guide as public values. People know what environmental assets are important to pass on to future generations, he said.</p>
        <p>The Science Advisory Board acknowledged that assessing relative risks was an imprecise science, since much was unknown about some environmental threats. The board noted in its report that environmental policy making "necessarily embodies subjective values" and that policy makers should take both science and public perceptions into account.</p>
        <p>As more complex and challenging environmental threats dominate the discussion, the debate will probably be complicated by increasing uncertainty about the nature of environmental risks, noted Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who presided over the hearing. Science, he said, is a matter of complexity and probability, not simple certainty.</p>
        <p>What this means is that when science is invoked as a guide to priorities, as Mr. Reilly and others believe it must be, clear-cut answers are harder to come by. As science investigates an issue, it often tends to raise as many questions as it answers. In the eyes of the public, this could weaken the claim of science as an arbiter of priorities. Danger of Inaction</p>
        <p>But on the biggest risks, some scientists argue, uncertainty must not become cause for inaction. Much is uncertain about the magnitude and effects of global warming, for instance. By the time scientists know whether they are right or wrong about predictions of climatic catastrophe, Dr. Cooper said, it will be too late to do anything.</p>
        <p>This requires "a whole different mind set," Dr. Cooper said.</p>
        <p>"You don't care about being right," he said. "You just don't want to be wrong. Once the cost of being wrong gets too high, you go into a risk-aversion mode. You avoid the risk no matter what the cost."</p>
