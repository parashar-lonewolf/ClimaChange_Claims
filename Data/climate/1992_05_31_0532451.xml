        <p>Most of the delegates converging on Rio de Janeiro for the start of the Earth Summit on Wednesday, it seems safe to say, believe that humanity must do something about the harm that human expansion is doing to the rest of the biosphere. But it also seems that many of the world's governments tend to pin primary responsibility on someone else and to duck strong measures that could hurt them economically or politically.</p>
        <p>That is why the Rio meeting -- as has already been made abundantly clear in pre-summit talks on the key issues of climate and extinction of species -- is likely to disappoint any who are expecting a dramatic environmental leap forward.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that nothing important is happening.  For the first time, the nations of the world are seriously coming to grips with the fundamental and seemingly intractable question of how to pursue economic growth and combat poverty while at the same time protecting the interacting web of atmosphere, water, soil and biological organisms on which human life depends. But the task is proving difficult and frustrating, made so by the fact that rich and poor countries approach it with divergent perceptions and agendas.</p>
        <p>"They come to the bargaining table, literally and figuratively, from two different worlds," said Richard Mott, the treaties officer of the World Wildlife Fund. Blame the Rich</p>
        <p>While most of the industrialized countries can afford the luxury of contemplating environmental problems, most of the poor ones are preoccupied with economic survival. Spanning this North-South gulf, as diplomats refer to it, has been the main difficulty but hardly the only one.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, the poor countries of the South blame most environmental damage on the rich countries of the North, who engage in what they see as wasteful overconsumption. The poor countries say they have no choice but to make economic development their first priority. If the South is to play the game of environmental protection, they insist, the North must pay.</p>
        <p>Their attitude, says one American diplomat, is: "You've had your turn; you're fat, happy and breathing dirty air and you have no trees. We want our turn, and when we're rich we can start worrying about the environment." Besides, the diplomat added, no leader in a developing country gets elected on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>The North, while acknowledging its own responsibility, asserts that the South's frightening population explosion and advancing industrialization threaten to ultimately eclipse any damage done by the North. If the poor countries develop as the industrialized nations have, the North argues, the result will be environmental disaster.</p>
        <p>All of this is the political leitmotif of the summit, but it has endlessly complicated variations, exceptions and sub-themes. Talks on Warming</p>
        <p>In talks on a treaty to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases that scientists fear will cause the earth's climate to warm, the North-South split resulted in an agreement three weeks ago that put most of the responsibility on the industrialized countries. They now emit most of the gases, but that is expected to change in the decades ahead as the developing countries grow. Also in the agreement, the rich countries agreed to give poorer ones money and technical help for cleaner cars and smokestacks.</p>
        <p>But many political cross-currents affected the path to that rapprochement. The industrialized countries, for instance, were split over insistence by the European Community that emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, first be stabilized at 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Europeans, with their forceful "green" parties, committed themselves to an economic future in which fossil fuels loom smaller.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, given the United States' dependence on huge amounts of coal, oil and natural gas, was unsure the country could meet the Europeans' modest targets without hurting the economy. Given a recession and an election year, anti-environmentalist hardliners in the Administration pressed for no concessions at all. But more moderate forces prevailed, the United States agreed to some vague first-step targets, and a compromise was struck in which the Europeans seemed to yield more.</p>
        <p>Nor were the developing countries monolithic. India led a hard-line faction that refused to sign any treaty that did not require the Northern countries to take strong first steps. It is still unclear whether India will sign the agreement that emerged. Other developing countries, recognizing that global warming would hurt them as much as anyone, were more conciliatory, though still insistent that the North bear the cost. Few were fully satisfied with the treaty that emerged on May 9, which is to be presented for signing in Rio. But it is widely considered a step forward in that it establishes a process and general commitments aimed at stabilizing greenhouse-gas levels. Even this lowest-common-denominator agreement was nearly derailed at the last moment when Saudi Arabia, whose economy is based on a fossil fuel, tried unsuccessfully to introduce small amendments that could have filibustered the treaty to death. Biological Diversity</p>
        <p>In the talks that produced a treaty on protecting biological diversity two weeks later in Rio, the United States again became a naysayer. But this time it was actually united with other industrialized nations in pressing for strong action on the main point of the treaty -- creating national strategies for protecting ecosystems and integrating protection and economic development.</p>
        <p>The bargain struck in Nairobi says that the South will do nothing without Northern money and states flatly that economic development must be its first priority. The concessions to the South, including some less-than-ironclad commitment language, make the treaty less than satisfying to some ardent conservationists. But again, it sets up an international process for long-term management of the problem of species extinction. And for the first time, it institutionalizes the idea of integrating development and conservation by recognizing that preserving jungles and grasslands can bring in money -- through tourism, for instance, or through royalties from companies that develop new drugs from protected plants or gene material from protected animals or microbes.</p>
        <p>The United States has refused to sign the treaty, however, and the balkiness stems again from self-interest. American officials say it does too little to protect the patents of companies that share biotechnology with developing countries and that it tries to regulate genetically engineered materials, in which the United States is a leader.</p>
        <p>With Rio nearly here, the likelihood is that the international arguing will reach a new pitch as delegates negotiate a declaration of goals and a more detailed blueprint to guide nations in pursuing environmentally friendly economics, as well as a statement of principles on protection of forests. Developing countries, led by Malaysia, which derives much of its national income from logging, have already drastically weakened the statement in preliminary talks.</p>
        <p>The overall outcome in Rio will be at least one big measure of how well the world can unite against a danger that all recognize.  WORLDS APART</p>
