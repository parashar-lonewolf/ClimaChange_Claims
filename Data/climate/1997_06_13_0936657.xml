        <p>The Clinton Administration will soon make one of the most important environmental decisions of this decade: whether to support the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal for tough new rules on air pollution.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. is asking for stricter limits on ozone, or smog, and the dustlike particles known as particulates. Toughening these national standards for smog and soot is essential to protect the public health.</p>
        <p>But opponents of the proposed rules have been lobbying the President to moderate them. He should resist. No one can deny that the standards will lead to cleaner air and fewer respiratory problems, particularly for the elderly and the young.</p>
        <p>Government has few responsibilities more important than providing clean water and clean air. We must do whatever is reasonable to protect the quality of the air we breathe.</p>
        <p>That's why New York is moving ahead to further reduce emissions from utility plants beyond the levels required by Federal law. This state is also taking aggressive measures to curb emissions from motor vehicles, including trucks and buses that spew soot, and we are eliminating polluting coal-fired boilers from New York City schools.</p>
        <p>But while New York's air quality is steadily improving, there's a limit to what we can do on our own. We are at the end of the air pollution pipeline. Air entering New York from the Midwest already exceeds national standards for ozone. Under the E.P.A.'s proposed rules, Midwestern states would be forced to impose stricter pollution control measures already used in the Northeast, like requiring cleaner-burning power plants.</p>
        <p>This is particularly important given the advent of competition in the electric power industry. Thanks to deregulation, large Midwestern coal-fired plants, which have lower costs for controlling air pollution, will be at a competitive advantage. If their sales of electricity increase, so will their downwind emissions to the Northeast. New national standards would not only protect the environment but also help insure more fairness in the market for electricity.</p>
        <p>In addition to allowing all of us to breathe easier, the proposed rules offer other environmental benefits. For one thing, the standards would reduce acid rain, which continues to devastate New York's majestic Adirondack Park. The rules would also decrease the amount of nitrogen entering Long Island Sound, leading to cleaner water and healthier aquatic life. New York State is already spending $200 million, through the Clean Water-Clean Air Bond Act, to reduce nitrogen deposits in the Sound.</p>
        <p>Although health considerations demand that we adopt these new air standards, economic factors are important, too. The E.P.A. should allow industry as much flexibility as possible to meet emission reduction goals in a cost-effective way. The success of the Federal program allowing companies to trade credits for emissions that produce acid rain suggests not only that industry can meet environmental protection standards, but also that market forces can drive down the cost of doing so.</p>
        <p>In the end, the most important question in evaluating the proposed rules on pollution is whether they will provide cleaner and healthier air. Let's hope that when the Clinton Administration decides whether to stand by the E.P.A.'s air quality standards, concern for the health of our children and grandchildren leads the way and political considerations take a back seat.</p>
