        <p>It was cloudy and cool outside the north portico of the White House this morning as Steve Doocy, the jovial Fox News Channel weatherman, asked Al Roker, the ebullient NBC weatherman, just why it was that the President of the United States had invited them over.</p>
        <p>''Because we promised to bring Krispy Kremes!'' Mr. Roker chortled. Then he sobered up and told the Fox viewers watching the live broadcast that Mr. Clinton wanted to talk about changes in the global climate.</p>
        <p>''Al, let me ask you this,'' Mr. Doocy said. ''About the global warming thing -- we're against it, right?''</p>
        <p>''We don't like global warming,'' Mr. Roker agreed. But he added that, looking at the bright side, he owned some land in Pennsylvania, ''and within a few years, I may have beachfront property!''</p>
        <p>On the theory that you do, in fact, need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows, Mr. Clinton invited more than 100 national and local television forecasters to the White House today for a chat with him and Vice President Al Gore and for briefings on climate change from Government experts.</p>
        <p>The Administration hopes that the forecasters will influence public opinion on climate change more than the journalists on the evening news; Clinton aides complain that they pay scant attention to the issue.</p>
        <p>''You, just in the way you comment on the events that you cover, may have a real effect on the American people,'' Mr. Clinton said this afternoon to the assembled broadcasters, who were overwhelmingly white, male and shorter than they appear on television.</p>
        <p>Playing host to the nation's television weather forecasters was the most innovative step in a White House campaign to rally public support for new binding global targets for restricting greenhouse gases. A broad coalition of industry and labor groups is spending some $13 million on advertising opposing such targets, which may be adopted at an international conference in December in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
        <p>''I don't ask for you to advocate or do anything outside of whatever your own convictions are,'' Mr. Clinton said this afternoon, as the skies cleared and the East Room brightened. ''But I do think it's very important, since you have more influence than anybody does on how the American people think about this, that at least you know what you believe and how you think we should proceed.''</p>
        <p>As the 5 o'clock broadcasts rolled around, dozens of weathermen milled about in the mellowing sunlight on the north lawn of the White House, straightening their hair, consulting notes, muttering lines. While others waited their turns, about six stood bathed in white lights before cameras, speaking to the folks back home or standing, faces blank and microphones at the ready, as they listened for their cues in the distant chatter among the anchors.</p>
        <p>As they talked about the chill in Buffalo or the pleasant weather here, the forecasters also described the concerns of the President. ''He wants all of us to think about what is happening to our climate,'' said Chuck Gaidica Jr. of WDIV in Detroit.</p>
        <p>Some were careful to distance themselves from the White House's arguments.</p>
        <p>Global warming is ''a theory that is widely accepted, but it's still under debate in the scientific community,'' Cecily Tynan told viewers of WPVI in Philadelphia. ''Judging by the P.R. event that was orchestrated here, it's certainly become a very hot topic in the Clinton Administration.''</p>
        <p>But other forecasters confessed to their viewers that they were thrilled to be there. ''To be honest with you, I'm just like a little kid,'' said Bob Kovachick of WNYT in Albany. After the camera stopped rolling, Mr. Kovachick, like many of the other meteorologists, said that he intended to return to the subject of global warming in broadcasts later tonight and on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Bryan Norcross, of WBRY in Miami, told his viewers about the detailed presentations from Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. ''Everyone in the room came away impressed that they know what they're talking about, that this isn't just a political event, even though the Vice President is going to run for President,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Several weathermen said in interviews that they had already been sold on the dangers of climate change before their visit to the White House. Craig Allen, the CBS morning weatherman, said he felt ''absolutely honored'' to be invited to the day's session. ''He feels very strongly about it,'' he said of the President, ''and he just wants us to get the message out. And I'm happy to do it because I lean in that direction.''</p>
        <p>Calling the day a success, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that the weathermen ''appreciated being treated as something other than airheads.''</p>
        <p>Gail MacDonald, president of the Global Climate Coalition, which is made up of business and trade groups opposed to binding targets for reducing emissions, said she did not object to the White House's tactics. ''We think that any kind of any increased public discourse is good,'' she said. ''We think the journalists involved will look critically at the data and be professional.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some forecasters said they were frustrated that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore had not spelled out any remedies. Mr. Clinton, who is planning to hold a conference on climate change at Georgetown University on Monday, is not expected to reveal his proposed emissions targets for another two or three weeks.</p>
        <p>''We really haven't heard what it is they expect us to give up or change in our habits,'' Mr. Gaidica said. ''I mean questions as simple as can we use the barbecue today or can we use the Waverunner anymore.''</p>
        <p>Beyond such skepticism, some weathermen took advantage of their appearance at the White House to attach a few barbs to their famously chipper chatter. ''We got here real early this morning,'' Mr. Doocy deadpanned on Fox. ''It was just me, the crew, and the special prosecutors.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 10, 1997, Friday</p>
        <p>An article on Oct. 2 about a visit by television forecasters to the White House misidentified the television station in Miami where Bryan Norcross presents the weather. It is WFOR, not WBRY.</p>
