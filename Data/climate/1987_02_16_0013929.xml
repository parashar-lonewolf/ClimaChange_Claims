        <p>LEAD: Up to 13 of the 300 Soviet children born since the reactor accident at Chernobyl to women who lived nearby are expected to suffer mental retardation because of exposure to hazardous levels of radiation, an American physician who recently returned from the contaminated area said here today. But none of the children have been observed to have any physical defects, he said.</p>
        <p>Up to 13 of the 300 Soviet children born since the reactor accident at Chernobyl to women who lived nearby are expected to suffer mental retardation because of exposure to hazardous levels of radiation, an American physician who recently returned from the contaminated area said here today. But none of the children have been observed to have any physical defects, he said.</p>
        <p>The physician, Dr. Robert P. Gale of the University of California at Los Angeles, who has worked extensively with Soviet victims of the April 26 accident, said 13 excess cases of retardation were expected among 300 infants born to women who were pregnant at the time of the accident and who lived within 30 kilometers of the nuclear reactor.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gale, speaking at a news conference during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the estimate was derived from studies of retardation among children whose mothers were exposed to radiation in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Children Will Be Monitored</p>
        <p>Among the 300 Soviet newborns, Dr. Gale said, about 26 would normally be expected to suffer some kind of retardation. He did not define what he meant by retardation. If 13 additional cases occurred, Dr. Gail said, the Chernobyl radiation would thus be responsible for an increase of 50 percent. He stressed that 13 was the worst possible estimate and that there might be fewer additional cases.</p>
        <p>''It's too early to test for things of that nature,'' Dr. Gale said. ''We will follow these children very carefully and try to identify them and eventually try to get them better schooling or do whatever we could to prevent'' any problems.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gale said none of the 300 Soviet newborns had been observed to have any physical defects because of radiation. High doses of radiation can produce fetal deformation and miscarriage. The radiation levels at Chernobyl were apparently too low to produce serious problems.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Gale said abortions had been performed on pregnant women living near the reactor. He said he did not know the number and added that he had been told Soviet officials did not know. Confusing the Brain Cells</p>
        <p>''We've now had a chance to observe all the children that have been born close to Chernobyl,'' Dr. Gale said. ''Not surprisingly, none of them, at birth at least, has any detectable abnormalites. We weren't expecting any. That's an example that no news is good news.''</p>
        <p>The effects of radiation on the fetal brain are thought to be most extreme at 8 to 15 weeks of development, Dr. Gale said. ''At the eighth week of development, the brain cells, which are all clustered together, migrate out to form the structure of the adult brain,'' he said. ''If you irradiate an animal or human at that stage of development, you confuse the cells so they migrate to the wrong place.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Gale said the United States Department of Energy would soon publish a paper on the number of cases of retardation expected to be caused by the Chernobyl accident.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the accident, Dr. Gale was called to the Soviet Union to do bone marrow transplants on 13 of the most seriously irradiated victims of the disaster; two survived.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gale, who is coordinating long-term studies of the accident's health effects, has made repeated visits to the Soviet Union. He said he was stunned by the devastation of the area around Chernobyl, which he visited again within the last two weeks. 'Devoid of Human Life'</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to talk about deserted zones and another to drive into a 3,000-square-kilometer area just completely devoid of human life, to fly over an entire forest which is brown because the trees are radioactive,'' he said. ''It has a tremendous emotional impact. It's unavoidable when you see these things that you understand the potential dangers of radiation.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Gale said the deserted villages within the 30-kilometer safety zone (30 kilometers is about 19 miles) were covered with snow and many of them were probably safe enough to be reinhabited. He added, however, that the radioactive debris in the deep snow would be a problem in the spring when the snow melts and flows into rivers and reservoirs. Soviet officials have decided to bar villagers from their former homes until after the spring melt, he said.</p>
        <p>''Many people are trying to get back to their houses,'' Dr. Gale said. ''People see their homes, and they see no destruction, no fire, they just see their houses standing there and they want to go back to them. So they sort of sneak in on occasion.'' Weighing Risk of Other Sources</p>
        <p>Dr. Gale said Soviet officials, far from being put off by the Chernobyl accident, were planning to expand their reliance on nuclear power. Their goal, he said, was to increase nuclear production from 11 percent, its current rate, to 50 percent of all energy generated in the Soviet Union, from the current level of 11 percent.</p>
        <p>The risks of nuclear power, although great in some cases, have to be weighed against those of other energy technologies, he said. For instance, if the Soviet Union gave up its nuclear power program and relied on fossil fuels, it could expect 1 million more deaths over 50 years because of increased production accidents and pollution, he said.</p>
        <p>''Every kind of energy has its price,'' he said. ''Chernobyl is probably going to cost them 12,000 lives'' from excess cancer deaths in the Soviet Union. ''If they have no more Chernobyls,'' he said, ''then having switched to fossil fuels will cost them almost a million more lives. On the other hand, they could have another Chernobyl tomorrow.''</p>
