        <p>With a deep freeze threatening the New York area this weekend, Woodrow Stewart spent much of the day worrying about his steep, slush-covered driveway.</p>
        <p>The problem, he said, was that he had visited five stores across Westchester County but all were sold out of the rock salt he needed to prevent the sinking temperatures from turning his driveway into a virtual skating rink by Saturday night.</p>
        <p>Testily kicking a 20-pound bag of sand outside his final stop, the Pergament Home Center here, Mr. Stewart said: "I don't need this stuff. I need salt. I'm frustrated, I really am."</p>
        <p>Buffeted by a fierce snow-and-ice storm last weekend, then hit with another storm on Wednesday, many in the region shared Mr. Stewart's exasperation as they prepared for yet another dose of bad weather, this time temperatures that forecasters predicted would be the coldest in nine years and among the chilliest since the 1930's.  A Fleeting Thaw</p>
        <p>A fleeting thaw actually made traveling around some parts of the region worse today, with falling chunks of ice leading to the closing of the upper level of the George Washington Bridge, which in turn caused traffic delays of up to three hours by the evening commute. The upper deck reopened just after 6 P.M.</p>
        <p>By Saturday night, meteorologists said, temperatures in New York City were expected to dip as low as zero, which, when combined with winds in excess of 15 miles an hour, could make it feel like 30 below. Temperatures in some surrounding suburbs drop as many as 10 degrees lower than those in the city, forecasters said.</p>
        <p>"Any time you are below minus 25 degrees on the wind chill scale," Lee Grenci, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University said, "the risk of frostbite is rather high for exposed skin."</p>
        <p>The lowest temperature recorded in New York City in recent years, not accounting for wind chill, was 2 below zero, on Jan. 21, 1985, which was the last time the temperature in the city fell below zero. That was balmy compared with Jan. 9, 1934, when the temperature hit 15 below, the coldest on record.</p>
        <p>The prospect of frigid temperatures posed the greatest risk to the homeless, prompting New York City social services officials to step up the number of outreach workers who patrol the streets and encourage the homeless to enter shelters. Those who refuse, officials said, may be forcibly taken to shelters by the police.</p>
        <p>For many in the region, today was a day to stock up. Some focused on stores like Pergament, virtually stripping shelves of portable heaters, ice breakers, snow shovels and rock salt. Others turned to supermarkets, snapping up soups and other comfort foods that they said they wanted on hand because they did not relish venturing outside. Still others hoarded antifreeze and windshield-wiper fluid.</p>
        <p>Getting around was an ordeal in many places, because temporarily warmer temperatures -- it reached a high of 38 in New York City -- melted large pieces of ice, imperiling motorists.  The upper level of the George Washington Bridge was closed at 10:30 A.M. after a New Jersey woman suffered head, neck and face injuries when a piece of ice crashed through her windshield. She was treated at Harlem Hospital and released.</p>
        <p>Falling ice also closed the Outerbridge Crossing from 1:30 to 5:15 P.M.; four of five lanes on the upper level of the Manhattan Bridge, which was reopened by the evening rush and the upper level of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.</p>
        <p>In anticipation of falling temperatures, the region's three major airports worked to restore substantially depleted salt supplies while the Transit Authority moved its unused trains tonight to inactive, underground tracks, from the outdoors.</p>
        <p>In Buffalo, fans preparing to attend the National Football League divisional playoff game Saturday afternoon between the Bills and the Los Angeles Raiders were told to bring sleeping bags to crawl into, especially if the wind chill at game time dips to 25 below, as predicted.</p>
        <p>Among those preparing to don as many layers as were practical were the Buffalo Jills cheerleading squad, who, unlike the players on the sidelines, will not have heaters.</p>
        <p>"But they're out there doing their routines," said Joe Fischer, their administrative coordinator. "That pretty much keeps them warm."</p>
        <p>The cause of the unusual temperatures -- the normal low for Jan. 15 is 25 degrees -- is a mass of Arctic air perched over Hudson Bay, said Mr. Grenci, the meteorologist. That pool of cool air is expected to infiltrate the Eastern United States, largely because a ridge of warmer air is stalled along the West Coast, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grenci predicted that temperatures would rise on Sunday, with New York City reaching the teens.</p>
        <p>By early afternoon today, radio and television warnings on the impending cold had seemed to cause a bit of a run on some food shops, like Balducci's at 424 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, and video stores, including Kim's Underground Video at 144 Bleecker Street. Candles Warm Homeless Man</p>
        <p>Not everyone was treating the talk of Arctic temperatures with alarm. "I love this weather," said Stephanie Rich, 47, an actress. "I think it's an indication we're healing the ozone layer."</p>
        <p>But for some, the cold was a real alarm. A homeless man, who identified himself only as Lee, lives in a tent made out of an American flag by the southbound 79th Street exit ramp off the Henry Hudson Parkway. "I got candles, blankets, cushions, a sleeping bag, the whole nine yards," he said tonight. If it is too cold, he will light four or five candles, he said. "The flag is waterproof," he added.</p>
        <p>In other parts of the country, the bitter cold had already settled in.  Across the Midwest, temperatures fell well below zero today, in many areas to their lowest levels in a decade. The mercury registered minus 36 overnight at Tower, Minn. Milwaukee officials suspended the city's Winterfest for two days, deciding that wind-chill readings from 30 below to 50 below made it difficult to celebrate the season.</p>
        <p>The South did not go unscathed as snow fell, schools closed and motorists skidded across Kentucky.</p>
