        <p>AMERICANS love choice, as a glimpse at any supermarket's cereal aisle will attest. And with the nation paying more attention to fuel economy and environmental matters, it's only logical that automakers are offering the same basic cars in varieties ranging from big and mean to green and clean.</p>
        <p>But while several companies are selling models with either gas or hybrid powertrains, Honda has taken its Civic compact a step further. In additional to the gas-only and gas-electric versions, Honda offers a Civic that runs on compressed natural gas, a very clean fuel that is easy to refine and transport and generally costs less than gasoline. Furthermore, the nation's natural gas supplies come almost entirely from North America, not from the volatile Middle East.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS love choice, as a glimpse at any supermarket's cereal aisle will attest. And with the nation paying more attention to fuel economy and environmental matters, it's only logical that automakers are offering the same basic cars in varieties ranging from big and mean to green and clean.</p>
        <p>But while several companies are selling models with either gas or hybrid powertrains, Honda has taken its Civic compact a step further. In additional to the gas-only and gas-electric versions, Honda offers a Civic that runs on compressed natural gas, a very clean fuel that is easy to refine and transport and generally costs less than gasoline. Furthermore, the nation's natural gas supplies come almost entirely from North America, not from the volatile Middle East.</p>
        <p>The Civic GX is the only regular production vehicle in the United States that uses natural gas; it is the cleanest internal-combustion car ever tested by the Environmental Protection Agency. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, an environmental advocacy group known as A.C.E.E.E., gives the GX its highest green score, above the Civic Hybrid and the Toyota Prius.</p>
        <p>Until last fall, the GX was sold only in California. It is now offered in New York, which is among the states that have adopted California's clean-air rules.</p>
        <p>So the 2007 Civic offers a unique opportunity to compare the performance and economy of cars with distinctly different powertrains that are otherwise much the same.</p>
        <p>The Civic was redesigned for the 2006 model year, and the line includes other variants, including coupes and the high-performance (but less fuel-efficient) Si.</p>
        <p>Aside from the 197-horsepower Si, the 2007 sedans deliver either 140 horses, in conventional gasoline form; 110, with the Civic Hybrid; or 113, from the natural gas GX.</p>
        <p>The conventional version has a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine with a government mileage rating of 30 miles a gallon in town, 40 on the highway, when paired with an automatic transmission.</p>
        <p>The natural gas GX, which also has a 1.8-liter 4, carries an E.P.A. gasoline-equivalent rating of 28/39.</p>
        <p>The Hybrid integrates a battery-driven electric motor with a 1.3-liter gas engine. It is rated 49 m.p.g. in town, 51 on the highway.</p>
        <p>I had an opportunity to drive all three versions back to back to get a sense of their differences and similarities in everyday use in urban and suburban areas of Connecticut. In general, the Civic is a respected compact car that merits a spot on the list of many small-car shoppers. In each of its forms, I found it a good-looking, nimble economical car, certainly one of the best of its breed. And I found that the Civics were quite similar despite their different powertrains.</p>
        <p>EX: Peppy and Polished</p>
        <p>The conventional Civic that I tested was an EX -- the fanciest trim level, aside from the sporty Si -- with a sticker price of $22,159, including the optional navigation system and XM Satellite Radio. The base DX is $15,605 and the midrange LX is $17,555.</p>
        <p>Conventional Civic sedans come with a five-speed manual transmission or, for $800 extra, a five-speed automatic. All Civics have side air bags for the front seats, side curtain bags and antilock brakes.</p>
        <p>With its 140-horsepower engine and responsive automatic transmission, my EX test car was agile and fun to drive. Its ride was typical of a sedan this size; so was its noise level and seating comfort.</p>
        <p>There was plenty of power on tap and the fuel economy was about what I'd expected -- I averaged about 30 m.p.g. without trying too hard.</p>
        <p>The EX is an ultra-low-emissions vehicle under California rules, and its smog index is 0.39. The average vehicle scores 0.40, so this Civic, while clean, is not exceptionally so.</p>
        <p>Still, the gasoline Civic ranks No. 12 on the A.C.E.E.E.'s list of America's greenest cars. It is nicely finished, relatively powerful and refined.</p>
        <p>Hybrid: Having It Both Ways</p>
        <p>All Civic Hybrids are equipped like the EX -- very nicely, in other words -- for a starting price of $23,195. The only significant option is a package that includes the navigation system and satellite radio for $1,750.</p>
        <p>The Civic Hybrid currently qualifies for a $2,100 federal income tax credit.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the other Civics, the Hybrid has a continuously variable transmission without fixed gear ratios. Because this type of gearbox has no noticeable shift points, it is very smooth but can convey some odd sensations as the car's speed attempts to match the engine's speed.</p>
        <p>The variable transmission is more fuel-efficient than a conventional automatic. The Hybrid also has electric power steering, which saves fuel compared with the conventional belt-driven hydraulic power steering in the EX and GX.</p>
        <p>Having driven most of the hybrid automobiles on the market, I can say that the Civic's system is the most transparent I have come across. The engine shuts down almost imperceptibly when the car is stopped and the brake pedal is depressed, then starts instantly when you lift your foot from the brake pedal. After a bit of experience you don't even notice this starting and stopping.</p>
        <p>While Honda says the car can be propelled by the electric motor alone at speeds up to 35 m.p.h., I was unable -- despite a serious effort -- to get the car to run on the batteries alone at low speeds.</p>
        <p>While the Civic Hybrid responds nicely in city driving, it is not very peppy or responsive at higher speeds, with the variable transmission contributing to its relaxed demeanor.</p>
        <p>But fuel economy is top notch, and on regular fuel I averaged nearly 47 m.p.g. in mixed driving and often saw 50 m.p.g. or better on the instantaneous mileage readout.</p>
        <p>Under the California system, the Civic Hybrid carries the cleanest emissions rating of any car that uses gasoline: AT-PZEV, for advanced technology partial-zero-emission vehicle.</p>
        <p>The hybrid's battery pack carries an eight-year or 80,000-mile warranty. The Hybrid's rear seatbacks cannot be folded like those in conventional Civics because the batteries are behind the back seat.</p>
        <p>GX: Cooking With Gas</p>
        <p>A distinct version of the Civic, the GX is equipped pretty much like the Hybrid, though it comes with a five-speed automatic transmission and is not available with a navigation system. It has a sticker price of $25,185, including shipping.</p>
        <p>The GX also qualifies for a $4,000 federal tax credit through December 2010.</p>
        <p>Like the Hybrid, the natural gas Civic does not have the snappy feel of the conventional gasoline model. The lack of power is most noticeable when climbing modest grades at highway speeds when the transmission downshifts several gears in an effort to maintain speed. While this is accomplished smoothly, it still makes the car feel a bit sluggish.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. calculates the GX's fuel economy on the basis of what it calls the gasoline gallon equivalent. A full tank of natural gas, pressurized at 3,600 pounds a square inch, is equivalent to eight gallons of gasoline. On that basis, the GX is rated at 28 m.p.g. in the city and 39 on the highway. In my own driving, I averaged a bit over 30 m.p.h., slightly better than I did in the conventional Civic.</p>
        <p>The GX's overall emissions are considerably lower than even the Hybrid's, though it is also rated AT-PZEV. The GX not only emits less smog-causing compounds than a gasoline car, it also produces about 25 percent less of the emissions linked to global warming.</p>
        <p>The GX's natural gas tank is behind the rear seat, taking up a considerable amount of trunk space (and, like the Hybrid's, eliminating the fold-down rear seat).</p>
        <p>The tank is rated for a maximum of 3,600 p.s.i., giving the GX a potential travel range of about 260 miles -- though I started getting nervous when the low-fuel light illuminated around mile 200. But some fueling stations are capable of only a 3,000 p.s.i. fill (the equivalent of about six gallons of gasoline), which further reduces the distance the car can go.</p>
        <p>Filling the tank is much like pumping gasoline, though the GX has a special filler mechanism. Refueling from a pressurized source takes five minutes or less, about the same as filling up with gasoline at a self-serve station.</p>
        <p>So driving a natural gas car would seem to have a lot of advantages and not much downside, right? Unfortunately, there is a major drawback: fueling stations are sparse, particularly outside urban areas.</p>
        <p>Since many natural gas vehicles belong to government or corporate fleets, fueling stations are often run by government agencies and do not cater to public customers.</p>
        <p>Natural gas stations have been opening in California, New York and some other states, and obviously more will be coming as these vehicles become more popular.</p>
        <p>I found the nearest fuel station that would accept credit cards was 42 miles from my house in eastern Connecticut. Unfortunately, this station was charging $3.49 a gallon, considerably more than the going rate in California of $1.85 to $2.25.</p>
        <p>Given the limited travel range of the GX, a driver must always keep in mind where the stations are, making the GX best suited as a commuter car -- especially if you install a home-fueling device called Phill, which can be purchased or leased through Honda dealers. Only an exceptionally enterprising driver would want to take one on a cross-country trip.</p>
        <p>All three Civic sedans have their merits and each appeals to particular sensibilities.</p>
        <p>For the best driving experience, the conventional EX is the hands-down winner.</p>
        <p>Save-the-planet types can take heart in either the Civic Hybrid or GX, since both have emissions as low as anything but an all-electric vehicle.</p>
        <p>The Hybrid uses the least fossil fuel, but it still adds to the coffers of OPEC.</p>
        <p>The natural gas GX is not only the cleanest car sold in America, it contributes to the nation's energy independence by using a domestic fuel in plentiful supply.</p>
        <p>But the GX is simply not available -- yet -- in most of the United States, so the Hybrid may be the best compromise.</p>
