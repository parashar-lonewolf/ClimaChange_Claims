        <p>As the new evidence of ozone layer damage reported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shows, we have yet to experience the full impact of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-destroying emissions on the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>A ban on chlorofluorocarbons is a first step toward reducing even worse atmospheric damages.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the new evidence of ozone layer damage reported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shows, we have yet to experience the full impact of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-destroying emissions on the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>A ban on chlorofluorocarbons is a first step toward reducing even worse atmospheric damages. But with the world's population growing by 95 million a year, and 90 percent of this growth occurring in the world's poorest countries, future human demands threaten to outpace environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>As "The Ozone Hole Over Mr. Bush's Head" (editorial, Feb. 5) notes, in 1990 the White House refused a request from the developing world for $20 million to finance conversions of CFC's to safer chemicals. Currently, developing nations produce 17 percent of all CFC's; by early next century, their CFC production will rise to 29 percent of the world's total. Meanwhile, India hopes to provide its citizens with 300 million refrigerators by early in the next century.</p>
        <p>China plans to expand CFC production tenfold by the year 2000, since only one in three of China's 250 million households has a refrigerator. Although both countries are now willing to join in CFC reduction plans, economic demands and environmental planning present conflicts here and in the rest of the world's fastest growing and poorest countries.</p>
        <p>In 1984 the Reagan Administration turned its back on international family planning efforts, stating that population growth was a "neutral phenomenon," later withdrawing financing from the United Nations Population Fund, the largest multilateral supporter of family planning programming. President Bush, once an advocate of family planning, has continued the population policies of his predecessor.</p>
        <p>At this crucial juncture, it is vital that industrialized countries alter their own policies of consumption and support initiatives in the developing world for population growth reduction as well as efforts to preserve the environment. WERNER FORNOS President, Population Institute Washington, Feb. 7, 1992</p>
