        <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 Â— Facing intense criticism, the federal government announced today that it was withdrawing a proposal for oil and gas drilling in the Finger Lakes National Forest in upstate New York.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Facing intense criticism, the federal government announced today that it was withdrawing a proposal for oil and gas drilling in the Finger Lakes National Forest in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>The drilling plan, which had been under consideration by the United States Forest Service, would have given leases to private companies for the drilling rights to about 13,000 acres in the Finger Lakes National Forest.</p>
        <p>Northwest of Ithaca between Cayuga and Seneca Lakes, the national forest includes steep gorges, deep lakes, wineries and small towns in a region heavily dependent on tourism.</p>
        <p>The proposal had drawn criticism from New York lawmakers in both parties, who expressed concern that the drilling would disrupt the delicate ecology of the forest and mar its pristine landscape.</p>
        <p>Several companies had been seeking to tap the estimated 16 billion cubic feet of gas below the Finger Lakes forest -- enough to provide energy for 20 years to the 33,000 residents of Seneca County, where part of the forest lies.</p>
        <p>Congress recently approved a one-year moratorium on drilling in the national forest. But the Forest Service -- which until today seemed to favor limited drilling -- went ahead with an environmental study to determine whether the forest should eventually be opened to gas production.</p>
        <p>Today's decision was announced in a statement issued by Paul Brewster, supervisor of the Green Mountain and Finger Lakes National Forests. In the statement, he said, ''We looked at the external environment and noted that the current supply of natural gas in the United States was sufficient for the current demand; there was no compelling public need for the natural gas at this time.''</p>
        <p>The National Forest Service left open the possibility that it would consider drilling in the national forest in the Finger Lakes later if the need arose. But Mr. Brewster made it clear that the issue was closed for now, anyway. ''It was one of the most difficult decisions I've had to make in my career,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a related action today, New York's two senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, introduced legislation that would  permanently ban drilling in the Finger Lakes National Forest, the only national forest in New York and the smallest in the country.</p>
        <p>The issue had placed New York's Republican governor, George E. Pataki, in something of a political bind. Mr. Pataki, who is seeking re-election, was slow to voice his opposition to the drilling proposal, which some took as a sign that he did not want to offend the Bush administration because it had advanced the plan.</p>
        <p>Several environmental lobbyists said they had been counting on the governor to take a forceful position on the issue. During the governor's  tenure, he has sought to win the support of environmentalists, and his commitment to conservation is an important piece of his appeal to moderate voters.</p>
        <p>The governor's opposition to the drilling is one in a string of environmental issues on which he has opposed the president, including Mr. Bush's Arctic drilling plan, his reversal of a Clinton administration plan for stricter rules on arsenic in drinking water, and his retreat from a treaty to combat global warming.</p>
