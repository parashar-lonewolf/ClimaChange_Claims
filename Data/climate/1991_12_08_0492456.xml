        <p>Emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas scientists believe is the biggest contributor to climate change, fell in 1990, according to the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental organization. The organization predicted a continuing decline in 1991 and 1992.</p>
        <p>Worldwatch attributed most of the drop to the collapse of the economies of the Soviet Union and countries in Eastern Europe. Those economies are heavily based on coal, which produces more carbon dioxide per quantity of energy than other fuels do. In addition, these countries use more energy per unit of production than Western economies do, so any economic decline means a sharp drop in fuel use.</p>

        <p>Emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas scientists believe is the biggest contributor to climate change, fell in 1990, according to the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental organization. The organization predicted a continuing decline in 1991 and 1992.</p>
        <p>Worldwatch attributed most of the drop to the collapse of the economies of the Soviet Union and countries in Eastern Europe. Those economies are heavily based on coal, which produces more carbon dioxide per quantity of energy than other fuels do. In addition, these countries use more energy per unit of production than Western economies do, so any economic decline means a sharp drop in fuel use.</p>
        <p>The overall decline was small, less than two-tenths of 1 percent. Basing its estimate on data from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and British Petroleum, Worldwatch calculated that global emissions last year were 5.803 billion tons, down from 5.813 billion tons in 1989.</p>
        <p>Since 1950 the trend has been steadily up, except for the periods immediately after the oil-price increases and supply cutbacks of 1973 and 1979. Emissions in 1990 are up 12.8 percent since 1980 and 44.6 percent since 1970; since 1950, emissions have nearly quadrupled.</p>
        <p>Christopher Flavin, a vice president of Worldwatch, said, "while the new carbon dioxide figures don't represent the fundamental turnaround in energy trends needed to stabliize the climate, they suggest that lowering global carbon dioxide emissions will be easier than most national and international agencies have yet recognized." When formerly Communist economies modernize, he said, they will be far more energy efficient.</p>
        <p>The oil-well fires of Kuwait, set ablaze by retreating Iraqis in March and not completely extinguished until last month added about 100 million tons of carbon, Worldwatch estimated, or 1.8 percent of global emissions. With that factor removed next year, the 1992 emissions could be lower than 1991's, the group said.</p>
        <p>Worldwatch said emissions from the former Soviet Union were down 4 percent in 1990 and are likely to be down 5 percent more this year, while emissions from Eastern Europe fell 28 percent from 1987 to 1990. By the mid-90's, emissions for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could be down by 30 percent cumulatively, according to Worldwatch.</p>
        <p>With continuing declines in emissions from industrialized countries because of efficiency improvements, and increases from developing countries, the net effect could be "a near leveling off in global emissions during the 90's," the group said.</p>
