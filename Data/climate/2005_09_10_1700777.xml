        <p>Diplomats working on a pivotal document on the management overhaul of the United Nations and updated approaches to terrorism, development and human rights have locked horns just days before it is to be presented to more than 170 world leaders for their endorsement.</p>
        <p>Deep divisions persist despite crisis talks involving 32 ambassadors chosen to try to reach consensus, and there is looming embarrassment for the United Nations in having another failure on the heels of this week's report by the commission investigating the Iraqi oil-for-food program. The report, by a commission led by Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman, called for the kind of fundamental changes that the document puts forward.</p>
        <p>Once imagined as a visionary statement of the most far-reaching changes since the United Nations was created in San Francisco 60 years ago, the document instead is exposing the debilitating internal conflicts that often doom the organization to inaction.</p>
        <p>''Trying to reach the ambitions we had for it back in January as San Francisco II has rapidly become unrealistic,'' Mark Malloch Brown, Secretary General Kofi Annan's chief of staff, said in an interview Friday.</p>
        <p>''Now people are crimping it out of shape; they're emptying it of a lot of content,'' he said. ''If this is just brinkmanship, we can still pull it out, but if not, my deepest fear is that we'll end up with a summit of empty words and broken promises.''</p>
        <p>That would be a great setback for Mr. Annan, who first proposed the changes, and whose future is increasingly being tied to whatever success he can have with pushing them forward.</p>
        <p>Senator Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican who has repeatedly called for Mr. Annan's resignation because of the oil-for-food scandal, came to the United Nations on Friday to reiterate his position.</p>
        <p>''The secretary general is in no position to let that reform happen,'' he said. ''If the guy leading the charge is stained with a record of incompetence, of mismanagement, of fraud, it's going to make it very hard for him to do the very heavy lifting required.''</p>
        <p>Representative Tom Lantos, a California Democrat, rejected the notion, however, saying that Mr. Annan ''is the first to recognize the need for the fiscal and administrative reforms at the institution that Congress has called for. Therefore, calls for him to step down are misguided and do him an injustice.''</p>
        <p>Stalling progress is a basic disagreement between nations that want to see more power vested in the office of the secretary general and the 15-member Security Council and others, from the developing world, who want to retain power in the 191-member General Assembly.</p>
        <p>Abdallah Baali, Algeria's ambassador, said, ''On management reform, you have one side basically saying that the secretary general should be empowered and should have all flexibility as a kind of C.E.O. and the other side saying that it is not ready to give up the prerogative of the General Assembly and would like to keep a close eye on the work of the secretary general.''</p>
        <p>Also in dispute are measures to define terrorism as action against civilians that can never have any political justification, to enable the United Nations to take action in countries that do not protect their citizens from genocide.</p>
        <p>A clash over development was defused Tuesday when the United States withdrew an earlier demand to eliminate all mention of the so-called millennium development goals and compromised on language covering the Kyoto Protocols on climate change and the goal of devoting 0.7 percent of gross national product to development aid.</p>
        <p>The original document went through refinements in the spring and summer and appeared headed to general acceptance. In late August, though, the new United States ambassador, John R. Bolton, made public more than 400 amendments and deletions and insisted that the matter be taken away from lower ranking representatives and given to ambassadors to work out.</p>
        <p>Other nations saw that as an opportunity to bring their wishes to the table, and the ensuing talks have sometimes sharpened the divisions.</p>
        <p>A senior United Nations official, speaking anonymously because of the need to maintain neutrality among member states, identified the principal spoilers as Cuba, Egypt, India, Jamaica, Pakistan and the United States.</p>
        <p>''There is progress on a lot of small stuff, but no deals on the big stuff,'' he said. ''Clearly everyone is waiting, and the game is for very high stakes. The spoilers are taking hostage the rest of the world, because Africa, Europe, large swatches of Asia, Latin America all want this deal, but the unholy alliance are holding out for their pet projects.''</p>
