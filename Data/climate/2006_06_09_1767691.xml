        <p>China Halts 'The Da Vinci Code'</p>
        <p>The Chinese government has ordered movie theaters to stop showing ''The Da Vinci Code,'' The Associated Press reported. A Chinese film industry executive, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said a foreign film had never before been pulled from theaters in China after being approved for release. The executive said he was told the film, which opened on May 19, was withdrawn to make way for locally produced movies. But he noted that another Hollywood film, ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' was to be released in China today.</p>
        <p>Streisand to Tour</p>
        <p>Barbra Streisand will hit the road next fall in her first national tour since 1994. An announcement from her manager, Martin Erlichman, who is producing the tour, said it would consist of 20 concerts in October and November to raise money for charities she supports. In a statement, Ms. Streisand, left, said: ''The increasingly urgent need for private citizen support to combat dangerous climate change, along with education and health issues, was the prime reason I decided to tour again. This will allow me to direct funds and awareness to causes that I care deeply about.'' Dates and cities are to be announced.</p>
        <p>Handke Rejects Heine Prize</p>
        <p>The avant-garde Austrian author Peter Handke turned down a German prize for literature before the Düsseldorf city council could vote to revoke it, Agence France-Presse reported. Mr. Handke, below, won the Heinrich Heine prize, valued at $63,000, last month. But last week the council said it would veto the jury's decision because of Mr. Handke's sympathies for the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died in March in The Hague while on trial for genocide and war crimes. In a letter to Joachim Erwin, Düsseldorf's mayor, Mr. Handke said, ''I am writing to you to spare you and the world from the upcoming sitting of the city council in which they will decide not to give me the prize.'' He added that his action was ''above all to spare my work, which I do not want to become an endless target for the vulgar insults of party politicians.''</p>
        <p>The British Museum Makes History</p>
        <p>The British Museum will stay open until midnight for the first time in its 247-year history to accommodate visitors to its exhibition ''Michelangelo Drawings: Closer to the Master,'' The Associated Press reported. The museum will remain open until midnight every Saturday until July 25, when the exhibition of 90 drawings, which has attracted more than 140,000 people since it opened in London at the end of March, is scheduled to close.</p>
        <p>Chief Executive to Leave American Film Institute</p>
        <p>Jean Picker Firstenberg announced plans yesterday to step down next year as the chief executive of the American Film Institute. Ms. Firstenberg, 70, below, who has led the organization since 1980, said she would leave after a search for her successor is completed and after she leads the institute through its 40th-anniversary celebrations in 2007. ''I then plan to travel, write, consult and continue to be an advocate for the art and artists of film and television,'' she said. During her tenure, Ms. Firstenberg, who was named to her post by the board and Charlton Heston, then the organization's chairman, has expanded the institute beyond its founding mission, to train a new generation of filmmakers and preserve the nation's film heritage. It transformed itself from a traditional nonprofit organization significantly financed by the National Endowment for the Arts into a self-sufficient entrepreneurial organization. It also became a major nonprofit film exhibitor, inaugurated significant celebrations of American film and television, acquired an eight-acre Los Angeles campus, opened a theater and culture center outside Washington and established the AFI Los Angeles International Film Festival.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Loretta Lynn, 71, below, was scheduled to undergo surgery in Nashville yesterday after breaking her shoulder in a fall at her home on Sunday, The Associated Press reported. Because of the injury, she has canceled nine concerts this month and next. The Japanese designer Issey Miyake, 68, has been named a Kyoto Prize laureate for lifetime achievement in the arts. He is to receive a diploma, a gold medal and a cash gift of 50 million yen ($446,000) in November in Kyoto, Japan. Also named winners by the Inamori Foundation were the American immunologist and geneticist Leonard A. Herzenberg, 74, of Stanford University and the Japanese statistical mathematician Hirotugu Akaike, 78.  Six and a half weeks after opening at the Broadhurst Theater, the Broadway production of Alan Bennett's ''History Boys,'' imported from the National Theater in London, recouped its $1.9 million investment. An announcement yesterday said ''The History Boys,'' nominated for seven Tony Awards, had paid back its production cost during the week that ended May 28, after 10 previews and 41 regular performances. Its limited engagement ends Sept. 3.  Uzodinma Iweala has won the 2006 Young Lions Fiction Award for his debut novel, ''Beasts of No Nation'' (HarperCollins). The $10,000 prize is given annually to a fiction writer under 35 by the Young Lions, an organization of New York Public Library supporters in their 20's and 30's. Mr. Iweala is 23.</p>
