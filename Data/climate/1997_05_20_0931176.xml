        <p>GODZILLA, genitalless, gut feeling, gouty legs, goliath, gooseberry distal, ghost, glisten, gang-of-three.</p>
        <p>The quirky names, each carefully annotated, can be found on a Web site known as Flybase, the compendium of knowledge and home page of the world's 5,600 fly people. It is a point of honor among fly people, as biologists who study the laboratory fruit fly call themselves, to avoid giving unimaginative names to the new genes they identify in their favorite organism.</p>
        <p>The fruit fly is a little speck of a thing, most noticeable in the form of the hovering clouds that emerge from that forgotten peach at the bottom of the fruit bowl. But this little speck has now become the center of a vast research enterprise, the focus of attention of many of the world's best biologists.</p>
        <p>Their goal is to take the fly apart and put it back together by thorough analysis of its genes. When they can do that, they hope to understand several of life's deepest mysteries, like how a complex organism develops from a simple egg and how a nervous system is wired to produce a certain pattern of behavior.</p>
        <p>Medical research agencies willingly support fruit fly research because its relevance to humans has turned out to be surprisingly direct. Many of the most important fruit fly genes, like those that tell the developing embryo to produce organs in certain places, have been found to have counterparts in humans. The fly and human versions of these genes are not identical but have recognizably similar DNA sequences, reflecting their descent from a common ancestral gene some 600  million years ago.</p>
        <p>Fly people are now positioned on the forefront of biological research. Since their organism is so easy to study, many significant genes are discovered first in flies, allowing other researchers to find counterparts in mice or men. The fly people's penchant for playful gene names has tended to cross over, too. A gene called fringe in the fruit fly has vertebrate counterparts named manic, lunatic and radical.</p>
        <p>The fly's present pre-eminence in biology comes after a series of ups and downs. The Drosophila fruit fly was first chosen for scientific study in 1908 by Thomas Hunt Morgan of Columbia University. Morgan and his pupils worked out much of what is now standard genetics on the fruit fly. But Drosophila took a back seat after the discovery of DNA in 1953. The pioneers of modern molecular biology did their work in viruses and bacteria, the simplest forms of life. Fruit fly research stagnated.</p>
        <p>The fly flew back into prominence when biologists skilled in the techniques developed for studying viruses and bacteria decided to tackle the far more complicated cells of higher organisms, and chose Drosophila as their vehicle. Several genetic techniques were developed in the fruit fly bv Dr. David Hogness of Stanford University, and by students of his such as Dr. Gerald M. Rubin of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>By the 1980's, spectacular discoveries began to emerge about the genes that govern development of the early embryo. Some of these processes were special to insects, but the master genes that controlled them seemed to be part of a general plan for patterning all animal bodies.</p>
        <p>Until the discovery of the patterning genes, said Dr. Ralph J. Greenspan of New York University, ''it was very difficult to gain acceptance in other fields because they thought flies were irrelevant.''</p>
        <p>''Gene homology with humans really legitimized the fly,'' Dr. Greenspan said of the similarities in the genes' DNA sequences. Drosophila researchers who had sought Federal grants on the grounds that their work would be relevant to humans found their arguments were even truer than they had thought, Dr. Rubin noted.</p>
        <p>But at their moment of triumph, the fly people were threatened by rival tribes of biologists seeking knowledge from other totem animals. Some favored a tiny transparent worm, known as C. elegans. One of the fly people's stars, Dr. Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, now of the Max Planck Institute in Tubingen, Germany, began development of another model organism, the zebra fish of tropical aquariums. A technique for deleting genes put the mouse on the map as a workable model.</p>
        <p>The National Institutes of Health supports research on all these animals as part of its human genome project, to which it deems each will contribute. For a time it seemed that creatures with backbones would provide a surer guide to human genetics. But the fly people have fended off their rivals, at least for the moment, saved by the surprising and extensive overlap of the genes among all the model organisms, and because the techniques for manipulating the fly's genetics are so much further advanced.</p>
        <p>Drosophila research is now flourishing as never before. In the late 1980's about 200 researchers attended the annual national fly meeting. At last month's meeting in Chicago, some 1,400 people showed up. Dr. Kathy A. Matthews of Indiana University keeps the Fort Knox of the fly world, a collection of some 4,500 different strains of Drosophila maintained at the stock center at Bloomington. She sends out some 600 shipments every week to fly laboratories, a quarter of them outside the United States.</p>
        <p>''The field has been growing every year for the 10 years I have been here,'' Dr. Matthews said. ''We have been growing by 20 to 30 percent a year.''</p>
        <p>The fly people compete with other biologists for money and graduate students but increasingly collaborate with them in finding counterpart genes. Still, Drosophila workers see themselves as a distinct community, glued together by shared institutions and values.</p>
        <p>Their accumulating knowledge of fly genes, once broadcast in a mimeographed newsletter, is now stored in an electronic archive called Flybase (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu, with mirror sites in Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and Harvard). A separate data base, Flybrain, has been started for those who explore the genetics of the fly's nervous system (http://flybrain.ub.uni-freiburg.de). And the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, also supports a growing electronic archive (http:// fruitfly.berkeley.edu).</p>
        <p>The aim of the project is to work out the sequence of the 165 million chemical letters of the fruit fly's DNA. Dr. Rubin, the project's director, said he hoped to complete the sequence within five years.</p>
        <p>Fly people view themselves as being more open than other biologists and more generous with research materials. Their community has an ethos, which they attribute to Morgan, their founding father, of sharing fly strains and techniques even with close competitors.</p>
        <p>''It's that tradition -- not a tradition you'd find in the tumor virus field, to name one -- that has been tremendously powerful,'' said Michael Ashburner of Cambridge University, the author of a textbook known reverently as the Talmud of fly genetics.</p>
        <p>In other fields, colleagues sharing a genetically altered mouse or a special reagent will often demand co-authorship on the resulting paper. The rule among the fly community is to share without obligation, Dr. Rubin said, a custom he views as conducive to rapid progress.</p>
        <p>Yet giving out a strain or technique can quickly nullify a biologist's edge over competitors.</p>
        <p>''You are virtually blacklisted if you don't share,'' said Sean B. Carroll of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ''I think everyone is more nervous, because there are so many extremely competent and hard-working people and your own advances are shared so quickly. You may make one long stride but it quickly becomes a level playing field until you make take your next step.''</p>
        <p>Besides competitive colleagues, another matter that constantly weighs on fly people's minds is virginity. Fly genetics depends on substituting the experimenter's strict designs for nature's unplanned shuffling of genes. Complicated, multigenerational breeding schemes can be ruined if the females enter into love matches instead of arranged marriages. So every morning and evening the fly breeder must collect newly hatched females before they are ready to mate.</p>
        <p>''Arrange your crosses to compensate for nonvirginity wherever possible,'' Dr. Greenspan, of New York University, advises in ''Fly Pushing,'' a new handbook of fly genetics (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). ''This is especially important if your social life should suddenly become complicated and you miss the odd virgin collection.''</p>
        <p>Drosophila researchers sometimes call themselves fly pushers because much of their time can be spent sorting anesthetized flies under a microscope. One recent morning in Dr. Greenspan's laboratory, two of his assistants, Nanci Kane and Susan Broughton, showed how the flies were stunned with a puff of carbon dioxide. After examination, appropriate partners were sucked gently into a glass tube and blown into a tiny nuptial chamber known as a mating wheel.</p>
        <p>Fruit fly larvae are raised in small bottles and dine on a slush of baker's yeast, molasses and cornmeal. The passage from egghood to parenthood takes 10 to 14 days, depending on temperature. It is this rapid generation time, along with numerous offspring and specially visible chromosomes, that makes the fly so convenient for geneticists.</p>
        <p>Fly people, in turn, take good care of their minuscule charges. The flies often need cosseting, since strains may become enfeebled under a burden of weird mutations. Rather than grapple with agricultural customs regulations, some fearless fly aficionados are said to smuggle stocks across borders, strapping the bottles to their bodies to avoid the radiation of luggage-scanning machines. (The laboratory fruit fly is harmless, unlike its orchard-razing relative, the dreaded Med fly). Two things keep fly people awake at night: mite infestations and incubator failure, either of which can wipe out precious stocks and months of crosses.</p>
        <p>Flies have a delicate courtship in which the male sings by vibrating his wing; the female will accept him if she likes his song. Charming as the ritual may be, it is not completely spontaneous. The roles of both partners are governed by specific genes, a fact that has opened a new branch of inquiry. Most fly people still study the development of the embryo, but many are now using the fly to explore the genetics of behavior.</p>
        <p>Drosophila geneticists have become so adept at designing genes to order that they talk of engineering the fly. But when asked whether he thinks of the fly as just a biological machine, Dr. Ashburner, of Cambridge, said: ''No, I don't. We do engineer it like a machine, but I think most of us who work with flies realize just how bloody complex the thing is and how little we understand what is going on. The regulatory networks are very complex and we are only skimming the surface.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Greenspan, too, considers Drosophila more than a machine. One reason is that the flies' behavior is very varied, as is necessary to cope with the variability in its surroundings. He also admits to a certain feeling for the insect.</p>
        <p>''There is a real sense of affection that people have for the fly,'' he said. ''It is hard to account for. You always refer to it as 'the little fly.' In a sense it is a matter of respect for it, for what it has taught us, and the idea that if you are appropriately humble in terms of what it can do for you, you can get an enormous amount out of it.''</p>
