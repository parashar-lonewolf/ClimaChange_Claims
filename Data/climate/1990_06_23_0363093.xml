        <p>LEAD: Du Pont announced yesterday that it would design four plants to produce refrigeration chemicals that do not endanger the earth's ozone layer, but said it was continuing to delay a commitment to produce another family of compounds that would have a different use.</p>
        <p>Du Pont announced yesterday that it would design four plants to produce refrigeration chemicals that do not endanger the earth's ozone layer, but said it was continuing to delay a commitment to produce another family of compounds that would have a different use.</p>
        <p>The company said the decision to build the plants put it among the leaders in the production of environmentally friendly refrigerants. ''These commercial facilities would be among the first to produce world-scale quantities of non-ozone depleting alternatives,'' said Joseph P. Glas, director of the Freon Products division of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company. Freon is Du Pont's trade name for current refrigeration compounds.</p>
        <p>Both groups of chemicals are intended to replace the most widely used refrigerants, known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. The chlorine in CFC's that escapes to the atmosphere has been identified by scientists as the principal agent responsible for the thinning of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Because the ozone shields the earth from harmful solar rays that can cause skin cancer and disrupt the food chain, most industrial nations have agreed to phase out the use of the CFC's by 2000. More than two billion pounds of the chemicals are used annually worldwide, a third of them in the United States. They are also used in insulation and as cleaning agents in electronics.</p>
        <p>The company said the new plants would produce four types of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFC's, for use in automotive air-conditioners, home refrigerators and commercial refrigeration equipment. The new compounds contain no chlorine and are therefore not expected to pose a threat to the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>When they become operational, between 1992 and 1995, the plants will have the capacity to produce 140 million pounds of refrigerants annually, which the company said ''could supply most worldwide refrigeration needs through the end of the century.''</p>
        <p>The plants will be in Corpus Christi, Tex.; Louisville, Ky; Dordrecht, the Netherlands, and Chiba, Japan.</p>
        <p>Du Pont said it was holding back on plans to expand production of a third group of chemicals, known as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, pending passage of the revised Clean Air Act. HCFC's, as they are known, have been scheduled to replace CFC's in the roughly 75 percent of applications where HFC's are not suitable.</p>
        <p>Among the CFC applications where HFC's will not work are as refrigerants in large industrial chilling equipment and in the production of insulating foams, Du Pont officials said.</p>
        <p>HCFC's have much less ozone-depleting potential than CFC's, but they do contain chlorine. As a result, some environmental advocates have called for their use to be phased out soon after CFC's are eliminated in the next century. Big producers like Du Pont have said the HCFC ban should not take effect until 2030, to allow it and makers of equipment using the chemicals to recoup their investments in equipment to make and use the compounds.</p>
        <p>But an amendment to the Senate version of the Clean Air Act revision would ban their use by 2015. Mr. Glas said large chilling units that cool office buildings and hospitals have an economic life of up to 40 years. Anyone buying equipment designed for HCFC's could face a shortage of refrigerant long before the equipment was scheduled to be retired.</p>
        <p>Chemical industry executives have argued that the use of HCFC's is necessary for a quick phasing out of CFC's. And they have warned that if HCFC's are banned too soon, developing countries may continue to use the more dangerous CFC's, to the detriment of the ozone layer, until environmentally benign alternatives are found.</p>
        <p>Redesign Necessary</p>
        <p>Phasing out CFC's means redesigning all equipment that uses them as a refrigerant fluid. None of the proposed alternatives can be used in machines designed for CFC's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glas said Du Pont, which is one of the world's largest producers of CFC's, is working with manufacturers to assure that substitute fluids deliver adequate performance. He said domestic automobiles with non-CFC air-conditioners would probably be available toward the end of next year. The substitute would be an HFC compound designated HFC-134a.</p>
        <p>Du Pont said that by the end of the year it will have invested $240 million in research and capital spending on CFC replacements. It said total expenditures by the end of the century could total more than $1 billion.</p>
