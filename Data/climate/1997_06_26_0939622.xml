        <p>President Clinton today approved significantly tighter pollution limits on deadly soot and choking smog, while offering states and cities substantial flexibility in deciding how to reach the new goals over the next 10 years and beyond.</p>
        <p>The action, one of the most important environmental decisions of the decade, ended a fierce behind-the-scenes battle. Mr. Clinton sided with the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol M. Browner, against the concerns of his economic advisers, who had balked in the face of industry complaints that the rules would cost far more than they were worth.</p>
        <p>The White House put aside many of those economic concerns once Vice President Al Gore jumped into the fray last week, after lobbying by environmental groups, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>And in the end, Ms. Browner made relatively modest changes to the rule her agency proposed last November.</p>
        <p>Announcing his decision in a speech in Tennessee, the President cast it as an initiative to protect children, a favorite theme for the Administration. In this case, he cited especially the asthmatics who are most at risk from exposure to ozone and small particles of soot, two common pollutants caused by burning fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>''I approved some very strong new regulations today that will be somewhat controversial, but I think kids ought to be healthy,'' Mr. Clinton said at a conference on families at which Mr. Gore was the host.</p>
        <p>The rules are expected to have wide-ranging practical effects. For example, old power plants in the Midwest may have to install the kind of expensive pollution-control equipment that is already commonly used in much of the Northeast, where the air is dirtier. Also, states will probably have to put more money into mass transit and other measures to reduce pollution from automobiles.</p>
        <p>In addition, some factories like steel plants that burn lots of coal may be required to adapt their equipment to cleaner-burning fuels to avoid emissions of soot. And even the United States Forest Service may have to change the way it sets controlled fires on public lands to avoid sending too much smoke into the air.</p>
        <p>The air pollution regulation is one of two major environmental issues on the President's agenda this week, both of them intensely debated and each of them dividing one of the Administration's core constituencies, environmentalists, from business groups that the Administration does not want to alienate. On Thursday, he is to outline the Administration's policies on global warming to a United Nations conference in New York, where the United States has been criticized by European states for not moving swiftly enough to control emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Although the pollutants are different and the problems they cause are not directly related, both global warming and the soot and smog issues addressed today stem largely from the combustion of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Like the efforts to negotiate a binding treaty to limit emissions of gases that cause global warming, the Administration's decision on air quality rules faced an enormous campaign of opposition by industry and equally determined efforts by environmentalists who supported it.</p>
        <p>''The final product, I am delighted to say, is a major step forward for protecting the public health of the people of this country,'' said Ms. Browner, whose adamant defense of the proposals was described by her backers as courageous and principled, but by her detractors as stubborn and close-minded. ''These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children.''</p>
        <p>She spoke at a White House briefing that included officials who for weeks have argued over the rules.</p>
        <p>Those millions of people, E.P.A. officials said, live in hundreds of counties that will eventually have to impose new pollution control measures to meet the new standards.</p>
        <p>The agency has claimed, based on epidemiological studies, that 15,000 people die every year from exposure to these pollutants, especially the fine sooty particles. And the agency expects that hundreds of thousands of acute asthma attacks can be avoided each year, since smog often triggers breathing difficulties in children with that disease.</p>
        <p>By putting the new controls into place, states with relatively clean air will also be helping to clean the air in New York and other downwind states where the air is generally dirtier. Across most of the Northeast, a significant fraction of the chronic air pollution blows in from the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Under the Clean Air Act, the E.P.A. must set health-based standards for air quality without regard to the potential expense. States where the air violates these standards must then impose pollution controls that can cost industries billions of dollars and inconvenience motorists. The drive to tighten the standards touched off a huge lobbying campaign over the past two years, led by auto makers, electric utilities, fuel suppliers and manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Although the final rules are not quite as aggressive as the version that was first proposed, they are nonetheless a significant milestone in the long struggle against unhealthy air. The last time the ozone standard was changed, nearly 20 years ago, it was weakened. The tiniest particles of sooty chemicals, so small that they lodge deep in the lungs, have never been controlled before under the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>Some of the expected health benefits from the new regulations will not be felt until at least 2003 in the case of smog and 2008 in the case of soot, officials said. In the meantime, steps that are already under way to control pollution should continue to provide more modest gains.</p>
        <p>A coalition of powerful industry groups denounced the decision as ''crushing blow'' to the economy, and urged Congress to overturn it.</p>
        <p>''The Administration lacked the courage to do what is right,'' said Charles J. DiBona of the American Petroleum Institute, a leader of the coalition. ''Those who worked hard to bring reason to the debate, including some 250 members of Congress, 27 governors and more than a thousand mayors and other state, county and local officials, were simply ignored.''</p>
        <p>Environmental groups highly  praised the new standards and raised no objections to the flexible approach the Administration is offering to put the rules in place.</p>
        <p>''They really stood up to the worst that industry could throw at them,'' said Philip Clapp, the head of the Environmental Information Center, who had lobbied hard on the issue and criticized Mr. Gore last week for not intervening strongly enough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clapp and other environmentalists said they believed that when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore focused on the rule in the past week or so, they acted decisively to favor the Administration's green faction. ''They were extremely mindful of the fact that they had campaigned extensively on the environment, and the leaders of the Administration made their decision based on the promises they had made,'' Mr. Clapp said.</p>
        <p>At the White House today, Mr.  Clinton's advisers sought to describe the intense interagency fight over the rules as a normal process in writing regulations, and said all sides agreed that protecting the public health was a top priority all along.</p>
        <p>But privately, Administration officials said there was a definite dispute between economic agencies and health agencies. The Treasury Department, for example, fought Ms. Browner's proposals, while the Department of Health and Human Services supported her.</p>
        <p>Although the fight within the Administration over the proposals is now over, the new standards continue to face opposition in Congress and in the courts.</p>
        <p>Industry opponents are making several claims. They contend that the scientific evidence linking air pollution to illness and death is not solid enough, and the predicted health benefits not great enough, to justify such large expenditures. And they maintain that the E.P.A. failed to adequately assess the economic effects of tighter controls on small businesses, as required by a new law that gives Congress 60 days to overturn any major Federal regulation. The new rules on air quality are expected to be published in mid-July.</p>
        <p>The new standards for ozone, a compound of oxygen in a form that corrodes tissues, call for concentrations in the air not to exceed 80 parts per billion over an eight-hour period. Places where smog exceeds that standard more than four times a year averaged over three years would have to adopt corrective measures. The existing standard is 120 parts per billion over a one-hour peak period, a measure that the agency considers flawed because brief spikes of smog show up as violations, while persistent smog at lower but still damaging levels go unprevented.</p>
        <p>The new rules for fine particles of 2.5 microns in diameter call for daily averages not to exceed 65 micrograms per cubic meter of air, and for annual averages not to exceed 15 micrograms per cubic meter.</p>
        <p>To provide more flexibility as states try to comply with the fine particle rule, the E.P.A. loosened its earlier proposal for the daily standard, which was to have been 50 micrograms per cubic meter. But it maintained its initial proposal for the annual standard, which is a better indicator of chronic air pollution.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. agreed to allow five years for constructing monitors to detect the fine particles, since they have not been regulated before, and a few years more will pass before states must actually control emissions. During that time, more scientific studies of the health effects will be conducted.</p>
