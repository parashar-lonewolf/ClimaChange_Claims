        <p>LEAD: President-elect Bush, who described himself as an environmentalist in his election campaign, will have ample opportunity to prove it when he takes office.</p>
        <p>President-elect Bush, who described himself as an environmentalist in his election campaign, will have ample opportunity to prove it when he takes office.</p>
        <p>His administration will immediately be confronted with a long list of problems in pollution and in the depletion of resources, some of them affecting not only the nation but also the world.</p>
        <p>According to White House and environmental sources, Mr. Bush will have a breakfast meeting with leaders of the leading environmental organizations on Wednesday, just before the groups make public a ''Blueprint for the Environment,'' recommendations for the next administration on how to do a better job of fighting pollution and protecting natural resources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will take office at a time of rising scientific and public concern about a range of seemingly intractable environmental threats, ranging from urban smog and polluted beaches to global warming and the destruction of the earth's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>These perils are all the more disheartening because they come after two decades of activism in the public and private sectors to reduce pollution.</p>
        <p>Government environmental officials, past and present, as well as scientists, environmentalists and other experts interviewed in recent months generally agreed that the effort to clean up the environment has made some progress and certainly has held the line against what would have been much worse environmental degradation in the face of population growth and expanding economic activity.</p>
        <p>But they also acknowledged that the the task of cleaning and protecting the environment now seems much more complex, daunting and urgent than it did 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>''No nation in the world has grappled so successfully with these issues as the United States,'' said Russell E. Train, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who was chairman of President Nixon's Council on Environmental Quality. ''Without these accomplishments where would we be today? We would be like Mexico City or Sao Paulo.''</p>
        <p>But ''the problems hitting us now, problems like toxic wastes, acid rain, and global warming, are hellishly more complex and difficult, not only technically but politically and economically,'' Mr. Train said. An inventory of those problems and the gains that have been made follows:  Air</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act of 1970 singled out six pollutants - sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead and solid particles - considered especially troublesome to the nation's health and environment and set maximum permissible levels for those pollutants in the air of any given community. There has been measurable success, ranging from impressive to negligible, in curbing these pollutants.</p>
        <p>After the release of studies in the early 1980's showing relatively high levels of lead in the blood of most Americans and showing that the learning ability of children was impaired by lead in their systems, dramatic gains were made in removing lead from the air by retiring its use as an octane-booster in gasoline. The soot that darkened the skies at midday in industrial cities has been largely removed.</p>
        <p>Much more modest gains have been made in reducing other air pollutants. Most major urban areas fail to meet the mandated levels for ozone, a major component of smog, or carbon monoxide or both. Nitrogen oxide levels have been reduced only slightly and in some areas are starting to rise because of increased vehicular traffic.</p>
        <p>The law also authorized the Government to regulate the toxic air pollutants emitted by industry, many of which can cause cancer or cause other serious illness or injury. But relatively little has been done so far to come to grips with this problem. The Environmental Protection Agency has so far set standards for only 13 toxic air pollutants and new rules set by the toxic waste disposal law are only this year requiring industry to make public the nature and extent of toxic releases from factories and shops.</p>
        <p>One still unsolved and heavily debated issue, acid rain, is an example of how the nation, while seeking to deal with one kind of pollution created a different, more insidious problem. In response to the Clean Air Act's requirements for lowering sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution in industrial regions, many plants installed tall smoke stacks that would carry the gases high into the air and disperse them over a wider area.</p>
        <p>But pollution from these stacks, sometimes traveling hundreds of miles, is converted chemically in the atmosphere and returns to earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles. This acid precipitation can kill freshwater life and, many scientists believe, damage forests, erode buildings and threaten human health. Legislation that would have dealt with acid rain and toxic pollution was introduced but not enacted in the 100th Congress.  Water</p>
        <p>Although industry and municipalities made major strides in treating the raw sewage that they once poured into the the nation's streams, lakes, rivers and estuaries, the explicit goal of the Clean Water Act of 1972 of returning these waters to a fishable and swimmable state is still a long way from being achieved. While gross pollution of the kind that caused the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland to burst into flames 20 years ago is largely a thing of the past, the syringes and blood samples that washed ashore on Northeastern beaches this summer provided an ample demonstration of contamination in the nation's waters.</p>
        <p>The chief unregulated source of surface water contamination now is runoff containing fertilizers, pesticides and other pollutants from farms and livestock operations, and from urban streets and industrial areas tainted with metals and organic chemicals.</p>
        <p>Underground water supplies, which provide drinking water for half the nation as well as water for irrigation, remain largely unprotected despite evidence that this vital source is increasingly threatened by pesticide use, leaching from waste dumps and leaking underground storage tanks.  Waste</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. recently warned that the exploding volume of garbage and the lack of preparation for its disposal represented a crisis of ''staggering'' proportions.</p>
        <p>The solution, experts agree, is for the nation to stop producing throwaway materials and to recycle as much as possible. But the trend is toward production of ever more solid waste, while recycling is still practiced by a relatively few communities.</p>
        <p>In 1976 Congress passed a law requiring regulation of dangerous chemical wastes and other hazardous materials and in 1980 it enacted another law providing $1.6 billion to clean up abandoned hazardous waste sites. In 1987 this was raised to $8.5 billion. But it is widely agreed that because of imperfections in these laws, or in the slowness of Federal and state governments in carrying them out, many communities and their drinking water supplies remained seriously threatened by toxic wastes.  Pesticides</p>
        <p>The publication of Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring'' in the 1960's and the subsequent outpouring of concern about the impact of chemical pesticides on birds and other wildlife led to the banning of DDT and some other insect and weed killers that persisted in the environment for long periods. But these were replaced with newer chemicals, which, though less persistent, were more toxic. Meanwhile thousands of older pesticides, many untested or inadquately tested for the effect on public health and the environment, remain on the market.</p>
        <p>The volume of insecticides, herbicides and other chemicals has grown rapidly. The result is that millions working on the farm, or in their homes, as well as people who eat food with residues of pesticides, continued to be exposed to chemicals that pose a variety of health threats.  Land</p>
        <p>Public concern about the disappearance and degradation of the landscape as a result of urban sprawl and commercial exploitation led in the 1970's to a sharp increase in the amount of public land protected by the Federal Government. The national park, wilderness and wildlife refuge systems all experienced a major expansion.</p>
        <p>This expansion slowed sharply in the 1980's because of the Reagan Administration's view that the public domain had grown too rapidly and that there needed to be a period of consolidation.</p>
        <p>As the 80's wind down, the rapid loss of the nation's marshes, swamps, prairie potholes and other important wetlands to agricultural and commercial development remained almost unabated. The nation still is losing some 500,000 acres a year of these systems.  Global Problems</p>
        <p>Many scientists now believe that the most serious long-term environmental threat to civilization short of nuclear war is the probability of a substantial warming of the earth's surface caused by carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. These gases absorb infrared radiation from the sun and retain it in the atmosphere, much as a greenhouse retains heat from the sun. At current level of pollution, this greenhouse effect is expected to cause temperatures to rise by a global average of 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, and, as a consequence, cause a rise in sea levels, significant shifts in climate and disruptions in natural systems.</p>
        <p>So far, the global warming problem has not been addressed by public policy in this country or elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Another serious problem recently found to be of planetwide dimensions is the depletion of the earth's protective layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere by industrial chlorofluorocarbons. The ozone layer shields the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun and its depletion is expected to lead to increased skin cancer and cataracts as well as damage to forests, crops and marine life.</p>
        <p>The destruction of tropical forests in Latin America, Africa and Asia is now recognized as an assault on the environment that is regional in scale but global in implications. As forests on millions of acres are cut down each year, and the land opened for farming and ranching, many plant and animal species are being extirpated. These forests also serve the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen in photosynthesis, so their destruction is a major contributor to global warming and climate change.</p>
        <p>Finally, the rapid global population growth, particularly in the poorer countries, is regarded by some scientists as a serious threat to global ecological systems. The needs of feeding, clothing, sheltering and providing energy for this swelling mass of humanity is believed to be increasingly taxing natural systems and destroying the ability of these systems to sustain life over the long run.</p>
        <p>William D. Ruckelshaus, former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who is now chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, a major waste management company, said, ''The necessity of developing an environmental ethic is maybe more important now than it was 20 years ago.''</p>
        <p>''You go into a community and they will vote 80 percent to 20 percent in favor of a tougher Clean Air Act, but if ask them to devote 20 minutes a year to having their car emissions inspected, they will vote 80 to 20 against it,'' he said. ''We are a long way in this country from taking individual responsibility for the environmental problem. Just drive down the highway and watch the guy in front of you throw junk out of his car window. Unless we can get individuals to act differently than they do now, we have a hell of a problem.''</p>
