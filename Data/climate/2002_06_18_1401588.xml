      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For all the scratches and dents on Andre Valian's Plymouth Voyager minivan -- and there are quite a few -- the doors are remarkably ding-free.</p>
        <p>By one measure, that is a matter of kindness, of the drivers over the years who have avoided crunching their car doors into his.</p>
        <p>But by another, the smooth midsection of Mr. Valian's minivan reflects a certain municipal vision. Nearly a decade ago, Glendale officials noticed that while the typical family vehicle was getting bigger, the typical parking space was not.</p>
        <p>So in 1994, Glendale became one of the first California cities to eliminate spaces for compact cars in municipal and commercial parking lots in favor of a universally larger space so that all vehicles, including the ballooning numbers of sport utility vehicles, minivans and other light trucks, could aspire to a world without dings.</p>
        <p>In a state where cars define style and status for many residents, Glendale, a city of 200,000 people at the northern edge of Los Angeles, is not alone. With San Diego, Riverside and Santa Clarita among the latest cities to eliminate parking spaces for compact cars, nearly four dozen cities and counties across California have adopted similar requirements for parking lots where Ford Excursions, Chevrolet Suburbans and Toyota Tundras are muscling out the Honda Civics and Geo Metros.</p>
        <p>The sport utility culture is also exerting power at the state level. While California has developed a reputation as a defender of clean-air standards, it flinches at the prospect of new vehicle emission controls for S.U.V.'s and other large vehicles, which now account for almost half of all cars sold in the United States. A measure in the Legislature that would make California the first state to regulate carbon dioxide and other tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases is losing support.</p>
        <p>Experts predict that as long as people are buying the larger vehicles, communities will be willing to accommodate them, no matter how much they pollute.</p>
        <p>In California, that means larger parking spaces.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing more and more of it,'' said Pat Gibson, vice president of Kaku Associates, a traffic engineering and planning concern that works with communities changing regulations on parking spaces.</p>
        <p>A 1999 survey of 160 California cities and counties by International Parking Design Inc., an architecture and engineering consulting concern, found that 37 communities -- more than twice the number in the company's previous survey, in 1988 -- had eliminated compact spaces. The total includes politically liberal areas like Marin County, north of San Francisco, as well as places like Lawndale, a blue collar city south of the Los Angeles airport.</p>
        <p>Officials from the city and county of Los Angeles say they intend to address the size of parking spaces in their jurisdictions soon.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to do something,'' said Hal Bernson, a member of the Los Angeles City Council. ''I'm just waiting to get more information.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Gloria Molina, a Los Angeles County supervisor, said Ms. Molina had asked the planning commission for a similar proposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibson said the one-space-fits-all approach began more than a decade ago, when Californians began losing interest in small imports.</p>
        <p>In 2001, small cars constituted just 14.2 percent of car sales nationally, a drop from 23 percent a decade earlier, according to data from Ward's AutoInfoBank. Over the same period, sales of sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks rose to 44.9 percent of vehicles sold in 2001, from 33.3 percent in 1991.</p>
        <p>With fewer compact cars for their spaces and a growing number of larger vehicles competing for space, parking lot wars grew ugly.</p>
        <p>''We got so many complaints,'' said Edith Fuentes, the zoning administrator for Glendale. ''Even on the lot itself, people were arguing and screaming, 'Why are you taking up two spaces?' Or they parked where their car didn't fit.''</p>
        <p>In general, communities that changed regulations created spaces 8 to 9 feet wide and 18 to 20 feet long. In many parking lots, the new dimensions created spaces that are 12 to 18 inches wider, at the cost of up to 20 percent of the spaces.</p>
        <p>But even the larger parking places are causing some concerns. Mr. Valian, a Glendale resident for 28 years, complained that the enlarged slots were still too small.</p>
        <p>Ann Marable, who was juggling shopping bags with two children, Anthony, 4, and Isabella, 9 months, agreed, but conceded that her concern was tempered by the age and eroding condition of her 1993 Isuzu Rodeo.</p>
        <p>''I'm not that fearful that my car is going to get whacked,'' Ms. Marable said. ''It has so many door dings and changes in paint that it doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>But she recounted a recent family outing to Griffith Park, just across the city line in Los Angeles, where a woman squeezed her car between the Marables' S.U.V. and another vehicle. When one of the children opened the door and it bumped the woman's car, Ms. Marables said: ''She was screaming, 'Look what you've done to my new paint job!' I mean, she was freaking. When we finally got her calmed down, she looked at the door and saw it was only a water spot. I told her if she was so worried about her car, she should have parked somewhere else.''</p>
