        <p>"LET early education be a sort of amusement," Plato wrote. But as many educators say, this fine line is not easily walked. If a lesson is too playful, the need for thinking falls away; too book-intensive, and the current generation of so-called visual learners quickly loses interest.</p>
        <p>But this fine line has proved something of a cakewalk for Maxis, a California computer game company that started out with no intention of serving the educational market. The founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, set out with a much more self-interested mission in the mid-1980's. He had been experimenting with video games, but found most too trivial -- "So what if you shoot up a spaceship?" But he saw a business and education opportunity in developing games "that a yuppie adult like me would enjoy," he said. He nicknamed his venture "Games for Jeff."</p>

        <p>"LET early education be a sort of amusement," Plato wrote. But as many educators say, this fine line is not easily walked. If a lesson is too playful, the need for thinking falls away; too book-intensive, and the current generation of so-called visual learners quickly loses interest.</p>
        <p>But this fine line has proved something of a cakewalk for Maxis, a California computer game company that started out with no intention of serving the educational market. The founder of Maxis, Jeff Braun, set out with a much more self-interested mission in the mid-1980's. He had been experimenting with video games, but found most too trivial -- "So what if you shoot up a spaceship?" But he saw a business and education opportunity in developing games "that a yuppie adult like me would enjoy," he said. He nicknamed his venture "Games for Jeff."</p>
        <p>In 1987 he founded Maxis, the software publisher based in Orinda, Calif., that sold $13.3 million worth of entertainment software last year and has won a loyal following of educators.</p>
        <p>A great many companies now produce educational software, though many emphasize drills and practice to complement the curriculum they cover, such as "Number Munchers," by Mecc of Minneapolis, "Reader Rabbit," by the Learning Company, and "The Quarter Mile," by Barnum Software.</p>
        <p>But Maxis is markedly different. "It deals with principles," says Doreen Nelson, professor of environmental design at California State Polytechnic at Pomona, who has done consulting work for Maxis and studies education theory. "In this whole world of technology, Maxis really stands out."</p>
        <p>As their names suggest, the company's most popular titles, including "SimCity," "SimAnt" and "SimLife," which sell for $30 to $40, are simulation games in which the player is master of a particular universe. Turn on "SimCity" and you are the urban planner of a city where a year passes in a matter of minutes. Starting with an empty canvas, the player builds a city by adding residential areas, police and fire departments, shopping areas and businesses. Want more taxes to pay for more police to rein in criminals in the bad part of town? No problem; bring in some more big business. But wait! What to do with the pollution those companies are creating? How do you plan to accommodate a growing population? Endless Trade-Offs</p>
        <p>The questions, solutions, sacrifices and trade-offs go on indefinitely, with the kind of challenge that promotes critical thinking. "Kids think there is an answer to every question, but the questions change over time," Mr. Braun says. "There's no win or lose, just cause and effect." And the effects are reflected in the player's slipping or rising public opinion in the eyes of the simulated city's residents.</p>
        <p>In "SimAnt," the player is the commander of a black-ant colony that competes with a colony of red ants for territory and food, while contending with such hazards as lawn mowers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nelson says that although the games have high value in helping teach students to grasp the abstract and promote critical thinking, they are by no means perfect. The computer screen, after all, is two-dimensional. And she has found that students learn best when they are physically building a model city themselves.</p>
        <p>In the best of all worlds, students would get a sense of how the simulation games' complex innards work. In "SimCity," for example, an urban-modeling simulator that is based on real-world data conducts ongoing calculations based on a matrix of tax rates, crime statistics and property values. Currently, this function is invisible.</p>
        <p>Still, so many teachers have expressed an interest in Maxis programs that the company has developed handbooks to help teachers work up short lessons using the program. Teachers have also contributed to the writing of the handbooks.</p>
        <p>David Felt, a science teacher at Monterey (Calif.) High School, has contributed many lessons, including one in which students are assigned to analyze the warring ant colonies in "SimAnt." Mr. Felt also uses the program to teach his students more generally about arthropods. He asks the students to design an ant's appendages to work in space, thereby underscoring how each appendage of an earthbound ant is designed for a specific purpose.</p>
        <p>To a degree, Mr. Felt's exercise points up some of the current thinking about the use of computers in the classroom. Technology was once seen as a laudable solution destined for a starring role in schools. But educators now see computers as a small piece in a larger puzzle. For example, many teachers are using computers as tools for increasing interaction among students.</p>
        <p>Even so, computers have emerged as the best tutor for some students, particularly those who require remedial work. Nona Johnson, a math teacher who also coordinates computer activities at Isaac E. Young Middle School in New Rochelle, N.Y., noted that students can proceed through drill and practice programs at their own rate, and can make mistakes without risking embarrassment among their peers.</p>
        <p>Such thinking is a long way from Mr. Braun's pre-Maxis days, when he ran a company that developed factory-floor automation systems using bar codes. Then in 1985, he was taken with graphics and audio capabilities of the Amiga computer. "I decided it was going to change the world," he said. He developed specialized editing software, then sold the company with an eye to entering the video-game business, which he saw as a more creative field.  A Video-Game Party</p>
        <p>He needed programmers, and figured the best way to meet them was to throw a party featuring pizza, beer and, of course, video games. There he met Will Wright, whose game "Raid on Bungeling Bay" had sold a million copies but who had had worse luck with "Metropolis," a more constructive version of urban planning. When Mr. Wright shopped "Metropolis" around he was told that if players could not win, it was not a game.</p>
        <p>The party's host thought otherwise. "It was a breakout, something I had never seen before," said Mr. Braun, and the two joined forces.</p>
        <p>Their work has prompted some equally surprising results. Mr. Felt, the science teacher, for example, was introduced to Maxis software through his son, who peppered him one evening with questions while playing with "SimEarth." "He turned to me and said, 'Dad, what does the greenhouse effect mean?' " Mr. Felt recalled his son saying. "After about the third question I said, 'What are you doing?' "</p>
        <p>His son explained "SimEarth," and Mr. Felt has been a Maxis fan ever since. "It's pretty amazing," he said, "that a game company could put together so many concepts we use in science."  SOFTWARE</p>
