        <p>LEAD: OIL, air and water do not readily mix, but problems related to them do. Each one represents a growing ecological concern, a problem in themselves, but in combination a threat to our quality of life and standard of living. As an evolving conservationist, I feel that our current problems can only grow worse if we choose to ignore them.</p>
        <p>OIL, air and water do not readily mix, but problems related to them do. Each one represents a growing ecological concern, a problem in themselves, but in combination a threat to our quality of life and standard of living. As an evolving conservationist, I feel that our current problems can only grow worse if we choose to ignore them.</p>
        <p>In the New York area and other heavily populated regions, the demands on the Earth's resources are particularly heavy. Here the battle to control resource use and pollution must be won before our nests become so fouled that they can no longer serve as nests. The rub is that everything we might choose to do has a cost greater than what we are paying now but considerably less than what we will have to pay later.</p>
        <p>One immediate problem is the available quantity of these resources. Oil is a highly valued source of energy but its remaining supply is limited. Experts tell us we are using it up at a rate far greater than the Earth is replenishing it.</p>
        <p>The easy and cheap oil extraction times have long passed. We are currently planning to explore for more black gold in Alaska, not because its extraction and dispersal will be easy, but because it is one of the few places where a sizable find is possible.</p>
        <p>Does anyone doubt that this new source will not cost more than the curent price of oil? Current estimates are that even if it meets our expectations in quantity, it will take only one year of American consumption to use it up. We are risking another Valdez spill, an ecological disaster, for a modest return. We would be better off using other energy sources and reducing overall energy requirements before we further explore the Arctic.</p>
        <p>Oil is also capable of degrading our air as well as our coastal waters. The burning of quantities of hydrocarbons is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is suspected of creating the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Our environment, which we tend to consider permanent, appears to be slowly changing. More immediate is the pollution caused by burning hydrocarbons inefficently. Automobile emissions, though under some control, are not being reduced at the rate originally intended. California officials have recently adopted an air-quality standard to reduce the pollution in the coming decades. They are right in their thinking, but it will surely affect their wallets.</p>
        <p>Autos that run on natural gas or batteries are logical improvements that could provide us time to set our world in order. We will be approaching a permanent solution when we begin to think of this planet as our spaceship, where important resources are recycled.</p>
        <p>The problems with water are of quantity and quality. The demands of a metropolitan area for pure water are great. New York City requires a vast watershed in the Catskills to quench its thirst. Any change that reduces the yearly precipitation will bring on a permament drought.</p>
        <p>Long Island, whose wells tap underground pools of water established tens of thousands of years ago, is facing a water debt. Fresh water is not being replaced at the rate it is being used. In both cases, obtaining more water will be costly.</p>
        <p>Salt or brackish water can be distilled into fresh water, but at great cost. Bermuda is able to capture enough rain water to supply its needs but it is hard to conceive that Long Island would ever construct enough cisterns to hold supplemental rain water. As with oil, it would be easier and cheaper to reduce demand.</p>
        <p>Oil, air and water problems are not insurmountable; however, they do require attention followed by honest efforts. Where populations are concentrated, the problems are magnified. The solutions will have to be applied throughout the world.</p>
        <p>To maintain an atmosphere we will have to control what is discharged into it and insure that enough forests are preserved to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. To have sufficient pure water we will have to live with what nature provides us or be willing to pay for additional supplies.</p>
        <p>To meet our energy needs we will have to look beyond dwindling oil reserves to other sources and conservation until we can balance the energy equation or find a source, like nuclear fusion, that will carry us to the end of Earth's time.</p>
        <p>Like most difficult tasks, all we really need is the resolve. If we collectively do not make those hard decisions we, be assured that Mother Nature will make them for us, but probably not to our liking.</p>
