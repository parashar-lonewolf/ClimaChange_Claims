        <p>Each fall, the weekly Leelanau Enterprise promises $100 to the reader who comes closest to estimating the final winter snowfall on this peninsula famed for its breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and miles of cherry orchards.</p>
        <p>On April 25, 34-year-old Donna Thomas was declared the victor with a guess of 217 3/4 inches, 70 inches higher than normal. Winter, though, was not yet over.  Six days later it snowed 4 inches more, bringing the official total in Leelanau  (pronounced LEE-lan-awe) County to 231 inches, surpassing the previous record by two feet.</p>
        <p>Everybody was fine until those last couple of snows," said Wendy VerSnyder, a clerk at the newspaper. "We've all had enough."</p>
        <p>With weeks of zero and below-zero temperatures, and snow that often falls at  the rate of a foot a day, Leelanau and its neighboring counties in northwestern  Michigan are accustomed to hard winters and chilly, reluctant springs. Normally, though, April means putting away the boots and heavy coats, and early May's warm winds prompt lakeside homeowners to put their boat docks in the water.</p>
        <p>Not this year. Beginning with the first snow in late October, people in this  region of farms and forests near the northern end of Lake Michigan have endured  six straight months of snow, ice and shivering.</p>
        <p>On May 1, motorists were still brushing snow off their windshields.</p>
        <p>Grand Traverse Bay, on the east side of Leelanau County, froze over on Feb. 3, and did not melt until April 20, the longest frozen stretch in 70 years, according to the Coast Guard.</p>
        <p>In Antrim County, a record 245 inches of snow fell, seven feet more than normal. "It's been a lot of battle fatigue," said Fred Hunt Jr., the manager of  the Antrim County Road Commission, describing the mood of his 35 snowplow drivers. "It was constant pounding. They even got tired of the overtime."</p>
        <p>Just about the only people not complaining are the ski resort owners. The long season and Michigan's surging economy are credited with helping to shatter  every record for customers and revenue. As late as Sunday, as daytime temperatures fell again to the 30's, the slopes remained open at Boyne Mountain  in Charlevoix County, capping the longest ski season in the resort's 48-year history.</p>
        <p>Even old-timers have marveled. "In 1921 or 1922 we had a heck of a snow in April. It blocked the railroad for six weeks," said Edward Kahrs, an 89-year-old retired farmer who has lived in Leelanau County his entire life. "That's about the last time I can recall any winter this long."</p>
        <p>The unforgiving winter is part of an unusual period of erratic weather in the upper Midwest. Last summer, near-record heat turned normally frigid northern Lake Michigan so warm that swimming in it was actually enjoyable, residents say. The colors of fall, usually a palette of brilliance, were muted and short-lived  as temperatures plunged below freezing in October, weeks earlier than usual. The cold air and warm water combined to produce blizzards of "lake effect" snow in November and December.</p>
        <p>Climatologists say the jet stream in the upper atmosphere is the source of the severe weather, especially during this lost spring. Normally, the jet stream begins to move north by March or April, bringing with it warming temperatures. This year, it remained fixed well south of the Great Lakes.</p>
        <p>The talk on the street is that global warming, ozone depletion or the Pacific phenomenon known as El Nino is producing the unusual weather.</p>
        <p>Michigan's climate specialists say that El Nino is not a culprit and that there is no way to confirm whether man-made global environmental influences are  involved.</p>
        <p>"What we know for sure," said Dr. Fred Nurnberger, the state climatologist, "is that until the jet stream moves north, we will have below-normal temperatures."</p>
        <p>It has been so cold that the usual harbingers of spring have been three weeks late. Morel mushrooms, a regional delicacy coveted for their flavor and meaty texture, have not yet popped up among the matted leaves on the forest floor. Only in the last day or so have the buds on the cherry trees begun to swell. Even the bees at Kirk Jones's Sleeping Bear Apiaries in Benzie County, south of  here, were not flying until after May 1. "It was too chilly in April for the flowers to open," Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>So alternative messengers of spring sufficed. The ice fishing shacks were hauled off Crystal Lake in Beulah, although the ice did not melt completely until April 19. Like the return of the swallows to Capistrano, the seasonal restaurant owners came back. Jim Barnes, who spent the winter in Australia, has  been cleaning out Northern Delights Cafe, his hilltop restaurant in Benzonia, in time for opening to the summer trade later this week. Down the hill, Jonathan Clark returned from Texas to reopen his L'Chayim Delicatessen, serving corn beef and pastrami to overflow crowds.</p>
        <p>"I have traditionally opened the first day of May, and this year we had three inches of snow," said Mr. Clark, who was raised in Benzie County and is nursing  a bad spring cold. "That will tell you one reason why I want to go back to Texas.</p>
        <p>"It's been lousy."</p>
