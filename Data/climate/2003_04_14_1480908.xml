        <p>Editorial says uninspired energy bill approved by House would do little to rescue country from its precarious dependence on imported oil; says its most serious defect is its failure to require meaningful improvements in fuel economy, best way to ease that dependence; says it is alarming that White House is pleased with bill, and particularly 'gratified' that it would open Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling; says Senate, which has already rejected drilling in refuge, must do so again, and much more, to bring country rational energy policy</p>

        <p>Given the war in Iraq, the possibility of further turmoil in the Middle East and the volatility of oil markets, this would seem the right moment for a  reassessment of the nation's energy strategy. Unfortunately, the uninspired energy bill approved by the House on Friday would do little to rescue the country from its precarious dependence on imported oil. One hopes for more enlightenment from the Senate.</p>
        <p>There are bound to be a few good things in a bill that runs to 772 pages and carries a price tag of $50 billion over 10 years, and there are. While bowing deeply to the needs of the energy producers, the bill gives at least a nod to energy conservation, allocating one-third of its $18 billion in tax breaks to increasing energy efficiency and alternative energy sources like wind power. There is also, thanks to Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York, serious money for ''coal gasification'' -- the one technology that shows any promise of making coal burn more cleanly and efficiently.</p>

        <p>Given the war in Iraq, the possibility of further turmoil in the Middle East and the volatility of oil markets, this would seem the right moment for a  reassessment of the nation's energy strategy. Unfortunately, the uninspired energy bill approved by the House on Friday would do little to rescue the country from its precarious dependence on imported oil. One hopes for more enlightenment from the Senate.</p>
        <p>There are bound to be a few good things in a bill that runs to 772 pages and carries a price tag of $50 billion over 10 years, and there are. While bowing deeply to the needs of the energy producers, the bill gives at least a nod to energy conservation, allocating one-third of its $18 billion in tax breaks to increasing energy efficiency and alternative energy sources like wind power. There is also, thanks to Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York, serious money for ''coal gasification'' -- the one technology that shows any promise of making coal burn more cleanly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>But like last year's energy bill, which mercifully disappeared when the Senate and House failed to reconcile differences, this year's measure is on the whole a compendium of tired ideas favoring the oil and gas industries and special-interest groups like farmers. These include a $3 billion subsidy to encourage the environmentally destructive extraction of coal-bed methane, as well as subsidies of dubious value for the producers of corn-based ethanol. In addition, the bill would erode environmental protections for public lands, primarily in the West, to encourage oil and gas exploration in wilderness areas that are best left alone.</p>
        <p>Even worse is what the bill does not do. It does little to encourage industry to reduce the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, but its most serious defect is its failure to require meaningful improvements in fuel economy -- the quickest and surest way to ease America's dependence on foreign oil. And while the bill provides money for aggressive research on a hydrogen-powered fuel-cell car, it fails, perversely, to provide the tax breaks President Bush had requested for buyers of fuel-efficient hybrid cars.</p>
        <p>Alarmingly, the White House said it was generally pleased with the bill and was particularly ''gratified'' that it would open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. The Senate, which has already rejected drilling in the refuge, will now have to do so again. Indeed, it will have to do much more than that if it is to bring the country the rational energy policy it deserves.</p>
