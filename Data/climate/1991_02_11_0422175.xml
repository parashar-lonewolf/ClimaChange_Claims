        <p>Efforts to protect health and the environment are clashing more and more frequently with the goal of freer world trade.</p>
        <p>Differing standards for cleaning up air and water, the costs of these efforts and their implications for commerce, have officials fretting about the use of health and environmental regulations as a new form of nontariff trade barrier. Already such regulations pose so many problems that officials are suggesting a new round of trade talks to address these conflicts even before current global talks on reducing trade barriers have ended.</p>
        <p>German beer makers, for example, recently complained to the European Community about a regulation in Denmark barring the sale of beer not made in refillable bottles. Because most beer outside Denmark is not produced in such bottles, the Germans, joined by other community producers, pointed to the regulation as an unfair restraint of trade. Nevertheless, the community's Court of Justice recently ruled that Denmark was within its rights.  Protests by Japan</p>
        <p>In a working group on the rules and disciplines of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization that manages international trade, Japan has sought to fight bans on the export of raw logs by Indonesia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and even the United States. The bans are intended to conserve forest resources, but Japan, which has to import practically all its wood, said they represented unfair trade.</p>
        <p>Mexico has mounted a challenge within the legal framework of GATT against an American ban on imports of tuna caught with nets that also kill dolphins. The Mexicans charge that this, too, is unfair trade, aimed chiefly at protecting the American tuna industry.</p>
        <p>To defray the costs of pollution cleanup, several governments, especially in Europe, provide special grants to industries. But there is growing concern that these subsidies create an unfair cost or competitive advantage. Focus on New Rules</p>
        <p>The complaints of unfair trade practices are so numerous that GATT's director general, Arthur Dunkel, has predicted that the next round of global trade talks, being projected for later in the decade, will focus on the writing of new international rules to minimize trade frictions.</p>
        <p>"Right now, we have no machinery for making any kind of judgments about the linkages between trade and the environment," said David Woods, head of information at GATT's headquarters in Geneva.</p>
        <p>Stewart J. Hudson, legislative representative for international programs at the National Wildlife Federation, acknowledged that anti-pollution and health safeguards "offer a creative way to protect jobs," adding that in any new GATT rule-making exercise it would be "hard to ferret out the protectionst from the conservationist impulse." But in spite of this, he stressed that "the environmental concerns are no less valid."  Fears of Mexican Advantage</p>
        <p>Complaints of unfair trade advantages caused by the wide differences in environmental standards between the United States and Mexico are already being expressed in trade talks between the two countries.</p>
        <p>Formal negotiations aimed at duty-free exchanges are expected to open next summer, but farmers in California, Florida and Texas have already signaled their fears of a surge of Mexican imports. They warn that any tariff cuts would add to the competitive advantages that Mexican growers already have because of less rigorous environmental standards and a much lower wage base.</p>
        <p>Free trade would eliminate United States duties as high as 70 cents on a 25-pound box of Mexican tomatoes -- about 10 percent of the wholesale price -- or as high as 35 percent on imported melons.</p>
        <p>"When our costs for environmental programs go up, as they just have under the Clean Air Act, it can't help but improve the competitive position of Mexico, where standards are already much lower," said Reginald L. Brown, director of marketing and membership of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Associatiion in Orlando.</p>
        <p>American steel, copper and textile manufacturers are expected to express similar complaints.  Calls From Congress</p>
        <p>Thirty-seven members of Congress, led by Representative Donald J. Pease, an Ohio Democrat, have called for any free-trade agreement to include a "social charter" to address concerns about differences in environmental conditions, as well as in health and labor. The average Mexican manufacturing wage is less than 60 cents an hour, compared with $10.50 in the United States.</p>
        <p>But United States and Mexican trade negotiators, seeking to conclude an accord within the next 18 months, insist on a more narrow focus. They say environmental issues, which could complicate the talks, should be addressed separately. Still, the environmental worries are so large that many say it is doubtful the trade negotiators will get their way.</p>
        <p>"Increasingly, the environmental issues are becoming global and regional rather than national in scope, and as that occurs the international trade implications become significantly more important," said Richard A. Johnson, former general counsel for international trade at the Commerce Department and now a partner of Arnold &amp; Porter, a Washington law firm. Demand for Cooperation</p>
        <p>The growing international concern about environmental problems like climate change, ozone depletion, deforestation and water pollution has generated a demand for more effective international cooperation.</p>
        <p>Such cooperation is also affecting trade policy. A 1987 agreement in Montreal to curb global use of chlorofluorocarbons -- chemicals that are believed to be destroying the earth's ozone shield -- envisions trade sanctions against countries that do not abide by the new standards.</p>
        <p>The accord calls for a ban on imports of products made with the substances, which are used in refrigeration and foam insulation and as industrial solvents and aerosol propellants.</p>
        <p>While of limited scope, the sanctions are the first to be agreed upon to promote an environmental goal.</p>
