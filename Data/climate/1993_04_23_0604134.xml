        <p>President Clinton's speech commemorating Earth Day calmed the jangled nerves of those who had begun to question his interest in the environment, not least Al Gore. The Vice President was all smiles on Wednesday when Mr. Clinton pledged specific steps to address the threat of global warming and promised to sign an international treaty protecting rare and endangered species.</p>
        <p>Both pledges reversed the timid policies of his predecessor and signaled that Mr. Clinton is prepared, at least for now, to assume the mantle of stewardship that George Bush declined.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Clinton has finally set himself on the right path, one nice speech does not begin to meet the strenuous tests of leadership that lie ahead. This is especially true on the matter of global warming. Despite years of studies, uncertainties remain. And while all scientists agree that certain gases -- mainly carbon dioxide -- trap heat and cause temperatures to rise, nobody knows whether the increase will make much difference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton must therefore make a persuasive case that the</p>
        <p>risk</p>
        <p>of cataclysmic temperature changes is itself enough to justify preventive steps. He will also be required to spell out what these steps will be and how much they will cost.</p>
        <p>So far he has pledged only to "reduce" carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. That's less ambitious than the target sought by European delegates to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last summer. Their aim was to "stabilize" emissions at 1990 levels, effectively capping them.</p>
        <p>Moreover, many scientists argue that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will keep growing even at 1990 levels. Thus sharp reductions in those gases, not just stabilization, will be needed.</p>
        <p>That could mean a more aggressive conservation program involving heavy capital investments in cleaner technologies and even higher energy taxes. And that, in turn, would sorely test the political skills of a President who's already tasked himself with selling the country on new income taxes and a revolution in health care.</p>
        <p>Still, after three months of crablike scuttling on environmental issues -- months in which Mr. Gore must have wondered why he signed up for the job -- Mr. Clinton has begun to honor two important campaign pledges and fended off the doubters in his Cabinet who argued that conservation would threaten economic recovery. What counts now is whether Mr. Clinton can devise and sell a strategy worthy of his rhetoric.</p>
