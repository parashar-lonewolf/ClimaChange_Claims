        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The clean air bill being considered by Congress will pack a far greater economic wallop than anyone expected. Residents of New York State alone could pay as much as $5 billion a year for additional air-pollution controls, according to a study by Denny Technical Services. Nationwide costs of clean air proposals range between $51 billion and $91 billion a year, depending on decisions Congress will make this fall.</p>
        <p>The Senate and House of Representatives are trying to reconcile their clean air bills in conference. If the most extreme proposals are enacted, citizens of New York would be required to pay $57 million more for controlling air toxics emissions, $160 million more for controlling acid rain and $4.8 billion more for controlling ozone - every year.</p>
        <p>Our nation cannot ignore the enormous costs of clean air legislation, and these expenses will inevitably worsen America's economic problems. There are effective and affordable ways to clean our air. High-cost options will not necessarily mean improved environmental protection.</p>
        <p>The business community, which my Clean Air Working Group represents, wants Congress to pass a clean air bill this year, and we believe Americans deserve a significant return on investment in improved environment. We need a law that allows us to meet our environmental goals without unduly burdening a sagging economy.</p>
