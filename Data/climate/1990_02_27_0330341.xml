        <p>LEAD: BENEATH the Huautla plateau in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, the limestone is like Swiss cheese.

        <p>BENEATH the Huautla plateau in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, the limestone is like Swiss cheese. Water percolating down through the rock has carved out a complex network of tunnels, caverns and subterranean rivers, creating what is probably the world's deepest cave system, and presenting a challenge to adventurous speleologists.</p>
        <p>Last week an international team of cave explorers announced plans for an expedition to descend almost one mile into the vertical cave, then follow the 46 miles of tunnels already charted and finally plunge into an underground river of unknown length, depth and peril. The river presumably connects the Huautla caves with springs flowing out of the nearby caves of La Pena Colorada.</p>
        <p>Dr. William C. Stone, an inventor and experienced diver in cave waters, said the expedition he planned to lead next February would be the culmination of more than 12 years of reconnaissance and would employ new diving technologies in tracing the course of the underground river that had stymied all previous explorers. The unexplored part of the stream is believed to be more than 100 feet deep and at least four miles long. Unseen Lakes and Tunnels Dr. Nicholas Sullivan, president of the Explorers Club in New York, a sponsor of the expedition, said the project would be to cave exploration what the first ascents of Mount Everest were to mountaineering.</p>
        <p>''No human beings have ever seen any of the passages, any of the lakes, any of the tunnels that will be explored,'' Dr. Sullivan said. He described the expedition as the ''wedding of technology and exploration in ways that would have been unthinkable only 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Getting down the lowest depths of the cave will require mountaineering-style ropework to negotiate the 43 stepped drops. From top to bottom, Dr. Stone said, will be three and a half times the height of the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>The explorers will set up a base camp on the ledges near the entrance to the chamber where the waters begin their uncharted course and will suspend cables from the sheer walls to support a diving platform over the water. A small hydroelectric plant set up at one of the waterfalls will generate the team's electricity.</p>
        <p>The main advance in technology, Dr. Stone said, is a lightweight underwater breathing apparatus that was developed for the expedition. The system was designed by Cis-Lunar Development Laboratories in Derwood, Md., after consultations with engineers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Dr. Stone, a structural engineer, is president of the laboratories.</p>
        <p>The backpack is a self-contained ''re-breather'' system. It can support a diver for up to 18 hours underwater, about twice the usual duration, because the gases are recirculated. Exhaled air is processed to remove the carbon dioxide so it can be breathed again. Nothing is lost except the oxygen that is metabolized. The gas required for recharging the system weighs only eight pounds.</p>
