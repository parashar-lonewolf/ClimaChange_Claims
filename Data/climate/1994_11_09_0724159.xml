        <p>New Federal clean-air rules will force drastic changes in the recipe used for gasoline in most urban areas in the next few weeks, and refiners and distributors are struggling to get supplies of the reformulated gasoline into place.

        <p>New Federal clean-air rules will force drastic changes in the recipe used for gasoline in most urban areas in the next few weeks, and refiners and distributors are struggling to get supplies of the reformulated gasoline into place. Some analysts are predicting spot shortages and sudden price surges.</p>
        <p>"We're going to have the biggest change in gasoline chemistry ever, even bigger than what we saw when we went to unleaded gas in 1973 and 1974," said William Berman, chief environmental affairs lobbyist of the American Automobile Association.</p>
        <p>The new rules will instantly cover about 30 percent of the national gasoline market, nearly 30 million gallons a day, enough to fuel 43 million passenger cars. By contrast, the last big change, to unleaded fuel, was gradual, with only enough produced at first to supply 1974 model cars.</p>
        <p>The areas where the new gasoline will be required are most of the Boston-New York-Washington megalopolis, extending south to Richmond, north to most of coastal Maine and west to much of western Pennsylvania; the Chicago region, including northeastern Indiana and eastern Wisconsin; sections of Kentucky in the Louisville area and near Cincinnati; the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas, and the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.</p>
        <p>Some of those areas already require fuel with special characteristics but the new rules are much stricter.</p>
        <p>Distributors must have the new fuel on hand by Dec. 1, and refiners in areas where reformulated gasoline is required must have switched over completely by Jan. 1. In many areas, retailers are already pumping the new fuel, although most preferred to wait as long as possible because the it is more expensive.</p>
        <p>The new fuel, designed to cut smog by 20 percent, will burn more thoroughly, evaporate more slowly, and even smell different. It will have sharply reduced levels of compounds like toluene and benzene, which refiners have used for years to enhance octane but which scientists have determined are toxic.</p>
        <p>And the reformulated fuel will cost more, because it will require more refining and must include oxygen-containing molecules. That oxygen requirement is contributing to a temporary shortage of gasoline ingredients that contain oxygen. The "oxygenated" gasoline now costs about 9 cents a gallon more than ordinary fuel at wholesale.</p>
        <p>Experts say that the cost of the oxygen-containing additives may decline, becoming no more per gallon than the cost of the gasoline it is blended with. But in the long term, drivers will probably pay 4 to 6 cents a gallon more for reformulated gasoline, because of the additional refining work needed.</p>
        <p>Other than price, drivers probably will not notice much change. "The customer is not going to see a change in vehicle performance, in the sense of acceleration, riding down the road, knock, or anything else," said Reginald R. Modlin, the manager of vehicle emissions regulatory planning at Chrysler. "What we're talking about is emissions performance."</p>
        <p>Some automotive experts say, though, that the new gasoline is likely to be blamed for anything that goes wrong with a car after Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>The new gasoline, like the old, is a potpourri of hydrocarbon molecules derived from crude oil. But in unreformulated gasoline the largest of those molecules tend to go through engines without burning, so the new rules will allow fewer of the big molecules. In addition, the smallest molecules tend to evaporate easily, which also adds to air pollution, so the new gas will have fewer of those.</p>
        <p>As a result, refiners will have to fuse the smallest molecules, and break up the biggest, or take those materials out of the gasoline altogether. None of the technology is complicated, but it involves more refining equipment and more work.</p>
        <p>The law also has "anti-dumping" provisions, so that chemicals taken out of reformulated gasoline cannot be thrown into the mix in rural areas and other places that do not now have an air pollution problem.</p>
        <p>This has created logistical problems for refiners and distributors. "You're basically introducing yet another kind of gasoline," said Bryan Davis, a spokesman for Sun Oil Company. But the number of pipelines and storage tanks is not changing. "It's like putting something new on the shelf without building any more shelves," he said.</p>
        <p>Some experts are predicting sudden swings in the gasoline prices of 25 cents a gallon or more. "We're heading into a situation where it's going to be very, very tight in January," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist who specializes in energy markets, at Charles River Associates, a consulting company based in Boston.</p>
        <p>Others think the new rules will raise prices because they will reduce competition in the marketplace. Edwin S. Rothschild, of Citizen Action, a nonprofit group in Washington, said that major oil companies would have an easier time complying with the new rules than small companies, which formerly imported much of their gasoline and now would find it harder to obtain supplies that meet the complicated new specifications.</p>
        <p>And, he said, companies would no longer be able to swap supplies so easily, because "unleaded regular" is no longer one product, but two, reformulated and unreformulated.</p>
        <p>And some places where reformulated gasoline is not required will end up using it anyway, because the terminals or tanker trucks may change over to the new fuel for all of their distribution area, even if only part of it must have the new fuel.</p>
        <p>Even the rules governing who must have the reformulated gas are a patchwork. For nine urban areas the changes are mandated by the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990; 40 other areas decided to require the new gasoline, in preference to other measures to clean up the air, like stricter controls on factories or tougher car inspections or new rules on new cars. Refiners expect more areas to voluntarily adopt the new fuel, which may eventually cover more than half the national market.</p>
        <p>The rules taking effect on Jan. 1 are only the first stage; the Clean Air Act calls for stricter rules on Jan. 1, 1998, and a third phase, stricter yet, on Jan. 1, 2000.</p>
        <p>This January, motorists who keep careful track may notice a decline in mileage of about 1.5 percent, because the new fuel has more molecules that contain an oxygen atom. The idea is to provide more oxygen in the cylinder, so when the fuel is burned, the exhaust contains less carbon monoxide, which is poisonous, and more carbon dioxide, which is not. But the oxygen-containing molecules have less energy.</p>
        <p>A national program to require oxygenated gasoline in wintertime, when carbon monoxide is a problem, began in late 1992; it is now entering its third winter. But the new reformulated gasoline also calls for oxygenated fuel, and that will be year-round.</p>
        <p>The oxygenate most popular with refiners is methyl tertiary butyl ether, known as MTBE, but it is now in short supply, because of the increased demand, combined with recent breakdowns at refineries that make the ingredients of MTBE. MTBE usually sells for about the same price per gallon as unleaded gasoline, 65 cents, but it is now selling for double that.</p>
        <p>As a result, gasoline with oxygenates is now selling at wholesale for about 9 cents a gallon more than regular gasoline; last winter the difference was only 3.5 cents.</p>
        <p>A 9-cent increase at retail would be large if it came suddenly. But prices show a considerable variation over the period of a few months. According to the American Automobile Association, the national average price for a gallon of self-serve regular unleaded was $1.065 in March vs. $1.188 in August. The most recent figure, for mid-October, was $1.157 a gallon.</p>
