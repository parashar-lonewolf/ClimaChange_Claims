        <p>Because of their incomparable beauty, coral reefs have long been popular tourist destinations. But a report at the end of last year by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network found that 20 percent of the world's coral reefs have been effectively destroyed and show no immediate signs of recovery. The report also said that more than 500 million people relied on coral reefs for food, coastal protection and tourism income.</p>
        <p>Among the threats to the reefs are rising sea temperatures caused by global changes. This results in a ''bleaching'' of the coral and can cause irreparable damage, but direct human pressures are equally disturbing. Overfishing and destructive fishing -- using explosives and cyanide -- are two major threats. Sedimentation from pollution and coastal development are further dangers to reefs.</p>

        <p>Because of their incomparable beauty, coral reefs have long been popular tourist destinations.

        <p>Among the threats to the reefs are rising sea temperatures caused by global changes. This results in a ''bleaching'' of the coral and can cause irreparable damage, but direct human pressures are equally disturbing. Overfishing and destructive fishing -- using explosives and cyanide -- are two major threats. Sedimentation from pollution and coastal development are further dangers to reefs.</p>
        <p>''While it's true that rising water temperatures are a big threat, you can give the coral reefs the best bet at survival by trying to remove all of these human pressures,'' said Helen Fox, a marine conservation scientist for the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
        <p>Last summer, the Australian government temporarily or permanently closed to all fishing 33 percent of the Great Barrier Reef (42,000 square miles, about the size of Pennsylvania) to protect fish stocks and natural habitats.</p>
        <p>But the report said that the many Caribbean reefs have seen up to an 80 percent decline in coral reef cover, and that the marine life and vegetation that scuba divers and snorklers see today pales in comparison to what they saw in the past.</p>
