        <p>The urban summer smog that chokes asthmatics and confines the elderly to air-conditioned rooms will be gone by early in the next century -- or so Congress decreed in 1990.</p>
        <p>But with the 12 states of the Northeast facing a cleanup bill that could run to tens of billions of dollars and with the deadline for explaining who will pay just months away, the diverse interests that influence air-pollution policies have not advanced much further than pointing fingers.</p>
        <p>"It's almost like the Palestinian-Israeli talks," said David Hawkins, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental group. "Nobody wants to be the first to compromise."</p>
        <p>Failure to break this deadlock over enforcement of the Clean Air Act, business executives say, could be as threatening to the region's economic health as smog is to the public's health. "If air quality is not improved in a cost-effective way," said Bill Tell, an executive in charge of regulatory affairs at Texaco, "you are going to see an exodus of jobs" from the region. Hearings on Tap This Week</p>
        <p>That is why both big business and environmental hard-liners (as well as the state officials caught in between) are pinning their hopes on a little constructive head-bashing by Washington. And with Environmental Protection Agency holding hearings in Hartford this week, there is good reason to hope that the agency will broker a deal.</p>
        <p>Almost certainly, that deal will include a free market for trading emission rights among polluters and a system for easing compliance costs of coal-fired power plants.</p>
        <p>The active ingredient in smog is ozone. And ozone is created near the ground by a host of reactions involving ultraviolet light, heat, nitrogen compounds and volatile organic compounds that include anything from raw gasoline to tree sap.</p>
        <p>Until recently, efforts to contain ozone focused on cutting organic compounds from tailpipes, smokestacks and ventilators. But scientists now say that nitrogen compounds are a critical player in transforming life-sustaining oxygen into lung-searing ozone. Indeed, John Bachman of the Environmental Protection Agency says that in much of the Northeast cutting nitrogen compounds would be far more effective in reducing smog than further cuts in volatile organic compounds.</p>
        <p>Spicing the recipe for conflict, there is now good evidence that both ozone and its chemical precursors travel long distances. Hence, compounds blown in from western Pennsylvania can combine with locally made ingredients to transform New York or Boston into smog central. New Enthusiasms</p>
        <p>This explains the new enthusiasm for controlling nitrogen compounds from coal-burning power plants. It also explains why Congress created the Ozone Transport Commission, made up of representatives of 12 Northeastern states plus the District of Columbia who have the mandate to figure out strategies for controlling regionwide smog sources.</p>
        <p>Some important anti-smog measures are already dictated by Federal law, and are thus uncomplicated by the push and shove of regional interests. For example, the region will benefit from tougher emissions standards to be applied to new cars nationwide.</p>
        <p>But Eric Svenson of New Jersey's giant utility, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, argues that such measures "alone won't even come close" to helping the states meet ozone standards during the dog days of summer. That leaves it to the states to explain how they are going to reduce volatile organic compounds emissions 15 percent by 1996, plus cut both organic and nitrogen compounds by 3 percent annually.</p>
        <p>The members of the Ozone Transport Commission made headlines in February by asking the Environmental Protection Agency to impose on the Northeast the same exceptionally stringent standards on new autos that will be required in smog-burdened California. But Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Virginia demurred, because of worries about the cost. And the American automobile industry is fighting back, offering to produce a vehicle that would be cleaner sooner, but would not meet the California standard.</p>
        <p>Hardly anyone is claiming that the California vehicle standards alone would get the Northeast where it must go. Then what? Targeting nitrogen compounds, with heavy emphasis on power plants, which produce about half of the region's emissions. But the states are bitterly divided on how to proceed, and no wonder. Smog in the Corridor</p>
        <p>The worst smog in the region is along the "Amtrak corridor" from Washington to Boston. But the bulk of the nitrogen compounds, notes John Elston, New Jersey's official in charge of air quality, comes from plants far to the west. And such areas have little motivation to pitch in because little of the benefit would go to their own ratepayers.</p>
        <p>Adding sand to the wheels of negotiation, there is still much debate over allowing smog producers to pay rather than to play. A free market trading system already gives power plants broad discretion in controlling emissions that generate acid rain. A dirty plant can buy pollution rights from a clean plant, for example.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, has suggested that it would be cheaper to achieve the goals of the California car standards by creating a similar trading system for nitrogen and organic compounds, letting auto makers buy equivalent abatement from stationary sources like power plants or a dry-cleaning store or to buy and junk especially dirty vehicles. Indeed, some experts argue that opposition to the Ozone Transport Commission's proposal for car standards would evaporate if it were amended to include a trading system.</p>
        <p>William Rosenberg, a former assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, says that trading nitrogen compound rights among stationary sources is also critical to containing costs and softening opposition from coal-fired utilities. To comply, he reckons, most utilities would have to do little more than shift to natural gas in the summer -- or pay other plants to make the shift.</p>
        <p>But the devil is in the details. Acid rain cumulatively damages lakes and soil over vast areas. A straightforward trading system for smog precursors, it is widely acknowledged, would be more problematic because ozone damage varies widely according to season, air temperature and wind patterns.</p>
        <p>Daniel Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund acknowledges that trading does not fit into an ozone solution as neatly as it did to acid rain, and many environmental groups question whether such trading will ever lead to cleaner air. But Mr. Dudek says the benefits of cutting compliance costs would far outweigh the risks of creating financial incentives to reduce emissions at the wrong place or time. Denying the legitimacy of market-based trading at this stage, he says, would only show that "we haven't learned anything since 1989," when trading rights were proposed for acid rain.</p>
        <p>This brew of conflict and scientific uncertainty seems a recipe for political gridlock. But a solution is in the works.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the penalties for states that fail to present serious plans by the deadline in November represent an incentive to compromise. While state officials might welcome a Federal takeover of the cleanup, they would not relish the consequences. Once the deadline is missed, a sanction clock starts ticking that would lead to a cutoff of highway funds and a moratorium on business growth within two years.</p>
        <p>Some participants in the debate have sketched the outlines of a deal. One element would be the California tailpipe standard, softened by allowing auto makers to buy emissions rights from other sources. Mr. Dudek calculates that trading under these conditions would save the auto industry $5 billion from 1996 to 2004.</p>
        <p>Another element would limit power plants' emissions of nitrogen compounds but let the plants trade emissions upwind. Thus a New Jersey utility could buy emissions rights from a plant in Pennsylvania, but not vice versa. The deal would be sweetened for Pennsylvania by setting exceptionally tough emissions standards for power producers along the Amtrak corridor, in effect requiring the east to subsidize nitrogen compound reduction in the west.</p>
