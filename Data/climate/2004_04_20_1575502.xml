        <p>Marian Koshland Science Museum, which recently opened in Penn Quarter area of Washington, DC, is designed to inform public about scientific issues and to potentially influence policy decisions; first two installations are on global warming and effects of gene sequencing; Dr Daniel E Koshland, University of California, Berkeley, biochemist and former editor of Science magazine, worked with National Academy of Sciences to develop idea of museum, which was built to honor his wife Marian, academy member and immunologist who has recently died; museum director Patrice Legro says museum is expected to have about 100,000 visitors per year; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Science museums are often frenzied and noisy, full of young people pushing buttons and shrieking with delight. The Marian Koshland Science Museum, which opens here on Friday, aims to upend that stereotype. Its goal is not to shock, amaze or even entertain, but to inform the people who influence or will someday influence science policy.</p>
        <p>Rotating exhibitions at the museum, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, will focus on topical issues with the potential to hit close to home. The first two will cover global warming and the way gene sequencing has helped create disease-resistant crops, identify criminal suspects and otherwise change lives.</p>
        <p>The museum was partly the brainchild of Dr. Daniel E. Koshland, a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former editor of Science magazine. Dr. Koshland approached the academy president, Dr. Bruce Alberts, in 1998 with a desire to honor his wife, Marian, an immunologist and academy member who had died the year before.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alberts suggested several potential projects, and he and Dr. Koshland settled on the most expensive one, the museum.</p>
        <p>Dr. Koshland's inheritance -- he is the son of an original executive at Levi Strauss -- helped him put up the initial $25 million endowment. He and Dr. Alberts agreed that exhibitions should be easy to understand and based on consensus science from academy reports. The 6,000-square-foot center is around the corner from the academy headquarters at Sixth and E Streets NW in the booming Penn Quarter area, which is becoming known for night life.</p>
        <p>It was not easy for the 23 members of the museum advisory committee to whittle down the content to fit the space for each topic. Scientists wanted to ''tape up textbooks,'' Dr. Alberts said.</p>
        <p>''They had no real sense of how to engage the public,'' he added.</p>
        <p>They found an exhibition designer, Tom Bowman of the Bowman Design Group of Signal Hill, Calif., who took their complicated ideas and translated them into easily understood displays. Creating a concise exhibition on global warming was especially difficult. The academy has produced 75 reports on climate change in the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>''We had some pretty expansive ideas,'' said Dr. Eugene Rasmusson, chairman of the advisory panel on the climate exhibition and a research professor emeritus of meteorology at the University of Maryland. Planners realized that the content would have to appeal to the core visitors: middle and high school students and their parents. After illustrating basic climatology and mapping temperature and carbon dioxide levels from 300,000 years ago to the present, the exhibition explains that human activity, mostly through burning fossil fuels, is the biggest cause of warming.</p>
        <p>A display takes a quotation from an academy report that says the time to act is now. That message is further illustrated by a display that plots warming over the last century and its predicted 100-year course.</p>
        <p>At a computer kiosk, visitors are asked to consider how they can decrease warming. Researchers are recording the responses. The panel wanted to convey that ''in the end, you're going to have to make these decisions,'' Dr. Rasmusson said.</p>
        <p>An exhibit on ''Putting DNA to Work'' focuses on gene sequencing and its role in identifying infectious diseases like SARS and inherited ones like sickle cell anemia. Visitors are introduced to sequencing through an oversized unraveling strand of DNA being fed into a huge mock computer.</p>
        <p>They can put together highly simplified gene hunts by punching in letters that represent nucleotides -- A, C, T and G -- and trolling for matches or sequences that might indicate a disease or an inherited trait.</p>
        <p>The museum hopes that a display on DNA fingerprinting technology will be a major attraction, given the popularity of television dramas on forensics.</p>
        <p>The director, Patrice Legro, said the museum expected about 100,000 visitors a year, compared with about six million for the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian and 50,000 to 60,000 for the National Museum of Health and Medicine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Koshland and Dr. Alberts said they believed they were taking something of a risk with their museum, which seeks above all else to educate visitors. They said they hoped it would appeal to a small but important segment of the public.</p>
