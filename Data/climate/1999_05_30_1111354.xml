        <p>This season the battle against mosquitoes and other biting insects has become more sophisticated -- and stylish. Bugs B Wear of Minneapolis has a line of repellent-filled sterling silver jewelry. A frisky lemony-scented oil of lavender, citronella, lemongrass and spearmint is applied with a dropper in earrings, necklaces and, for the guys, stickpins, $27 each. Information: (877) 877-7879. ''You can take the jewelry off in the clubhouse for lunch, so you don't smell like insect repellent,'' Jill Johnson, the company's owner, said. Mosquito 'Cognito is a battery-powered citronella dispenser available from the Gardener's Supply Company catalogue for $29.95; (800) 863-1700. More militaristic additions to the arsenal include the Mosquito Killing Unit, $399.95; (877) 545-5667. It draws biting insects with heat, as does the Dragonfly, which uses carbon dioxide and a substance called octenol to lure biters. ''CO2  works like landing lights for biting insects,'' said Jim Nolen, president of Biosensory, which will sell the Dragonfly starting on Tuesday for $279, from www.biosensory.com or (860) 423-3009. Mosquito Magnet, $1,295, is a propane-fueled device that sucks bugs from the air. The American Biophysics Corporation, the machine's maker, says that in tests in the Florida Everglades, it caught 100,000 bugs a night. Available from (401) 884-3500 or www.mosquitomagnet.com.</p>
