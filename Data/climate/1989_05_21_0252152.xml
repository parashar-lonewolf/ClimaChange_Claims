        <p>LEAD: Corruption, poverty, crack, racial tension, AIDS and a poisonous environment: the plagues of the late 80's and the nightmarish anxieties they arouse are darkening popular music.</p>
        <p>Corruption, poverty, crack, racial tension, AIDS and a poisonous environment: the plagues of the late 80's and the nightmarish anxieties they arouse are darkening popular music.</p>
        <p>Though by no means the dominant theme, a mood of embattled discontent has touched every musical genre, from pop to hard rock to heavy metal to rap. After having been shunted to the sidelines for more than a decade, guitar-based folk pop - the idiom that has carried protest songs since the days of Woody Guthrie - is making a comeback. The range of voices - despairing, angry, sorrowful and ironic, from London to Los Angeles - mirrors an increasing fragmentation and deepening sense of helplessness.</p>
        <p>The latest cycle of what used to be called protest music is strikingly different in mood from that of 25 years ago. There are no implied happy endings blowing in the wind.</p>
        <p>The old liberal certainties have given way to an anguished pessimism. The music's outlook is at best grimly realistic, at worst apocalyptic. While the old protest songs were rallying cries aimed at mobilizing a community, most 80's protest songs are cranky, personal tirades, reflecting alienation rather than unity. Rather than purveyors of hope, today's songwriters tend to be prophets of rage who can only rail about conditions for which there seem to be no solutions. And if some of today's songs are preachy and overblown, others are brilliant examples of terse musical storytelling.</p>
        <p>On John Cougar Mellencamp's ornery new album, ''Big Daddy,'' the Indiana-based rock singer and chronicler of small-town life looks beyond the heartland to the world at large. What he sees is a Darwinian jungle in which people are either oppressive, power-mad egotists - big daddies - or victims. The song ''J. M.'s Question'' runs down a list of the world's ills from contaminated food and water, to ozone depletion, to nuclear weapons, to the destruction of rain forests, in a tone of scathing sarcasm.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Mellencamp's voice sounds strikingly reminiscent of Bob Dylan at his most caustic, his message is even darker than that of Mr. Dylan's stern 60's tirades. Mr. Dylan's songs held up an Old Testament vision of righteousness and retribution. In Mr. Mellencamp's songs there is no higher authority, only people behaving like beasts. ''What kind of world do we live in/ When you do it to your buddy before he does it to you?'' chimes the chorus of ''J. M.'s Question.''</p>
        <p>Two leaders in the resurgence have been Tracy Chapman, the black Boston-based singer-songwriter, and Living Colour, the black, New York-based hard-rock band founded by the guitarist Vernon Reid. Last year, ''Fast Car,'' Ms. Chapman's devastating first-person song about a young couple trapped in a cycle of poverty, single-parenthood and homelessness, became one of the year's most unlikely hits.</p>
        <p>This spring, Living Colour's ''Cult of Personality,'' a snarling hard-rock anthem whose lyric warns against blindly following charismatic leaders, narrowly missed hitting the top 10. Most of the other songs on the albums by Ms. Chapman and by Living Colour also deal with political issues, in particular racial friction. In concert, Living Colour performs Ms. Chapman's song ''Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution,'' which predicts, ''Poor people gonna rise up/ And take their share.''</p>
        <p>Among white American rock bands, 10,000 Maniacs, from Jamestown, N.Y., is at the forefront of a revival of fervent folk-rock. Natalie Merchant, the group's lead singer and chief songwriter, writes quirky lyrics that have the resonance of contemporary parables. On the group's superb third album, ''Blind Man's Zoo,'' some of the topics include pollution, poverty, unwanted pregnancy and racism. ''I wonder just how long they knew our well was poisoned but they let us just drink on,'' muses the narrator of ''Poison in the Well.''</p>
        <p>Today's political songs addressing specific issues tend to be more sharply focused than those of 25 years ago. In his song, ''The Word Justice,'' on his forthcoming album ''World in Motion,'' the Los Angeles singer-songwriter Jackson Browne draws connections between America's foreign policy and the epidemics of crack and gang warfare on city streets:</p>
        <p>In the streets of America, the chldren are buried</p>
        <p>Caught up in an avalanche of weapons and drugs</p>
        <p>They live and they die in the bowels of a business</p>
        <p>That's disguised as a war between the Crips and the Bloods</p>
        <p>And there is a need to keep some things a secret</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. deals protecting the source.</p>
        <p>Lou Reed's acclaimed album, ''New York'' is a collection of infuriated broadsides about a multitude of current events, issues and personalities from the Howard Beach incident to Jesse Jackson to the tolls of the AIDS and crack epidemics. Mr. Reed's recurrent image of the ''Statue of Bigotry'' distills his angry vision of an unjust society.  Misanthropy On the Rise</p>
        <p>The songs on Mr. Mellencamp's and Mr. Reed's albums represent a strain of angry misanthropy that is relatively new to pop. Other recent albums - Elvis Costello's ''Spike'' and Randy Newman's ''Land of Dreams'' - also take a dim view of human nature. ''Spike'' includes one of the angriest diatribes ever addressed to a politician in ''Tramp the Dirt Down.'' Calling Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the ''madam'' of a country he scorns as ''the whore of the world,'' the singer vows he will live long enough to see her buried. ''I'll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down,'' he swears. In Randy Newman's song, ''It's Money That Matters,'' the high-rolling narrator sneers at intellectuals who ''never adjusted to the great big world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Costello is one of many English artists who came of age in the late 70's when the punk-rock movement revitalized the country's anti-establishment rock tradition, and he has grown to be a corrosively cynical social commentator.</p>
        <p>British pop, like British theater and film, is a wellspring of anti-Thatcher sentiment. Joe Jackson, who emerged out of the same environment, voices a skepticism similar to Mr. Costello's, though it is not as overtly contemptuous. In the song ''Evil Empire'' on his new album ''Blaze of Glory,'' America is portrayed as a country that's tired, scared, violent and isolated from reality. Even such mainstream English pop acts as George Michael and Simply Red have recorded songs attacking the Thatcher Government's dismantling of the British welfare state.</p>
        <p>Angrier than Mr. Reed's and Mr. Costello's rants are the revolutionary exhortations of the New York-based black rap group Public Enemy, whose album, ''It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,'' contemplates a violent response to the white establishment. Where Ms. Chapman's and Living Colour's songs evoke a racial climate in which blacks and whites can still march together to overcome injustice and poverty, Public Enemy's ethos excludes whites.</p>
        <p>High on its agenda is an injunction to ''Bring the noise.'' That noise is not just the sound of boom boxes blaring out rap on American city streets but angry, organized black separatism. The group's newest single, ''Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos,'' tells of a black prisoner who organizes a jailbreak that frees fellow convicts. A parable of oppression and liberation, the song implies that blacks locked in American jails are political prisoners.</p>
        <p>Technology As Tyrant Increasingly, modern pop songs view technology as a Frankensteinian monster. The images of devastation and brutality that run through many heavy metal lyrics could also describe music that is a direct reflection of technological might. One of the music's thrills is the challenge it poses to the body's capacity to withstand noise that suggests repetitive shelling. Metallica is the most popular of an austere new breed of metal band whose grimly oracular songs explicitly invoke the technology of war and its capacity for destruction.</p>
        <p>Television is likely to be portrayed as manipulative and dangerously pacifying. The slippery leader against whom Living Colour's ''Cult of Personality'' warns is described in the lyric as ''the smiling face on your TV.'' And in the band's ''Which Way to America?'' Mr. Reid compares television images of white America with his own firsthand impressions of urban black America:  I look at the TV</p>
        <p>Your America's doing well</p>
        <p>I look out the window</p>
        <p>My America's catching hell.</p>
        <p>In Public Enemy's ''She Watch Channel Zero?!'' television is denounced as a brainwashing, pacifying obstacle to social change: ''Her brains retrained/ By a 24-inch remote.''  Apocalypse Now?</p>
        <p>The sense of global peril in 60's antinuclear songs like Mr. Dylan's ''Hard Rain Is A-Gonna Fall'' has escalated sharply as the nuclear threat has been joined by the greenhouse effect, the imperiled ozone layer, toxic waste and other environmental issues. For some songwriters, the coming decade may be humanity's last chance to save itself. ''This is no time for celebration,'' warns Lou Reed. ''This is no time for inner searchings/ The future is at hand.''</p>
        <p>In ''How Long,'' Mr. Browne cries, ''How long will it be till we've turned/ to the tasks and the skills/ That we'll have to have learned/ If we are going to find our place in the future/ And have anything to offer/ where this planet is concerned?''</p>
        <p>Many of the same sentiments Mr. Browne expresses are reiterated sternly in the songs of Bruce Cockburn, the Toronto-based folk-rocker whose dour reflections on the fate of the earth are tempered with a streak of Christian mysticism.</p>
        <p>And in ''Everybody Knows,'' Leonard Cohen, the 54-year-old Canadian poet and songwriter wrote what may be the most sweeping recent song of apocalyptic angst. ''Everybody knows that the dice are loaded/ Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed/ Everybody knows the war is over/ Everybody knows the good guys lost,'' begins a lyric which ends with an image of the world having a heart attack.  The Times They Are A-Changin'</p>
        <p>Unlike great love songs, which are ageless, socially conscious songs are often so closely tied to current events and to evanescent moods that over time they often lose their resonance. If Woody Guthrie's best songs transcend historical events, much of yesterday's protest music today tends to sound naive and smugly simplistic. One reason may be that 60's protest music was bound up with a rebellious youth culture that exploited the genre to thumb its nose at its elders.</p>
        <p>The political climate of the 60's was also more hospitable to the music of dissent.</p>
        <p>During the Kennedy and Johnson eras, when the Federal Government pressed its commitment to civil rights, the Government, liberals and the youth culture briefly seemed to share a social agenda. But that coalition shattered as the antiwar movement replaced civil rights as the most burning issue of the day. While it lasted, however, that coalition helped make songs like ''We Shall Overcome,'' ''The Times They Are A-Changin','' and ''Blowin' in the Wind'' so popular that they seemed almost to be statements of national purpose.</p>
        <p>Beginning in 1965, loud individual voices, led by Bob Dylan, began taking over the pop protest platform. Carrying the rage of protest music into the personal realm, Mr. Dylan invented a new kind of socially conscious song - the putdown, which Elvis Costello, Lou Reed and countless others have appropriated.</p>
        <p>The majority of today's edgy idiosyncratic voices - from Mr. Reed, who at 46 is only two years younger than Mr. Dylan, to Mr. Browne, 40, to Mr. Mellencamp, 37, to Mr. Costello, 33, to Ms. Chapman, 25 - are all Mr. Dylan's progeny.</p>
        <p>Much of the provocation of late 60's rock arose from the unprecedented rawness of the singing, music and lyrics. If a single record could be said to distill the political mood and feeling of the era, it might be Jimi Hendrix's bitter, splattering evisceration of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''</p>
        <p>Angry protest from inner-city blacks could be heard in rap music as early as 1982 with Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five's influential hit, ''The Message.'' Since then, one segment of rap has grown more serious and confrontational. In its very structure, rap embodies challenge. Its elimination of one basic element of music - melody - is a radical act that implies, among other things, that what is being said is too urgent to be sweetened.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the rhythmic scratching of records that is one of rap's hallmarks is a ritualized mutilation of technology. And the spare, clattering beat propelling so many rap records bears an unmistakable resemblance to the sounds of gunfire. When these innovations are fueled by a political vision and imaginative sound effects, the music can be incendiary. Many see in the rap of Public Enemy, Stetsasonic, KRS-1 and others signs of an emergent black nationalist movement.</p>
        <p>In the white-dominated rock mainstream, among the early signs of a resurgence of the political were Bruce Springsteen's 1980 album, ''The River,'' and ''Infidels,'' Bob Dylan's 1983 album. Subsequently blockbuster albums by Mr. Springsteen, U2, Sting and Peter Gabriel helped develop a new image of the rock superstar as a concerned world citizen with racial injustice and human rights heading the list of causes on a broad humanist agenda. In that climate, songs that are more specific in their charges and more urgent in their tone have found acceptance.  Music for A Small Planet</p>
        <p>The darkening mood of late 80's pop is in part a reaction to the giddy atmosphere surrounding the mid-80's all-star charity events like Live Aid, Farm Aid and USA for Africa's ''We Are the World,'' when for a moment pop musicians turned their energies toward worthy causes. Those fantasies of saving the world were quickly dashed by political realities and the scope of the problems. Just as disillusion was setting in, the urban crises of the late 80's began to be recognized as national emergencies.</p>
        <p>Songwriters, like everybody else, react to what they see around them. And, they're in a position to raise their voices and sound the alarm, especially among young audiences. If the gap between America's haves and have-nots widens, and the crises worsen, we can expect more musicians to be spurred by events into spreading the grim news.</p>
        <p>As Lou Reed sings, in ''Busload of Faith,'' a song that was used as an ironic epilogue in the movie ''True Believer,'' which contrasted 60's idealism with 80's disillusionment:</p>
        <p>You can't depend on no miracle</p>
        <p>You can't depend on the air</p>
        <p>You can't depend on a wise man</p>
        <p>You can't find them because they're not there</p>
        <p>You can depend on cruelty, crudity of thought and sound</p>
        <p>You can depend on the worst always happening</p>
        <p>You need a busload of faith to get by.</p>
