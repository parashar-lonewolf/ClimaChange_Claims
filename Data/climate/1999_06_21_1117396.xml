        <p>An important element of the Pataki administration's plan to lower electricity rates through competition has hit a serious snag: no state agency is legally authorized to give permission to build new power plants.</p>
        <p>The problem could be solved with a simple piece of legislation, but in Albany these days, there is no such thing. The Pataki administration proposed a bill this week to resolve the impasse, but the bill is under attack by environmentalists and Democratic legislators.</p>
        <p>Power companies have applied to build four new plants -- including a floating plant off the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn -- and expand two existing ones. A half-dozen more applications are expected in the next year. One company, U.S. Generating Company, a subsidiary of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, is ready to begin work on a major new plant in Athens, 30 miles south of Albany, awaiting only permits that, without the current impasse, the state could issue this summer.</p>
        <p>But lawmakers and industry analysts say it is likely that those companies will spend the rest of the year, at least, waiting for politicians to resolve their differences. Regulators and the electric industry say new plants are crucial to the new, deregulated power market because they will promote competition and lower energy prices.</p>
        <p>''The new plants for the next generation are going to be built in the next two years, as the market opens up,'' said Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat who is chairman of the Energy Committee. ''If they're blocked in New York, they'll get built elsewhere, and we will miss out on the economic benefits.''</p>
        <p>As much as anything, this is a tale of Albany foul-ups dating back more than a decade, and of the current gridlock between Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, and Democrats in the Legislature over just about every significant issue.</p>
        <p>Under Federal law, any new power plant or expansion of an existing plant requires permits showing that it would comply with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. In each state, the Environmental Protection Agency delegates to a state agency the power to issue those permits.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, New York created a power plant siting board, and the E.P.A. gave it the authority to issue those permits. But the law was written to lapse at the end of 1988. In Albany, factions often add such ''sunset clauses'' to each other's bills to gain future leverage over the bill's sponsors.</p>
        <p>Since no one was clamoring to build new power plants in the 1980's, state officials barely gave a thought to the law's expiration. Then, in 1992, lawmakers created a new siting board, assuming that it would inherit the powers of the old one.</p>
        <p>By late last year, New York's moves to introduce competition to the electric power industry had encouraged several companies to propose new and expanded power plants, and they applied to the new siting board for permits.</p>
        <p>But in February, the E.P.A. notified the state that the new siting board had no power to issue permits. The agency said it had given that right to the old board, and that the authority was not automatically inherited by the new board.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. added that it did not think the new board had adequate resources to review applications. Federal officials said they would be willing to give the state's Department of Environmental Conservation the power to issue permits, but state law reserved that right for the siting board.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. could issue the permits, itself, but it warned that would take two years.</p>
        <p>''No one can quite believe the state got itself in this situation,'' said Cara Lee, president of Scenic Hudson, an environmental group following the power plant proposals.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists seized on another Albany axiom, that difficult decisions are made only when related issues can be linked and a deadline is looming. As long as the state needed a new law on permitting new plants, they argued, why not attach a requirement that older power plants meet the same pollution standards as new ones?</p>
        <p>There are no environmental standards for plants that predate the 1970 Clean Air Act, and they are a leading source of air and water pollution. Compared with the coal-fired plants built in the 1940's and 1950's, new plants produce about 75 percent less sulfur dioxide, 40 percent less nitrogen oxide, and 25 percent less carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>An older plant can consume over 200 billion gallons of water a year for cooling, killing millions of fish as they are sucked in, and killing still more by pumping heated water into an adjoining river or lake. A comparable new plant takes in 2 billion to 3 billion gallons a year.</p>
        <p>But in its new bill, the Pataki administration does not deal with standards for older plants. It would give the Department of Environmental Conservation the power to issue permits for new plants, and adds some new wording to the law governing environmental standards for those plants.</p>
        <p>''It's an insult to everybody who breathes,'' said Larry Shapiro, a senior lawyer at the New York Public Interest Research Group who closely follows electric power issues. ''Here was this huge opportunity, and they blew it.''</p>
        <p>The Governor's office declined to comment on the bill, directing inquiries to the Public Service Commission, which oversees the power industry.</p>
        <p>''We're willing to listen to other ideas,'' said David Flanagan, spokesman for the commission, ''but the bottom line is, this legislation sets stricter environmental standards than have ever existed in New York State for siting power plants.''</p>
