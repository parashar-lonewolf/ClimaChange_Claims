        <p>Just about every major magazine has made some sort of nod to global warming, and Rolling Stone plans to do so in its June 28 issue: on top of the requisite interview with former Vice President Al Gore and an essay by the environmentalist Robert F.

        <p>Just about every major magazine has made some sort of nod to global warming, and Rolling Stone plans to do so in its June 28 issue: on top of the requisite interview with former Vice President Al Gore and an essay by the environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the magazine will start printing on paper that is said to have less of a negative impact on the environment.</p>
        <p>But as Rolling Stone and others try to be green, they draw criticism from environmentalists who think that if this is walking the walk, it is doing so with a pronounced limp.</p>
        <p>Rolling Stone will be printed on what it calls ''carbon neutral paper,'' because it is made through a process that the magazine claims adds no carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The paper, which is considerably thinner than what Rolling Stone uses now, is made by a Canadian mill, Catalyst Paper, that the magazine says has reduced greenhouse-gas emissions by 82 percent since 2005 and been cited by the World Wildlife Fund for its conservation efforts.</p>
        <p>Catalyst offsets the small amount of carbon released in making the paper by planting trees that will not be harvested for more paper, but rather left standing to help cool the climate, said Lyn Brown, vice president for corporate relations and social responsibility at Catalyst.</p>
        <p>What neither an editor's note in Rolling Stone nor a press release sent by the magazine mentions, however, is that the new paper has no recycled content, which prompted a mixed review by Frank Locantore, director of the Magazine Paper Project at Co-op America, a nonprofit group that works with publishers to reduce paper use.</p>
        <p>''Are the steps that Rolling Stone is taking good and important ones?'' Mr. Locantore asked. ''Yes. But what I'm afraid they are doing in the process is diverting attention away from the need to use recycled paper.'' He added, ''All the evidence shows that the greatest ecological and social benefits come from using recycled paper.''</p>
        <p>Eric Bates, deputy managing editor of Rolling Stone, said, ''We think recycled paper is great.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''we're publishing some of the world's greatest photographers and artists,'' and the print quality on recycled paper does not do them justice. ''What we're trying to do is what we can do. We can't put out the magazine we put out on recycled paper.''</p>
        <p>Mansueto Ventures, which publishes Inc. and Fast Company, announced last week that it had switched both its publications to 100 percent recycled paper and had noticed no slip in quality.</p>
        <p>''It did really used to be true that you would lose quality by switching to recycled, but I don't think that's the case anymore,'' John Koten, chief executive and editor in chief of Mansueto, wrote in an e-mail message.</p>
        <p>Hearst Magazines, which publishes 19 magazines in the United States -- including Cosmopolitan, Seventeen, Esquire and O, The Oprah Magazine -- said in April that beginning in July, it would put a ''Please Recycle This Magazine'' logo prominently in all its magazines. Whether the company, whose Hearst Tower in New York is a much-lauded eco-friendly building, uses any recycled paper for those magazines, though, remains an open question.</p>
        <p>In March, Marc Gunther, a senior writer at Fortune magazine, wrote a piece on his Web site about his fruitless attempts to get a straight answer out of Hearst's press office about whether O, The Oprah Magazine has any recycled paper content.</p>
        <p>Andrea Faville, a spokeswoman for Hearst, e-mailed what she called ''a backgrounder on Hearst's green efforts.'' It said the company is ''using more than 15 percent of post-consumer recycled fiber content across its portfolio of publications.''</p>
        <p>But is any of that recycled fiber going into magazines, or instead into the company's dozens of newspapers and trade publications? ''Right now, we don't have any info for you beyond what is in the backgrounder,'' Ms. Faville responded by e-mail.</p>
