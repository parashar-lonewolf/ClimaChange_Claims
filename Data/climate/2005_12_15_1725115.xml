        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A leader should possess both the judgment to identify critical problems and the skill to deal with them effectively. President Bush has consistently exhibited neither of these essential attributes.</p>
        <p>Among the various critical issues confronting our nation, the one to which he has devoted his greatest attention and expended most of his political capital has been the invasion of Iraq.</p>
        <p>In stark contrast, the Bush administration has willfully played down the growing threat posed by global warming. Here we have a looming crisis that could affect the entire world, and America has totally abdicated any leadership role.</p>
        <p>We can only hope that future presidents will be able to mitigate the damage resulting from the failures of leadership of our current one.</p>
