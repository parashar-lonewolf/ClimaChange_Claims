        <p>The New York Power Authority last night fired up the first of seven mini-power plants it is installing around New York City, a victory for the Pataki administration in its efforts to stave off an energy crisis this summer.</p>
        <p>The power authority turned on the plant in the Port Morris section of the Bronx, and planned to leave it on for 12 to 24 hours in a test run, said Mike Petralia, a spokesman for the agency. ''We've spent the day doing all the final checks on all the equipment to make sure everything's in good working order, and it is,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said all the plants would be supplying power by late June.</p>
        <p>Last summer, demand for electricity in New York City rose closer to the available supply than it had been in decades, causing prices to spike upward and prompting state officials to begin warning of potential shortages. There are proposals to build major new power plants, but none of these generators are expected to begin service until 2003 or later.</p>
        <p>So the Pataki administration, to increase supply, sought to install 11 large, gas-fired turbines at seven sites, boosting the available power in the city and Long Island by 450 megawatts, or about 3 percent. The power authority began that work last fall, and said it would have the plants finished by June 1, yesterday, an ambitious timetable that critics said would be hard to meet. With the exception of some finishing work, it met that deadline, at a cost of more than $500 million.</p>
        <p>Community and environmental groups complained that in its haste, the administration bypassed requirements for environmental review and public comment, claims the authority denies. There were also complaints about the fact that all the plants are going into mostly poor, minority neighborhoods. Yesterday, several groups that opposed the projects staged a protest outside the governor's Manhattan office.</p>
        <p>The turbines will be, megawatt for megawatt, the cleanest power plants in the city, but like all plants that burn fossil fuels, they do create air pollution. In response to the criticism, the authority has pledged to reduce air emissions at other sources, so that there would be no net increase in pollution in the affected neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The authority took suggestions from those communities about how to make those pollution cuts, whether by replacing apartment building boilers, refitting New York City Transit diesel buses or other means. The period for submitting suggestions ended May 31, and Mr. Petralia said it was not clear when the authority would decide what measures to adopt.</p>
