        <p>The Burning Season</p>
        <p>The Murder of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest</p>
        <p>By Andrew Revkin</p>
        <p>317 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $19.95.</p>
        <p>In Chico Mendes, a Brazilian rubber tapper who was murdered in December 1988, the developed world found a symbol of resistance to the destruction of the planet. Mr. Mendes, who had campaigned for the preservation of the Amazon rain forest that provided his livelihood, became a martyr to the environment and a posthumously fashionable figure.</p>
        <p>After a torrid summer in the United States in 1988, with its drought and fires in Yellowstone Park, the killing of Mr. Mendes by ranchers intent on setting the Brazilian forest ablaze caught the imagination and indignation of Americans. He became the symbol of the little man standing up to the big interests that were fueling global warming.</p>
        <p>Now, two books - Andrew Revkin's ''Burning Season: The Murder of Chico Mendes and the Fight for the Amazon Rain Forest'' and Alex Shoumatoff's ''World is Burning'' - look back at the life and death of Mr. Mendes. Each, inevitably, covers much of the same ground, chronicling the gradual transformation of Mr. Mendes from a humble rubber tapper in Acre, an eastern Brazilian state, to a man whose courageous defense of the trees and workers he loved eventually made him a figure of such influence that the ranchers he opposed decided to kill him.</p>
        <p>But the similarities between the books end there. While Mr. Revkin's book is a clear, informative account of the clash in the dark heart of the rain forest, Mr. Shoumatoff seems unable to decide whether he is writing a personal travelogue of his own meanderings in the Amazon and elsewhere or the story of Mr. Mendes. His hip language, which seems to owe much to Hunter S. Thompson without ever having Mr. Thompson's bite or humor, is too often a thin mask for an irritating sloppiness. Explaining the difficulty of getting statistics on the Amazon, for example, he writes that ''numbers are a temperate-zone precision trip.''</p>
        <p>Born from a magazine piece on Mr. Mendes that appeared last year in Vanity Fair, Mr. Shoumatoff's book is flawed by its self-obsession and lack of structure. Chapters follow the writer in a circuitous route from his country cabin in New York State, to Rio de Janeiro, on through the Amazon and around again. It reads like a long unedited diary, awaiting distillation. In one of countless references to himself, he describes how he wrote a 714-page ''vomit draft'' of the book in the last three months of last year. Even at half that length in its final form, the book is a trifle emetic.</p>
        <p>That is a pity because Mr. Shoumatoff, an old Brazil hand, has a sharper journalistic eye for the country than Mr. Revkin. He captures well the mounting sense of moral depravity that marked the country during the administration of President Jose Sarney and reached a culmination with the murder of Mr. Mendes.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he understands the sometimes maddening meekness of the myriad Brazilian poor, some of whom Mr. Mendes unexpectedly organized into a resistance force, and their unusual generosity of spirit. He describes well the Brazilian conviction that American concern over the Amazon masks a quest to hold back the economic development of a country with lingering superpower pretensions. And he has a keen sense of the country's institutions, writing, for example, ''In the Brazilian system, the church is the moral check, and the military is the check against chaos.'' But if there are interesting insights scattered through Mr. Shoumatoff's pages, they are awash in a sea of trivia. Overall, Mr. Revkin does a better job of telling the rubber tapper's story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendes emerges as a genuinely tragic figure, swept up in larger forces that ultimately destroy him. Born into the depressed fringes of western Brazil, he takes up his father's work, tapping the rubber trees of the rain forest to extract the syrupy latex that will become rubber. Through a series of chance encounters, he is thrust from this role into the defense of his livelihood against ranchers and others pouring into Acre, intent on burning the forest for pasture.</p>
        <p>Finally, as the global environmental movement gathers force, he assumes a much wider role as a spokesman for the rain forest at international meetings in Miami and Washington, before his still primitive corner of Brazil reclaims him, with bullets.</p>
        <p>In a telling passage on the roots of Mr. Mendes's dogged campaign, Mr. Revkin quotes the rubber tapper, shortly before his death, as he leaps up in anger while watching a documentary on the greenhouse effect and the carbon dioxide spewing from the burning forests of the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''I'm not protecting the forest because I'm worried that in 20 years the world will be affected,'' he said. ''I'm worried about it because there are thousands of people living here who depend on the forest, and their lives are in danger every day.''</p>
        <p>While waving the Mendes banner is now de rigueur for those who are attracted by rain-forest chic, this is a useful reminder that the rubber tapper was no starry-eyed environmentalist.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, his struggle to create ''extractive reserves'' in the forest was directly born of the violent reality of Brazil. It is a reality well captured by Mr. Revkin when he evokes the strangeness of Amazonia: ''The look, feel and smell of the hunks of smoked latex seemed antiquated, anachronistic. It was a material from another time, but in the Amazon all times overlap. Here, rubber tappers still live as they did in the 19th century while ranchers hop to their properties in sleek twin-engine planes and watch television via satellite.''</p>
        <p>Amid the media's discovery of the rain forest and Hollywood's fascination with it, the complexity of Brazilian society and the forces driving settlers into the Amazon has often been forgotten. Mr. Revkin does a good job of presenting all the issues. And although those charged with killing Mr. Mendes have not yet been brought to trial, he sounds a cautiously optimistic note.</p>
        <p>Large extractive reserves for rubber and nuts have been created since Mr. Mendes's death. Killings in Amazonia have fallen off in an apparent sign that the ranchers' sense of impunity has diminished. And the new Brazilian President, Fernando Collor de Mello, has committed himself to environmental defense amid a growing realization that the development of the Amazon has been hopelessly mismanaged.</p>
        <p>This is testimony to Mr. Mendes's achievement. The Amazon, 15 percent of the total mass of plant life, is still little known, and he stood up, almost alone, to preserve its treasures. As Mr. Revkin writes, in an image that is bound to encourage those continuing the struggle Mr. Mendes began, ''Where one tree has fallen to crumble and rot, dozens of green seedlings and saplngs suddenly spring up to vie for the blast of sunlight entering the hole in the canopy.''</p>
