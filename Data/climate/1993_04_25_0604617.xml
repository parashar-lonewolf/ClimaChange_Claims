        <p>On a sunny spring day last week, President Clinton traveled from the White House to a greenhouse at the United States Botanical Gardens and promised two things that President George Bush had refused to do: sign an international agreement protecting rare and endangered species and pledge that the country would reduce greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. Greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, include the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal, oil and gas.</p>
        <p>The speech won praise from environmentalists, who had been troubled by what they perceived as Mr. Clinton's inclination to compromise on environmental issues. Many had criticized his decision last month to back down from a proposal to raise grazing and mining fees on Federal lands, after being pressured by lawmakers from Western states.</p>

        <p>On a sunny spring day last week, President Clinton traveled from the White House to a greenhouse at the United States Botanical Gardens and promised two things that President George Bush had refused to do: sign an international agreement protecting rare and endangered species and pledge that the country would reduce greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. Greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, include the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal, oil and gas.</p>
        <p>The speech won praise from environmentalists, who had been troubled by what they perceived as Mr. Clinton's inclination to compromise on environmental issues. Many had criticized his decision last month to back down from a proposal to raise grazing and mining fees on Federal lands, after being pressured by lawmakers from Western states.</p>
        <p>It was also a boost for Vice President Al Gore, a long-time environmental champion whose clout had suffered setbacks in recent months. He prevailed over some Cabinet members who had argued that the restrictions on global warming would hurt American business.</p>
        <p>Despite their euphoria, environmentalists said that the extent of Mr. Clinton's devotion to their issues has yet to be tested. Some noted, for example, that the White House had not made any commitments about capping greenhouse emissions after the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Their concerns were only magnified later in the week, when Government scientists reported that there was less protective ozone over the Northern Hemisphere this year than there had been in 14 years.</p>
