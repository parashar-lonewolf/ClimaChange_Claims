        <p>If the Government deported all its ''immoral'' citizens to Los Angeles Island after a millennial earthquake severed the city from the mainland, who would be the person you might be most likely to meet there, wearing a wet suit, clutching a surfboard and waiting to ride the next tsunami?

        <p>If the Government deported all its ''immoral'' citizens to Los Angeles Island after a millennial earthquake severed the city from the mainland, who would be the person you might be most likely to meet there, wearing a wet suit, clutching a surfboard and waiting to ride the next tsunami? Why, Peter Fonda of course! And what would the star of psychedelic adventure movies like ''The Trip'' and ''Easy Rider'' exclaim if there were a sudden downpour? ''Acid rain!''</p>
        <p>''John Carpenter's Escape From L.A.,'' the long-in-coming sequel to his 1981 movie ''Escape From New York,'' is filled with such Hollywood in-jokes. These sardonic moments go a long way toward keeping afloat a hopelessly choppy adventure spoof that doesn't even try to match the ghoulish surrealism of its forerunner.</p>
        <p>The sequel wants mostly to play it for laughs while serving up a series of silly comic-book stunts. When dishing out its Hollywood humor, it succeeds in being frothily diverting. Given this frame of mind, who else could possibly play the grim, Bible-thumping President of a politically correct fascist Christian state but Cliff Robertson, the hero of the real-life Hollywood expose ''Indecent Exposure''?</p>
        <p>Since the millennium, the capital of the country has been relocated to Lynchburg, Va., and the Government has outlawed cursing, smoking, drinking and red meat. Los Angeles may be hellish, but at least, explains one exiled character, there you can still wear a fur coat.</p>
        <p>For good comic measure, the movie also throws in Pam Grier as a transsexual Los Angeles overlord, and Steve Buscemi as the ultimate, fast-talking, double-dealing, sleazy Hollywood agent, a slimeball with the unfortunate name of Map to the Stars Eddie.</p>
        <p>Kurt Russell is back, of course, a few pounds heavier than he was in ''Escape From New York'' but still in good shape, as Snake Plissken, the stubbly faced indestructible warrior with an eye patch, a reptilian tattoo and a voice that never rises above a gravelly whisper. In this episode, Snake is forcibly recruited by the President to retrieve a doomsday device that has fallen into the hands of third world invaders headquartered in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The enemy leader, Cuervo Jones (George Corraface), is a Peruvian terrorist and Che Guevara look-alike who drives around in a limousine with a row of baby dolls perched under the windshield and an illuminated disco ball on the back. Cuervo has captured the deadly device, a black box that can shut down all the power on the planet, by intercepting  the President's rebel daughter, Utopia (A. J. Langer), on a virtual-reality trip and turning her into a revolutionary. Snake is informed he has only a few hours to get back the box or he will succumb to a hideous designer virus that has been implanted in his body through a hand scratch.</p>
        <p>''Escape From L.A.,'' which the director wrote with Mr. Russell and Debra Hill, is much too giddy to make sense as a politically astute pop fable. As amusing as some of its notions may be, none are developed into sustained running jokes.</p>
        <p>In its funniest concept, the post-millennial Beverly Hills is peopled entirely by ''surgical failures,'' those who have undergone so much cosmetic surgery that they have all become Michael Jackson-like oddities and worse. Anyone who ventures into the area is promptly captured and whisked to the former Beverly Hills Hotel, now a filthy hospital run by a fright-masked chief surgeon and his blood-spattered assistants, who tie up the prisoners and extract their body parts for further surgery. As the head of the place examines the body of a fresh female captive and touches her breasts, he exclaims, ''My God, they're real!''</p>
        <p>But for the most part, the film's horror-movie vision of Los Angeles is surprisingly unimaginative. More than anything else, the place suggests a giant outdoor tattoo parlor crossed with an automobile junkyard.</p>
        <p>''John Carpenter's Escape From L.A.'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of cartoonish violence and some strong language.</p>
