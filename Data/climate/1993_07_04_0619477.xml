        <p>THE ECONOMY One Swallow Can Be Ignored; a Flock of Them Can't</p>

        <p>THE ECONOMY One Swallow Can Be Ignored; a Flock of Them Can't</p>
        <p>Yes, month-to-month figures mean little -- any number of odd events can jostle them. Yes, it's the long term that counts. But when the arrows head relentlessly downward, they just can't be ignored. And last week it was down, down and down again. Here's just a sampling: even with bargain-basement mortgage rates, new-home sales took their biggest plunge in 13 years, erasing a big April gain. And if the ever-fickle consumer can be believed, there's worse to come, as consumer confidence, which soared in the post-election months, dropped perilously close to its feeble October level. What's to blame? Uncertainty has to be a factor. Tax increases and health care reform are on everyone's lips, but no one knows how the script will play out after the folks in Washington finish their horse-trading. When people feel uneasy, they snap their wallets shut. And the economy stalls. No Comfort in the Job Numbers  Last week's job data provided no exception to the gloomy economic news, as June unemployment climbed right back to 7 percent after a brief visit at 6.9. And the underlying figures were discouraging -- a loss of 53,000 manufacturing jobs and a scant 13,000 rise in payroll jobs. Bob Dole, as usual, couldn't wait to make political hay from this scorched field, saying that with tax increases looming, "employers are scared to death, so they're simply not hiring." But the White House, in the person of Laura D'Andrea Tyson, economic adviser, countered that the job-stimulus bill the Republicans hacked to death would have been felt by now. And in any case, she said, nearly a million new jobs have been created this year. Tim-ber! Watch for Falling Jobs!</p>
        <p>What's most important -- jobs, trees or owls? The answer isn't easy. Typically, Bill Clinton is trying to serve all three masters, and he has everyone angry. Environmentalists want to protect ancient forests in the Northwest, and the northern spotted owls that live there, while loggers warn that if trees aren't being lopped off, their livelihoods will be. So last week Mr. Clinton proposed a compromise, with limits on logging balanced by $1.2 billion for economic development and helping displaced loggers. But the timber industry said the cuts were too deep -- they do represent a drastic change in the way public forests are managed -- while environmentalists said loopholes would allow too much cutting. At press time, the owls had yet to comment. 'Violent Content'? Bring It On  "Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised." What do those eight little words say to a 10-year-old grazing across the channels? Simple. They say, Drop your Nintendo, forget your homework, get your buddies, and watch this! A watchful parent should switch off the set? Right. Mom's stuck at the office, Dad's doing the laundry, the coast is clear. But that warning is what the four commercial broadcast networks came up with last week to try to head off criticism of the increasing violence on television. Some critics want more -- curbs on the violence, ratings, perhaps a way to block out some shows. Not likely; lobbyists are out in force. "We cannot allow broadcast television to become barren of dramatic excitement," the networks said. Farewell, subtlety. There used to be drama in a raised eyebrow, a piercing look. Now, it seems, it can be found only in a raised knife, a piercing bullet.  He Caressed the Modem . . .  Humans have eight years left: In 2001, computers complete their takeover, rendering us obsolete. Don't believe it? Listen to this. Last week, a steamy novel came out that was written partly by a computer named Hal -- surely a cousin of the "2001" star. It seems that Scott French, Hal's "co-author," delved into Jacqueline Susann's masterworks, broke the digital code that dictates exactly when hearts leap and pants drop, and programmed Hal to churn out a hot romance. It took eight years, but he and Hal did it, calling the book "Just This Once." And the Dead Jackie Susann Quarterly (yes, there is such a publication) decreed that it had just the right mix: "money, sleaze, disease, death, oral sex, tragedy and the good girl gone bad." Surely, by 2001, Hal can perfect his (her? its?) craft, and discard the mortal co-author, stripping humans of one of the last things they can do better than machines. Time to pack it in. INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>Germany Meets Critics Halfway  Germany tried to keep interest rates high to ward off demon inflation, but outsiders were impatient. Typical were remarks by President Clinton, who called for lower rates "so that all of us together can expand this economy." But Germany has been giving in -- gradually, giving out crumbs of rate cuts every month or so. Last week, perhaps to head off criticism at this week's meeting of leading nations, it dropped rates again, to 6.75 percent for its discount rate and 8.25 percent for the Lombard rate -- a move one German economist called "more of a middle policy." Setback for the Trade Pact  When the United States, Canada and Mexico came up with their North American Free Trade Agreement, environmentalists said: Wait a second! What about air and water pollution in border areas if industry flocks to Mexico? What about pesticides in imported food? Unsatisfied with the answers, three environmental groups took this lament to court, and last week a Federal judge said they had a point. The judge ordered the Government to prepare an environmental impact statement -- which could take six months -- probably delaying and maybe even killing the pact. This setback for the Administration may have a silver lining, though, because Congressional support for the pact was shaky anyway, and President Clinton may thus avoid another nasty battle. Learning the Rules in Japan  In the board room, east isn't meeting west quite yet. American pension funds, feeling their oats after pushing some directors around back home, tried their stuff in Japan. But the Japanese do things their way: they have their annual meetings all at once, making it impossible for a troublemaker to attend more than one, and they brook little dissent. It's a clubby affair, with a lot of reciprocal back-scratching. Enter Calpers, the mighty California retirement system, which has about $5 billion worth of Japanese stock. Wanting to have a say, Calpers cast a number of "nay" votes last week, but when the votes were counted, management resolutions somehow passed unanimously. COMPANIES</p>
        <p>Where's the Bottom at Empire?</p>
        <p>At some point things have to hit bottom at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, where, amazingly, each wave of news is worse than the last. Last week would be hard to top, though: at a Senate hearing, the insurer's chief auditor testified that she couldn't get straight answers from the chief financial officer about discrepancies in the books -- even as the ousted chairman, Albert Cardone, testified that there never were two sets of books. But there was a ray of hope, when Empire picked a new chairman and chief, Philip Briggs, formerly of Metropolitan Life. Mr. Briggs brought understatement to new heights by describing Empire as "a little disorganized," but, for a change, he has experience at a for-profit insurer. That can't hurt. A Kinder Refrigerator  Here's one way to get companies to make things that are kinder to the planet: drop the stick, try something more edible. In a contest referred to as "the golden carrot," a group of utilities offered $30 million for the best refrigerator design that saves both energy and the ozone layer. This is no small matter, for refrigerators account for fully 20 percent of household electric bills, and their CFC's eat away at the ozone. The carrot worked, for Whirlpool came up with a model that uses 25 percent less energy and has no CFC's, and last week it took the prize. And because the prize money will offset some startup costs, the new refrigerators, due early next year, will cost about the same as current models.  Benefits for Gays at HBO  Gay workers edged closer to the mainstream last week when HBO, joining a growing list of companies, offered health benefits to same-sex partners. But it's not true equality; the I.R.S. doesn't recognize such couples, so part of what HBO gives, the taxperson takes away. Outsider to Run Westinghouse  Again, the corporate ladder is not as orderly as it used to be, as newly bold directors cast their net far and wide to pick a boss. After Paul Lego resigned at Westinghouse, Gary Clark filled in as acting chief executive, but directors kept searching outside. Only last week, nearly half a year later, did they find their man: Michael H. Jordan, with a long stint at Pepsico on his resume.  Now It's Murdoch vs. the Unions  The choice was coming down to this: a New York Post owned by Rupert Murdoch, or no New York Post. No one else seemed willing to pour millions into this especially leaky bucket -- at least no one who didn't appall the Post staff (or have you forgotten Abe Hirschfeld?) -- and Mr. Murdoch was about to pull the plug. So last week the F.C.C. granted Mr. Murdoch a waiver to let him own a newspaper and television station in a single market. The F.C.C. insisted it was setting no precedent. It's a one-time-only bow to "the overwhelming body of responsible public opinion," said James H. Quello, the acting chairman. But before he can make the purchase, Mr. Murdoch must still get union opinion on his side -- and that'll be tough. His latest threat: if there's no contract by July 9, no more Post.</p>
