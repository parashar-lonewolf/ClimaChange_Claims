        <p>Outside, the rain was cascading in sheets, pounding on windshields, roiling rivers and tributaries, lakes and ponds, water, too much water, and then some more.</p>
        <p>Inside Hancock High School, in the nether reaches of the Catskills on Thursday night, Hancock's town supervisor, Sam Rowe, greeted visitors in a T-shirt from last June's storm reading, ''Come Hell or High Water -- Flood of 2006.''</p>
        <p>He hung around for a while until his phone beeped, listened for a moment and then rushed out. Route 17, the main drag, was closed to the west because of flooding.</p>
        <p>You looked at the topic that had sucked people out into this soggy mess, ''Before the Next Flood: What Your Community Can Do!'' and thought, ''Whoops, too late.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, that wasn't quite right. Thursday's heavy rains produced some minor local flooding. Still, it wasn't Strike 4 in the biblical plague of flooding upstate that has produced disasters that are not supposed to occur for a century or more over the last two years.</p>
        <p>But the frustration and anger seething through the high school cafeteria, the Babel of hydrology and bureaucratese, the pulls of competing constituencies made you think, man, they better figure out something before the next flood, because people can take only so much, and they already have.</p>
        <p>''We were recovering from two floods, and then we got hit with one of a magnitude that no one alive has ever seen around here,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''It could take 10 years to totally recover from this last one -- and that's assuming we don't get another one we have to deal with.''</p>
        <p>So about three dozen local officials and frustrated residents braved one downpour to contemplate a worse one on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Here's what's at stake: The Delaware River is the longest nondammed river east of the Mississippi, extending 330 miles from the Catskills to the mouth of the Delaware Bay. Nearly 15 million people -- about 5 percent of the nation's population -- rely on it and 216 tributaries for drinking water and industrial uses. New York City gets half of its water from three reservoirs on the Delaware, and countless towns from here to the Atlantic exist because the river does.</p>
        <p>From 1955 to 1996, there were no major floods. Now, it seems, there's one every year. The Delaware River Basin Commission, which manages the river system, has begun a flood mitigation study, but on Thursday you could hear the frustration in the voice of every resident who spoke.</p>
        <p>''I hear the word rain, and I hear a four-letter word,'' said Joan Homovich, a retired teacher, who estimates her basement has flooded 10 times since 2003 and now obsessively goes online studying water releases from the reservoirs on the river. ''When I thought about this rain I couldn't eat.''</p>
        <p>Part of the difficulty is a blizzard of conflicting agendas.</p>
        <p>New York City, which controls the reservoirs, wants to be assured of drinking water for more than eight million people. Upstate residents want the city to also use the reservoirs to manage river flows and minimize flooding. Fishermen and environmentalists want to protect fisheries and limit man-made disruptions on the river. Towns want to be able to dredge and clean out streams to improve water flows that would prevent flooding.</p>
        <p>At Thursday night's meeting, the second of two last week, there was all sorts of information: about where to build homes and how to retrofit existing ones to protect them from flooding; about flood insurance and managing water flows.</p>
        <p>But the issue that people cared most about was one with no solution in sight -- whether New York City's Department of Environmental Protection has any real interest in managing its reservoirs, now full yet again, for flood control as well as for providing water to the city.</p>
        <p>Residents want the agency to release water and lower the reservoir levels, creating a void that could trap rainfall that could otherwise cause flooding. The agency says its options are limited because the reservoirs are not built for flood control. But for the first time it has said it would make efforts in that direction.</p>
        <p>Residents say the city is already failing to deliver. (The agency says reservoirs are now at 100.5 percent of capacity. Normal is 70 percent.)</p>
        <p>''We're looking at full reservoirs and it's raining like hell,'' said Chuck Schroeder, who has a log home he built near Hancock that was flooded out in 2005 and then in June. ''I look out there, and I see exactly the same conditions we've had over the last three floods.''</p>
        <p>This year in the Catskills is among the wettest on record, but who knows what to read into a few years of wet weather. Freak of nature? Global warming? Thirty-year rainfall cycle? Act of God?</p>
        <p>No one knows, and there are acts of nature that are beyond the machinations of man.</p>
        <p>But as people rushed through the downpour to their cars they did know one thing: after three catastrophic floods in two years, there's little in place that would make a fourth any different.</p>
