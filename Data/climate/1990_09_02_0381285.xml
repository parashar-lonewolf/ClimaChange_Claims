        <p>Chandler S. Robbins, a senior U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, is rattling through the refuge in Laurel, Md., when he brakes his Chevy on a one-lane bridge spanning a creek that is swollen with spring rain. From a drooping branch hangs a nest, and in it sits an olive-brown mite of a bird he quickly identifies as an Acadian flycatcher.</p>
        <p>After Robbins gets out of the car, the bird flies off with a perturbed pip! - and no wonder. For through the bridge's girders Robbins pokes an extendible aluminum pole with the rear-view mirror from a child's bicycle affixed to its tip. A dentist could use the device to examine a giraffe's molars. Angling the mirror over the nest, Robbins sees that it's empty, still under construction. So, leaving the bird to its business, he continues on his.</p>
        <p>Six hours later, he has examined and tallied the contents of 16 wood thrush nests, three red-eyed vireo nests and one each belonging to an ovenbird and a Kentucky warbler. Some are empty, many contain eggs and a few hold just-hatched, dime-size, eraser-pink young. (One clutch of precocious wood thrush nestlings, literally early birds on this last weekend in May, has sprouted mole-gray pinfeathers.) None of these nests has been as conveniently close to a road as the flycatcher's. Yet lumbering through thickets and sloshing across streams in high rubber boots has been more exhilarating than exhausting. Robbins will be attending his 50th reunion at Harvard in a week. Even with hearing aids, he can no longer detect the high-frequency lisp of a blue-gray gnatcatcher or the urgent squeak of a blackpoll warbler. But there's still something boyish about him, and it's not just his bushy crew cut and the Boy Scout olive of his overshirt. He loves to tramp though the woods with an adolescent's abandon - albeit with a scientist's sense of purpose.</p>
        <p>Robbins - known as Chan everywhere but in scholarly papers - is in the vanguard of biologists who are sounding an alarm that songbirds are imperiled in America, especially in what remains of the forests in the Northeast. ''There is a sickness in the woods,'' the biologist John Terborgh warns in his recent book, ''Where Have All the Birds Gone?''</p>
        <p>The malady is not the same one Rachel Carson diagnosed in ''Silent Spring,'' her 1962 book (based largely on data compiled at Patuxent) that led eventually to the banning of DDT. Pesticides still present problems, but these pale beside a new danger -the rapid deforestation of Central and South America, where many birds spend the winter - and an old one that continues unabated: the commercial and residential development of North America, where these migrants rear their young. Moreover, new research suggests that suburbia poses a subtle and insidious threat to many songbirds by enabling predators and parasites to thrive at their expense.</p>
        <p>''These birds are getting it on both ends of the line,'' Robbins says, ''in the breeding season and in the winter. The thing that's difficult to answer specifically about an individual species is where is the bottleneck? They're under pressure here, they're under pressure there. Which is worse?''</p>
        <p>In 1965, Robbins and other Fish and Wildlife researchers organized the nationwide Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), expanded to include Canada, and the records of volunteer observers (some 4,000 participated this spring) have been accumulating ever since. The computer analysis to which these findings is subjected is arcane, but you don't need a Ph.D. in statistics to decode the bottom line.</p>
        <p>Between 1978 and 1987, the number of wood thrushes breeding in the eastern United States and Canada fell at an annual rate of 4 percent. For rose-breasted grosbeaks, the yearly decline was 4.1 percent. North America's two species of cuckoo, the black-billed and yellow-billed, were down an annual average of 5.9 and 5 percent, respectively. The Tennessee warbler is minus 11.6 percent annually; the worm-eating warbler, minus 2 percent; the ovenbird, minus 1 percent.</p>
        <p>These figures are not universally accepted, but if the U.S. Census Bureau is having difficulty counting 250 million or so people, imagine the impossibility of tallying accurately the 20 billion birds ''guess-timated'' to inhabit the continental United States every summer.</p>
        <p>BBS data indicate that at least 21 species of songbirds that are dwindling in eastern North America fly to wintering grounds in the Neotropics: to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. (An additional dozen or so songbirds may be declining, but the falloff is not yet statistically significant.) Many migratory shorebirds are in trouble, as well as some migrant songbirds that nest in the West, but the Northeastern woods are the nursery and summer home of the greatest concentrations of Neotropical migrants. Some of these birds, the warblers and tanagers, are our most vividly colored; others, particularly the thrushes, are the most melodious singers. Without flycatchers, our woods would be even thicker with no-see-ums and other nuisances. Were these migrants to disappear altogether, not just the forests but our lives would be impoverished.</p>
        <p>By now the deforestation of Central and South America, which is proceeding in some countries at an annual rate of 1 to 3.5 percent, has become a cause that is literally celebre. Everyone from Senator Sam Nunn to Madonna has jumped on the ''Don't Bungle the Jungle'' bandwagon. The pressures of population and economics are devastating Latin America and endangering, many scientists charge, the earth's entire atmosphere as well as the winter habitats of what it is presumptuous to call ''our'' birds, since they actually spend the greater portion of the year in the Neotropics.</p>
        <p>Increasing numbers of American biologists are spending their winters in the Neotropics, too, trying to document the damage and to encourage local conservation efforts. Deforestation is their greatest concern, but not their only one. Many dangerous pesticides that have been outlawed in the United States, for instance, are still widely used in Latin America.</p>
        <p>On that spring morning at Patuxent, Chan Robbins wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a toucan and the legend ''Belize'' - where he has conducted research for the past three years. Using satellite imagery to identify different habitats, he is comparing bird populations in agricultural and still-forested areas.</p>
        <p>Radar scans of flocks of birds migrating across the Gulf of Mexico show a decrease in density, but those that live year-round in the tropics have been hit even harder, according to Robbins. The scarlet macaw, he says, seems to have all but disappeared: ''To see one you'd have to backpack for two or three days and hire a special guide.''</p>
        <p>Among migrant songbirds, those that depend exclusively on undisturbed Neotropical forests, particularly those that winter in a circumscribed area, seem to be most at risk. These include the cerulean warbler and the Louisiana water thrush (despite its name, another warbler).</p>
        <p>Yet suspicion is mounting that the attrition of Neotropical migrants cannot be attributed entirely to circumstances south of the border - no more than America's cocaine problem can be blamed altogether on Colombia and Peru. That is why Robbins, two Fish and Wildlife colleagues and two summer interns are scouring the woods in Maryland for bird nests. They are comparing the reproductive success rates of birds within the 4,700 acres of the Patuxent refuge to those that attempt to breed within the smaller woodland plots, or ''fragments,'' more characteristic of the densely settled Northeast. The conclusion that their evidence points to is that if it's bad for Neotropical migrants all over, fragmentation is especially injurious to their reproductive health.</p>
        <p>''We're gradually building a public awareness,'' Robbins says. ''This whole business of fragmentation - 20 years ago that word was never used - it was wet woods or steep woods or whatever, but woods was woods. Size had no meaning. Now we know that it is extremely important.''</p>
        <p>''Ooooh, disgusting!'' Barbara A. Dowell is surveying the wreckage of a wood thrush nest that has been knocked on its side but not quite dislodged from a sapling. On the ground lie one pale blue egg, wet and cold to the touch, a shattered shell containing an embryo and shards of a third egg whose contents have presumably been eaten by an unknown predator.</p>
        <p>Dowell, who has been working at Patuxent for 12 years and with Robbins for most of them, is canvassing a 45-acre lot a few miles from the refuge. This fragment is all that remains of what may be the last virgin forest in Maryland. Development in this area, strategically and vulnerably midway between Washington and Baltimore, has been recent and massive. The housing clusters often bear ironically sylvan names like Twelve Oaks (even a Job Corps center is called Woodland).</p>
        <p>While scores of oaks and tulip trees still tower in this plot, the leaves of the dogwoods that fill in the spaces between their immense trunks are withered and crumpled - by acid rain, says Dowell. More bird nests than in the refuge seem to have been struck by a blight, too. Since Dowell last checked, numerous wood thrush nests, as well as a Kentucky warbler's, have been despoiled by predators. Locating three cardinal nestlings in a tangle, she sniffs the musky, urinaceous scent of a fox whose den must be nearby and predicts that they're not long for this world, either.</p>
        <p>Warblers, no less than wolves, need Lebensraum, but research suggests that a wood lot's size per se is not the only factor that deprives birds of their reproductive edge. It is also the easy access that smaller forests provide predators to the birds' eggs and young within.</p>
        <p>These have always been tempting morsels. When Audubon painted blue jays, he portrayed them gobbling eggs. ''See how each is enjoying the fruits of his knavery,'' he wrote, ''sucking the egg which he has pilfered from the nest of some innocent dove or harmless partridge!'' Crows and grackles, as well as blue jays, feast upon eggs and nestlings, and so do raccoons, skunks, opossums and squirrels (not to mention cats). All of these creatures have fattened at the bird feeders and garbage cans of suburbia, where they prosper in greater densities than in deep forest. And when the woods aren't deep - they seldom are in America anymore - the birds that nest there are sitting ducks for opportunistic and increasing populations of predators.</p>
        <p>That's the theory, at least, and scientists are still gathering evidence to support it. A question immediately arises, however. If predation is the culprit, why are so many other birds that migrate only as far as the southern states, or not at all, flourishing under the same suburban circumstances? Species such as the tufted titmouse, cardinal and mockingbird have even expanded their geographical ranges.</p>
        <p>David S. Wilcove, now the senior biologist for the Wilderness Society, conducted a series of ingenious field experiments with artificial, cup-shaped wicker nests stocked with commercial quail eggs. He set them out in forests of varying sizes, on the ground and in saplings, and he also deposited eggs in makeshift nesting boxes mimicking the tree holes (or ''cavities'') in which birds such as woodpeckers, chickadees and titmice nest. The deeper the woods, his results showed, the less predation. Nests on the ground were looted more frequently than those in trees. And nests in cavities escaped scot-free. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Neotropical migrants construct open-cup nests, and many build them on the ground. Birds that don't migrate such distances tend to prefer cavities and other less accessible nesting sites. Thus, birds that stick closer to home year-round are more secure than Neotropical migrants, even without the feeding stations that enable many of them to survive the winter.</p>
        <p>Chan Robbins and his colleagues have been counting bird nests in Maryland for three years, which is not long enough to reach definitive conclusions. But one thing is already obvious to him: ''In the small, isolated woodlands, we're not getting the Neotropical migrants anymore. . . . You just don't find warblers.''</p>
        <p>It's a grotesque yet mesmerizing sight, a miniaturized ''Rosemary's Baby'' for real. On a bare branch about 20 feet up an oak tree, a big dingy cowbird fledgling is calling insistently for food. Its cries are answered by a warbler half its size, an adult ovenbird that alights on the branch with a caterpillar in its beak. Approaching timorously, the ovenbird tosses the tidbit down the fledgling's gullet and flies off in a flash, as if in fear that it, too, will be devoured. Twenty minutes later, and as many yards away, a diminutive ovenbird fledgling flutters about the undergrowth, cheeping to be fed, but to no apparent avail.</p>
        <p>One usually thinks of parasites as tiny ticks and such, but the brown-headed cowbird is also a parasite, one that threatens many other birds almost as gravely as predators. Indeed, one warbler, the Kirtland's, would probably be extinct by now if Fish and Wildlife and other agencies didn't regularly trap and remove cowbirds from their nesting grounds in central Michigan.</p>
        <p>Cowbirds have the nasty habit of depositing their eggs in smaller birds' nests. A young cowbird is large to start with and grows quickly, commanding most of the food brought by stepparents whose natural offspring often languish and die. ''Rowdy little buggers,'' Barbara Dowell calls young cowbirds. One researcher admits that when she encounters cowbird nestlings or eggs, she often casts aside scientific protocol and flings them to the ground.</p>
        <p>When cowbirds were largely confined to the Great Plains and the company of bison, so was the havoc they wreaked. But with the felling of the forests and the introduction of mechanized harvesting that leaves behind plenty of grain for cowbirds to consume, their range has extended across the continent.</p>
        <p>The open nests of Neotropical migrants are as inviting to these parasites as they are to predators. To make matters worse, most long-distance migrants lack the instinctual ability some short-distance migrants and stay-at-homes, including blue jays, catbirds and robins, have acquired after centuries of experience to recognize cowbird eggs and eject them from their nests.</p>
        <p>Cowbirds still seem to be most pernicious in the Midwest - where one researcher concluded from an Illinois study that ''wood thrushes are doing nothing but raising cowbirds'' - and to prefer open country and suburbs to dense woods. That's why the encounter with the ovenbird and the parasite fledgling was particularly dismaying. It occurred deep within the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in eastern Pennsylvania, where the research director, James C. Bednarz (who now works with a private consulting firm), and an intern were snaring ovenbirds.</p>
        <p>Going Robbins one better, Bednarz and his colleagues were not only tallying nests but banding birds - ovenbirds and wood thrushes - within the sanctuary and in outlying forest fragments. The goal is to track individual birds over several years. Will they return to the same spot for several springs? How prolifically will they breed? Will they abandon a fragment in frustration?</p>
        <p>Lugging mist nets and poles in an old golf bag, Bednarz was accompanied by Nancy R. Zawada, an urban park ranger from Staten Island. Whenever they heard an ovenbird's teacher-teacher-teacher song (Robert Frost's sonnet, ''The Oven Bird,'' hailed the ''singer everyone has heard''), they would unfurl and string up two 30-foot-long swathes of fine mesh. At the center, where the nets met, they stationed a wooden model of an ovenbird, nicknamed Oppenheimer (the wood thrush decoy is Wendell), and concealed a tape-recorder under leaves. All morning long the songs, live and on tape, volleyed back and forth, like an avian ''Dueling Banjos,'' but not until after noon did an ovenbird actually fly into the nets as it tried to drive its unbudging rival from its nesting territory.</p>
        <p>Quickly disentangling the bird, Bednarz and Zawada took several measurements and suspended it, nestled in a navy-blue sock, from a pocket scale (19 grams). After she attached colored bands to each of its legs, Zawada blew gently on the feathers of the underbelly to part them and determine the sex (male, with swollen testes). And, just before releasing the bird, she plucked one of its 12 tail feathers (it's painless, she said, and a replacement soon grows in).</p>
        <p>Zawada is conducting an experiment in the little-known field of ptilochronology. Certain bird feathers bear faint lateral bands that indicate 24 hours' growth, much as the rings in a tree trunk record a year's. Squint and wiggle the feather as if it were one of those magic pictures from a Cracker Jack box, and you can just make these bands out. The wider they are, the more daily growth and, presumably, general well-being a bird has enjoyed. By measuring them on birds netted in different habitats, Zawada is administering what amounts to a comparative stress test. Her hope is to determine whether birds are literally more ''stressed out'' in forest fragments than in thick woods.</p>
        <p>But the woods atop Hawk Mountain were not very thick this year. In the spring, gypsy-moth caterpillars stripped the oak canopy bare, as they have so many other forests in the Northeast since the Eurasian moth was introduced to the United States in 1869. Several decades of widespread aerial spraying have put a stop neither to the devastation nor to the debate over the effects of such pesticidal programs. One study conducted in a New Jersey state forest indicated that birds declined in abundance by 55 percent after a single aerial spraying and took years to recover.</p>
        <p>Gypsy moth infestations are usually periodic, not permanent. The tree trunks on Hawk Mountain (which has not been sprayed since 1969) were studded, as if by rusty nails, with dead caterpillars, and the ground was littered with their squishy remains. They had erupted in such numbers that they had exhausted their food supply and starved to death. The recommendation of many naturalists is to let nature - even if, as in the case of the gypsy moth, it's imported - take its course.</p>
        <p>Robbins and many other biologists believe that what threatens bird life is not nature, but mankind, taking its course. Yet a great deal more research must be conducted and completed in both South and North America to determine the extent of the decline and its causes. ''We're dealing with huge numbers of birds and a large geographical area,'' Robbins says. ''Even when we say it's a scarce bird, there are a lot of them out there. How many cerulean warblers are there? Tens of thousands? Maybe 100,000? No one knows. They're not going to disappear all of a sudden.''</p>
        <p>Although 9 out of 10 researchers, according to Paul Kerlinger, director of the Cape May Bird Observatory of the New Jersey Audubon Society, would agree that woodland birds are losing ground, some still harbor doubts. Richard T. Holmes, a biology professor at Dartmouth College who has been conducting studies in the White Mountains for 22 years, says he hasn't seen a widespread decline in New Hampshire and questions the Breeding Bird Survey data. However, even Holmes, who also works in the Neotropics, acknowledges, ''I don't think anybody has any good evidence that the Neotropics are important at this stage, but they will be eventually if enough deforestation occurs down there.''</p>
        <p>''It could creep up on you,'' warns Jim Bednarz. ''If we wait for 10 years and the songbirds decline by 50 percent, it may be too late to recover.''</p>
        <p>''We must strike a balance,'' cautions an article in Current Ornithology, ''between labeling every ephemeral downturn a major population decline (the 'Chicken Little Syndrome') and refusing to accept the evidence for population decline unless it satisfies impossibly rigorous statistical requirements for certainty (the 'Tobacco Lobby Syndrome').''</p>
        <p>All the evidence about songbirds so far supports preserving as much forest as possible, in North America as well as the Neotropics. And in large, contiguous tracts rather than small, isolated parcels. What Bednarz calls ''Swiss cheese habitat'' is porous to predation. In order to protect the maximum amount of remaining woodland, the New Jersey Audubon Society is not alone in recommending development policies that promote cluster housing rather than individual lots. It also urges a halt to aerial spraying for gypsy moths and mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Still, the last lines of Frost's ''The Oven Bird'' echo ominously: ''The question that he frames in all but words/Is what to make of a diminished thing.''</p>
        <p>''If I had children, I'd be worried,'' says Patuxent's Barbara Dowell. ''Not because people are going to become extinct like the birds, but because of the quality of their life. To me, a minimum quality of life is a wood thrush.''</p>
