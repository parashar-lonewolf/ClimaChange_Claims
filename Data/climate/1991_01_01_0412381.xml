        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I found what looks like a root that glows in the dark. What is it?</p>
        <p>A. "If it was a tree root, it might be luminous as the result of invasion by certain luminous fungi," said Dr. Stephen K. Tim, vice president for science and publications at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. "On a dark night, a heavily infested root or trunk near the ground may show phosphorescence, and it looks like an eerie glow from the root itself."</p>
        <p>One luminous fungus is the honey mushroom, which commonly invades oak and walnut trees, he said. Another species is called the jack-o'-lantern mushroom. Many bacteria also cause phosphorescence, he said.</p>

        <p>The glow comes from the release of energy from a biochemical reaction, Dr. Tim said, but the phenomenon has not been well studied, and the reason and the mechanism remain obscure.  Holes in the Sand</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>What makes the bubbling holes in the sand when a wave recedes?</p>
        <p>A. One cause is simply air trapped beneath the surface bubbling up through the sand, said Richard Crist, assistant supervisor of aquariums at the New York Aquarium in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Another source could be hardshell clams, he continued. They get oxygen from water drawn inside their shells through a siphon that extends out the side. Inside is a crude gill that takes oxygen from the water and returns carbon dioxide. Then the water is expelled. The hole is just the end of a tube that lets water move back and forth through the wet sand, Mr. Crist explained. Burrowing shrimp and worms leave similar holes.</p>
        <p>"If you dig down into the sand and nothing is there, it could be that an animal has moved away from an old hole," he said.</p>
