        <p>Bruce McCall Op-Art piece on other possible ice skating venues in New York now that there is one in Bryant Park; they include Grand Central Terminal, Guggenheim Museum, Columbus Circle and flight deck of Intreped</p>

        <p>A gala black-tie Madison Square Garden benefit performance of ''The Iceman Cometh Follies,'' America's first Eugene O'Neill musical on ice, recently kicked off fund-raising for a renaissance of outdoor skating in New York City. A new temporary venue in Bryant Park has already joined the long-established Wollman and Rockefeller Center rinks this winter to serve Manhattan's skating throngs. Critics' charges of a mere election-year sop notwithstanding, the city's new Department of Fun is busily considering other possible</p>
        <p>Manhattan rink sites for the skating season. But look around: skating fever appears to be bursting out all over.</p>
        <p>Suspected to have been financed by a lavish donation from Big Ice, Grand Central Terminal's vast vaulted main concourse will be transformed into an indoor skating arena complete with old-fashioned pipe organ and Strauss waltzes from December to March. ''Meet me at the information booth,'' chirps Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, ''but slow way down before you get there!'' Thousands of daily commuters will learn to skate to and from their trains -- that, or risk fibula and tibia trying to cover that super-slippery surface on foot.</p>
        <p>On Boxing Day, Dec. 26, the Consulate General of Canada is sponsoring a spectacular ''Blades Across the Border'' skate sprint. It will be Canadian ice demons against their American cousins in a mad indoor skating dash, spiraling from street level to the uppermost reaches of Fifth Avenue's Guggenheim Museum -- and spiraling right back down again.</p>
        <p>Down Wall Street way, the roofs of the larger office buildings this winter will become outdoor hockey rinks where New York's financial overachievers vent their over-the-top competitive zeal in slam-bang, end-to-end action. But guys, no body-checking opponents over the side!</p>
        <p>Chaotic Columbus Circle is all set to become a hushed home to the hypnotic swishswish-swish of blades on ice as this natural racing circuit plays host to the first annual ''Borolympix,'' pitting New York's five boroughs against one another in speed-skating grudge matches sure to lend new meaning to the phrase ''internecine warfare.'' The Taxi and Limousine Commission's 11th-hour exemption allowing cabbies full run around the circle, though admittedly controversial, is certain to heighten the excitement.</p>
        <p>Over on the West Side, the flight deck of the Intrepid will feature daily demonstrations of skill and derring-do by the United States Special Forces' elite ''Skatin' 55th'' Ice Corps, skate-shod parachutists specially trained for clandestine night maneuvers on frozen Dutch canals, Canadian ponds and other potential global flashpoints.</p>
        <p>If some detect a frantic quality to this sudden burst of New York skatemania, scant wonder: the grim fact is that, like the Fudgsicle and the snow angel and the Scotch on the rocks, ice skating early in the third millennium finds itself pinned under the white-hot spotlight of global warming. It's only a matter of time, experts predict, until this centuries- old cold-weather pastime melts away. But until that slushy day, ice-minded Manhattan aficionados intend to lace up, step out and set their blades on that big city ice.</p>
