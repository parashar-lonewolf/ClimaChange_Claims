        <p>LEAD: The greatest musical evocation of nature, for me, is Haydn's oratorio ''The Creation.'' As God creates the earth and its creatures, one hears them in instruments and voices: fields and mountains, eagles and whales and worms.</p>
        <p>The greatest musical evocation of nature, for me, is Haydn's oratorio ''The Creation.'' As God creates the earth and its creatures, one hears them in instruments and voices: fields and mountains, eagles and whales and worms.</p>
        <p>Listening to it last weekend in a beautiful performance by the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston under Christopher Hogwood, I realized that there was a certain sadness now in ''The Creation,'' along with the pleasure of the music. And I understood why.</p>
        <p>Haydn's music expresses a simple faith in the goodness and enduring order of nature. Eagles soar, lions roar. And shining through it is Haydn's faith in God the creator of all things. ''His glory lasts forever,'' the text says, ''and for evermore.''</p>
        <p>We cannot have that simple faith now, that 18th-century belief in the permanent order of nature: not if we are at all aware of the realities around us. We know that what God created, in the Genesis story, man is destroying.</p>
        <p>The reports are there, day after day: tropical rain forests cut and burned, lakes dead from acid rain, a hole in the protective ozone layer, thousands of plant and animal species heading for extinction. The richness and variety that poets have celebrated in nature are steadily diminishing.</p>
        <p>I find myself turning away from stories about the degradation of the environment, because the kind of change needed to reverse the trend is so daunting. The very numbers and character of modern man press on our natural surroundings. Population growth, land development, industrial technology and commercial agriculture all take their toll.</p>
        <p>Think about the greenhouse effect, with its projected disastrous warming of the earth. It is caused by the chemical byproducts of systems on which we all rely: the internal combustion engine, refrigeration and so on. How can we change all that?</p>
        <p>Moreover, our usual political mechanisms are ill suited to coping with a problem on the scale of the gathering environmental crisis. Small groups, seeing only their parochial interests, often have more influence than the larger community.</p>
        <p>Consider the current controversy about clear-cutting of ancient evergreens on Federal land in Oregon and Washington. These are virgin forests. When they are gone, there will be nothing like them on earth.</p>
        <p>Americans as a people have a great interest in preserving those forests of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. But one small group has an intense interest in cutting them down: the logging companies and their employees. And they have influence in Congress.</p>
        <p>Last month a one-hour television special on the controversy was presented by the National Audubon Society. Before it was shown, on a Turner Broadcasting System cable network, the timber industry mounted a pressure campaign against it. Stroh Breweries, a sponsor, was told that loggers would boycott Stroh beer. Stroh pulled out, withdrawing all the support it had promised for an Audubon series: $600,000. Ford, Exxon and other advertisers also canceled.</p>
        <p>The program was shown, finally, with public service announcements instead of advertising. It is supposed to appear on Public Broadcasting stations next summer. But the next time someone proposes a program on an environmental issue that affects some American interest group, will a television network be brave enough to take it on?</p>
        <p>''No one objects if you do a story about the Brazilians burning up their forests,'' said James Lipscomb, co-producer of the Audubon program. ''But if you produce a program where a Forest Service scientist says we are cutting down our virgin forest at a faster rate than Brazil, the funding dries up.''</p>
        <p>In that small example one can see how hard it is for the general interest - the interest in nature and survival - to prevail over the particular. But the kind of world we know will survive only if the general interest can be understood, and prevail.</p>
        <p>The odds are long, but more and more people have begun to understand and to fight. In California this week an alliance of politicians and environmentalists introduced a broad ballot measure to protect air, food and water. The fact that serious political forces join in such an initiative is reason for hope.</p>
        <p>There will be no supernatural rescue. Man the destroyer must now be the preserver. As John Kennedy said in his inaugural address, ''here on earth God's work must truly be our own.''  ABROAD AT HOME</p>
