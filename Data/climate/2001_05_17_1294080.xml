        <p>Following are excerpts from the overview of the national energy policy being proposed by President Bush today, as provided by the White House:</p>
        <p>America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970's. The effects are already being felt nationwide. Many families face energy bills two or three times higher than they were a year ago. Millions of Americans find themselves dealing with rolling blackouts or brownouts; some employers must lay off workers or curtail production to absorb the rising cost of energy. Drivers across America are paying higher and higher gasoline prices.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the overview of the national energy policy being proposed by President Bush today, as provided by the White House:</p>
        <p>America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970's. The effects are already being felt nationwide. Many families face energy bills two or three times higher than they were a year ago. Millions of Americans find themselves dealing with rolling blackouts or brownouts; some employers must lay off workers or curtail production to absorb the rising cost of energy. Drivers across America are paying higher and higher gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>Californians have felt these problems most acutely. California actually began the 1990's with a surplus of electricity generating capacity. Yet despite an economic boom, a rapidly growing population and a corresponding increase in energy needs, California did not add a single new major electric power plant during the 1990's. The result is a demand for electricity that greatly succeeds the amount available.</p>
        <p>A fundamental imbalance between supply and demand defines our nation's energy crisis. As the chart illustrates, if energy production increases at the same rate as during the last decade our projected energy needs will far outstrip expected levels of production.</p>
        <p>This imbalance, if allowed to continue, will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our national security. But it is not beyond our power to correct. . . .</p>
        <p>The Challenge</p>
        <p>America's energy challenge begins with our expanding economy, growing population and rising standard of living. Our prosperity and way of life are sustained by energy use. America has the technological know-how and environmentally sound 21st-century technologies needed to meet the principal energy challenges we face: promoting energy conservation, repairing and modernizing our energy infrastructure and increasing our energy supplies in ways that protect and improve the environment. Meeting each of these challenges is critical to expanding our economy, meeting the needs of a growing population and raising the American standard of living.</p>
        <p>We are already working to meet the first challenge: using energy more wisely. Dramatic technological advances in energy efficiency have enabled us to make great strides in conservation, from the operation of farms and factories to the construction of buildings and automobiles. New technology allows us to go about our lives and work with less cost, less effort and less burden on the natural environment. While such advances cannot alone solve America's energy problems, they can and will continue to play an important role in our energy future.</p>
        <p>The second challenge is to repair and expand our energy infrastructure. Our current, outdated network of electric generators, transmission lines, pipelines and refineries that convert raw materials into usable fuel has been allowed to deteriorate. Oil pipelines and refining capacity are in need of repair and expansion. Not a single major oil refinery has been built in the United States in nearly a generation, causing the kind of bottlenecks that lead to sudden  spikes in the price of gasoline.</p>
        <p>Natural gas distribution, likewise, is hindered by an aging and inadequate network of pipelines. To match supply and demand will require some 38,000 miles of new gas pipelines, along with 255,000 miles of distribution lines. Similarly, an antiquated and inadequate transmission grid prevents us from routing electricity over long distances and thereby avoiding regional blackouts, such as California's.</p>
        <p>Increasing energy supplies while protecting the environment is the third challenge. Even with successful conservation efforts, America will need more energy.</p>
        <p>Renewable and alternative fuels offer hope for America's energy future. But they supply only a small fraction of present energy needs. The day they fulfill the bulk of our needs is still years away. Until that day comes, we must continue meeting the nation's energy requirements by the means available to us.</p>
        <p>Estimates indicate that over the next 20 years, U.S. oil consumption will increase by 33 percent, natural gas consumption by well over 50 percent and demand for electricity will rise by 45 percent. If America's energy production grows at the same rate as it did in the 1990's, we will face an ever-increasing gap.</p>
        <p>Increases on this scale will require preparation and action today. Yet America has not been bringing on line the necessary supplies and infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Extraordinary advances in technology have transformed energy exploration and production. Yet we produce 39 percent less oil today than we did in 1970, leaving us ever more reliant on foreign suppliers. On our present course, America 20 years from now will import nearly two of every three barrels of oil, a condition of increased dependency on foreign powers that do not always have America's interests at heart. Our increasing demand for natural gas, one of the cleanest forms of energy, far exceeds the current rate of production. We should reconsider any regulatory restrictions that do not take technological advances into account.</p>
        <p>We have a similar opportunity to increase our supplies of electricity. To meet projected demand over the next to decades, America must have in place between 1,300 and 1,900 new electric plants. Much of this new generation will be fueled by natural gas. However, existing and new technologies offer us the opportunity to expand nuclear generation as well. Nuclear power today accounts for 20 percent of our country's electricity. This power source, which causes no greenhouse gas emissions, can play an expanding part in our energy future. The recommendations of this report address the energy challenges facing America. Taken together, they offer the thorough and responsible energy plan our nation has long needed.</p>
        <p>Components</p>
        <p>The national energy policy we propose follows three basic principles:</p>
        <p>*The policy is a long-term, comprehensive strategy. Our energy crisis has been years in the making and will take years to put fully behind us.</p>
        <p>*The policy will advance new, environmentally friendly technologies to increase energy supplies and encourage cleaner, more efficient energy use.</p>
        <p>*The policy seeks to raise the living standards of the American people, recognizing that to do so our country must fully integrate its energy, environmental, and economic policies.</p>
        <p>Applying these principles, we urge action to meet five specific national goals. America must modernize conservation, modernize our energy infrastructure, increase energy supplies, accelerate the protection and improvement of the environment, and increase our nation's energy security.</p>
        <p>Modernize Conservation</p>
        <p>Americans share the goal of energy conservation. The best way of meeting this goal is to increase energy efficiency by applying new technology -- raising productivity, reducing waste and trimming costs. In addition, it holds out great hope for improving the quality of the environment. American families, communities and businesses all depend upon reliable and affordable energy services for their well being and safety. From transportation to communication, from air conditioning to lighting, energy is critical to nearly everything we do in life and work. Public policy can and should encourage energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Over the past three decades, America has made impressive gains in energy efficiency. Today's automobiles, for example, use about 60 percent of the gasoline they did in 1972, while new refrigerators require just one-third the electricity they did 30 years ago. As a result, since 1973, the U.S. economy has grown by 126 percent, while energy use has increased by only 30 percent. In the 1990's alone, manufacturing output expanded by 41 percent, while industrial electricity consumption grew by only 11 percent. We must build on this progress and strengthen America's commitment to energy efficiency and conservation. . . .</p>
        <p>Modernize Our Energy Infrastructure</p>
        <p>The energy we use passes through a vast nationwide network of generating facilities, transmission lines, pipelines and refineries that converts raw resources into usable fuel and power. That system is deteriorating, and is now strained to capacity.</p>
        <p>One reason for this is government regulation, often excessive and redundant. Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly burdensome. Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities, making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, price spikes and supply disruptions. America needs more environmentally sound energy projects to connect supply sources to growing markets and to deliver energy to homes and business.</p>
        <p>To reduce the incidence of electricity blackouts, we must greatly enhance our ability to transmit electric power between geographic regions, that is, sending power to where it is needed from where it is produced. . . .</p>
        <p>Increase Energy Supplies</p>
        <p>A primary goal of the national energy policy is to add supply from diverse sources. This means domestic oil, gas and coal. It also means hydropower and nuclear power. And it means making greater use of non-hydro renewable sources now available.</p>
        <p>One aspect of the present crisis is an increased dependence, not only on foreign oil, but on a narrow range of energy options. For example, about 90 percent of all new electricity plants currently under construction will be fueled by natural gas. While natural gas has many advantages, an over-reliance on any one fuel source leaves consumers vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions. There are several other fuel sources available that can help meet our needs.</p>
        <p>Currently, the U.S. has enough coal to last for another 250 years. Yet very few coal-powered electric plants are now under construction.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power plants serve millions of American homes and businesses, have a dependable record for safety and efficiency and discharge no greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. As noted earlier, these facilities currently generate 20 percent of all electricity in America, and more than 40 percent of electricity generated in 10 states in the Northeast, South and Midwest. Other nations, such as Japan and France, generate a much higher percentage of their  electricity from nuclear power. Yet the number of nuclear plants in America is actually projected to decline in coming years, as old plants close and none are built to replace them.</p>
