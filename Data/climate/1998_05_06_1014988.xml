        <p>Nothing is fueling the world's economy quite like its inhabitants' wanderlust.

        <p>So where is the world turning for guidance on how to handle the crush of visitors? To the Europeans, famed for their grand old hotel schools? Or to the Asians, renowned for their skill at pampering the road-weary? Guess again.

        <p>Nothing is fueling the world's economy quite like its inhabitants' wanderlust. Within the next decade, the global tourism industry is expected to triple in size, to almost two billion travelers spending $1.83 trillion a year, or $5 billion a day. All that growth could create as many as 100 million jobs.</p>
        <p>So where is the world turning for guidance on how to handle the crush of visitors? To the Europeans, famed for their grand old hotel schools? Or to the Asians, renowned for their skill at pampering the road-weary? Guess again. It is turning to those masters of nuts-and-bolts business management and McDonald's-style mass marketing -- Americans.</p>
        <p>Foreign students, many subsidized by governments desperate for more tourism dollars, are flocking to tourism schools across the United States. ''We have over 1,000 international students from more than 85 countries this year, 54 percent majoring in hospitality or tourism,'' said Ana Roche, director of the International Student Center at Johnson &amp; Wales University, which specializes in those trades. ''Both those figures are up 75 percent just since 1993.''</p>
        <p>Statistics on foreign students studying hospitality and tourism in this country do not exist, but the number is thought to be well in the thousands -- and climbing rapidly. Surges similar to that at Johnson &amp; Wales have been recorded in recent years at scores of other American institutions of learning, including George Washington University, Florida International, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, the University of Houston and Northern Arizona University.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-five years ago, about 20 schools in the U.S. had four-year programs for hotels, restaurants and tourism,'' said Lee Dickson, associate dean of the School of Hospitality Management at Florida International in North Miami, which attracts many students from the Caribbean and Latin America. ''Today,  at least 160 schools have them.''</p>
        <p>Aspiring hotel administrators, restaurant managers, casino executives, tour organizers, theme park directors, resort developers and candidates for all the other myriad positions opening up in the industry are streaming to the United States from every continent. And despite tourism's reputation as a source of mostly low-wage jobs, many are making great personal sacrifice for the chance to join the business.</p>
        <p>Bridget Mavuma, 26, for example, left her two young children in Botswana two years ago to earn degrees in travel and tourism management here. She misses her children every day, she said, but they are well taken care of by her husband, who was reluctant to trade the African warmth for Rhode Island winters, and by their extended African family. Furthermore, she is confident the sacrifice will pay off after she returns.</p>
        <p>''Before, when my country limited the number of tourists, we would study tourism in the U.K., because we're a protectorate of the British Isles,'' Ms. Mavuma said. ''But now, our Government wants more tourists, so they want us to study the U.S. educational system to learn how to do it.'' Those who do learn, she added, will have the inside track for the best new jobs that will become available.</p>
        <p>Andrea de Freitas, 31, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, was also eager to study in America, but did not want to leave behind her 7-year-old son -- so she brought him along to Johnson &amp; Wales. They live in an apartment in nearby Greenville, where the boy is enrolled in a public school, learning English and playing soccer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freitas is looking for part-time work while she attends college, but meantime is sanguine about the future. ''When I go back home with my degree, I'll be able to choose whom to work for,'' she said, adding that her sights are set on an international hotel under construction in Bahia in Northeast Brazil. It should be just about ready to open by the time she returns.</p>
        <p>The sudden popularity of American mentoring is largely a reflection of the United States' economic ascendancy in the 1990's. With the nation leading the way into the global economy, even as Japan stagnates and Europe struggles to unify its currencies, American management and marketing techniques are being imitated everywhere as the path to business success.</p>
        <p>''There are good, inexpensive schools in Europe,'' said Donald Hawkins, chairman of the department of tourism and hospitality management at George Washington University in Washington, ''but students coming to study in the U.S. want to learn about hospitality and tourism from the world leader.'' At George Washington, the biggest number of such students in recent years has come from China.</p>
        <p>John J. Bowen, the president of the main campus of Johnson &amp; Wales (which has branch campuses in Charleston, S.C.; North Miami; Norfolk, Va., and Vail, Colo.), says the difference between European and American educational priorities is stark. ''My European hotel school director friends say, 'We understand service; you understand management and profits,' '' Mr. Bowen said.</p>
        <p>And if it is a choice between knowing how to deliver good service or making a hefty profit, few tourism industry leaders-in-training hesitate. ''We were shocked when our international students told us that American hotel work experience is a more highly valued commodity than European experience,'' said Moira Oliver, director of human resources at the Hyatt Orlando hotel. Not only does the Hyatt Hotels Corporation hire hundreds of interns each year, its sister company, Hyatt International,  often sends fast-track employees to the United States for as much as a year, Ms. Oliver said, to acquire the experience necessary to advance through Hyatt International ranks.</p>
        <p>It isn't just a yen for American knowledge and skill that draws so many foreign students to these shores. The fact is, there just are not that many slots open anywhere else. Despite an unprecedented boom in the construction of hotels, resorts, entertainment parks and other tourist attractions worldwide, few foreign colleges have degree programs to teach the necessary management and financial skills to the people who will run them.</p>
        <p>For example, Switzerland's highly regarded Ecole Hoteliere de Lausanne, founded in 1893 and the world's oldest hotel school, did not offer a four-year university-level program until 1996.</p>
        <p>''We have schools in my country,'' said Nava Singam, a Malaysian who is studying for a master's degree at the School of Hotel and Restaurant Management at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. ''But they only offer a two-year diploma. That wouldn't take you beyond middle management with the international hotels, and I always had a vision to do better than that.''</p>
        <p>An American education can also be a short cut to a career with one of the giant American hotel chains or entertainment conglomerates that straddle the globe. In addition to Hyatt, American Express Travel Services, Inter-Continental Hotels, Universal Studios, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and assorted cruise lines have recently hired foreign graduates of American schools.</p>
        <p>''Experience is important,'' said Yap Che Che, an ebullient 20-year-old junior from Kuala Lumpur. ''But most of the international hotels in Malaysia are American, so it's important to learn American standards and the American system.''</p>
        <p>Going to school in the United States has the added bonus of familiarizing foreigners with American culture -- handy knowledge when they take up jobs with their government or their country's domestic tourism industry.</p>
        <p>''If these countries want to capture the American market, and they do,'' said Patti Shock, head of the tourism and convention department at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, ''they have to learn what Americans want and expect, as well as their idiosyncrasies.''</p>
        <p>The course work at most American schools centers on marketing, accounting and management. But it also covers such topics as the economics of tourism, managing meetings and conventions, food and beverage operations, travel agency procedures and administration of amusement parks and cruise ships.  Courses in tourism range from so-called eco-tourism (a discipline that covers everything from game parks in Africa to protecting local flora) to packaging the historic sites of a city or region in order to attract visitors -- preferably overnight visitors.</p>
        <p>''The hands-on approach is important,'' said Prof. K. S. Chon, who specializes in tourism and hospitality marketing at the University of Houston, ''but today you also have to learn marketing, accounting and managerial skills.''</p>
        <p>After a class in eco-tourism, which on this particular day focused on acid rain formation and ozone depletion, Helena Lofroth, 30, a senior from Skelleftea, Sweden, said, ''A lot of people talk about preserving the environment, but it's important for everybody involved in the tourist industry to understand the relationship between nature and tourism.''</p>
        <p>The economic potential is enormous. Every year, the number of travelers grows by the tens of millions. Yet, some parts of the world have barely begun to build the infrastructure to receive them.</p>
        <p>Last year, for example, the entire African continent counted a paltry 23 million visitors who spent $8.7 billion -- compared with 30 million visitors who poured $9.9 billion into Las Vegas alone.</p>
        <p>Even wealthy industrialized countries see opportunities to expand. While tourism already accounts for some 200,000 full-  or part-time jobs in Sweden, which has a population of 8.9 million, the Government is investing in small tourist businesses in the hopes of creating more jobs. Margareta Winberg, the Swedish Labor Minister, said the Government is counting heavily on tourism to meet its goal of reducing unemployment to 4 percent by 2000 from 6.7 percent today.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the second-biggest foreign contingent studying hospitality and tourism at Johnson &amp; Wales (trailing only the 106 students from Thailand) are the 96 students from Sweden, many of whom studied tourism at home before deciding they needed a degree from the United States.</p>
        <p>The American economy, too, gets an enormous boost from the travel-and-tourism industry, which accounts for 15.8 million jobs, or one of every 17 working Americans, according to the Travel Industry Association of America.</p>
        <p>If a meeting of hotel school directors from some 30 countries here three years ago was any indication, the Europeans and Asians can learn something about responsive service, too.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Bowen, the school's president, the coffee served at the receptions on the first day of the conference tasted weak to most foreign delegates, who were used to the potent concoctions served back home. The next day, after Johnson &amp; Wales doubled the amount of coffee used in brewing, conference participants were astonished.</p>
        <p>''Several of them told me if that happened in their country,'' Mr. Bowen said, ''it would have taken a week to change things.''</p>
