        <p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper's new Conservative government on Tuesday announced nearly $20 billion in tax cuts over two years, reflecting a federal budget surplus that is bulging along with a growing economy.</p>
        <p>The government presented its first budget as the Canadian dollar surpassed a value of 90 American cents for the first time since 1978. The dollar's rise was a result of the new economic muscle that comes with increasing world prices for Canadian oil, gold and other commodities.</p>
        <p>The prosperity is bringing a windfall to the federal government, producing a budget surplus estimated at nearly $8 billion this year.</p>
        <p>That has helped Mr. Harper cut the national sales tax to 6 percent, from 7 percent; reduce the general corporate tax rate to 19 percent, from 21 percent; and cut income taxes for most people.</p>
        <p>''Taxes will go down for all Canadians,'' the finance minister, Jim Flaherty, told the House of Commons when announcing the budget. ''Canadians pay too much tax. It's holding families back.''</p>
        <p>The budget fulfills many promises made in the recent election campaign, in which Mr. Harper defeated Prime Minister Paul Martin, a Liberal, and squeaked into power with shaky control in the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>The budget is considered a curtain-raiser for the next campaign, as the new government is expected to survive only a year or two.</p>
        <p>Conservatives hope the tax cuts will help win them a majority government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flaherty said the government planned to reduce the national debt and trim spending, but he also announced new spending to help stay-at-home parents, strengthen border security and build housing in the Arctic. The budget will allow the hiring of 1,000 more officers for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and expand the national DNA databank.</p>
        <p>Parents will receive almost $1,200 annually for every child under 6, beginning in July, and the government will spend $250 million to add 50,000 spaces for day care. Commuters will receive tax credits for using mass transit. To encourage fitness, families will get credits for fees spent on registration fees for sports teams.</p>
        <p>The Liberal Party proposes a much more sweeping child-care program, and it has said its lawmakers will vote against the budget. ''It's far too ideological and not practical for Canadians,'' Bill Graham, leader of the Liberal Party, said of the budget.</p>
        <p>The Conservatives have a minority of seats in the House of Commons, and their government could fall if the three opposition parties voted against the budget.</p>
        <p>But the separatist Bloc Québécois is expected to vote in favor because its popularity has fallen in recent months and it does not want another election anytime soon.</p>
        <p>The government is planning cuts of about $1 billion from programs to control climate change over the next five years, as Mr. Flaherty promised a ''made in Canada'' solution for reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>But over all many economists said the budget would stimulate the economy, although it might heat up what is now a modest inflation rate.</p>
