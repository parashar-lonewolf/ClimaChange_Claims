        <p>AS a fuel cell housed in a metal box about the size of a small S.U.V. hummed quietly in the parking lot of the Babylon Town Hall with puffs of steam floating out of its exhaust pipe, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, Richard Kessel, announced early this month that the utility was seeking a company to build and operate a 10-megawatt fuel cell that would provide enough energy to power 10,000 homes.</p>
        <p>''This will be the first project of its kind in America,'' Mr. Kessel said of the plan to feed fuel cell energy directly to the power grid. ''We're taking fuel cells to a new level.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cells are ''clean'' energy generators that convert hydrogen to electricity by a chemical process, requiring no combustion. The exhaust is water, heat and some carbon dioxide. Currently, most fuel cells extract the hydrogen from natural gas.</p>
        <p>The proposed plant, to be situated at a substation in West Babylon, is to replace a ''farm'' of 75 smaller fuel cells now being tested there. LIPA does not expect homeowner electricity rates to increase as a result of the new project, Mr. Kessel said, even though fuel cells generate electricity at a higher cost than combustion generators.</p>
        <p>Three days after the announcement, in the quiet living room of a house in West Islip, Sister Gertrude O'Brien flipped a switch on the reading lamp over her easy chair. The lamp, one of several appliances in the house powered by the fuel cell sitting in the middle of the backyard, dutifully lighted the room. ''I think it's kind of ugly,'' Sister Gertrude said of the bulky fuel cell out back, ''but I would say that the benefits greatly outweigh the aesthetics.''</p>
        <p>Those benefits were visible on a day in December when a car hit a utility pole nearby. The whole neighborhood lost power, but Sister Gertrude and the two other nuns who live in the house could turn on their lights and watch television.</p>
        <p>Next door, when the Rev. Douglas Dower returned to his home that same night, he noticed all the homes on his block were dark. When he got inside, he checked his appliances.</p>
        <p>''When I opened the refrigerator door, the light went on and everything inside was still cold,'' Father Dower said.</p>
        <p>The fuel cell in his yard, hooked up through conduits and pipes in the cellar to provide heat, light and power to essential appliances in his home, did not need the LIPA grid.</p>
        <p>Sister Gertrude and Father Doug, as they are called at Good Samaritan Hospital where they both work, live in hospital-owned homes that are two of several fuel cell test sites across the Island. Others include buildings at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a McDonald's restaurant and the Babylon Town Hall.</p>
        <p>Baron Davis, who lives with his wife and two young sons in a home they rent in Mineola, first came to live on Long Island from Anchorage, Alaska, in August 2003, landing at Newark Liberty International Airport only 20 minutes after a widespread blackout had knocked out power to most of the East Coast.</p>
        <p>With nowhere else to go, Mr. Davis rented a car and drove with his sons to the Mineola home where the family had just moved. ''It was a nightmare, I couldn't even see road signs,'' Mr. Davis said of that harrowing six-hour drive.</p>
        <p>But he is feeling more secure these days. Since early January, Mr. Davis's home has been one of seven in Mineola, owned by Winthrop Hospital, that are powered and heated partly by a fuel cell.</p>
        <p>''They basically created a ditch and connected pipes over a week,'' he said of the installation by Plug Power Inc., the Albany-based company that manufactured the fuel cells for the tests. ''It really didn't create any problems.''</p>
        <p>The fuel cell power has been more reliable so far. Before the fuel cell was hooked up, the lights in the house would flicker every day, he said, and he often had to reboot his computer.</p>
        <p>''Ever since they've had this on, I haven't seen any glitches,'' Mr. Davis, an unemployed electrical engineer, said of the fuel cell. ''No lights flickering on and off anymore.''</p>
        <p>But fuel cells like those used in Long Island homes are too expensive, about $75,000, and require servicing too often to be a viable residential alternative right now, according to Roger Saillant, president and chief executive of Plug Power. The main function of the tests is to improve the technology.</p>
        <p>''You can compare it to the combustion engine in a car -- billions have been built, there's an opportunity to learn from each one of them,'' Mr. Saillant said. ''Of all the fuel cells in all the world, there's probably not 2,000 of them.''</p>
        <p>The LIPA plan to use fuel cells to supply the grid is part of an effort to generate 25 percent of the utility's energy using renewable sources by 2014, a goal set by the New York State Public Service Commission last year, Mr. Kessel said.</p>
        <p>The utility has also already contracted with Florida Power and Light to build a windmill farm -- 40 to 50 windmill turbines -- about six miles from the Island's south shore, near Robert Moses State Park, providing 140 megawatts of power to the grid. Long Island's power demands averaged about 2,989 megawatts per hour in 2004 during peak hours.</p>
        <p>But while windmills create electricity from ocean winds, the fuel cells used for LIPA's project will use a fossil fuel to operate: natural gas. The public service commission includes fuel cells in its policy, a commission spokesman, David Flanagan, said, to spur on the development of cells that will one day run on renewable resources like methane or electrical current.</p>
        <p>Gordian Raacke, head of the environmental group Renewable Energy Long Island, discussed the future of fuel cells at the Babylon Town Hall news conference, where he praised LIPA's newest energy project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raacke powers his East End home with solar panels. Under a LIPA plan that allows homeowners using solar energy to ''run their meters backward,'' Mr. Raacke feeds electricity back to the grid and gets credits on his electric bill instead of charges. ''I don't pay anything for electricity,'' he said. ''When the day is overcast and I need energy, I use the credits.''</p>
        <p>The fuel cell of the future, Mr. Raacke believes, will be able to extract and store hydrogen from solar- and wind-generated energy, so if he had one in his house, he would not need to tap the grid on a cloudy day. ''Fuel cell technology provides an important link in the alternative energy chain,'' he said. ''It closes the loop.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saillant of Plug Power said it is indeed possible for fuel cells to store hydrogen gas taken from a mixture of water and the electrical current generated by wind turbines and solar panels. Ideally, the stored gas would be used on a calm or overcast day to continue powering and heating the home.</p>
        <p>But he estimates that fuel cells not requiring natural gas are, under the best federal-financing conditions, at least 15 years away.</p>
        <p>More recently in Mineola, Mr. Davis is happy with the first month of fuel cell power in his home. ''Having experienced a major outage, I can really appreciate this,'' he said.</p>
