        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The ink is barely dry on the Kyoto protocol, but Michael J. Sandel argues that the agreement's emissions trading provisions, supported by the Clinton Administration, will foster ''immoral'' behavior (Op-Ed, Dec. 15).</p>
        <p>Was it immoral when the United States used a tradable permit system among refineries to phase leaded gasoline out of the market in the 1980's more rapidly than anyone had anticipated and at a savings of $250 million a year?</p>

        <p>Was it immoral when the United States used a tradable permit system among refineries to phase leaded gasoline out of the market in the 1980's more rapidly than anyone had anticipated and at a savings of $250 million a year?</p>
        <p>Is it now immoral that we are reducing acid rain by half through a tradable permit system among electrical utilities, reducing emissions (sulfur dioxide) faster than anyone had predicted and saving up to $1 billion a year for electricity consumers? Is that why the Environmental Defense Fund and others have worked so tirelessly and effectively to implement these emissions-trading programs?</p>
