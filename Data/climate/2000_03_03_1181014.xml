        <p>This advertisement lends a bit of mystery to the presidential campaign. The mystery is the advertisement's sponsor, Republicans for Clean Air, a group unknown to political professionals and the Federal Elections Commission. The Bush campaign says it knows nothing about the group. Advertising time was bought by the Multi Media Services Corporation, an  advertising firm that worked on the campaign for a 1996 environmental referendum pushed by Gov. George E. Pataki, the chairman of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign in New York. The group lists an address that is a post office box in Virginia belonging to Lydia Meuret, a consultant who runs a political action committee headed by Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas, a Bush ally. Ms. Meuret said there was no connection between Republicans for Clean Air and Mr. Bonilla or his political action committee, other than that she was a consultant to both, and she refused to say any more about who paid for the advertisements. The advertisement praises Mr. Bush's environmental record, while criticizing Senator John McCain's; environmental groups like the Sierra Club say neither man has a good record, though Mr. McCain's might be marginally better.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. McCain's face is superimposed against a backdrop of smokestacks belching dark clouds.</p>

        <p>This advertisement lends a bit of mystery to the presidential campaign. The mystery is the advertisement's sponsor, Republicans for Clean Air, a group unknown to political professionals and the Federal Elections Commission. The Bush campaign says it knows nothing about the group. Advertising time was bought by the Multi Media Services Corporation, an  advertising firm that worked on the campaign for a 1996 environmental referendum pushed by Gov. George E. Pataki, the chairman of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign in New York. The group lists an address that is a post office box in Virginia belonging to Lydia Meuret, a consultant who runs a political action committee headed by Representative Henry Bonilla of Texas, a Bush ally. Ms. Meuret said there was no connection between Republicans for Clean Air and Mr. Bonilla or his political action committee, other than that she was a consultant to both, and she refused to say any more about who paid for the advertisements. The advertisement praises Mr. Bush's environmental record, while criticizing Senator John McCain's; environmental groups like the Sierra Club say neither man has a good record, though Mr. McCain's might be marginally better.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. McCain's face is superimposed against a backdrop of smokestacks belching dark clouds.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Last year, John McCain voted against solar and renewable energy. That means more use of coal-burning plants that pollute our air. New York Republicans care about clear air. So does Governor Bush. He led one of the first states in America to clamp down on old coal-burning electric power plants. Bush clean air laws will reduce air pollution more than a quarter million tons a year. That's like taking five million cars off the road. Governor Bush: Leading so each day dawns brighter.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- There are flaws in every claim. The clampdown on coal-burning plants that the advertisement cites was, in fact, a voluntary program in Texas for which relatively few companies signed up, and with which even fewer complied, and exempted many of the dirtiest plants, environmentalists and Texas newspapers say. Environmental groups, which say the pollution reduction claim is overstated, give Governor Bush poor marks on clean air issues. Mr. McCain did vote against solar and renewable energy spending programs; he has also voted for them. The vote mentioned in the advertisement was one of many that he has cast against spending bills to object to the way they were approved, rather than their content.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This advertisement is intended to appeal to New York's moderate, pro-conservation Republican voters, as the Bush campaign tries to portray Mr. McCain as being too far to the right. That is a switch from previous primaries, when Mr. Bush called the senator too liberal for the party. But with the outcry from environmentalists who say the advertisement is inaccurate, it is unclear how effective it will be.</p>
