        <p>LEAD: ON a wind-swept point of black lava jutting into the Pacific Ocean, a small band of scientists and entrepreneurs is generating electricity, raising lobsters and growing strawberries using cold water from the depths of the sea.</p>
        <p>ON a wind-swept point of black lava jutting into the Pacific Ocean, a small band of scientists and entrepreneurs is generating electricity, raising lobsters and growing strawberries using cold water from the depths of the sea.</p>
        <p>Eventually, they say they hope the techniques they are devising here may increase food supplies and produce energy without pollution and without the use of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>For now, however, ''cold water is the resource we're selling,'' said Thomas H. Daniel, technical director of the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii, where the projects are under way.</p>
        <p>That water, pumped from a depth of 2,000 feet, comes up at a nearly constant temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, or 43 degrees Fahrenheit. It has a high concentration of nutrients like nitrates, phosphates and silicates that foster the growth of plants and algae. And it is pure, having been out of contact with the surface for centuries as it drifted slowly along the bottom, and thus is free of the pathogens that carry diseases.</p>
        <p>When the laboratory began the project about 10 years ago, scientists here were confident it would be possible to put the water to profitable use. While profits have so far been elusive, the researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of several ideas, solved formidable engineering problems and produced a wealth of data.</p>
        <p>Promise of Growing Lobsters</p>
        <p>The lab, which operates on a budget of $1.5 million a year and has a staff of 20, began by seeking to use the differences in temperature between surface and deep sea water to produce electricity in a process called ocean thermal energy conversion.</p>
        <p>But it is the other projects developed on this 322-acre site that seem more promising today: growing lobsters in half the time it takes in their natural habitat along the coast of Maine; raising flounder, sea urchins and salmon; distilling fresh water and cooling buildings and industrial plants.</p>
        <p>Next to the energy lab is the Hawaii Ocean Science and Technology park, a 547-acre site set aside by the state for commercial development of the laboratory's findings. Once a project developed at the lab becomes profitable, it must move out, either to the park or elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Aquaculture Enterprises has already moved to the park. The company has been experimenting since 1987 with lobsters and has begun test sales locally. The lobsters are raised in shallow tanks under green tents that block the heat of the sun. They are kept in separate pans so they will not eat each other.</p>
        <p>Joseph Wilson, a partner in the enterprise, said that by mixing cold and warm sea water to maintain a steady temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, researchers have eliminated the near-hibernation of the lobsters in winter. That has cut growing time to less than four years from the seven and a half years it takes in nature. As they learn more about the lobsters' environment, nutrition and genetics, he said, ''we think that could be cut again to 30 months.''</p>
        <p>Purity of Water Is Important</p>
        <p>But even more than the temperature, he said, the purity of the water was essential to raising the lobsters. Other aquaculture efforts have been plagued by diseases carried in surface waters.</p>
        <p>He said his company planned to cover 20 acres with the shallow tanks through which the sea water flows constantly. ''We have to produce 500,000 pounds a year to have a viable unit,'' he said. The North American market for lobster is 140 million pounds a year.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Gerald R. Cysewski, the scientific director for the Cyanotech Corporation, pointed to raceways in which paddles like small versions of those on Mississippi riverboats kept a green slime moving slowly. The algae, rich in protein and vitamins, are sold for pharmaceuticals and health food, like spirulina. For his operation, which was open to the sun, the temperature of the water made little difference. ''For us,'' he said, ''it's the purity and the nutrients.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cysewski said the company produced 8,000 kilos of spirulina a month and sold it for $17 a kilo. He said the company was also moving into production of beta carotene from the algae, a precursor to vitamin A that may help to prevent cancer.</p>
        <p>Ocean Farms of Hawaii is raising hundreds of salmon in its 21 acres of tanks along with abalone that feed on the kelp growing from the bottom. Royal Hawaiian Sea Farms is growing ''nori,'' the spinach of the sea used to wrap sushi rolls. A Japanese company, Uwajima Fisheries is raising hirame, a flounder popular in sushi restaurants.</p>
        <p>In early May, Hawaii Seafood Growers Inc. announced it would start a pilot operation to grow mahi-mahi, a favorite fish in Hawaii. Thomas J. Vincent, the company's chief executive, said the fish farm could produce 1.5 million pounds a year, or a third of annual consumption here.</p>
        <p>Growing Plants That Like the Cool</p>
        <p>But the cold water also finds uses on land. Run through pipes the energy laboratory has laid in strawberry, lettuce and flower beds, the cold water keeps the plants at the cool temperature they like and causes fresh water to condense on the pipes. The fresh water drips from the pipes to water the plants.</p>
        <p>''When we want the strawberries to think it's winter,'' Mr. Daniel said, standing under a tropical sun, ''we just run the cold water faster.'' Strawberries with five times more sugar than those in nature have been produced.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the laboratory, John P. Craven, said cold sea water could have an economic future in air-conditioning and industrial cooling.</p>
        <p>Several buildings at the energy laboratory at Keahole circulate cold sea water through their air-conditioning systems. The systems must be carefully maintained so that they are not corroded. Even so, electrical costs for the buildings have been cut by about 75 percent, Mr. Daniel said.</p>
        <p>So far, the energy laboratory and the commercial park have not drawn protests from environmentalists who have demonstrated against an experiment on the other side of the island, where scientists are trying to tap a volcano for its heat to produce power. The reason, Mr. Craven and Mr. Daniel said, is that the lab and the enterprises change the sea water little before returning it to the ocean.</p>
        <p>An Idea a Century Old</p>
        <p>The idea of generating electricity from differences in sea water temperatures is the energy laboratory's main goal. A French engineer, Jacques-Arsene d'Arsonval, first proposed the idea in 1881. His student, Georges Claude, built a pilot plant on the north shore of Cuba in 1930.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the oil crisis of the mid-1970's set off a search for new forms of energy. The natural energy lab was set up here in 1974 as a joint venture of the State of Hawaii, the University of Hawaii and the Federal Department of Energy. Japanese researchers and engineers have also developed the technology.</p>
        <p>The ocean thermal energy conversion process, which the laboratory is using to generate electricity, can be accomplished either with closed or open cycles. In a closed cycle, warm sea water is pumped in from about 40 feet beneath the surface, where it is between 25 and 28 degrees Celsius, or 77 to 83 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
        <p>It is pumped through a heat exchanger containing a fluid like ammonia which vaporizes at low temperature. The vapor expands to drive a turbine that, in turn, drives an electrical generator. The fluid passes through a second heat exchanger in which it is cooled and condensed by cold sea water. Then it is recycled back into the first heat exchanger.</p>
        <p>Payoff From Bigger Pipeline</p>
        <p>In an open cycle, warm sea water is pumped into an evaporator in which the pressure has been lowered to make the water boil. In this case, the water vaporizes to drive the turbine and generator. But when the vapor is condensed, in a condenser cooled by cold sea water, fresh water is siphoned off.</p>
        <p>Electricity from the more efficient closed-cycle plants, according to Mr. Daniel, would cost up to 14 cents a kilowatt hour, as against 5.6 cents for electricity generated by burning oil at $20 a barrel.</p>
        <p>The laboratory has nine pipelines from 12 inches to 40 inches wide, which can bring up 25,000 gallons of cold sea water a minute. But so far, it has taken more power to pump up sea water than the ensuing process has been able to generate. The laboratory is planning to experiment with a pipe that is eight feet wide to pump up enough cold sea water to produce a net gain in electric power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniel and Mr. Craven said a breakthrough on heat exchangers, however, may lower the cost. Researchers from the Aluminum Company of Canada and General Electric Company of Britain, have found that heat exchangers can be made for 20 percent the cost now by using aluminum instead of titanium. The exchangers account for about one-third the cost of the plant.</p>
        <p>Patrick K. Takahashi, director of the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, a separate research organization at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, said that a combination of power generation and food production might eventually be economical.</p>
        <p>''This might be competitive as a package in certain places, such as the Pacific islands, where fossil fuels are expensive,'' he said.</p>
