        <p>Alissa Arshalous Chackerian, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Charles Chackerian Jr. of Los Altos, Calif., is to be married today to Rodrigo Storari Philander, the son of Dr. and Mrs. S. George Philander of Princeton, N.J. The Rev. C. George Fitzgerald, a Presbyterian minister, is to perform the ceremony at Stanford University's Memorial Church.</p>
        <p>The bride, 28, will keep her name. She is a doctoral candidate in immunology at Harvard, in Boston, where she is researching tuberculosis. She graduated from Stanford, as did the bridegroom. Her father, a molecular spectroscopist, retired from the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., and is now conducting research there for the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence Institute, analyzing atmospheric gases on other planets for signs of life.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 30, designs and markets databases and Internet business software in Boston. His mother, Hilda Storari Philander, is a research engineer at Titan Systems Corporation, a military contractor in Princeton that conducts research and develops defense systems. His father is a professor of oceanography at Princeton, and is the director of the school's graduate program in atmospheric and oceanic sciences. Dr. Philander is also the author of ''Is the Temperature Rising? The Uncertain Science of Global Warming'' (Princeton University Press, 1998).</p>
        <p>The couple met in 1995 when both were members of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, an amateur performing group made up of students and other members of the university community. Mr. Philander was the orchestra manager and a first violinist.</p>
        <p>''I just knew him as the guy who set the chairs up before rehearsal,'' Ms. Chackerian said.</p>
        <p>All that changed when Ms. Chackerian was promoted from the second violin section to the first, where Mr. Philander sat. A romance developed, and their shared love of classical music soon became simply a shared love.</p>
