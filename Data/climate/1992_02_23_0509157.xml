        <p>THE composer contemplated the coming performance of his music an event that for most living composers is as rare as, say, a snowstorm during global warming. The work was quite listenable, not at all avant-garde, he said reassuringly. Even the most musically conservative of Reform Jews should feel a nostalgic twinge, he said, as they listen to his "Sabbath Eve Service," to be presented Friday evening during regular services here at the Westchester Reform Temple.</p>
        <p>Lionel Semiatin, at 74 still penning string quartets and other compositions at his White Plains home, said he looked forward to hearing his "Sabbath Eve Service," especially because the work for organ and voice had been performed only a few times since its completion in 1960.</p>

        <p>THE composer contemplated the coming performance of his music an event that for most living composers is as rare as, say, a snowstorm during global warming. The work was quite listenable, not at all avant-garde, he said reassuringly. Even the most musically conservative of Reform Jews should feel a nostalgic twinge, he said, as they listen to his "Sabbath Eve Service," to be presented Friday evening during regular services here at the Westchester Reform Temple.</p>
        <p>Lionel Semiatin, at 74 still penning string quartets and other compositions at his White Plains home, said he looked forward to hearing his "Sabbath Eve Service," especially because the work for organ and voice had been performed only a few times since its completion in 1960.</p>
        <p>The composer can thank Cantor Stephen Merkel of the Westchester Reform Temple for the occasion. Mr. Merkel, a baritone with a parallel career as a concert singer, said he wanted to "raise the Jewish consciousness" by presenting a different kind of worship service to his congregation.</p>
        <p>The plan may raise eyebrows among traditionalists, but Mr. Merkel, who spent some student days at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, is committed to keeping the Jewish musical tradition alive. "Because congregations get very comfortable," he said, the question is "Where does a legitimate composer fit into mainstream Jewish life?"</p>
        <p>"Not only do we have congregants who go to the Philharmonic," he added, "they support it. But they have a different mind set when they come to temple." The Son of an Orthodox Cantor</p>
        <p>Cantor Merkel named some composers whose liturgical music had been embraced by their Jewish contemporaries: Salamone Rossi in the 16th century, Salomon Sulzer and Leon Leopold Lewandowski in the 19th century and a few others.</p>
        <p>There had been "peaks and valleys and long stretches" during which people held tightly to the melodies and rhythms they knew and loved, he said. Mr. Semiatin, himself the son of an Orthodox cantor, said that his own body of work was largely nonreligious, consisting mainly of chamber music.</p>
        <p>"Sabbath Eve Service" was commissioned in 1959 by Cantor Raymond Smolover of the Jewish Community Center in White Plains, who "got after me and wouldn't take no for an answer," Mr. Semiatin said.</p>
        <p>At the time, the composer was serving as executive director of Temple Israel Center in White Plains, a position he held from 1953 until his retirement in 1982. He wrote the service while spending 60 to 80 hours a week at nonmusical tasks, Mr. Semiatin said, including helping his wife, Edith, raise the couple's four children, who then were all younger than 10.  First, Bread on the Table</p>
        <p>Composing has always come after putting bread on the table, Mr. Semiatin said, adding that "no one makes a living writing serious music." Mr. Semiatin was born in Dublin and came to the United States as a child with his family. He began composing music at the age of 12, somewhat awed by the example of his father, whom he called "a professional first-class choir director."</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Semiatin has studied composition all his life -- teaching himself harmony and counterpoint and poring over the scores of the great composers (especially Haydn) -- he has had no formal musical training except the piano lessons he received as a child from his sister.</p>
        <p>The composer has won first prizes for his liturgical works in competitions sponsored by the National Foundation for Jewish Culture in Manhattan and the Jewish Music Commission of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Later this year, the Mount Vernon Chamber Orchestra of Alexandria, Va., will perform another of Mr. Semiatin's works, "A Sweet Suite for My Grandchildren to Remember Me By." He called the piece "real modern-sounding Americana."  Ambivalent About the Organ</p>
        <p>Congregants on Friday will hear a more intricate organ line than usual in Sabbath services, played by a guest organist, Justin Bischof. Mollie Nichols, the temple's regular organist, will conduct an ensemble composed of four singers and Mr. Merkel as soloist.</p>
        <p>Some Jews are ambivalent about the organ, Mr. Merkel said, because they think "it sounds as if it belongs in a church." But, he added, the organ is part of the Reform movement and provides "a space for Jews to feel comfortable in the Western world."</p>
        <p>Integrating the organ into the service makes common sense as well as musical sense, the cantor said. "The organ buzzing and making funny sounds in the background doesn't mean anything -- it's the Muzak of all Muzaks," he said.</p>
        <p>The public is invited to attend Friday's service, which begins at 8:30 P.M. at the Westchester Reform Temple at 255 Mamaroneck Road here. Mr. Semiatin will be on hand to introduce the service. For more information, call the temple at 723-7727.</p>
