        <p>A new museum of science and technology in Amsterdam, Newmetropolis, offers visitors computer games and hands-on experiments that explore energy and science. For example, visitors can use laboratory equipment to measure water and carbon dioxide in their breath, or study clues and evidence in the ''Crime Lab.'' Staff members are available to provide explanations and demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Designed as a large plaza, Newmetropolis opened in June on Amsterdam's waterfront. Sitting atop the IJ Tunnel leading into the city, it appears to rise from the harbor like the bow of a ship. The building's roof is  easily accessible and provides panoramic views of the city's center.</p>
