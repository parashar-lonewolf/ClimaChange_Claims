        <p>E.P.A. to Issue Rules To Curb Diesel Pollution  The E.P.A. plans to announce new pollution-control rules that will cut truck and bus emissions drastically, in part through a 97 percent reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel over the next 10 years.

        <p>Mrs. Clinton Is Nominated, To Face Unknown Opponent  The New York State Democratic Party nominated Hillary Rodham Clinton as its candidate for senator. In her acceptance speech, in Albany, she portrayed the campaign as a contest between political philosophies, an attack not on any candidate but on Republican policies that aides said would stand whether her opponent ended up being Mayor Giuliani or some other Republican.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani met with doctors about his prostate cancer and gave no indication of his political plans.</p>

        <p>Interest Rates Increased  The Federal Reserve adopted a more aggressive approach to fighting inflation, pushing short-term interest rates up by half a percentage point to try to slow the headlong pace of economic growth. The Fed also signaled that there might well be more rises to come.</p>

        <p>Consumers will quickly begin to feel the pinch as borrowing -- from home equity loans to car and truck financing to credit cards -- becomes more expensive. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages, however, have already climbed and may even retreat some from their current level of about 8.5 percent, specialists said.</p>
