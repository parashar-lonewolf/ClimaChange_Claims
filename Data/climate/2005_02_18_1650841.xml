        <p>President Bush declared Thursday that Syria was ''out of step'' with democratic trends in the Middle East and that the Syrian government needed to cut off support for Iraqi insurgents and stop interfering in Lebanon to avoid becoming further isolated internationally.</p>
        <p>''We've recalled our ambassador, which indicates that the relationship is not moving forward, that Syria is out of step with the progress being made in the greater Middle East, that democracy is on the move, and this is a country that isn't moving with the democratic movement,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference.</p>

        <p>President Bush declared Thursday that Syria was ''out of step'' with democratic trends in the Middle East and that the Syrian government needed to cut off support for Iraqi insurgents and stop interfering in Lebanon to avoid becoming further isolated internationally.</p>
        <p>''We've recalled our ambassador, which indicates that the relationship is not moving forward, that Syria is out of step with the progress being made in the greater Middle East, that democracy is on the move, and this is a country that isn't moving with the democratic movement,'' Mr. Bush said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the administration announced the recall of the ambassador, Margaret Scobey, to express American displeasure after the assassination on Monday of Rafik Hariri, a former Lebanese prime minister who was a close ally of the United States and France and also a critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon.</p>
        <p>While listing grievances with Syria on Thursday, Mr. Bush stopped short of linking the country directly to the assassination. Asked if Syria bore responsibility for the assassination, he responded: ''Well, I can't tell you that. I don't know yet because the investigation is ongoing.''</p>
        <p>On other matters, Mr. Bush said that he would use his trip to Europe next week to try to find common cause with Europeans on several fronts, particularly the efforts to encourage democracy in the Arab world and promote peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also suggested that the United States bore some blame for a breakdown in communication with Europe after disagreements two years ago over the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Those differences at time, frankly, caused us to talk past each other, and I recognize that,'' he said. ''And I want to make sure the Europeans understand I know that, and that as we move beyond the differences of the past, that we can work a lot together to achieve big objectives.''</p>
        <p>He said he looked forward to working with Europeans on programs to ease hunger and disease and on curbing global warming through technology and by finding sources of clean energy. Mr. Bush also said Europeans and others did not need to worry that American warnings about Iran's and North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons activities would be followed by military action, as happened with Iraq in 2002 and 2003.</p>
        <p>''Iran is different from Iraq -- very different,'' he said, adding that Iraq had spurned 16 United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that it disclose and dismantle its weapons programs. By contrast, ''the Iranian issue hasn't even gone to the Security Council yet.''</p>
        <p>On North Korea, as on Iran, he said the United States would work with its allies for a diplomatic resolution. On Syria, Mr. Bush did not suggest further actions the United States might take to punish Damascus.</p>
        <p>The administration has repeatedly complained that Syria has allowed the use of its territory in support of the Iraq insurgency and for terrorism generally, and has interfered in Lebanon's internal affairs, most concretely through the 14,000 Syrian troops that have been in Lebanon since the beginning of the Lebanese civil war in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Syria has denied having consciously allowed its territory to be used by the insurgents and has told others that of the suspects whose names it has been given for arrest, some were not in Syria and others had nothing to do with the Iraqi insurgency.</p>
        <p>Until recently, some administration officials have been saying that conversations with Syria had been somewhat productive. But a State Department official said that Syria had recently been given a list of 34 people whom the United States wanted questioned, and that Syria produced only one.</p>
