        <p>LEAD: The dark pall of smoke hovering above giant forest fires recently in the West has yielded a scientific bonanza for researchers studying whether nuclear warfare would plunge the earth into a freezing ''nuclear winter.''</p>
        <p>The dark pall of smoke hovering above giant forest fires recently in the West has yielded a scientific bonanza for researchers studying whether nuclear warfare would plunge the earth into a freezing ''nuclear winter.''</p>
        <p>''The conditions that existed in southern Oregon and Northern California were as close as one is likely to see to conditions one might expect after the use of nuclear weapons,'' said Bernard Zak, atmospheric program coordinator at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.</p>
        <p>The fires yielded ''at least 10 times as much data'' as the controlled brushfire last year in the San Dimas Experimental Forest northeast of Los Angeles, said Mr. Zak, a physicist whose work is financed by the Defense Nuclear Agency. Smoke on Regional Scale</p>
        <p>''Fire and smoke began to approach the regional scale we expect to see after a nuclear war, although certainly they didn't come anywhere close to the global scale,'' said Richard Turco, a Marina del Rey atmospheric scientist.</p>
        <p>He helped develop the theory that smoke from cities bombed in even a limited nuclear exchange would block sunlight long enough to lower temperatures sharply in the Northern Hemisphere, possibly wiping out crops and causing mass starvation.</p>
        <p>Scientists said information gathered from the fires, not yet analyzed, would be used to help determine if the nuclear winter hypothesis was correct.</p>
        <p>''We haven't found anything that's tending to knock the props out from under it,'' said Lawrence Radke, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Washington.</p>
        <p>The fires, still smoldering 1 1/2 months after being ignited by lightning strikes in late August, engulfed 772,500 acres in Northern California and 135,281 acres in southern Oregon, the U.S. Forest Service said.</p>
        <p>As smoke dimmed daylight to twilight throughout the region, scientists conducted two key experiments. Sandia's Twin Otter aircraft sampled cumulus clouds that formed above large smoke plumes, while the University of Washington's C-131 research plane chased a huge smoke plume 400 miles over the Pacific Ocean. Tracking a Smoke Cloud</p>
        <p>''No one's ever tracked a smoke cloud that far before,'' Mr. Turco said, adding the chase let scientists get information on how long smoke particles take to clump into larger particles and how fast they fall.</p>
        <p>''People who are pooh-poohing nuclear winter are saying the smoke particles are going to get large enough that they'll fall out,'' said Mr. Westphal, who works under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Early findings suggest ''the nuclear winter hypothesis is actually looking pretty robust,'' Mr. Radke said.</p>
        <p>Scientists also studied how much sunlight and reflected heat was absorbed and how much was scattered by smoke particles, key questions in determing if smoke from nuclear war would cool the planet's surface, said Dean Hegg, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turco said the Otter's sampling of clouds above other smoke plumes was the first such successful sampling.</p>
        <p>Critics of the nuclear winter theory believe smoke particles will clump together in the clouds or be washed out by rain, reducing the sun-blocking effect. But Mr. Turco said smoke particles that ''seed'' clouds may be so numerous that only tiny fog droplets condense, preventing the washing effect. Lower Temperatures</p>
        <p>Mr. Zak and others cited unconfirmed reports that some smoke-covered valleys had temperatures in the 50's despite forecasts of 80-degree weather.</p>
        <p>In 1982, Alan Robock, a meteorologist at the University of Maryland, found smoke from Canadian forest fires chilled Midwest areas 3 to 7 degrees below forecasts, while adjacent non-smoky areas had temperatures consistent with forecasts. He is now trying to learn if the same thing happened during the recent fires.</p>
        <p>''The fires were awesome,'' Mr. Zak said. ''The plumes towered to 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Whole hillsides were going up in flames in seconds. It was quite an emotional experience, particularly when one thinks of the men on the ground fighting those fires.''</p>
        <p>Scientists said information collected from the fires would also help in the study of acid rain, the depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer and the ''greenhouse effect'' warming of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Douglas Westphal, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said, ''It's terrible all the natural destruction occurred, but it's fortunate we could make some aircraft-based measurements in the smoke to help us understand the nuclear winter hypothesis better.''</p>
