        <p>Biosphere 2, the supposedly self-contained ecological experiment in the Arizona desert, can succeed as a scientific venture as well as a tourist attraction, but only if more attention is paid to its science, a new report says.</p>
        <p>The report is by an eight-member committee led by Dr. Thomas E. Lovejoy, an ecologist and vice president for external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution. Among other things, it calls for the appointment of a director of science and the creation of a science plan for the project.</p>
        <p>Supporters say Biosphere 2 is a re-creation of conditions on Earth, which they call Biosphere 1. The 3.15-acre, $150 million greenhouse holds five climate zones and thousands of plant and animal species. In a storm of publicity, four men and four women were sealed in it last September with the professed intention of remaining inside for two years and recycling the greenhouse's gases, liquids, plants and everything else inside, without any physical contact with the outside world. 'Some Really Good Stuff'</p>
        <p>But within months of the experiment's beginning, researchers acknowledged that they were removing excess carbon dioxide from the air and storing it rather than recycling it, pumping new air into the greenhouse and bringing supplies into the area.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lovejoy said that when controversy about the project began, Edward P. Bass, a Texas oil heir who is financing Biosphere 2, asked Dr. Lovejoy to convene the committee.</p>
        <p>"This is in condition to run for maybe 100 years, so there is plenty of time to do some really good stuff," Dr. Lovejoy said, referring to possible scientific experiments. "And my sense is that Ed Bass is committed to that; otherwise he wouldn't have exposed himself to a report that was likely to contain some criticism."</p>
        <p>But the report says competing economic and scientific goals have hindered the project. 'Science Got Lost'</p>
        <p>"I think that the initial business about eight people being closed up for two years was so hyped that the science got lost," Dr. Lovejoy said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the experiments of the eight people, which focus on recycling human wastes to produce food, Biosphere 2 has a visitors' center, restaurant and inn surrounding it in the desert of Oracle, Ariz. Mr. Bass, who has financed many large-scale ecological projects, calls himself an "ecopreneur," seeking a profit as well as knowledge from his ventures.</p>
        <p>The committee recommended that Space Biospheres Ventures, which operates Biosphere 2, implement important controls on the experiment. These would include a director of science and more trained scientists involved on a regular basis, a science plan, an effort to publish findings in peer-review journals and a procedure to insure the integrity of computer data.</p>
        <p>With these changes in place, Dr. Lovejoy said, Biosphere 2 could provide important scientific findings. Pledge to Address Concerns</p>
        <p>"It is not abnormal for a scientific exercise to have some goals other than the science itself," he said. "In universities, it is education, for instance. It is just necessary to keep those other elements from beginning to wag the scientific dog."</p>
        <p>In a written response to questions, Mr. Bass said that he would address all the committee's concerns and that the committee would continue to play an advisory role.</p>
        <p>In addition to Dr. Lovejoy, the committee includes Dr. Stephen J. O'Brien, chief of the Laboratory of Viral Carcinogenesis at the National Cancer Institute; Dr. Eugene Odum, director emeritus of the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia; Dr. Ghillean T. Prance, director of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, England; Dr. Robert Peters, former senior fellow at the W. Alton Jones Foundation; Dr. Keith Runcorn, a fellow of the Royal Society at Imperial College; Dr. Gerald Soffen, director of university programs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and Robert Walsh, senior vice president of the Allegheny Ludlum Corporation.</p>
