        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brian Schweitzer presented many aspects of synthetic fuel production that should give us hope for a stable energy future: an enormous indigenous resource base, local jobs and local profits, and more stable fuel prices.</p>
        <p>But synfuel processes are not environmentally benign unless purposefully designed that way, and this raises the cost.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gas emissions, for example, are significantly higher than those from conventional oil unless the excess carbon dioxide is captured and stored.</p>
        <p>While this has been suggested for synfuel facilities, it is not currently practiced, and developers of the synthetic fuels will not include such technology unless induced to do so by policies that control carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>We may be able to kick the foreign oil habit with synthetic fuels, but this is not a cure that is free from side effects.</p>
