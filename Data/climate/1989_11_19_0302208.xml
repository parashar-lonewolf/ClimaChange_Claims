        <p>LEAD:  The contras</p>
        <p>The contras</p>
        <p>A quick agreement between President Bush and the Democratic leadership resolved the long fight over the Nicaraguan contras, abandoning the Reagan Administration's quest for military victory in return for limited aid.  Savings and loans</p>
        <p>Congress voted to bail out the industry, at a cost of at least $50 billion over three years, and change its regulatory system. The Government must now dispose of failed institutions.  The flag</p>
        <p>After the Supreme Court's ruling that flag-burning is a protected exercise of free speech, Congress tinkered with the anti-desecration law, but rejected Mr. Bush's proposed constitutional amendment.  Minimum wage</p>
        <p>A textbook compromise: Republicans agreed to a raise from $3.35 to $4.25 an hour, the first increase in nine years, while Democrats consented to a lower ''training wage'' for teen-agers. Mr. Bush signed the bill on Friday.  Aid to Poland</p>
        <p>For a popular cause, Congress allotted $846.5 million, twice what the President recommended. He is expected to approve the aid.  Drugs</p>
        <p>Congress approved Mr. Bush's proposals, which focus on law enforcement, and added $900 million to his request. Total cost this fiscal year: $3.18 billion.  Unfinished business  Capital gains</p>
        <p>Senate Democratic leaders staved off Mr. Bush's proposal to cut the tax rate, but the proposal will be back next session, probably enjoying some Democratic support.  Clean air</p>
        <p>The 1970 act must be reauthorized, a huge undertaking that will address motor-vehicle standards, toxic air pollutants and acid rain. Mr. Bush submitted legislation stricter than environmentalists expected. Meantime, a House subcommittee agreed to tougher auto-emissions standards, and resistance to acid-rain controls is waning.  Child care</p>
        <p>Several proposals are stalled in conference committees. Issues are what form the aid should take - tax credits or outright grants - and whether funds should be available to day care centers that engage in religious activity.  The disabled</p>
        <p>The House must act on a bill of rights for the disabled that bans discrimination in employment and requires access to transportation and communication services. The Senate approved the measure overwhelmingly.  Housing</p>
        <p>The overhaul of housing programs has been delayed by fights over whether aid should take the form of construction subsidies or vouchers for the poor. Congress must also address political favoritism and other abuses in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
