        <p>"Nature," the popular PBS series, begins its new season at 8 P.M. Sunday on Channel 13 with a program that untypically is not about wildlife. "From the Heart of the World: The Elder Brothers' Warning" is an account of a visit by the producer, Alan Ereira, to the remote reaches of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia to look at what he calls "the last functioning civilization of pre-Columbian America." It's an interesting visit, up to a point.</p>
        <p>The Kogi have no wheels, plows or written language, but they are certain -- and Mr. Eriera seems to agree -- that they are in tune with the harmony of nature, which the modern world has violated. They see themselves as the elder brothers of mankind, the rest of the globe's population being made up of younger brothers who have gone astray. The elder brothers wear white cotton garments but no shoes; they carry little sticks that they constantly rub against gourds and then lick; they chew dried coca leaves; they farm. The elder sisters tend to stay out of camera range.</p>

        <p>"Nature," the popular PBS series, begins its new season at 8 P.M. Sunday on Channel 13 with a program that untypically is not about wildlife. "From the Heart of the World: The Elder Brothers' Warning" is an account of a visit by the producer, Alan Ereira, to the remote reaches of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia to look at what he calls "the last functioning civilization of pre-Columbian America." It's an interesting visit, up to a point.</p>
        <p>The Kogi have no wheels, plows or written language, but they are certain -- and Mr. Eriera seems to agree -- that they are in tune with the harmony of nature, which the modern world has violated. They see themselves as the elder brothers of mankind, the rest of the globe's population being made up of younger brothers who have gone astray. The elder brothers wear white cotton garments but no shoes; they carry little sticks that they constantly rub against gourds and then lick; they chew dried coca leaves; they farm. The elder sisters tend to stay out of camera range.</p>
        <p>Much of the hour is given to the accounts of a priest, one of the Kogi's ruling caste, of the beginnings of the world and the Kogi's special place in it until the conquistadors arrived in the 16th century. The combination of history, folk tales and myth, in a translation that seems to aspire to poetry through rarely touching it, is accompanied by some fancy photography. In accord with public television's penchant for picturing primitive peoples as repositories of spiritual truths, the narrator credits the priests with having a line to "the inner reality of the world."</p>
        <p>An investigator of primitive societies must walk carefully. The people being studied have to be understood and respected on their own terms, unadulterated by the outsider's preconceptions or moral judgments or wishful thinking. Mr. Ereira is respectful to the point of reverence, but he succumbs to the temptation to idealize the Kogi and use them to promote his ecological predilections. By the end of the program, he is talking about global warming. Even as he laments the exploitation that the Kogi and their lands have suffered, he does a little exploiting of his own, for television's favorite cause.</p>
