        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re '''No Nukes,' No More,'' by John Tierney (column, May 17):</p>
        <p>The only sector that reaps economic benefits from nuclear power is the nuclear industry. Entergy, the owner-operator of the Indian Point nuclear plant, 24 miles north of New York City, hauls in more than $10 billion in annual revenue.</p>
        <p>Over the last 50 years, some $145 billion in federal research and development subsidies has gone to the nuclear industry; only $5 billion has gone to renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a substantial portion of the costs of operating a nuclear plant are imposed on communities. Indian Point kills over a billion Hudson River fish, eggs and larvae annually; local taxpayers cover most of the emergency planning costs.</p>
        <p>Entergy recently went on record opposing backup power to emergency sirens, yet it seems to have ample funds for advertising campaigns designed to lull the public into a false sense of security. Providing increased safety and prosperity for American families is patriotic. Providing more welfare checks to the nuclear industry is not.</p>
