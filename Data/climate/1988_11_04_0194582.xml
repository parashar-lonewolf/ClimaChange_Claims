        <p>LEAD: In their television advertisements and stump speeches, in their debates and interviews, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis have emphasized issues fraught with emotion like crime, drugs, civil liberties, gun control, abortion, the environment and ethics.</p>
        <p>In their television advertisements and stump speeches, in their debates and interviews, Vice President Bush and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis have emphasized issues fraught with emotion like crime, drugs, civil liberties, gun control, abortion, the environment and ethics.</p>
        <p>Many of those issues are to some extent beyond the realm of the Presidency. Crime control, for example, is primarily the responsibility of state and local authorities. But that has not stopped Mr. Bush from using a large share of his television commercials to portray the Massachusetts Governor as soft on crime.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, Mr. Dukakis has tried repeatedly to associate Mr. Bush with avarice on Wall Street, as if insider trading and corporate mergers would be primary responsibilities for the new President.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, their disagreements on such highly charged topics, perhaps more than differences on the central issues of foreign and economic policy, have established the character of the candidates in the mind of the public. They will doubtless be the basis on which many voters will choose next week.</p>
        <p>What follows is a rundown of the Bush and Dukakis positions on such ''gut'' issues and a number of other areas of domestic policy. Their Records on Environment</p>
        <p>Neither candidate has a record in office as a committed environmentalist. Mr. Bush, for example, headed a Reagan Administration task force that recommended relaxing many environmental regulations. Mr. Dukakis sought waivers of Federal requirements that Boston Harbor be cleaned up. Yet both candidates are campaigning as strong conservationists, and protection of the environment has become a widely discussed issue for the first time in a Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush ran a series of television advertisements attacking Mr. Dukakis for pollution in Boston Harbor. Mr. Dukakis, saying he was not at fault, responded with ads blaming Reagan budget cuts for the harbor's pollution and criticizing the Vice President for opposing renewal of the Clean Water Act and strong regulation of corporate polluters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis has won the endorsement of most national environmental organizations. The League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of the main environmental groups, gives Mr. Dukakis a rating of B, Mr. Bush a grade of D+, based on their records and stated positions.</p>
        <p>Neither man has promised to spend much new money on the environment. But both have endorsed a program to reduce pollution that causes acid rain, both say they would bring an end to ocean dumping and both promise to call a meeting of world leaders to address the threat of global warming caused by man-made gases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promises to exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's target of cutting hazardous wastes by 25 percent, without specifying the policies that would enable him to meet his goal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis endorses much stricter environmental regulation across the board than that backed by the Reagan Administration. The Governor also favors a new law requiring companies to adopt environmental accident-prevention programs and another setting national standards to reduce toxic emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush supports offshore oil drilling in most instances, while Mr. Dukakis would outlaw it in environmentally sensitive areas and productive fishing grounds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis takes a skeptical view of nuclear power and says new plants are economically and environmentally unfeasible. Mr. Bush favors nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, while saying he would insist on high safety standards. Crime and Civil Liberties</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has attacked Mr. Dukakis relentlessly over the Governor's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union and over a Massachusetts prison furlough program from which a convicted murderer escaped and raped a woman. The Vice President assails ''legal technicalities'' that allow criminals to go free and supports the death penalty for ''heinous'' crimes.</p>
        <p>''The rights accorded criminals must never overshadow the wrongs done to victims,'' he declares in his stump speeches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis says he is proud of his A.C.L.U. membership, although he says he disagrees with the organization on some matters. He defends the furlough program, put in place by his Repubican predecessor, and argues that the Federal Government and other states have similar programs.</p>
        <p>He stresses that the crime rate in Massachusetts has fallen since he has been Governor and that the state has the lowest homicide rate of any industrial state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis opposes capital punishment, saying he has seen no evidence that it is a deterrent to crime, and says strict attention must be paid to due process of the law and other Constitutional rights. ''I don't think you have to destroy or severely limit our rights under the Constitution,'' he said in an interview on CBS News last week. ''That's a very important document.'' Drugs</p>
        <p>Both candidates have talked a great deal about fighting drug abuse. But except for Mr. Bush's support of capital punishment for drug ''kingpins'' and his greater willingness to require involuntary drug testing of Government employees and other citizens, their positions are not significantly different.</p>
        <p>Both stress improved drug education. Both would call a meeting of Western Hemisphere political leaders to discuss the drug problem. And both would use the military in some circumstances to interdict drug traffic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would put Dan Quayle, the Vice Presidential nominee, in charge of the Government's drug policies. Mr. Dukakis would centralize the policies under a ''drug czar.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of the intractability of the problem, some of their proposals have been inconsistent. Mr. Dukakis, for instance, says he would cut off foreign aid to Governments that refuse to cooperate on drug policy, but in response to an inquiry, the Governor's aides said he did not contemplate denying assistance to Mexico, which will not let the American authorities pursue smugglers across the border. Mr. Bush supports an ''international strike force'' to counter drug operations abroad, but his aides acknowledged that officials in most countries probably would not allow an international police force on their territory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was in charge of the Reagan Administration's ''war'' on drugs and did not have notable success in solving the problem. Mr. Dukakis opposed some anti-drug initiatives in Massachusetts on civil liberties grounds, including one denying bail to drug trafficking suspects. Gun Control</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis favors tougher gun controls. Mr. Bush does not.</p>
        <p>The Governor, for instance, supported unsuccessful legislation this year that would have imposed a seven-day waiting period in purchases of pistols. The Vice President opposed the bill. Mr. Dukakis would outlaw ''Saturday night specials,'' the inexpensive, easily concealed pistols that are often used in crimes. Mr. Bush would not make them illegal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis says he fully supports hunters and target-shooters who want to own firearms and others who keep guns to protect their homes or businesses. Mr. Bush has said he would veto legislation banning handguns that cannot be detected by security devices, but he has urged gun owners to work with police officals on a compromise. Abortion</p>
        <p>Vice President Bush calls abortions ''killings,'' says he favors ''adoption over abortion'' and supports a constitutional amendment that would prohibit abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother's life is endangered. In his first debate with Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Bush said he had not ''sorted out'' what criminal penalties should be imposed on women who have abortions. The next day, his staff said he had thought about the matter overnight and had decided that penalties should be imposed on those who perform abortions but not on the women themselves, whom he called ''victims.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis says he is personally opposed to abortions but believes they should be legal. ''The question is, who makes the decision,'' he said in the first debate. ''And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis supports Federal financing of abortions for poor women, as with other medical procedures. Mr. Bush opposes it. AIDS</p>
        <p>Both men have talked about the horror of the AIDS epidemic and have proposed additional education and research in the area. Mr. Dukakis has specifically suggested spending an additional $1 billion. Mr. Bush is not committed to spending a specific amount. Both say they would take steps to protect people with AIDS from discrimination.</p>
        <p>Where they differ is on testing. Mr. Bush supports widespread mandatory testing for AIDS, including tests for citizens applying for marriage licenses. Mr. Dukakis favors more limited testing, including prisoners and military personnel. Poverty</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis, noting in almost every stump speech that poverty and homelessness have increased during the Reagan Administration, emphasizes Government intervention to meet the problems. Especially, he says, the Government should build and rehabilitate more housing. He does not say, however, how much he would spend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush talks about these issues infrequently. When he does he stresses volunteer efforts, calling such charitable enterprises a ''thousand points of light.''</p>
        <p>Both candidates stress job training over welfare. Both also support full Federal financing of the relatively small-scale legislation Congress approved this year to help states deal with problems of homelessness.</p>
        <p>During the primaries last spring, Mr. Bush declared that mental illness was the main cause of homelessness. Now, he says it is only a part of the problem. Aging</p>
        <p>Both candidates oppose reductions in Social Security benefits and promise annual cost-of-living increases. Mr. Dukakis supports legislation, rejected by Congress this year, that would pay through Medicare for the treatment at home of elderly people who are chronically ill or disabled. The program would be financed by eliminating the $45,000 cap on income subject to the Medicare payroll tax. Mr. Bush opposes the legislation but backs tax incentives to establish private insurance for long-term care. Civil Rights</p>
        <p>This has been less of an issue than in past Presidential campaigns. For example, busing for school desegregation has hardly been discussed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis supported legislation, enacted this year over President Reagan's veto, broadening various civil rights laws that had been struck down by a 1984 Supreme Court ruling. Mr. Bush avoided taking a position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis supports adding the proposed equal rights amendment, outlawing sex discrimination, to the Constitution. Mr. Bush opposes it. Both candidates say they favor affirmative action but oppose rigid quotas. Mr. Bush emphasizes encouragement to minority businesses. Mr. Dukakis stresses job equality for women and members of minority groups. Judicial Appointments</p>
        <p>The three most liberal Supreme Court Justices, William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, will be in their 80's when the next President takes office. Thus, the new President is expected to have the opportunity to pick new Justices and hundreds of lower courts judges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said in the second debate that he would name judges ''who will not legislate from the bench'' and be part of a ''liberal majority.'' The Vice President has spoken highly of Robert H. Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected last year by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Dukakis has a record of judicial appointments. He established a judicial nominating council in Massachusetts that recommended people for him to appoint to the courts. The justices he put on the State Supreme Court voted to strike down death penalty laws and ruled that a state pornography law violated the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.</p>
        <p>The Massachusetts justices recommended that he veto a law requiring teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance, a veto Mr. Bush has criticized repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis is critical of the Bork nomination and maintains that the selection of Mr. Quayle for the Vice Presidency illustrates the kind of people Mr. Bush would choose to be judges. Ethics</p>
        <p>Throughout the campaign, Mr. Dukakis has attacked Mr. Bush for what the Governor calls the ''sleaze factor'' in the Reagan Administration. He questions Mr. Bush's role in the Iran-contra affair and his dealings with Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian leader; tries to tie Mr. Bush to former Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and former White House officials who have been convicted of crimes, and draws a comparison between ethics in the Administration and scandals on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis promises that on his first day in office he will sign an executive order banning lobbying by former top Federal officials as long as their Administration is in office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says he will create a strong ethics office in the White House and maintains that Congress, as well as the Executive Branch, should be subject to investigation by special prosecutors. Mr. Bush often observes that a top education official under Governor Dukakis in Massachusetts was convicted for fraud and other crimes.</p>
        <p>Both candidates have a long history of making their personal financial statements public. Space and Science</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis maintains that the space program has fallen into ''disarray.'' Both candidates support further space exploration, put priority on development of a space station and support a project to observe long-term climatic changes from space.</p>
        <p>Both men pledge more funds for scientific research, and Mr. Dukakis stresses that he intends to shift the emphasis from military to civilian research. Mr. Bush endorses construction of a Superconducting Super Collider; Mr. Dukakis says he will address such scientific projects on a case-by-case basis.  ON ABORTION  ''I don't favor abortion. I don't think it's a good thing. I don't think most people do. The question is, who makes the decision. And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.'' MICHAEL S. DUKAKIS  ''Yes my position has evolved, and it's continuing to evolve in favor of life. And I had a couple of exceptions that I support: rape, incest, and the life of the mother.'' GEORGE BUSH  ON GUN CONTROL  ''We already have some Federal restrictions on handgun ownership. I think there has to be some control over concealable handguns. I have no problem with hunters and weapons for sport or target practice, but Saturday-night specials, in my judgment, require regulation.'' MICHAEL S. DUKAKIS  ''I have always opposed Federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners  [ but ]  we must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with the rights of society. . . . We must do all we can to keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals.'' GEORGE BUSH  ON THE SUPREME COURT  ''What I would do is appoint people to the federal bench that will not legislate from the bench, who will interpret the Constitution. I do not want to see us go to again - and I'm using this word advisedly - a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the bench.''  GEORGE BUSH  ''I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders. I don't appoint people I think are liberal, or people who I think are conservative; I appoint people of independence and integrity and intelligence, people who will be a credit to the bench.'' MICHAEL S. DUKAKIS  ON AIDS  ''We must commit the resources and the will to find a cure. . . . I believe that continued research on the virus, combined with public education and testing, is the best path to curing the spread of AIDS. . . . We need testing, but only accompanied by guarantees that everyone is treated fairly.'' GEORGE BUSH  ''I strongly support the efforts to increase funding for AIDS research and education to over $1 billion a year. An increasing commitment to research, treatment and education will be necessary in future years.'' MICHAEL S. DUKAKIS</p>
