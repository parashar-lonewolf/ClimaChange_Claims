        <p>London in the year 2008 is a dank hellhole aswarm with rats and is severely flooded because of global warming and torrential rains. The soggy environment has spawned a killer who rips out the hearts of his victims, eats them and leaves elaborate astrological clues to his whereabouts.</p>
        <p>Enter Stone (Rutger Hauer), the creature's would-be nemesis. Three years earlier, his police partner was murdered by the beast. Partly out of guilt for having taken up with his former partner's wife, Michelle (Kim Cattrall), Stone lives only to track down and exterminate the thing.</p>
        <p>"Split Second," which opened on Friday, follows the efforts by Stone and his squeamish new partner (Neil Duncan) to end the terror. Before sputtering to a predictable ending, this clammy, blood-soaked thriller directed by Tony Maylam finds the pair staking out a sleazy strip club and rummaging through a morgue. Eventually they face down their enemy in a dripping, rat-infested subway tunnel.</p>
        <p>Within the genre of supernatural thrillers, "Split Second' is fairly dull. Mr. Hauer's Stone is an expressionless, unsympathetic lug who grunts his lines in a near monotone that sometimes becomes unintelligble in the movie's muffled soundtrack. The film is so desperate to create tingles that poor Miss Cattrall has to endure two protracted nude scenes -- one in a shower, the other in a bathtub -- in which she is menaced. Neither is especially spine-tingling.</p>
        <p>"Split Second" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, strong language and lots of gore.  Split Second  Directed by Tony Maylam; written by Gary Scott Thompson; director of photography, Clive Tickner; edited by Dan Rae; music by Stephen Parsons and Francis Haines; production designer, Chris Edwards; produced by Laura Gregory; released by Interstar. Running time: 90 minutes. This film is rated R. Stone . . . Rutger Hauer Michelle . . . Kim Cattrall Durkin . . . Neil Duncan The Rat Catcher . . . Michael J. Pollard Thrasher . . .
