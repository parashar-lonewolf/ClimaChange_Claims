        <p>LEAD: Which Presidential candidate offers more promise in foreign relations? On the most important relationship, this campaign remains, for both candidates, a campaign of missed opportunity.</p>
        <p>Which Presidential candidate offers more promise in foreign relations? On the most important relationship, this campaign remains, for both candidates, a campaign of missed opportunity.</p>
        <p>Mikhail Gorbachev challenges the United States to reshape world politics, and neither George Bush nor Michael Dukakis answers with ideas of interest and weight. Without a clearsighted American strategy, Moscow will set the diplomatic agenda, and a great opportunity for peace and cooperation could be lost.</p>
        <p>The Soviet leader proposes reducing long-range nuclear weapons sharply. He proposes cutting conventional forces. He calls for elimination of chemical weapons. The two would-be Presidents usually respond with little more than mutterings that they are eager for, yet wary of, arms control. Neither man gives any sign that he has thought about how this country should respond, about the relative importance of the various arms negotiations and about how agreements might affect Pentagon budgets. Nor has either candidate distinguished himself in explaining how he would bargain with Moscow.</p>
        <p>Governor Dukakis resurrects self-defeating, unworkable nonsense about the need to tie trade to Soviet ''good behavior.'' He also talks as if prospective American military deployments count for little in Soviet arms control decisions, as if Moscow's agreement to destroy its Euromissiles were only a matter of economy. The Vice President, meanwhile, is no more plausible when he attributes Moscow's generosity at the nuclear bargaining tables almost entirely to the threat of American weapons deployments.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take much sense to know that Moscow is driven by both, no less by Mr. Gorbachev's aims and problems than by United States might. But not until last week did Mr. Bush fully credit both considerations; and Mr. Dukakis hasn't done so yet. The Democrat still talks about scrapping the two new land-based missiles, MX and Midgetman, and hints vaguely at an alternative. There's nothing here to show that Mr. Dukakis appreciates the value of a bargaining chip.</p>
        <p>Mikhail Gorbachev has opened the path to settlements in Afghanistan, southern Africa and elsewhere. Here again, Mr. Dukakis seems hesitant to acknowledge that United States military aid helped bring Moscow around. By contrast, Mr. Bush has a record of understanding the role of power in diplomacy. It would be more heartening if he showed any awareness of the need for serious diplomacy in Central America.</p>
        <p>The Vice President also seems unable to fathom the potential in Mr. Gorbachev's proposals to expand the use of the United Nations in regional negotiations and peacekeeping. Mr. Bush busily throws raw meat to right-wingers by pledging never to sacrifice an ounce of American sovereignty to any international body. How perverse, even tragic, that at the very moment the United Nations shows promises of fulfilling its charter, Mr. Bush looks the other way.</p>
        <p>There is no alternative to U.N. forces to keep the peace in Cyprus, the Middle East, Namibia and elsewhere. Mr. Dukakis knows that and promises to explore new Soviet ideas for the U.N. and multilateral diplomacy. Whatever the state of bipolar power politics, global issues are coming to center stage. Drug trafficking, ocean pollution, holes in the ozone layer, acid rain and trade wars present monumental challenges to all countries. Mr. Dukakis, at least, has these challenges on his radar screen and seems to possess the intellectual discipline to pursue them.</p>
        <p>Who would respond better to all the diplomatic challenges of coming years? Mr. Bush seems more alert to the nasty world of power and intractable conflicts than his opponent. Mr. Dukakis demonstrates more awareness than Mr. Bush of the need for new forms of diplomatic cooperation.</p>
        <p>And when it comes to the central challenge of relations with the Soviet Union, neither man approaches Mikhail Gorbachev's command of foreign affairs, imaginative proposals and grasp of the possibilities for reshaping and rechanneling world competition.</p>
        <p>If the judgment is limited to foreign relations, it's hard to choose between the candidates. For those who think the future will follow the familiar path of the present, the choice is Mr. Bush. For those who think the future can hold unexpected promise, the choice is Mr. Dukakis.</p>
