        <p>Negotiators from more than 150 countries moved closer today to an agreement requiring reductions in the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrial countries, but a firm deal continued to elude them.</p>
        <p>With a deadline looming later today, the discussions focused on a proposal put forth by Raul Estrada-Oyuela of Argentina, the chairman of the talks, that would cut average emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases during the period 2005 through 2010 by 5-percent below the level of emissions in 1990.</p>
        <p>In meeting the overall target, different countries and groups of countries would be assigned different targets according to their economic profiles. Thus, while the United States would cut its emissions by 5 percent and Japan by 4.5 percent, for instance, emissions of the European Union would be reduced 8 percent.  But all would fall within a narrow band ranging from that 8 percent reduction to increases of 5 percent permitted in Australia and Norway.</p>
        <p>''The trend is a very positive one,'' Mr. Estrada said after the talks recessed at 2:30 A.M.</p>
        <p>At issue are emissions of six greenhouse gases. The most important is carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The others are methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexachloride, but various proposals on reductions would leave decisions on some gases for another conference.</p>
        <p>All trap heat in the atmosphere, and some scientific advisers at the talks say the gases will raise the average global temperature by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if emissions are not reduced.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the world has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last Ice Age, and these scientists say the predicted warming would cause widespread climatic and environmental disruption.</p>
        <p>On the sticky question of how developing countries can be brought more closely into the effort to control emissions, the proposal suggested setting up a special fund to serve as a conduit for the transfer of money and technology from rich countries to poor ones, so that the latter can adopt appropriate technologies.</p>
        <p>The United States ''welcomes'' this concept, said Stuart Eizenstat, the chief American negotiator, who called it ''exactly the kind of bridge both worlds should hope for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrada's proposal also provides for developing countries to submit to binding controls on emissions at any time, at their option; some countries, including Chile, have expressed interest in this.</p>
        <p>The developing countries have been insisting that they will not accept any further commitments under the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, beyond general ones already binding them to take measures to cut emissions, until the rich countries submit to binding reductions.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mark Mwandosya, chairman of the developing-country caucus in the talks, said on Tuesday that ''we will not be a stumbling block'' to Mr. Estrada's efforts to forge a deal.</p>
        <p>The United States signaled that it was moving in the direction of Mr. Estrada's plan on at least one key element, that of the emissions-reduction target. Mr. Eizenstat said the United States had proposed going below 1990 levels. Earlier reports from the European camp that the proposal involved a cut of 2 percent were ''understated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisenstat said the revised American target was contingent on the acceptance of a package that includes the ''trading'' of emissions among countries and regions, and the Estrada proposal includes this feature. In emissions trading, a country or industrial company would be able to meet its target by cutting emissions itself, by buying reductions from a country or company that achieved excess cuts, or by both approaches.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the approach argue that it provides an incentive for companies and countries that find it easier and cheaper to cut emissions to reduce them below the target and then sell the excess reductions, at a profit, to companies or countries that find it harder or more costly to reduce emissions on their own.</p>
        <p>The Americans say this results in cheaper and more effective reductions, but the Europeans worry that countries might be able to buy their way out of their obligations.</p>
        <p>The Americans proposed on Tuesday that the United States join with a group of countries including but not limited to Japan, Russia, Australia, New Zealand and Canada in an emissions-trading group.</p>
        <p>This would potentially make it easier for the United States to achieve its commitments because Russia's economic troubles have reduced its emissions drastically. The European Union has long insisted that its 15 countries be allowed to band together to achieve a common target.</p>
        <p>The Estrada plan would allow countries to meet part of their obligation by counting natural features, mainly forests, that absorb carbon dioxide. The Americans favor this, but the Europeas are skeptical.</p>
