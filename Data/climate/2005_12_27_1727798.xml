        <p>Earth scientists with the longest frames of reference, particularly those whose specialties begin with the prefix ''paleo,'' often seem to be the least agitated about human-caused global warming.</p>
        <p>This has been true even in 2005, a year that saw the biggest summer retreat of Arctic sea ice ever measured, a new sign that warming seas are rising at an accelerating pace and global temperatures continuing a sharp climb that began around 1990 and appears unmatched in 2,000 years. But these backward-looking experts have seen it all before.</p>
        <p>Recent studies have found that 49 million years ago the balmy Arctic Ocean, instead of being covered in ice, was matted with a cousin of the duckweed that cloaks suburban frog ponds. The forests on the continent now called Antarctica and on shores fringing the Arctic were once thick and lush.</p>
        <p>And through hundreds of millions of years, concentrations of carbon dioxide and the other trace gases that trap solar energy and prevent the planet from being an ice ball have mostly been far higher than those typical during humankind's short existence.</p>
        <p>Compared with that norm, the rapid buildup of carbon dioxide now from a binge of burning forests, coal and oil lasting for centuries (and counting) is but a blip</p>
        <p>In fact, the planet has nothing to worry about from global warming. A hot, steamy earth would be fine for most forms of life. Earth and its biological veneer are far more resilient than human societies, particularly those still mired in poverty or pushed to the margins of the livable.</p>
        <p>Only we humans have to be concerned, and species like polar bears that, like the poorest people, are pushed to an edge -- in the bear's case the tenuous ecosystem built around coastal sea ice.</p>
        <p>Henk Brinkhuis, a paleoecologist and botanist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, said it might be hard to get used to the idea, but the Arctic as we have known it for centuries ''is history.''</p>
        <p>He said this may spell doom for polar bears, a species that branched off from brown bears only about 250,000 years ago -- an evolutionary blink of the eye.</p>
        <p>Still, this is a special case, not necessarily a blow to the prospects of mammals in general.</p>
        <p>The world's last huge warm spike, the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum some 55 million years ago, preceded ''the biggest radiation in mammals ever,'' Dr. Brinkhuis said.</p>
        <p>''The first horses, cows, the first primates had their origin right around then,'' Dr. Brinkhuis said. ''It may be that the extinction of the polar bear would be followed by all kinds of new species in return.''</p>
        <p>None of this means that humans should simply embrace their fossil-fueled potency without regard to the effects. In fact, many scientists say, if we value the world as it is, there are still strong, and purely self-serving, reasons to start curbing releases of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>That long-scale earth history, while speaking of nature's vagaries, holds supporting evidence. It is rife with thresholds, points at which a little warming turns into a lot in a hurry. Avoiding such thresholds could forestall things that societies decide matter, like rapidly rising seas or a farewell to cherished Arctic icons.</p>
        <p>The Arctic, particularly, is filled with what amount to flippable climate switches, including natural repositories of carbon, like boggy tundra, that could emit vast amounts of greenhouse gases should the current warming trend pass certain points, said Jonathan T. Overpeck, the director of the Institute for the Study of Planet Earth at the University of Arizona.</p>
        <p>This could amplify warming and take the climate into a realm beyond anything experienced through human evolution.</p>
        <p>Another lesson of deep planetary history, Dr. Overpeck said, is that, once set in motion, such warm-ups can happen fast and then last a very, very long time.</p>
        <p>''That's a condition that might be really hard to get out of for tens of thousands of years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Studies of the past also show that pace matters. The rise in temperature and greenhouse gases during the great heat wave 55 million years ago, while instantaneous on a geological time scale, took thousands of years to unfold.</p>
        <p>But the pace of the recent rise in carbon dioxide is as much as 200 times as fast as what has been estimated in past rapid climate transitions.</p>
        <p>Slowing that pace would help human endeavors as much as ecosystems, said David G. Barber, who holds the Canada research chair in Arctic systems science at the University of Manitoba.</p>
        <p>Those who speak of the potential benefits of warming, he noted, forget that a thawing, greening Arctic, for example, will not suddenly transform from spongy tundra to wheat-friendly farmland.</p>
        <p>''You have to generate soil,'' Dr. Barber said. ''It takes a long time to generate this kind of stuff. So it's not going to be an instantaneous sort of thing. There's going to be a lot of messiness in between.''</p>
        <p>Even for polar bears, there are reasons to think the end is not necessarily nigh. There was at least one significant period -- the last gap between ice ages 120,000 years ago -- when the global climate was several degrees warmer than it is today and they clearly squeaked through.</p>
        <p>So at least slowing or blunting the warming might allow them to squeak through once again. Dr. Barber said he was confident that biology would endure much of what humans throw at it. His concern is for the effects on people and the things they rely on or cherish.</p>
        <p>''All of global warming has nothing to do with the planet,'' Dr. Barber said. ''The planet will go on through its normal cycles, and it'll do its own thing.</p>
        <p>''It only has to do with us -- as people. Our economic side of things and our political side of things are really what are being affected by climate change. The planet could care less.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 28, 2005, Wednesday  A caption about climate change in Science Times yesterday omitted one picture credit and misstated another. The picture of a protester dressed as a polar bear was taken by Steve Morgan for Greenpeace.
