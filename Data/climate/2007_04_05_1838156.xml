        <p>DaimlerChrysler insists it is keeping all options open for the future of the Chrysler Group. But judging by its tense annual meeting here on Wednesday, Daimler's marriage to Chrysler is already finished -- except for the ink on the divorce papers.</p>
        <p>Trying to placate restive shareholders, DaimlerChrysler confirmed for the first time that it was in negotiations with a number of bidders about a deal for the troubled American unit, which lost $1.5 billion last year.</p>
        <p>''We are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest,'' the chief executive, Dieter Zetsche, said. ''So far, I am satisfied with the process. Everything is going according to plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zetsche did not identify the suitors. Nor did he guarantee that the talks would end in a sale. ''We need to keep all options open,'' he said. ''We need to keep maximum scope for maneuver.''</p>
        <p>Still, the deal-making machinery is turning. People involved in the process said three bidders submitted preliminary offers for Chrysler on Friday: two private equity firms -- the Blackstone Group and Cerberus Capital Management -- and a Canadian auto parts supplier, Magna International.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler's confirmation of the discussions was hardly a surprise. The auto industry on both sides of the Atlantic has crackled with rumors about would-be bidders for Chrysler since mid-February, when Mr. Zetsche disclosed in Michigan that the company was thinking anew about the future of its American outpost.</p>
        <p>But the latest disclosure is likely to add momentum for a deal. Daimler shares have soared nearly 25 percent since the company put Chrysler into play, and they dipped 1.4 percent on Wednesday only because investors were frustrated that Mr. Zetsche did not offer more details.</p>
        <p>''This marriage made in heaven turned out to be a complete failure,'' said Hans-Richard Schmitz, one of a long line of investors who condemned the 1998 merger and called for a quick sale of Chrysler. ''What's missing now is a swift resolution of the issue by the management of the group,'' said Mr. Schmitz, who represented the German Association for the Protection of Shareholders.</p>
        <p>If DaimlerChrysler does not get rid of Chrysler soon, he warned, it could become a takeover target itself. ''I don't understand why you're so hesitant, Dr. Zetsche,'' Mr. Schmitz said. ''You can do the job yourself, or a financial investor will come along and do the job for you.''</p>
        <p>As DaimlerChrysler's fortunes have frayed, these annual meetings have become a collective exercise in anger management. Between plates of sausage and dumplings, the 8,000 or so shareholders applaud heartily as their representatives lash the management for its unmet promises.</p>
        <p>But with Chrysler's future in flux, this meeting had a subtly different tone. This time, shareholders tried to press the company into going through with a sale rather than simply criticizing management failings.</p>
        <p>''Were Chrysler finally to be led before a divorce court judge, we would be very thankful,'' said Henning Gebhardt, head of German equities at DWS, the fund management arm of Deutsche Bank. ''But what will happen if you do not find a new bridegroom for Chrysler, or if he demands too high a dowry?''</p>
        <p>Chrysler, with some $20 billion in health care obligations for retired workers, will not be easy to sell, according to analysts. Some estimate it may fetch no more than $5 billion to $7 billion, or even nothing at all -- a humbling comedown for a merger originally valued at $36 billion.</p>
        <p>Hailed at the time as a blueprint for the global automaker of the future, the Daimler-Chrysler combination fell victim to clashing corporate cultures, strategic missteps and, most damagingly, wrenching changes in the American auto industry. Instead of being all things to all car buyers, DaimlerChrysler wound up satisfying no one.</p>
        <p>Despite the querulous tone of investors on Wednesday, company officials said many major institutional shareholders opted to skip this year's meeting because they were willing to wait and see how the endgame on Chrysler played out.</p>
        <p>But smaller shareholders made their feelings known. Among their proposals was one that would force DaimlerChrysler to change its name back to Daimler-Benz if it did not get rid of Chrysler by March 31, 2008.</p>
        <p>''Maintaining a corporate name that evokes associations with the failure of the business combination with Chrysler is detrimental to the image of the corporation and its products,'' said the proposal, submitted by two shareholders, Leonhard Knoll and Ekkehard Wenger, who delivered a spirited case against the existing name.</p>
        <p>The proposal was defeated in a shareholder vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zetsche came in for pointed criticism for his management of Chrysler, which shareholders said left it exposed when high crude oil prices persuaded Americans to switch to small fuel-efficient vehicles. Chrysler continued to churn out sport utility vehicles, light trucks and minivans.</p>
        <p>''How could it happen that you were so surprised by the developments in the United States?'' Mr. Gebhardt asked. ''Turning away from gas-guzzling vehicles was not really a surprise.''</p>
        <p>He also criticized DaimlerChrysler for responding sluggishly to concerns about climate change. Mercedes-Benz cars, with their powerful engines, are among the worst offenders in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zetsche said Chrysler had begun to produce fuel-efficient vehicles, including the Dodge Avenger, which it displayed in the cavernous convention center here. And he said the company had invested 1.4 billion euros in Europe last year ($1.87 billion at current exchange rates) to develop technologies to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
        <p>While the criticism of Mr. Zetsche was not as fierce as that last year against his predecessor, Jürgen E. Schrempp, it was clear that Mr. Zetsche's honeymoon in Germany was over.</p>
        <p>Shareholders saved some of their harshest words for Hilmar Kopper, the departing chairman of DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board. A former chief of Deutsche Bank, Mr. Kopper was a staunch supporter of Mr. Schrempp and backed the merger. He will be succeeded by Manfred Bischoff, a strong-minded former Daimler executive who is expected to push for further changes.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that given the recent jump in the stock price, the company had little choice but to go through with a sale. In a recent report, Morgan Stanley raised its price target for the shares, based on a sale of Chrysler for no cash at all -- after deducting its health care liabilities.</p>
        <p>''Investors will debate the process and proceeds of a potential Chrysler divestiture, but we think the writing is on the wall,'' the report concluded. ''It's time to go back to Benz.''</p>
