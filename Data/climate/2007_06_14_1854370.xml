        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Auto Chiefs Make Headway Against a Mileage Increase'' (Business Day, June 7):</p>
        <p>Anyone with a passing knowledge of the predicted impacts of global warming, and an ounce of common sense, should view with horror and disbelief the recent bullying push by Big Coal to lock the United States into generations of ever-growing, coal-based greenhouse gas emissions, and the latest refusal by the Big Three to make their automobiles significantly more fuel-efficient.</p>
        <p>Do these corporate executives, and their well-supported political allies in Washington, really not understand what is at stake here? That we are fast approaching changes to the planet's physical, chemical and biological systems that will last for hundreds if not many thousands of years. That as long as the United States does little to cap its escalating emissions, China and India will have no incentive to do so.</p>
        <p>And that by their behavior, they are choosing potential profits over the health and the lives of not only my children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren, but of their own as well.</p>
        <p>Eric Chivian, M.D.  Boston, June 8, 2007</p>
