        <p>Rosario Silva was determined to suffer no more. For two weeks, she had sat in her living room, wet towels draped over her body. Four times a day she had made a mad rush to the bathroom for a cold shower. Her two window fans seemed only to mock her, blowing hot air into her face.</p>
        <p>On Friday, after another day of unbearable heat and a string of sleepless nights, she made a life-changing decision: she would buy an air-conditioner.</p>
        <p>"This heat just puts me in a bad mood," said Ms. Silva, 62, as she studied the air-conditioner units at a Nobody Beats the Wiz store at 153d Street and Third Avenue in the South Bronx. "I've lived here 41 years and this summer it's hot, very hot."</p>
        <p>Just behind her, another customer huddled over a unit, inspecting its B.T.U.'s and warranties and switches. Then a third zeroed in on the display shelf. It never stopped. All day, heat-crazed New Yorkers, fed up with the unrelenting sultriness, turned over a few hundred dollars for the promise of a sweat-free afternoon and a good night's rest.</p>
        <p>"Yesterday was nonstop," said Elizabeth Cueva, a cashier at the store, referring to Thursday. "They were going like water."</p>
        <p>The city's obsession with staying cool is not likely to abate any time soon. The temperature yesterday was a bit milder than Thursday's, with a high of 89, but was expected to climb into the 90's during the next few days. The humidity was 70 percent in Central Park at 5 P.M.</p>
        <p>The police reported no heat-related deaths or injuries yesterday, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cautioned New Yorkers to take it easy and avoid strenuous activity.</p>
        <p>The air-conditioner frenzy began in mid-July, during the heat wave that struck the city on a Saturday. Pandemonium broke out, one Wiz employee recalled.</p>
        <p>"There were 30 people lined up outside the store before we even opened the doors," said Jose Gutierrez, a stockroom manager, who said sales this summer have been the biggest he can remember. "They were all there waiting for air-conditioners. It was horrible. They came and they didn't care whether they had the money or not. They just bought."</p>
        <p>Arguments broke out as customers demanded to know why some units weren't available, he said. The line leading to the display section snaked outside the door, past the metal detectors. People shoved and swore until they got what they wanted: relief.</p>
        <p>Since then, extra truckloads of units have pulled up to the store every weekend. And the weary have continued to arrive. They swear that this is the most unforgiving summer ever, worse than two years ago, worse than ever. They have no proof, no thermometers or gauges, just raw nerves and soaked shirts. They say it's not so much the heat as the humidity that is driving them over the edge. And the long spells: two weeks running, they say.</p>
        <p>Fernando Rivera has rigged five fans in his Bronx apartment. Even with one poised in front of his open refrigerator, the heat keeps him up at night. Yesterday, he walked out of the store $260 lighter, with an air-conditioner in tow, but his peace of mind intact.</p>
        <p>"It's terrible," said Mr. Rivera, 30, who has lived in the Bronx for seven years and works at a private club in Manhattan. "The humidity is just terrible. It's like an oven."</p>
        <p>For Luis Martin, a handyman in the nearby Jackson Avenue housing project, staying cool this summer seemed improbable. He can install an air-conditioner window unit but he can't afford to buy one. A veteran of 48 New York summers, Mr. Martin sticks by his statement: "It's the hottest. Whenever a skinny guy like me starts getting heart palpitations, something is going on."</p>
        <p>He has tried seven showers a day and gallons of water and juice to rehydrate himself. "I'm still drenched in sweat in my bed," he said. "The pillow, the sheets, myself, from top to bottom."</p>
        <p>The housing project is especially brutal, Mr. Martin said, because there is so much concrete and so little green space. He also blames the thinning ozone layer for this summer's woes.</p>
        <p>Some people at the store insisted on buying extra wall units, complaining that just one is not enough to relieve the humidity. Others were replacing burned-out units. "My wife has had it," said Jose Ortiz, who stretched a tape measure across a window unit. "She sent me out here today to buy another one."</p>
        <p>With the temperature expected to rise further, Carmen Gloria Rivera said it was almost impossible to take the Mayor's advice and avoid overexerting herself. Just cooking and walking causes anxiety. Last week she nearly fainted over the stove. Now she doesn't even like to leave the bedroom, where she has one air-conditioner going full blast.</p>
        <p>"I'm saving my money for another one, for the living room," Mrs. Rivera said. "All I do is watch TV in the bedroom in a nightgown. This summer has just been the worst."</p>
