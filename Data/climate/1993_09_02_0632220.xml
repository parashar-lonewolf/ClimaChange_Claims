        <p>Your Aug. 18 report on preparedness for the hurricane season on the East and Gulf Coasts in the aftermath of 1992's Hurricane Andrew and your Aug. 19 article on building a house to withstand a hurricane both neglect climate. Scientists and insurance companies alike are concerned that the increased intensity, frequency and cost of storms may be related to the climate changes caused by global warming.</p>
        <p>As concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases derived primarily from the burning of fossil fuels increase in the atmosphere, Earth's climate could change dramatically. As insured losses from hurricanes and cyclones mount, several international companies have established in-house groups to study climate change.</p>
        <p>Their findings are not heartening. Lloyd's of London -- which suffered $4.33 billion in losses in 1990 -- discovered that from 1966 to 1987, no natural disasters topped $1 billion in insurance losses. But in the next five years alone, 10 catastrophic windstorms cost more than $15 billion in insured losses. Swiss Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, acknowledged that the increase could be "an initial consequence of climatic change."</p>
        <p>While millions of dollars are spent to improve flood walls and levees, little is being done to employ the safe energy that would reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases. No doubt, better building codes and enforcement are necessary, but the great Midwest flood reminds us that the best engineering can be breached by rampaging weather. Real disaster prevention requires kicking our fossil fuel habit. KELLY QUIRKE  Washington, Aug. 20, 1993 The writer is with Greenpeace's climate change campaign.</p>
