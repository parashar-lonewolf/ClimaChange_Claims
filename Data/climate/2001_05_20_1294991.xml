        <p>IT was the morning after Congress took a big step toward giving President Bush much of his proposed tax cut, but the plan's primary architect, Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief White House economic policy adviser, already had other things on his mind.</p>
        <p>The commission appointed by Mr. Bush to develop a plan for private investment accounts in Social Security needed office space, background material and a schedule, Mr. Lindsey was told at his daily staff meeting on the second floor of the West Wing.</p>
        <p>Other issues followed in quick succession:  Delta Air Lines seemed headed toward a showdown with striking pilots at its Comair subsidiary. And the leading industrial nations were establishing a task force to study how to give low-income people better access to computers.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, Mr. Lindsey headed into a meeting on the administration's policy toward government-chartered, shareholder-owned corporations like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a topic of intense interest to Wall Street, the mortgage industry and financial regulators. That afternoon, he  went downstairs to the Oval Office, to brief the president on energy policy, then to a meeting about overhauling Medicare.</p>
        <p>Having watched his father lose the presidency in part because of how he handled the recession of the early 1990's, Mr. Bush has kept economic issues front and center in his administration. And that has put a particular focus -- and onus -- on Mr. Lindsey and the rest of Mr. Bush's team of economic advisers, including the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, and the budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.</p>
        <p>The president came to office with an agenda full of proposals to reshape economic policy along conservative lines: cutting taxes, restraining government spending, giving people the chance to invest their Social Security money, expanding free trade, reducing regulation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his advisers also inherited a slowing economy and all the political risk that comes with it. And they have been confronted with the kinds of unexpected challenges -- like threatened airline strikes, rolling blackouts in California and rising gasoline prices -- that can overshadow or derail even the best-planned agenda.</p>
        <p>Four months after inauguration day, it is too early to judge the team's performance. Its ultimate grade may hinge more than anything else on the depth and duration of the current business cycle downturn, something that is largely out of the administration's control.</p>
        <p>''You're asking about a three-point shot that's still in the air,'' Mr. O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>But the team has avoided the distracting stumbles into unwanted controversies that plagued President Bill Clinton during his first months in office. And it has set into motion many of the biggest items on its to-do list, heartening conservatives with its focus on smaller government, deregulation and individual responsibility.</p>
        <p>To the president's ideological opponents, the team's approach is fiscally irresponsible, a payoff to its corporate patrons and an effort to repackage right-wing policies in a centrist guise.</p>
        <p>But even some of the administration's harshest critics say they have been impressed by the discipline and political touch that the president and his team have brought to pursuing their agenda, especially the tax cut.</p>
        <p>They say the team has been particularly nimble in turning events to its favor. When the economy turned downward, Mr. Bush's tax plan, originally presented as a way to send the federal budget surplus back to taxpayers, became an antirecession program. When gasoline prices surged, the tax cut became a subsidy to help consumers cope with rising energy costs. And Mr. Bush's support for more oil and gas drilling became the solution to the rolling blackouts afflicting California.</p>
        <p>''Tenacity and focus and consistency are the most important aspects of a new presidency,'' said Robert B. Reich, who was secretary of labor in Mr. Clinton's first term.</p>
        <p>''This team has been remarkably effective, unified and focused on getting a huge tax cut,'' Mr. Reich said. ''They've spoken with one voice. They have refused to compromise when that was helpful to them and compromised when they had to. And they've done it without igniting strong public opposition so far.''</p>
        <p>It is a team heavy on corporate and Washington experience, with a strong ideological bent but no close ties to the epicenter of the market economy, Wall Street.</p>
        <p>While it has championed free markets and sought to portray itself as above special-interest politics, it has proved willing to pursue a limited industrial policy in some cases, as in its support for shielding operators of nuclear power plants from liability or in providing government subsidies for clean-coal technology. And while many of its members came to office espousing a policy of blocking international bailouts of countries that get into financial trouble, the Bush team has already backed new International Monetary Fund loans to one strategically important ally, Turkey, and is supporting a package being negotiated by another economically struggling nation, Argentina.</p>
        <p>Getting Their Feet Wet</p>
        <p>Most of the economic advisers are still settling into their jobs. At the Treasury Department, Mr. O'Neill spent his first few months on the defensive over his early remarks on the dollar (he is still establishing his credibility with the financial markets as a defender of a strong currency) and a flap over whether he could hold onto his stock in Alcoa, the company he ran for 13 years (he eventually decided to sell it).</p>
        <p>At the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Daniels has brought a political sensibility to the often arcane world of spending plans and regulation, but he remains little known outside conservative Republican circles.</p>
        <p>Josh Bolten, the deputy White House chief of staff, indulges a renegade streak by riding a motorcycle, but is one of Mr. Bush's most trusted policy advisers. The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, has as much experience in foreign and economic policy as any Republican in Washington, and his  behind-the-scenes role in the Florida election uproar showed that he is a skilled partisan as well.</p>
        <p>Many other appointees will play important roles, too. John B. Taylor, who is awaiting confirmation as under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, is sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is eager to put economic research to work on behalf of Mr. Bush's professed philosophy of ''compassionate conservatism.''</p>
        <p>The team has two important honorary members. One is Vice President Dick Cheney, who has a voice in nearly all domestic policy matters, as he does in foreign policy. The other is Mr. Greenspan, who has close relationships with Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Lindsey and has made no secret of his support for major elements of the Bush agenda, including tax cuts, Social Security investment accounts and free trade. Indeed, when Mr. Bush made his first trip to Washington as president-elect, Mr. Greenspan was the first person with whom he met.</p>
        <p>The Early Leader</p>
        <p>The relative influence of the economic team's various members is difficult to assess this early in the administration. But for now, the hub of policy-making is Mr. Lindsey's paneled office a floor above the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Whatever influence Mr. Lindsey wields -- and outsiders who have dealt with the White House say it is considerable -- is partly a function of his role as director of the National Economic Council. The council coordinates policy across cabinet departments and agencies, not only on highly visible issues like tax cuts but also on the full array of economic and business issues that confront the White House, including those involving trade, the financial markets, technology, labor, regulation and the budget.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lindsey's power is derived more from his close relationship to Mr. Bush. A former Federal Reserve governor and a policy aide in the administration of the president's father, Mr. Lindsey, 46, signed on early as the Bush campaign's economics expert and more than anyone else was the author of the tax-cut plan.</p>
        <p>He is also ideologically compatible with Mr. Bush, leaning slightly to the left of conservative orthodoxy just often enough to buttress the president's compassionate-conservative theme. He persuaded Mr. Bush to use his tax-cut plan to address quirks in the tax code that take a big bite from the earnings of low-income working people, especially single parents.</p>
        <p>But in most ways, his ideological view is traditional. To a conservative like himself, he said, the greatest threat is ''the overweening bureaucrat with the power of the state behind him who may be unchecked in his ability to tell someone how to run his life.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsey says that any suggestion that he has any particular influence with Mr. Bush is exaggerated, and that his main role is to forge consensus on issues before they reach the president. But people inside and outside the administration say Mr. Lindsey's view on what that consensus should be is often heeded, partly because he has a good sense of what Mr. Bush wants.</p>
        <p>While it is difficult to say when his view is the deciding one, Mr. Lindsey rarely seems to be on the losing side of a debate. This year, he argued in favor of dropping Mr. Bush's campaign position that industrial emissions of carbon dioxide should be regulated -- and the position was dropped.</p>
        <p>Along with Mr. O'Neill, he pushed successfully to withdraw American support for an international push to crack down on tax havens in the Caribbean, saying the effort was intended to discourage competition among nations to offer lower tax rates.</p>
        <p>On many economic issues, Mr. Lindsey is the last to offer an opinion to Mr. Bush. He meets with the president at least three times a week for formal economic briefings, where, he said, Mr. Bush often starts by asking, ''Hey Lindsey, when are we going to get some good news?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsey has long had a bearish economic outlook. He sold all his stocks in 1998, saying he wanted to be able to sleep at night, and during the campaign he urged Mr. Bush to think about an inevitable downturn.</p>
        <p>As a result, the new administration was ready to sell its tax plan as an economic stimulus plan when it became clear that the long expansion was faltering.</p>
        <p>''I was somewhat skeptical about the late 1990's, and I had a view that at some point there would be an adjustment,'' Mr. Lindsey said. ''You deal with the hand you're dealt, and one of the first things you do is say, 'This is the hand.' You don't try to bluff your way through. You don't say everything is fine. You say, 'These are the facts, and I have a program that knows how to deal with the facts.' ''</p>
        <p>For now, he said, he sees the economy balanced between a relatively healthy consumer sector and a downturn in technology investment, yielding ''subpar growth, in the zero to 2 percent range.'' He said that economists should be humble enough not to predict when conditions might change -- but that he was optimistic for the long run.</p>
        <p>Not One to Play Games</p>
        <p>At a hearing a few weeks ago before a House appropriations subcommittee, Mr. O'Neill was asked about heavy overtime being worked by the Secret Service, which is part of the Treasury Department. Mr. O'Neill, who knows his way around government from a stint in Washington in the 1970's, gave a polished answer, including the news that he had cut back on his own security detail to save money and to free  agents for more pressing needs.</p>
        <p>But his performance that day was something of an exception. In his first few months on the job, Mr. O'Neill has gained a reputation for blunt talk, impatience with the elaborate political dance that is necessary to get anything done in Washington and a tin ear for the nuances of policy debates.</p>
        <p>At his confirmation hearing, he said he was ''not going to make a huge case'' that Mr. Bush's tax cut was an effective way to keep the economy out of recession -- at a time when Mr. Bush was making just such a case.</p>
        <p>On taking office, Mr. O'Neill decided that he should be able to keep the $100 million in Alcoa stock that he had amassed as chief executive, only to change his mind after it became clear that he would face constant questions about potential conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>As for the debate within the administration on global climate change, he has been criticized by conservatives as not being sufficiently opposed to regulating industrial emissions. And an article in The Wall Street Journal portrayed him as spending considerable time studying worker safety issues at the Treasury Department.</p>
        <p>A result has been a sense outside the administration that Mr. O'Neill is less of a force in the big policy debates than many people had expected him to be, given his success at Alcoa and his long ties to Mr. Greenspan, who as an Alcoa director in the 1980's helped Mr. O'Neill land his job there.</p>
        <p>''The perception is that he's not as much involved as one would expect the Treasury secretary to be, given the nature of the agenda,'' said Bruce Bartlett, an economist at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group.</p>
        <p>The perception is not entirely fair. Whatever his influence, Mr. O'Neill is very much at the center of the action within the administration. He briefs the president regularly and meets for an hour or two a week with Mr. Greenspan, who worked with him at the White House during the Ford administration, when he was deputy budget director. Mr. O'Neill also participates in National Security Council meetings and is host for a regular lunch at the Treasury Department that includes Mr. Lindsey, Mr. Bolten and other officials like Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel I've ever been left out of something I should have been involved in, or included in something that was a waste of my time,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''Having been involved in a lot of other administrations, this one has a nice developing balance about the way we work together. There's a lot of collegiality and volunteered respect among the participants.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. O'Neill has been dealing with an agenda that was set before he joined Mr. Bush's team, especially on taxes. He may have his best opportunity to make his own mark as the administration turns to international economic affairs, particularly its stance toward the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>
        <p>He is deeply skeptical about trying to prop up the currencies of countries in financial trouble. And while he sees the international financial institutions as having a role to play, he says the I.M.F. in particular needs to do a better job of heading off crises rather than dealing with them after the fact.</p>
        <p>The key to dealing with economic problems in developing nations, he said, is ''intervening earlier, which means accepting responsibility for being identified with precautionary action rather than waiting until people's economies are down around their ankles and you rush in like some kind of hero.''</p>
        <p>A Mechanic Who Can Laugh</p>
        <p>Economic policy is usually debated at the lofty plane of the macroeconomy, but it is often carried out at a nuts-and-bolts level. And the ultimate repository of policy hardware in any administration is the Office of Management and Budget, which turns ideology and political compromise into hard numbers and concrete regulation.</p>
        <p>In the Bush administration, the man with the wrench is Mr. Daniels, and he has been using it to carry out Mr. Bush's priorities of holding down government spending, streamlining management of government programs and lifting the regulatory demands on business.</p>
        <p>A political assistant in the White House under President Ronald Reagan, Mr. Daniels subsequently became an executive at Eli Lilly in his native Indiana, but he stayed active in Republican politics and in promoting supply-side economics.</p>
        <p>Last year, he helped run a losing campaign for governor of Indiana, for a conservative Republican, David M. McIntosh, but played no role in the Bush campaign. He was recommended to Mr. Bush by Al Hubbard, an Indiana businessman who is a friend of the president, and within weeks he was helping to write the administration's first budget.</p>
        <p>He has already drawn fire from Democrats for championing a tax cut that they consider reckless and  spending cuts that they say will hurt  the government's ability to address social and economic problems. But if nothing else, he has proved that the administration's chief bean counter has a sense of humor.</p>
        <p>Asked during a news conference last month about a proposed cut in the budget of the Energy Department, he said the previous year's budget had been higher than normal because of the costs associated with wildfires near some research laboratories in the West. ''We had a big debate at O.M.B. and decided not to start another fire this year,'' he said. ''Therefore we did not renew that particular $500 million expenditure.''</p>
        <p>First Florida, Now the World</p>
        <p>Bob Zoellick, a veteran of the White House and the State and Treasury departments in the two previous Republican administrations, spent much of November and December in Florida, helping Mr. Bush capture the final electoral votes he needed. He is now gearing up for a campaign that could be almost as bloody in political terms: winning authority from Congress for Mr. Bush to negotiate trade agreements.</p>
        <p>Expanding trade is a core principle in Mr. Bush's economic plan. But there is a bitter divide in Congress over the issue, reflecting the broader debate in the country and around the world over whether governments should manage the globalization of markets to ease the impact of rapid change on workers, industries and the environment.</p>
        <p>His job will be all the more difficult if the economy continues to weaken, driving up the unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zoellick says that increasing trade by cutting tariffs is the equivalent of a tax cut in terms of helping a slowing economy, and that businesses are increasingly looking at markets abroad as the domestic market cools off. But he knows that he is in for a fight.</p>
        <p>''This is a wonderful opportunity for us to shape the future of the international trading systems, and unfortunately, we're falling behind,'' he said. ''We need to regain momentum globally and regionally and bilaterally. A key element is trying to rebuild support with the Congress and the public.''</p>
        <p>The Rest of the Team</p>
        <p>A number of Mr. Bush's economic aides have lower profiles but are also likely to play crucial roles in policy decisions. At the Council of Economic Advisers, R. Glenn Hubbard will develop the economic rationale for many administration plans, including overhauling the social welfare system and dealing with regulatory issues. A former professor at Columbia University, he is best known for his work supporting the theory that reducing the top income tax rate will generate increased economic activity and for studies suggesting that Americans can move up the economic ladder over their lifetimes.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine being more on the front line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolten, 46, a former investment banker and general counsel to the United States trade representative in the first Bush administration, works a few doors down from the Oval Office as the deputy chief of staff for policy. He ran Mr. Bush's policy development operation during the campaign, and continues to have a hand in almost every decision on economic-related issues, helping to bring together the substance and the politics on any given topic.</p>
        <p>As the Treasury Department's top international official, Mr. Taylor, an economist from Stanford University, will be on the spot the next time an international financial crisis flares. In the past, he has expressed support for encouraging the industrialized nations to coordinate, at least informally, their inflation targets, to help stabilize the relative values of their currencies. And he has advocated shifting the focus at the World Bank from supporting social welfare programs in poor nations to helping them improve productivity and economic growth.</p>
        <p>But some economists say Mr. Bush put Mr. Taylor on his team at least partly to groom him for a bigger job. A world authority on monetary policy, Mr. Taylor would probably be near the top of any Republican president's list of possible replacements for Mr. Greenspan, whose current term ends in 2004.</p>
