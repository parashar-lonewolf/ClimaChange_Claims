        <p>LEAD: On Earth Day 1970, Americans rose up against what they had done to foul the environment. That wave of dismay drove Congress to decree a substantial cleanup of air and water. Twenty years later, on Earth Day 1990, public concern about the environment is again at a peak. And this time the wave washes far beyond American shores.</p>
        <p>On Earth Day 1970, Americans rose up against what they had done to foul the environment. That wave of dismay drove Congress to decree a substantial cleanup of air and water. Twenty years later, on Earth Day 1990, public concern about the environment is again at a peak. And this time the wave washes far beyond American shores. Whether the issue is global warming or ozone depletion, what happens in Eastern Europe or China matters as much as what happens here.</p>
        <p>If, for example, global warming is confirmed, global burning of coal, oil and wood must be sharply reduced. That will be hard for America, traumatic for developing countries. Yet the lesson of the last 20 years is that even the most painful readjustments can be made.</p>
        <p>Cars rolling off Detroit's assembly lines emit 96 percent less carbon dioxide and 75 percent less nitrogen oxides than those of 1970. The Great Lakes have been restored to life and the Hudson now teems with fish. Congress has raised $6 billion to help clean abandoned toxic waste dumps, and $60 billion for building sewage treatment plants. And it's about to rewrite the Clean Air Act, finally tackling the divisive issue of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Some countries cannot afford such expensive solutions. But global threats like ozone-layer depletion and climate change knit all predicaments together. At some point, each country's waste becomes the world's business, whether it be America's profligate use of energy, Brazil's wanton destruction of forests or the miserable pall of Stalinist filth that blights Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The ruination of nature now apparent in East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia shows what environmental indifference can do. Communist central planners faced no public pressure to heed the consequences of pollution. Unchecked, heavy industry spewed poisons into air and water.</p>
        <p>The results were disastrous. Half of Poland's rivers are now too toxic even for industrial use. Acidic industrial fallout has eaten away the faces of Cracow's medieval statues. In Katowice, poisonous gases and toxic dust are so severe that people sleep in salt mines just to breathe clean air.</p>
        <p>And even though East bloc governments have long suppressed health statistics, their savage disregard of the environment seems certain to have taken a heavy toll.</p>
        <p>The contrast between West and</p>
        <p>East makes clear the value of relentless pressure from environmentalists in the U.S., including the organizers of Earth Days past and present.</p>
        <p>At times, their acknowledgment of past accomplishments seems grudging, their warning of future perils excessive, their exhortations to change life styles intrusive. Commute by bus, they cry; don't use disposable diapers, and be sure to separate recyclable materials in the garbage.</p>
        <p>Those are not trivial ways to raise consciousness. But what will count most are economic incentives to save energy and curb pollution, research into new energy-saving technologies, and a reasoned effort to set priorities among threats of widely different risk.</p>
        <p>An America humming on solar cells and wind turbines . . . A Brazil that has at last achieved sanctuary for its irreplaceable rain forests . . . An Eastern Europe on the way to restoring its environment along with its freedoms: these are fitting goals for today's outpouring of concern and tomorrow's work.</p>
