        <p>PLACARDS extolling the environmental virtues of towel reuse have become hotel-room staples, as common as Gideon Bibles and overpriced minibars.

        <p>PLACARDS extolling the environmental virtues of towel reuse have become hotel-room staples, as common as Gideon Bibles and overpriced minibars. The signs, usually placed near the bathroom sink, suggest that guests who forgo their right to fresh towels daily will be doing the planet a favor: fewer towels to launder mean fewer washing-machine loads, which in turn reduces demand for electricity and water.</p>
        <p>Assuming that guests will never embrace the idea of air drying, how might hotels reduce towel turnover even further? Wendy Brodie suggests that they adopt her Bodyflik, a curvy plastic gizmo designed to wipe the water away from flesh. An advertising executive might characterize the Bodyflik as a towelless drying system; Ms. Brodie, a special-education teacher who lives in Penn, England, prefers to call it the human squeegee.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brodie originally designed the Bodyflik with haggard parents, not hotel managers, in mind. ''I have three teenagers, and they think the Magic Towel Fairy washes and dries everything,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In 2003, while grumbling that her life seemed to be nothing more than laundry chores, Ms. Brodie had a revelation: that shower and bath residue could be scraped off the skin, rather than blotted with terry cloth.</p>
        <p>She bought an ordinary window squeegee to test the concept. To soften the squeegee's stiff rubber blade, Ms. Brodie submerged it in boiling water for about 30 seconds. Then she bent the blade into a slight curve, the better for use on arms and legs.</p>
        <p>This initial version was moderately effective at removing water after a shower, but the shape wasn't right for reaching every contour of the body. Ms. Brodie spent months experimenting with various forms, eventually settling on one inspired by the French curve, a draftsman's tool from the days before computer-assisted design. Held vertically with the handle at the top, the Bodyflik resembles a seahorse more than anything else.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brodie hired a local plastics factory to begin stamping out Bodyfliks in 2004. But the first models off the assembly line were too thin and light, and thus no match for wet skin. ''They were actually quite wobbly,'' Ms. Brodie said. She spent an additional $3,800 to have the factory remake the Bodyflik's injection mold.</p>
        <p>The revamped product, priced around $9.35, went on sale in February 2005 at Bodyflik.co.uk. (A smaller ''sport'' version is available for about $1.90 less.) Ms. Brodie, who refinanced her family's mortgage to obtain start-up capital, estimates that she will break even once 10,000 Bodyfliks have been sold; she is about halfway to that goal.</p>
        <p>Most of the buyers have been individuals, although she hopes to crack the hotel market by stressing the Bodyflik's environmental advantages. She says that by extending the period between towel washes, each Bodyflik can save hundreds of gallons of water annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brodie doesn't contend, however, that the Bodyflik eliminates the need for towels; even after a good squeegeeing, she said, a bather will need a quick towel pat-down to finish the drying job.</p>
        <p>The Bodyflik purports to remove roughly 75 percent of the water clinging to a bather. My own tests would put that closer to 65 percent. The product worked best on my limbs, less so on my back and chest. It also doesn't address the issue of sopping wet hair, which made Bodyfliking my shoulders seem a somewhat fruitless task. Bald consumers may enjoy better results.</p>
