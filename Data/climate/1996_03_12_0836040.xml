        <p>BY unintentionally substituting the wrong gas for one they intended to use for hardening tools, workers at a small metallurgical company have accidentally  hit upon a potentially valuable method for coating objects with a hard diamond film.</p>
        <p>Specialists trying to learn why and how the method works warn that it has yet to prove its worth in industrial processing. But if the new diamond-coating technique proves to be as cheap, fast and effective as its inventors say, it may revolutionize the manufacture of machine tools, automobile engines, ships, beverage cans and much more, materials experts say.</p>
        <p>Although the discovery was made two years ago, it has not been reported in scientific journals, and information about it has spread mainly by word of mouth. Nevertheless, it has spurred excitement among potential users, including  the armed forces and the automotive and packaging industries.</p>
        <p>The discoverer of the new method is Pravin Mistry, a 43-year-old British metallurgist who founded a small, privately owned engineering company, QQC Inc., in Dearborn, Mich., as an affiliate of Turchin Inc., a maker of machine tools. Mr. Mistry's company specializes in applying coatings to industrial objects slotto impart desirable properties.</p>
        <p>"This is an interesting instance of technology leading science," said Dr. Rustum Roy, who heads the Diamond and Related Materials Center at Pennsylvania State University. "There is no question that this fellow is coating all kinds of things with diamond, and doing it astonishingly rapidly and well, under conditions that no scientists imagined would work."</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Mistry's method involves four powerful and finely tuned laser beams, which interact as they scan the surface of an object as it is coated. As  Mr. Mistry explains it, the scanning takes place in a gaseous environment, and the intense heat at the spot where the lasers converge breaks up some of the gas into an electrically charged plasma. The lasers also vaporize a very thin layer  of the object being coated.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roy, who is investigating the process at Penn State, believes that chemical reactions occur between the surface of the object and the ionized atoms of the gas, forming an ultrastrong bond. By continuing to deposit atoms from the hot gas on the coated object, the thickness of the coating can be rapidly increased to thicknesses up to a half inch, Mr. Mistry said.</p>
        <p>"This technique might be used to produce many different kinds of coating besides diamond, and it could be engineered for special requirements," Dr. Roy said. "It takes only a minute or so to apply one kind of coating, and you could  use several coatings on the same object. For example, you might want to coat part of a gear to harden it and another part of the gear for corrosion resistance."</p>
        <p>In 1994, Mr. Mistry's group made its discovery while using this interacting laser technique to apply a coating of hard titanium diboride to the surface of an aluminum object. An error in their procedure set the stage for a surprise that may prove to be immensely profitable for all concerned: someone accidentally substituted carbon dioxide for the nitrogen gas used in the process. A dense coating formed rapidly, but it did not consist of the intended  titanium diboride. It turned out to be diamond.</p>
        <p>News of the discovery spread rapidly among materials experts, who were amazed that Mr. Mistry's technique for coating objects with diamond films was reportedly 1,000 times faster than existing diamond-coating techniques. Moreover, the Mistry process promised to form particularly strong bonds between  the coating and the metal objects to which it was applied, a vital requirement for hardened machine tools.</p>
        <p>The United States Navy, Army and Air Force, and the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as automotive companies, are following developments with interest.</p>
        <p>"I have seen objects coated using Mr. Mistry's process, and I can verify that the coating is diamond," said Dr. Robert Pohanka, director of materials research at the Office of Naval Research in Arlington, Va. "I have visited the plant and seen the equipment.</p>
        <p>"The key issue will be cost," he said. "Can you make things at reasonable cost using this technique? How large an object can be coated? How strong is the  bonding between the object and the coating? These questions all must be answered."</p>
        <p>Mr. Mistry said in interviews that the technique was in its infancy, but that all indications suggested that the coating was cheap and could be applied in closely controlled shapes and thicknesses, with excellent adhesion to objects.</p>
        <p>If the Mistry process lives up to expectations, Dr. Pohanka said, it could be used to apply hard coatings to gears and bearings, to cover pumps and other machinery with corrosion-resistant coatings, to protect the windows of combat vehicles from scratching and erosion, and to harden engine components to reduce  wear.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roy, whose research group has undertaken an investigation of the scientific basis of the Mistry process, believes it could be used almost like a  paint brush to apply coatings of diamond or other special materials.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Mistry's equipment is operated by robots under computer control," he said, "and since the method is so flexible, it might some day be possible to coat an entire ship's hull with a film made of diamond or some other protective  material."</p>
        <p>Mr. Mistry has applied for more than 30 patents covering various aspects of his invention, and several have already received approval, he said. He predicts  that his method will find widespread application in special tools and dies that  can machine aluminum and other metals without requiring a liquid coolant. Coolants, which remove heat from objects being machined, pose environmental problems. Scrubbing every trace of coolant from a metal object is expensive, particularly when the object is an aluminum beverage can that must be absolutely clean.</p>
        <p>Diamond-coated tools, Mr. Mistry said, aid the "dry machining" of aluminum engine blocks, beverage cans and many other things. In conventional machining, the object being shaped heats up, but in dry machining, most of the heat is carried away by chips and filings that fly off, leaving the object being machined relatively cool. But to work, the tool must be extremely hard, and diamond coating is a way to achieve the necessary hardness.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade, toolmakers and other manufacturers have experimented  with diamond coatings applied to objects by a process known as chemical vapor deposition, or C.V.D. Ordinarily, the object to be coated is placed in a chamber containing a high-pressure, high-temperature mixture of methane, or some other carbon-based gas, and hydrogen. The gases are heated by hot filaments or radio waves, breaking up the methane into its constituent carbon and hydrogen atoms. The electrically charged carbon atoms settle on the object to be coated, many of them arranging themselves as crystalline diamond, rather than as graphite, another crystalline form of carbon.</p>
        <p>The chemical vapor method is simple and cheap in comparison with the high-pressure technique used since the 1950's to make synthetic diamonds. In the last decade, many companies have experimented with carbon-vapor diamond films as scratchproof coatings for sunglasses, ultrahard sheaths for steel machine tools, heat-conducting radiators for electronic chips, flat-panel video displays and rigid resonators used in loudspeakers to improve high-frequency sound.</p>
        <p>Some of these films have consisted mostly of diamond, while other coatings, called "diamondlike," consist largely of graphite with some diamond crystals mixed in. But though dozens of companies manufacture carbon-vapor diamond coatings for a large range of products, their success has been spotty and the technology has progressed much more slowly than innovators had hoped.</p>
        <p>One reason, according to Dr. William F. Banholzer, manager of engineering for the General Electric Company's Superabrasive program, was that many "diamondlike" films lacked the strength and adhesion to harden tools effectively. They tended to flake away from metal.</p>
        <p>"The chemical vapor deposition technique was terribly hyped," Dr. Banholzer said, "and these days, most large companies are canceling their C.V.D. programs."</p>
        <p>Another factor that has worked against the development of synthetic diamond materials is a precipitous decline during the last five years in world prices for industrial diamonds. The cheapest industrial diamond abrasive, called "loose chip abrasive," is made in enormous quantities by China using a high-pressure, high-temperature method, and these diamonds are sold for as little as 20 cents per carat.</p>
        <p>"Mind you," Dr. Banholzer said, "I don't want to put down or discourage Mr. Mistry or others working in this field, but we have yet to see how much his technique is really worth in commercial terms. Cost, performance, adhesion and ease of production all need to be evaluated."</p>
        <p>In pure, crystalline form, most carbon is graphite, which consists of molecular sheets of elemental carbon atoms linked together into planes and arranged in a pattern something like that of chicken wire. Graphite is a slippery, black substance used as a lubricant and for making pencil lead, among  other things.</p>
        <p>But when subjected to enormous pressure, the spaces between carbon atoms in graphite are compressed, forcing the atoms to rearrange themselves into compact  eight-sided crystals -- crystals of diamond.</p>
        <p>Most natural diamond crystals are black mixtures of diamond and graphite, and are used as abrasives. But occasionally diamond takes the form of pure crystals, transparent gems.</p>
        <p>Natural diamonds are believed to have been created by the great pressures and high temperatures that prevail deep in the earth's crust and mantle. Whether natural or synthetic, diamond has properties unique among all other known substances; diamond is the hardest known material, it has the highest refractive index (a measure of the degree to which a material bends light), and it conducts heat faster than anything else, faster even than copper. Diamond can also act as a semiconductor, and it has been proposed as a base material for electronic chips, replacing silicon.</p>
        <p>Although there are several claimants to having synthesized the first diamonds, it was General Electric that manufactured the first large gem quality  diamonds, and the company still makes them.</p>
        <p>In the early 1950's, G.E. engineers built a gigantic press that mimicked the  natural diamond-forming process by subjecting graphite to huge pressures and temperatures. The technique, while very expensive, produced gem diamonds of high quality and large size.</p>
        <p>But to G.E., "gems are not a business; they are an aspect of sociology," Dr.  Banholzer said. "Wives don't seem to accept the idea that a synthetic gem diamond is the same in substance and quality as a natural diamond. The price for synthetic and natural gem diamonds is about the same -- around $2,000 a carat. But gems will never be a big market for us."</p>
        <p>To manufacturers, however, a securely bonded diamond coating that is able to  extend the life of a drill or die or saw or axle by thousands of times would be worth its weight in gold. Such a coating may at last be within reach.</p>
