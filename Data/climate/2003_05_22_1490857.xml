        <p>Christie Whitman's resignation as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency leaves the environment without a single reliable defender inside the Bush administration. Even Mrs. Whitman's voice had grown less constant and increasingly faint. She arrived in Washington with respectable credentials as a defender of the regulatory framework that for 30 years had brought the nation cleaner air and water. But she soon found herself overwhelmed by the lobbyists and ideologues President Bush installed in every other important environmental job, and by a White House that valued its corporate constituency far more than it cared for the environment.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's announced reason for leaving is her desire to return to her home life in New Jersey. But she must surely be thankful to leave behind a bureaucratic struggle in which she usually emerged the loser.</p>

        <p>Christie Whitman's resignation as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency leaves the environment without a single reliable defender inside the Bush administration. Even Mrs. Whitman's voice had grown less constant and increasingly faint. She arrived in Washington with respectable credentials as a defender of the regulatory framework that for 30 years had brought the nation cleaner air and water. But she soon found herself overwhelmed by the lobbyists and ideologues President Bush installed in every other important environmental job, and by a White House that valued its corporate constituency far more than it cared for the environment.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's announced reason for leaving is her desire to return to her home life in New Jersey. But she must surely be thankful to leave behind a bureaucratic struggle in which she usually emerged the loser.</p>
        <p>The bright spots in her tenure included her decision to order General Electric to clean up the PCB's in the Hudson River and her determination to uphold and enlarge upon Clinton-era rules on diesel exhaust. Of the many setbacks, the most embarrassing was President Bush's decision to renounce the Kyoto Protocol on global warming only weeks after Mrs. Whitman had assured America's European allies that the administration was committed to finding ways to reduce greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>She also found herself in the awkward position of having to renounce and rewrite various rules governing industrial air pollution, rules she had vigorously defended when she was governor of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Finally -- and again under White House pressure -- she initiated a review of key sections of the Clean Water Act that some fear could weaken longstanding protections for wetlands and streams.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's admirers say she should never have signed on with the Bush crowd in the first place, given its fundamental hostility to the federal regulatory tradition that the E.P.A. so conspicuously represents. Even so, Mr. Bush may well seek out another ''moderate'' in order to present a more environmentally friendly face to the electorate in 2004. That, of course, will be nothing more than a cynical gesture if Mrs. Whitman's successor ends up wielding as little power as she did.</p>
