        <p>LEAD: THE 1987 Beaujolais nouveau, a sprightly potion so tantalizingly scented that it deserves to be sold at perfume counters, is gushing all over the United States.</p>
        <p>THE 1987 Beaujolais nouveau, a sprightly potion so tantalizingly scented that it deserves to be sold at perfume counters, is gushing all over the United States.</p>
        <p>The best new wines comprise a garden of earthly pleasures: they are ruby, sweet-smelling and tasting but bone dry, and seductively fruity. Mostly under $6, they are as light on the wallet (despite the sinking dollar) as they are in the glass.</p>
        <p>This year's eight-week-old nouveau, served slightly chilled, can brighten a Thanksgiving dinner of turkey, meat or fish, and can heighten the conviviality.</p>
        <p>Nouveau is released, by French law, on the third Thursday of November. This rite, which ballooned in the 1970's, is carried out amid the wine trade's ''spontaneous'' hoopla, which falls just short of hiring the angel Gabriel and his horn for the ultimate fanfare. Critics deplore the artificial excitement and pseudoromance that accompany a product whose raison d'etre is, arguably, a quick cash flow for winegrowers.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, I sampled 23 nouveaus that will be sold in the New York area. The tasting for the trade and the press was sponsored by the International Wine Center, a Manhattan wine school.</p>
        <p>Nouveau, or ''primeur'' as it is also called, carries two appellations of origin on the label: Beaujolais-Villages and, simply, Beaujolais.</p>
        <p>Beaujolais-Villages nouveau is the more winsome, less one-dimensional of the pair. It is a blend of wines from grapes grown on the granitic, sandy clay soils in the rolling hills and valleys surrounding 39 communes in the Haut-Beaujolais, the Beaujolais region's northern sector.</p>
        <p>More straightforward Beaujolais comes from grapes cultivated in the chalky, clay sedimentary soil of the Bas-Beaujolais, the flatter southern sector.</p>
        <p>Of those tasted, I liked 17. The distances in quality between my 10 top favorites were tiny, but were a degree greater among the remaining 7.</p>
        <p>As usual, Georges Duboeuf's artfully blended, neatly balanced Beaujolais-Villages sets the pace. (It is $5.99 at full 50 percent markup; the representative is William J. Deutsch, Chappaqua, N.Y.) In a near photo finish, the soft, generous Mommessin Beaujolais-Villages ranked second ($5.99; William Grant &amp; Sons).</p>
        <p>And in a welcome discovery, third place went to the rich, round Beaujolais-Villages of Pierre Ferraud, a shipper whose wine had been unfamiliar to me ($6.49; Mayfair Vintners, White Plains, N.Y.).</p>
        <p>The other brands followed in this order of preference: Sylvain Fessy Beaujolais ($5.75; Negociants, U.S.A.). Paul Beaudet Beaujolais-Villages ($5.99; Admiral Wine Merchants). Maison Jaffelin Beaujolais ($4.99;</p>
        <p>Premiere Wine Merchants). Jean Paul Selles Beaujolais ($4.99;</p>
        <p>Jason Brooke Imports). Jean Bedin Beaujolais ($4.99; Hoffman Imports of New York). Reine Pedauque Beaujolais ($4.99;</p>
        <p>Premium Wine Marketing, Brooklyn, N.Y.). Prosper Maufoux Beaujolais-Villages ($5.79; House of Burgundy). Gabriel Aligne Beaujolais ($5.99;</p>
        <p>Bernhard Horstman &amp; Partners). Barton &amp; Guestier Beaujolais ($5.60; the Seagram Classics Wine Company). Villamont Beaujolais-Villages ($5.29;</p>
        <p>Schenk U.S.A., Portchester, N.Y.). Bouchard Pere &amp; Fils Beaujolais ($5.49; International Vintage Wine Company, Jersey City, N.J.). Lupe-Cholet Beaujolais-Villages ($4.99; Everest Wines). Bichot Beaujolais-Villages ($3.99;</p>
        <p>L'Aiglon Wine and Spirits Import Company). Philippe Antoine Beaujolais-Villages ($4.59; Societe Distribution Vins Fins, Commack, L.I.).</p>
        <p>A laudable uphill effort to broaden the spectrum of dry kosher wines was foiled by the unpleasant Codobis Beaujolais-Villages (Everest), the costliest ($7.99) and poorest nouveau shown. While rabbinical supervision raises production costs, there is no technical reason why kosher wines cannot meet the quality standards of nonkosher competitors.</p>
        <p>The charm of the nouveau wines lies entirely on the surface, except for a few that aspire to a quarter-inch of complexity. This frivolity makes them ideal quaffing wines for parties until New Year's Eve, when Champagne takes over. Besides, they are so short-lived they should pretty much be finished by then.</p>
        <p>French vintners are touting the '87 Beaujolais harvest as outstanding. But no matter how glorious, nouveau can never outshine the finest Beaujolais from the nine main Haut-Beaujolais communes, whose names are as enchanting as their wines are floral.The quality of the '87 nouveau is a promise of what is to come from the communes' wines, which are maturing in barrels and vats and will arrive next spring. These wines - from lightest to heaviest, judged by their weight and complexity - are Chiroubles, Brouilly, Cote de Brouilly, St.-Amour, Fleurie, Chenas, Morgon, Julienas and Moulin-a-Vent.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the nouveaus are textbook - ''classic'' is too august a word - examples of this mini-genre. Since no two harvests are alike, the generally balanced '87 nouveaus differ from the acidic 84's, opulently grapy 85's and somewhat lean 86's.</p>
        <p>Hints of cherry, raspberry and strawberry that randomly pop up in the nouveaus contribute to their confectionery appeal; generally, the acid is refreshing and the alcohol level seems proper.</p>
        <p>Good nouveau, like a good joke well told, evokes a smile. Though French winegrowers and shippers ''own'' the patent on nouveau, they have spawned imitations that resemble bad jokes badly told, especially certain American nouveaus made from French-American varietals.</p>
        <p>However, one California winery, Charles F. Shaw, caught the Gallic spirit in its tasty '87 Napa Valley Gamay Beaujolais Nouveau ($6.18; Cazanove-Opici Import Corporation).</p>
        <p>The fruitiness of nouveau is preserved by a speedy vinification method that the French call carbonic maceration and the Americans call whole-berry fermentation.</p>
        <p>Instead of being crushed, grape clusters are placed in closed vats. Once the weight of those on top breaks those on the bottom, natural yeasts trigger the fermentation, and the resulting carbon dioxide envelops all the fruit. As fermentation proceeds inside each berry, flavor and color (but little tannin, the agent of aging) are extracted.</p>
        <p>The November issue of Market Watch, a trade magazine, reports that while nouveau remains popular, nationwide ''the trade's general consensus is that the 'Beaujolais boom' has peaked.'' Nouveau sales topped out at a little more than one million cases in 1984, dropped to 879,000 in 1985 and rose to 956,000 in 1986.</p>
        <p>Critics properly complain that nouveau reduces the volume of wine that could be transformed into more sophisticated Beaujolais. Still, since most consumers do not store and age wines, vintners everywhere are producing fast-selling, early-drinking reds and whites. Beaujolais nouveau is the acme of that trend. So why get indignant over a butterfly?</p>
