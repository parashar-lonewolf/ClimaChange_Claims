      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Saying that the last six years had ''shaken the faith of many Americans in our government,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed a series of initiatives on Friday to make the federal government more competent, effective and thrifty.</p>
        <p>In a wide-ranging speech that attacked the Bush administration for its handling of Hurricane Katrina, the controversy over the replacement of United States attorneys and fraud involving government contractors in Iraq, Mrs. Clinton characterized the current White House as having ''a stunning record of cronyism and corruption, incompetence and deception.''</p>
        <p>In the address, her first major policy speech on the campaign trail, she proposed to restrict no-bid government contracts sharply and make the details of all government contracts available online, along with the budgets of government agencies. Mrs. Clinton also called for extending the whistle-blower shield law to government employees, and said she would ban members of her cabinet and other high-ranking administration officials from lobbying her administration after they left.</p>
        <p>Most strikingly, Mrs. Clinton proposed eliminating as many as 500,000 private contractors from the federal payroll, a move she said would save $10 billion to $18 billion a year.</p>
        <p>She criticized the rapid privatization of government services under the Bush administration, saying that some contractors cost more than comparable federal workers while being less accountable and less competent.</p>
        <p>''Just think of what happened at Walter Reed,'' she said, referring to recent reports of poor health care and services at the Army medical center of that name in Washington. ''When the Army was forced to outsource maintenance to private contractors, the number of people doing maintenance dropped dramatically, the contractor cut corners, fell down on the job, and our soldiers paid the price.''</p>
        <p>A White House spokesman said that as a matter of policy, the administration did not comment on political attacks from the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>The address came before a largely sympathetic audience: a capacity crowd of about 250 students and faculty members at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College. Mrs. Clinton is in New Hampshire for two days of campaigning in the nation's first primary state, and was planning two public forums to court local Democrats.</p>
        <p>While pledging to reduce government waste, Mrs. Clinton also proposed the creation of two government entities and the re-creation of a defunct agency, the Office of Technology Assessment. That office was established in the 1970s to advise Congress on new technologies and evaluate government, but was abolished by Congressional Republicans in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said the last six years had freshly demonstrated the relevance of such an agency.</p>
        <p>''The administration has tried to turn Washington into an evidence-free zone, whether it's on stem cell research or Plan B contraception or pollution or global warming or the safety of our food, or the quality of our air,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Harking back to efforts by her husband's administration to streamline the federal government, Mrs. Clinton said she would create an agency to track public subsidies to businesses and help identify waste and fraud.</p>
        <p>''This isn't about big government or small government,'' she said. ''This should be about smart government.''</p>
        <p>Though she did not bash any government-issued ashtrays with a hammer -- as Vice President Al Gore did in 1993 in a television appearance to illustrate labyrinthine federal procurement regulations -- Mrs. Clinton did take a rhetorical hammer to the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>''For the past six years, we've had an administration that doesn't believe in less government, or smaller government, or better government,'' she said. Accusing the Republican Party of having ''contempt'' for government, she asserted that the administration had used federal agencies and contracts ''as a source of favors for private interests.''</p>
