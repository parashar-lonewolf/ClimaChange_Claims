        <p>RESEARCHERS are finding ways to answer a question that haunts every cancer patient: Why me?</p>
        <p>The explanation, they say, can be found deep within the cells of the body in biological factors called markers. Like the smoking gun in a crime novel, markers are physical evidence of the foul interplay between cancer-causing agents in the environment and a person's genes.</p>
        <p>But as in all whodunits, the true villain can be the one who arouses least suspicion. The new research shows that cancer is not primarily caused, as many Americans tend to think, by the poisons spewed into the air, water and land by uncaring industrialists. Rather, each person is born with various genetic susceptibilities, essentially weak spots in their genetic makeup, that play a leading role in the cellular mayhem called cancer.</p>
        <p>For example, researchers have found that some people have genes that enable their bodies to detoxify chemicals rapidly, including the carcinogens found in cigarette smoke and natural carcinogens found in foods. Others are born with slow acting varieties of the same genes; their bodies are less efficient at getting rid of carcinogens. If exposed to large enough quantities of the chemicals, these slow detoxifiers are more likely to get cancer. Differences in Susceptibility</p>
        <p>The research sheds light on a vexing question. Why do some people who smoke cigarettes and eat an unhealthy diet live to be 90 while others who live healthy lives succumb to cancer at a young age?</p>
        <p>Researchers from around the world are beginning to get a handle on this question by studying genetic differences among individuals and the way environmental carcinogens affect their cellular machinery. The subject is being discussed this week at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, being held in Dallas, and is the topic of an increasing number of scientific articles. The most recent appears in the current issue of the journal Nature. It shows that slow detoxifiers exposed to secondhand smoke have more cancer-causing chemicals bound up with their DNA than fast detoxifiers.</p>
        <p>The classic methods for studying cancer risks have been very frustrating, said Dr. Frederica Perera, a leader in biomarker research at Columbia University's School of Public Health in New York City. Epidemiologists, who study large populations of people over time, have made great strides in linking cancer to chemicals, she said, although since the deaths usually occur decades later, long after exposure to the chemicals took place, making the connections is often problematical.</p>
        <p>With the tools of molecular biology, however, Dr. Perera said: "We can get inside the black box everyone talks about. We can get some fingerprints on environmental carcinogens and look for their targets inside cells."</p>
        <p>Molecular toxicologists and molecular epidemiologists are looking for physical signs of damage in human cells. Some, called adducts, are chemicals bound up with DNA or proteins.  Others are gene and chromosome mutations, alterations in DNA repair enzymes, various forms of enzymes for metabolizing foreign chemicals and levels of nutrients in the bloodstream.</p>
        <p>Adducts are formed when chemicals stick to DNA, Dr. Perera said. Unless the damage is repaired before the cell divides, mutations can occur that may lead to cancer. Sometimes the adduct may attach itself to a length of junk DNA, where it does the body no harm. At other times, with the luck of a crap shoot, it may damage DNA that controls cell division. Exposure to Pollution</p>
        <p>Adducts are often found in people exposed to pollution, Dr. Perera said. For example, foundry workers have varying levels of a chemical, polyaromatic hydrocarbon, bound to their DNA, depending on their exposure to the chemical and their innate ability to detoxify chemicals.</p>
        <p>People living in the polluted air of a large city in Poland have more adducts and chromosome aberrations than people living in the cleaner air of a Polish village. And women exposed to polyaromatic hydrocarbons from the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial sources have varying levels of adducts in their breast tissue, depending on their genetic makeup. Such findings may help determine why one woman gets breast cancer and her next-door neighbor does not.</p>
        <p>Work is continuing to see if biomarkers like these can predict who will get cancer, Dr. Perera said. Researchers are looking for such adducts in blood samples stored 10 and 15 years ago, she said, to see if they foretell disease in given individuals.</p>
        <p>Another kind of physical damage to cells that can lead to cancer is a set of mutations in an important gene known as p53. The gene's normal function is to suppress cancerous changes in the cell, and these are very prone to develop when the gene is inactivated by mutations. Recent studies have shown that several environmental carcinogens cause mutations at characteristic sites on the p53 gene. In other words the site of the mutation on a person's p53 gene will indicate whether it was induced by ultraviolet light, aflatoxin from peanut mold or cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ilan Kirsch of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., is studying another type of biomarker involving the inherent instability of human DNA. DNA tends to jump about and recombine in ways that drive evolution, Dr. Kirsch said, but such recombinations can also cause cancer.</p>
        <p>The marker is an inverted DNA sequence that is found in one of every 5,000 to 50,000 white blood cells in the human body. Located on chromosome 7, it is an "innocent genetic aberration," Dr. Kirsch said, because it seems to cause no harm in most people.</p>
        <p>But other people have a genetic defect in which the chromosome 7 aberration is 100 times higher than normal, Dr. Kirsch said. They develop leukemia or lymphoma 100 times more often than people with the innocent aberration.  Farmers and Pesticides</p>
        <p>With this clue in mind, Dr. Kirsch is studying the chromosome 7 marker in farmers exposed to pesticides. He said chemicals could influence a person's baseline level of genetic instability, making DNA alterations more or less likely at any given time. In summer, farmers show an increase of chromosome 7 inversions as they apply pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, Dr. Kirsch said. In winter, the marker returns to normal levels. This fluctuation suggests that farmers who develop cancer have less stable DNA than those who do not.</p>
        <p>A third type of marker consists of enzymes found in the liver and other tissues. The human body has evolved families of enzymes for metabolizing chemicals -- the natural carcinogens in food as well as drugs and industrial compounds. When a chemical comes into contact with a cell membrane, it is met by enzymes that render the chemical more or less water soluble. If all the chemical is thus transformed, it is excreted completely from the body. Sometimes, however, a chemical can be altered into a form that makes it prone to binding with DNA or protein, raising the risk of cancer.</p>
        <p>There are wide genetic variations in these enzyme systems, said Dr. William Evans, a pharmacologist at St. Jude Children's Hospital at the University of Tennessee in Memphis. In some people an enzyme may be very slow acting; they can be easily poisoned by the drugs or chemicals detoxified by that enzyme. Others may inherit a fast-acting form of the enzyme, he said. Their bodies deactivate the drugs or chemicals handled by that enzyme with lightning speed.</p>
        <p>"We have observed ten- to one hundred-fold differences in enzyme activity," Dr. Evans said. Enzyme activity often declines with age, helping to explain why cancer tends to be a disease of old age. And enzyme activity varies between ethnic and racial groups, he said, providing clues about different cancer rates among races.</p>
        <p>These differences explain why the standard anti-cancer drug, 5-fluoro-uracil, is toxic to some people and ineffectual in others, said Dr. Robert Diasio, a pharmacologist and cancer expert at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. A person with normal amounts of the enzyme DPD clears the drug in 8 to 10 minutes, he said. A person with abnormally low amounts needs 159 minutes to clear the drug, which can be fatal. Others with super-fast DPD enzymes clear the drug in seconds and get little or no therapeutic effect from standard doses, he said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, people with low amounts of an enzyme that detoxifies pesticides will be more prone to pesticide poisoning than a person with a fast acting form of the enzyme.</p>
        <p>At the cancer institute, Dr. Frank Gonzalez has developed an assay using different forms of these human enzymes to test which chemicals are detoxified by which enzyme. Such information may ultimately help determine individual cancer susceptibilities.</p>
        <p>Variations in immune system genes can also affect cancer rates. For example, Hispanic women with one form of an antibody-forming gene are especially vulnerable to the wart virus that causes cervical cancer.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a person's lifetime exposure to sex hormones plays an important role in a third of all cancers, said Dr. Brian Henderson, a cancer expert at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Sex hormones cause certain tissues to proliferate, he said, causing the accumulation of random genetic errors. External mutagens like cigarette smoke and the chemicals at factories are not likely to be of major importance in many such cancers.</p>
        <p>Finally, nutrition plays a role in who gets cancer, Dr. Perera said. Many compounds have been isolated from food that prevent tumors from growing, slow down damage from oxygen radicals and promote enzyme efficiency. Broccoli and soy products are particularly beneficial. A marker called quercitin indicates the amount of fruits and vegetables a person eats and can be used to track who gets cancer and who does not, she said.</p>
        <p>Each person has strengths and weaknesses in the innate ability to detoxify chemicals. The goal, Dr. Perera said, will be to help people avoid the chemicals to which they are vulnerable and to obtain the right nutrients that protect against cancer.</p>
