        <p>LEAD: The United States Department of Energy will begin ''a major export initiative'' to help American oil-service companies gain business abroad, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Energy Secretary, said today.</p>
        <p>The United States Department of Energy will begin ''a major export initiative'' to help American oil-service companies gain business abroad, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Energy Secretary, said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, speaking at the World Energy Conference here, said the Government would seek to ''assist American business in identifying opportunities and overcoming barriers to effective competition in international projects.''</p>
        <p>The American oil-service industry has shrunk sharply since the collapse of oil prices in 1986 nearly closed the drilling business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore also repeated President Bush's pledge to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year, a sensitive point in eastern Canada, where the emissions have been proven to cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>He said he expected the President's clean air package to pass Congress, but added: ''Is it going to be quick? No. Is it going to be easy? No. Is it going to emerge unchanged? Probably not.''</p>
