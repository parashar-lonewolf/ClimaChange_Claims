        <p>After a final flurry of horse-trading, Senate and House negotiators today put the finishing touches on an energy bill that should lower electricity prices and set new efficiency standards for many home appliances but do little to decrease the country's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Congress first took up energy legislation after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But two years of back-room haggling, filibuster threats, and skirmishes between the oil and auto industries and environmental groups gradually pruned the bill to a shadow of its former self.</p>
        <p>By the time the House and Senate passed similar versions earlier this year, the two most far-reaching provisions -- to permit oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to bolster automobile fuel efficiency -- were spiked. Effects of Legislation</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, as elements of the bill are phased in over the next few years, motorists will be more likely to drive cars fueled by natural gas or methane, home buyers will receive lower interest rates on mortgages for better insulated homes, and businessmen eventually could become more willing to take a chance on investing in new nuclear power plants because of a streamlining in licensing rules.</p>
        <p>While few in the Congress or the Administration are enthusiastic about the legislation, both Republicans and Democrats have said they wanted to prove they could accomplish something before the Congressional session ended.</p>
        <p>"We can't leave and leave the work of the nation undone," said Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and a principal author of the bill.</p>
        <p>"We are very pleased with and fully support the progress made by the conferees in moving that much closer to final passage of the energy bill," said Laura Melillo, a White House spokeswoman.  The most far-reaching provision would revamp 1935 utility regulations, increasing competition between utilities in generating power and removing restrictions on smaller power companies from using power lines controlled by larger utilities.</p>
        <p>Leon Lowery, a lobbyist for Environmental Action, said the measure would "mean the profit margin for electric generation is lower and that means that conservation and efficiency will look better to utilities as investments."</p>
        <p>The measure also authorizes the Energy Department to provide financing to banks to offer lower interest rates for investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.</p>
        <p>In a 12-hour conference session that ended early today as the bill was approved, the pruning continued as Mr. Johnston and Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the leading House member of the conference, deleted or watered down provisions that hurt industries in their states.</p>
        <p>Concerned about the impact on the auto industry, Mr. Dingell weakened a requirement that Government and private vehicle fleets purchase more cars, trucks and buses that run on alternative fuels by requiring a finding by the Secretary of Energy that fuels such as methane or ethanol are available at low prices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston insisted that a measure intended to restrict the ability of natural gas producing states from controlling prices be stricken, and replaced by a nonbinding "sense of the Congress" line calling for competitive natural gas pricing. Environmental Groups' Reaction</p>
        <p>Environmental groups had generally expressed cautious support of the legislation until today. But they sharply denounced many changes bargained by the conferees, including the last-minute inclusion of a restriction on the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for radiation exposure at the proposed radioactive waste dump site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.</p>
        <p>Nevada's two Democratic Senators, Richard H. Bryan and Harry M. Reid, said they would use procedural delays to force Senate leaders to delete the Yucca Mountain provision, and kill the entire bill if they fail. They could be joined by Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, who is concerned the bill will open the way to drilling in environmentally sensitive offshore areas of his state.</p>
        <p>The Administration successfully lobbied to delete a section containing a moratorium on oil drilling off much of the outer continental shelf and enabling the government to purchase back leases off the Florida, North Carolina and Alaska coasts.</p>
