        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your May 8 front-page article on the global warming negotiations at the United Nations in preparation for the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, you report: "Scientists who are advising the talks here say that if the heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere at present rates, the earth's climate will warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, with possibly catastrophic effects on the world's climate."</p>
        <p>John B. Oakes (Op-Ed, May 8) writes of "a catastrophe in the making that, unless checked, will raise sea levels, drown coastal areas and change agricultural production before the end of the 21st century."</p>

        <p>In your May 8 front-page article on the global warming negotiations at the United Nations in preparation for the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro, you report: "Scientists who are advising the talks here say that if the heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere at present rates, the earth's climate will warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century, with possibly catastrophic effects on the world's climate."</p>
        <p>John B. Oakes (Op-Ed, May 8) writes of "a catastrophe in the making that, unless checked, will raise sea levels, drown coastal areas and change agricultural production before the end of the 21st century."</p>
        <p>Those judgments cannot be supported by hard and consistent scientific evidence. Some of the country's leading scientists, working through the George C. Marshall Institute, recently concluded that "computer models have considerably exaggerated the size of the greenhouse effect" and that "the sun has been the controlling influence on climate in the last 100 years, with the greenhouse effect playing a smaller role . . . a few tenths of a degree."</p>
        <p>According to Charles River Associates, an economics research organization also doing studies on this issue, a mandate to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at or below current levels in the United States could require a new tax of $200 a ton of carbon burned. That would mean a new tax on oil of $26 a barrel, on natural gas of $3.20 per thousand cubic feet and on coal of $120 a ton -- more than doubling oil and natural gas prices and increasing the price of coal fivefold.</p>
        <p>This could mean a 2 percent drop in our gross national product in the last half of the 1990's, resulting in a drastic impact on jobs, as well as on our standard of living. We are facing the equivalent of a $100 billion tax on Americans without solid scientific evidence.  WILLIAM F. O'KEEFE Executive Vice President American Petroleum Institute Washington, May 15, 1992</p>
