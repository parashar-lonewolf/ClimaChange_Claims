        <p>CHINA SYNDROME Trade Complaints Renewed "We will not wait forever," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said as Washington warned Beijing's leaders to end the pirating  of software, music and movies or face stiff trade sanctions. American officials  said the Chinese were dragging their feet on enforcing an agreement reached earlier this year to close 29 factories that churn out millions of illegal copies of American films and software. The piracy has cost American businesses at least $800 million this year, they said.</p>

        <p>CHINA SYNDROME Trade Complaints Renewed "We will not wait forever," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said as Washington warned Beijing's leaders to end the pirating  of software, music and movies or face stiff trade sanctions. American officials  said the Chinese were dragging their feet on enforcing an agreement reached earlier this year to close 29 factories that churn out millions of illegal copies of American films and software. The piracy has cost American businesses at least $800 million this year, they said.</p>
        <p>SETTLING G.M., Warner-Lambert Fined General Motors will pay an $11 million and an additional $34 million to recall a half-million Cadillacs, settling a Federal complaint that it had installed a computer chip that overrode emissions controls and caused the cars to emit illegal amounts of carbon dioxide. Warner-Lambert pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid $10 million for concealing faulty drug manufacturing processes.</p>
        <p>LABOR Pass the Salt The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a union tactic known as salting was legal. Particularly popular among construction industry unions, salting involves encouraging union officials and members to take jobs with nonunionized employers, hoping to persuade co-workers to organize. The Court ruled that such  organizers had the same legal protection as any other employees and that employers could not try to root them out or refuse to hire them. The ruling upholds the policies of the National Labor Relations Board, which are under attack in the Republican-controlled Congress.</p>
        <p>TOBACCO Penetrating the Smoke Federal and state prosecutors began interrogating Jeffrey S. Wigand, former research chief at Brown &amp; Williamson, the nation's third largest tobacco company, after overcoming the company's attempts to block his appearance. The testimony was taken in private and officials were barred from discussing his answers, but they said their questions focused on to what extent the company covered up and falsified evidence about tobacco's harmful effects.</p>
        <p>MEA CULPA Contrition Over Daiwa -- From the Regulators "The bottom line is that we did not succeed in unearthing Daiwa's transgressions where we might have," Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said at a Congressional hearing. New York State's Superintendent of Banking was  similarly abashed. Daiwa Bank of Japan has acknowledged that it secretly lost $1.1 billion in bond trading over 11 years; a Federal grand jury has accused the bank's management of conspiring to conceal the losses. Daiwa has been ordered to shut its American operations by early next year. MEA CULPA (2) Barings Trader Pleads Guilty A week after being formally charged and jailed in Singapore, Nicholas W. Leeson, whose trading losses put the British investment bank Barings P.L.C. out of business, struck a plea bargain with the authorites, pleading guilty to fraud and forgery while nine other charges were dropped.</p>
        <p>DEFENESTRATION A Shuffle at Hearst D. Claeys Bahrenburg, who ran Hearst's magazine group for five and a half years, was ousted. Cathleen P. Black, chief executive and president of the Newspaper Association of America, a trade group, and former president and publisher of USA Today, was named to replace him. The magazines, which include Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar and Redbook, have had a mixed performance recently.</p>
        <p>NETWORKS New Dawn at CBS Westinghouse took its first steps to overhaul CBS since completing its acquisition, naming a management team, talking of some staff cuts and replacing some CBS executives. Bill Korn, Westinghouse's top broadcasting executive, was named president of the newly combined station group, the nation's largest with 15 television and 32 radio stations, and also executive vice president of CBS Inc. Two other Westinghouse executives were put in charge of CBS's television stations and CBS Radio. Westinghouse also topped an NBC offer and landed Bill Cosby's new sitcom for CBS.</p>
        <p>DEALS No Sign of a Letup The multibillion-dollar wave of mergers, acquisitions and breakups continued, with Aetna agreeing to sell its property and liability insurance groups to Travelers for $4 billion; Rite Aid proposing to buy Revco and Broken Hill Proprietary seeking Magma Copper, each for $1.8 billion. Wolters Kluwer of Amsterdam is paying $1.9 billlion for CCH, a business law and tax publisher, and Baxter International plans to spin off its hospital-supply business, largely undoing its $3.8 billion acquisition of American Hospital Supply. In two deals worth a total of a half-billion dollars, Barry Diller said his Silver King Communications would buy the Home Shopping Network and Savoy Pictures Entertainment.</p>
        <p>PRIVATIZATION Are License Plates Next? Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said New Jersey had given a $64.2 million contract to a private company to provide health care for the state's prison system, which has 26,000 inmates. The decision to hire Correctional Medical Services of St. Louis, a managed-health-care company, reflects her desire to curb state spending by hiring contractors to provide some services.</p>
