        <p>The photo ops are guaranteed to promote Canada as a pristine oasis of Rocky Mountain tranquillity when President Bush and the other Group of 8 leaders discuss the world's problems Wednesday and Thursday in the resort village of Kananaskis.</p>
        <p>But the Canadian security forces are preparing extraordinary measures in this normally quiet Victorian capital and around western Alberta Province to control the kind of violent demonstrations that marred the last such meeting of industrial world leaders, in the Italian port city of Genoa, and the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City last year.</p>
        <p>A wide assortment of protest groups have been quiet about their exact plans. But they have organized a few thousand demonstrators from around Canada and the United States to march this week against globalization, free trade and perceived corporate greed, while supporting ratification of the Kyoto treaty as an antidote to global warming.</p>
        <p>Kananaskis, the leaders' picture-postcard meeting place 60 miles west of Calgary, consists of three small hotels, a post office and a general store set in the shadow of soaring Mount Kidd and amid two lush golf courses. They are not likely to see any protests there, which is perhaps the main reason Prime Minister Jean Chrétien chose the spot.</p>
        <p>His goal was to minimize the amount of time leaders spent in high-security motorcades and maximize the time talking face to face, without the distraction of protests and journalists. He has said he will try to focus the leaders on Africa, hoping they will agree that it needs more aid, trade and investment -- especially in those countries that strengthen democratic institutions and pursue free market policies.</p>
        <p>However, in light of President Bush's demand on Monday that Yasir Arafat be replaced as Palestinian leader before the United States will support an independent Palestinian state, it now appears likely that the leaders will try to resuscitate a Middle East peace process.</p>
        <p>Another likely topic is recently increased subsidies for American farmers and higher American tariffs on steel and softwood lumber.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chrétien told reporters on Monday that although he was committed to allowing free, peaceful protest, he would not tolerate violence. Canada was shaken in April 2001 by the scene of thousands of protesters clashing with police officers at the Quebec summit meeting of hemispheric leaders, which resulted in nearly 400 arrests and injuries to 300 police officers, protesters and bystanders.</p>
        <p>With Ottawa the expected site of most protests this time, federal officials are girding in readiness to face a group of demonstrators who call their coalition Take the Capital. There is concern that anarchists may try to rush Parliament Hill, the symbol of Canadian democracy.</p>
        <p>To minimize possible damages, workers have taken down the wrought-iron lighting fixtures that line the parliamentary entranceway and built a steel and concrete bunker around the Centennial Flame monument, which was first lighted on New Year's Eve 1966 to commemorate the country's 100th birthday.</p>
        <p>The National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography and other cultural and business institutions will close early on Wednesday or not open at all during the summit meeting.</p>
        <p>''We are entitled to have demonstrations,'' Mr. Chrétien said. ''I even organized some in my youth. But they have to be peaceful. Nothing has to be destroyed, and the police force is taking the required measures.''</p>
        <p>As for the Kananaskis region, only one road runs through it, which will simplify the security task for the 4,500 police officers and 6,000 soldiers protecting the leaders. The plan is for the forces to block the road and secure a 15-mile perimeter around the village. Any protesters who try to break through the perimeter will face not only troops equipped with assault rifles but also the possibility of an encounter with cougars, wolves and grizzly bears.</p>
        <p>A 330-mile-radius no-flight zone has been extended over the village, with any violators to be either forced or shot down by CF-18 fighters or ground-to-air missiles. The total cost of security for the two-day meeting has been estimated to exceed $200 million.</p>
        <p>In Calgary, city workers erected a concrete barrier around City Hall and another fence around the media center where international journalists will receive summit briefings. The city government has rented two armored vehicles capable of withstanding gunshots for riot control.</p>
