        <p>President Bush spent an Earth Day marked by record-high gas prices promoting his support for hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars, but Democrats said that the vehicles were years away from reality and that the president needed to do more to relieve sticker shock at the pump.</p>
        <p>Such was the state of the political battle over gas prices on Saturday, when Mr. Bush went to West Sacramento to tour the California Fuel Cell Partnership, a consortium of 31 car makers, energy companies and government agencies, and Democrats fired off press releases from Washington attacking the administration's energy plans.</p>
        <p>''This nation does not have to choose between a strong economy and a clean environment,'' Mr. Bush said in remarks at the Fuel Cell Partnership, where he was flanked by two boxy-looking prototype hydrogen cars. ''We can have both at the same time.''</p>
        <p>Cars powered by fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen from the air in a chemical reaction. Mr. Bush said there were about 100 hydrogen cars on California roads, but as of late last year, only one was being tested by consumers, the Spallino family of Redondo Beach, Calif., who had an experimental Honda FCX worth about $1 million.</p>
        <p>''I strongly believe hydrogen is the fuel of the future,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that he thought that today's children would take their driving tests in hydrogen-powered cars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks came as part of an effort to appear proactive about the problem of high gas prices, one that Democrats are increasingly using against the Republicans in this midterm election year.</p>
        <p>Although the president declared in his State of the Union address that ''America is addicted to oil'' and then presented a series of alternative energy proposals, Democrats have said the plans are not adequate. Mr. Bush, they say, should address consumption more aggressively and not oppose higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars.</p>
        <p>In a Democratic response to Mr. Bush, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said the president needed to take ''more dramatic steps,'' including conservation and raising the mileage standard for all passenger vehicles to at least 40 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>''The crisis is coming,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''And so America must act now, before soaring prices and a dependence on foreign oil puts a chokehold on our economy and military.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's energy proposals for the fiscal year that begins in October call for $289 million for hydrogen fuel technology, up from $53 million this year; $54 million for coal plants that would capture the carbon dioxide they produce; $148 million for solar power, up from $65 million this year; $44 million for wind power, up $5 million from this year; and $150 million for ethanol from cellulose, up $59 million from this year.</p>
        <p>The General Motors Corporation and the Department of Energy have committed $44 million to a fuel cell demonstration project, with G.M. pledging to put 40 fuel cell vehicles on the road in New York, Washington, California and Michigan by 2009. The department has also signed fuel cell development agreements with the Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler and the Hyundai Motor Company as part of a broader, five-year, $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative announced by Mr. Bush in his 2003 State of the Union address.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush began Earth Day with a bike ride through a foggy redwood forest in the Napa Valley wine country, where he had spent the night after a dinner on the Stanford University campus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush headed later in the day to a fund-raiser for the Republican National Committee in Indian Wells, where he raised $2 million, and was to remain overnight on Sunday in Rancho Mirage.</p>
