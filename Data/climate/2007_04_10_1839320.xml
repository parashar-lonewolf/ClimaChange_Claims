        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-13</p>
        <p>Shiites Rally to Demand End to U.S. Presence in Iraq</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of protesters loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric, rallied in the holy city of Najaf to demand an end to the American military presence in Iraq. Residents said the demonstration was the largest in Najaf, the heart of Shiite religious power, since the American-led invasion in 2003. A1</p>
        <p>Iran Claims Defy 2 U.N. Edicts  Iran claimed that it is now capable of industrial-scale uranium enrichment, a development that would defy two United Nations resolutions. Western diplomats and nuclear experts said the declaration seemed to have more to do with political showmanship than technical progress. A3</p>
        <p>China Dissident Cites Coercion  Gao Zhisheng, one of China's most outspoken dissidents until his conviction on sedition charges late last year, said in a recorded statement that while he had received a light sentence in exchange for his confession, it had been made under mental and physical duress. A10</p>
        <p>New Heat on Italy Captive Swap  The government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came under fierce attack after the Taliban said it had killed an Afghan hostage who was a colleague of the Italian journalist freed last month in a controversial prisoner swap.  A12</p>
        <p>Ban on Sailors' Selling Stories  After protest over a decision to allow some of the sailors and marines captured by Iran to sell their stories to the media, Britain's defense secretary reversed the decision, banning sales entirely.  A11</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A14-19</p>

        <p>Immigration Turns to DNA Tests  Federal officials are increasingly turning to genetic testing to verify the biological bonds between new citizens and the overseas relatives they hope to bring here, particularly those from war-torn or developing countries where identity documents can be scarce or doctored. But the tests can uncover unexpected and sometimes unbearable truths.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Convict Tests Church's Faith  A church in California, sustained by the belief that embracing all people is a living example of Christ's love, faced a profound test in faith when a convicted child molester asked to join. Congregants are now wondering if all are truly welcome.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>A Challenge to Emission Rule  The fight over cars and carbon dioxide moves from the Supreme Court to a federal courtroom in Burlington, Vt. The auto industry is suing to block a 2004 California regulation, which Vermont would follow, from taking effect.</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Guard Told of Deployments  About 13,000 National Guard soldiers from Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Arkansas got an official heads-up that they should expect possible deployment to Iraq by year's end or in 2008, sooner than scheduled and underscoring just how profoundly the National Guard's role has shifted since 2003.</p>

        <p>Raid on Home Shines Light On Immigration Tensions  A raid by federal agents on the home of a Hispanic family in East Hampton, N.Y., is the latest escalation in a wave of crackdowns driven by complaints against immigrants. The family members, all of whom are American citizens, see the raid as a violation of their rights. But to some residents, it was an overdue response to long-simmering concerns about illegal immigration on Long Island's East End. B1</p>
        <p>They Robbed the Mob  A federal trial now getting under way is expected to shed light on the 1992 execution-style killings of a young couple from Queens who robbed a series of mob social clubs armed with an Uzi submachine gun. A man prosecutors say is a Gambino crime family captain has been charged. B1</p>
        <p>New Restaurant Rat Patrol  New York City's health department is revamping how it inspects restaurants for potential rodent infestation after a review prompted by a widely seen news video of rats swarming in a KFC/Taco Bell restaurant in Greenwich Village. B3</p>
