        <p>To call Al Gore a cautious politician is greatly to understate the case, like calling Robin a polite sidekick or cauliflower less than spicy. The Vice President is a man so pinched in public that he uses the passive voice to issue a call to action.</p>
        <p>Take the speech he delivered in Tokyo on Monday before flying here:</p>
        <p>''Active engagement on environmental issues is needed from all of us,'' Mr. Gore declared, during the crescendo of his address, delivered at a conference on the environment.</p>
        <p>Before the speech, Mr. Gore's aides distributed excerpts that they thought might prove especially newsworthy. Here is one, in its entirety, which Mr. Gore delivered as written: ''Multilaterally, 1997 affords a number of important opportunities to make progress on the international environmental agenda.''</p>
        <p>The View at Arm's Length</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Gore's evident passion for his index cards, which he grips in both hands during even brief remarks, his aides are taking no chances on this trip.</p>
        <p>Discussions abroad, of course, are always delicate, particularly in China. But for Mr. Gore this trip has been further complicated by questions back home about Democratic campaign finances.</p>
        <p>Reporters have been locked out of most of his events, including even a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's press secretary, Ginny Terzano, said reporters had been kept out because that event was a ''working meeting'' to prepare Mr. Gore for a discussion with the Japanese Prime Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto. For a similar stated reason, reporters are being barred from a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce here. And they are being kept away from all of Mr. Gore's banquets in Beijing. Mr. Gore's aides say that in keeping the press out they are acceding to Chinese requests.</p>
        <p>Reporters are being allowed glimpses of Mr. Gore at work with his Chinese counterparts -- for instance today, when he presided over the signing of a big car-and-planes deal.</p>
        <p>But even that required long political discussions in the White House, and the restrictions generally mean that there will be no television images of Mr. Gore hobnobbing with wealthy businessmen -- or breaking bread with the leaders of a country that the Justice Department is investigating for trying to funnel money to Democrats. Today, Mr. Gore was presented with a glass of champagne to celebrate the business deals. But he did not smile when he clinked glasses with Prime Minister Li Peng.</p>
        <p>Poetry in Motion</p>
        <p>Even with all of these caveats, this is the highest-profile trip Mr. Gore has made. He has been feeling his oats and trying his wings, essaying occasional flights of rhetorical fancy that at times seemed to carry him into the big, blue beyond. As it were.</p>
        <p>In a speech in Tokyo before flying here today, he referred three times to cherry blossoms, which for diplomats is an evergreen (no metaphor intended) of United States-Japan relations.</p>
        <p>He called them ''a vivid symbol of the elegance and fragility of nature,'' and later he invoked the translation of a haiku: ''In the midst of the cherry blossoms, none are utter strangers.'' By this he meant that it was a ''fitting time to renew and extend our bonds of partnership.''</p>
        <p>When he arrived here last night, Mr. Gore switched to Chinese poetry and rivers. In a written statement, he quoted from ''On Stork Tower,'' a poem about a view of the Yellow River by Wang Zhi-huan, who lived during the Tang dynasty. ''If you desire a grander sight/Then you must scale a greater height,'' it reads, in part.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore went on to note that ''the landscape of U.S.-China relations is filled with many rivers, some flowing together, others flowing apart.''</p>
        <p>''But to see the currents of greatest confluence,'' he said, ''we must continue climbing the steps of Stork Tower. That is why I am here.''</p>
        <p>It may have been no coincidence, as they say, that later in the evening Leon Fuerth, the Vice President's national security adviser, promised that in Mr. Gore's meetings with Chinese officials this week, ''basically, they will cover the waterfront.''</p>
        <p>The Real Al Gore Stands Up</p>
        <p>After Vice President Gore marched stiffly and officiously through a series of appearances and pronouncements in Japan about carbon dioxide levels and the possible link between Asian monsoons and El Nino, a completely different Al Gore flew to Beijing.</p>
        <p>It was not that Japan had changed the Vice President, but that on his airplane the fiercely buttoned-down Mr. Gore briefly displayed his other side -- the funny, knowing person that his friends and aides insist is the real Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore ventured back onto Air Force Two with a photocopied article that had been thrust into his hands by a soldier during his visit this afternoon to the Yokota Air Base north of Tokyo.</p>
        <p>''Alert Engineers Repulse VC in Hand-to-Hand Fighting,'' read the headline on the dispatch from Vietnam.</p>
        <p>The article, from the military journal Stars and Stripes, was dated April 28, 1971, and bylined Specialist Albert Gore. ''Through the darkness,'' it began, ''a band of shadowy figures moved silently toward the U.S. fire base.''</p>
        <p>With a grin, Mr. Gore submitted the article to reporters traveling with him as evidence that he had once been one of them. But one insisted that Mr. Gore further demonstrate his credentials, asking what he had thought of his editor.</p>
        <p>''He sucked,'' the Vice President said, offering a common reporters' lament, to sympathetic laughter.</p>
        <p>Later, after Mr. Gore departed, Larry McQuillan of Reuters wryly disputed his view. ''I was the assistant bureau chief in Saigon,'' he said, looking over the story. ''I may well have edited this.''</p>
        <p>The information was conveyed to Mr. Gore. Ms. Terzano reported his response: ''I'm not backing down.''  Reporter's Notebook</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 26, 1997, Wednesday</p>
        <p>Articles yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's visit to China misstated the day of his arrival and the day of the signing of a major Chinese-American trade deal in some copies. The Vice President arrived in Beijing on Monday, not yesterday, and the trade deal was signed yesterday, not on Monday.</p>
        <p>One of the articles also misstated Mr. Gore's role at the signing ceremony for the deal in some copies. He was a witness but not a signer.</p>
