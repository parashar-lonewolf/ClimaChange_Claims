        <p>AFTER five years of study, a five-month moratorium on shoreline construction and a string of often-contentious public hearings, the Town of Southampton appears near to banning new bulkheads, steel walls, seawalls, rock revetments and other hardened erosion-control structures along its fabled ocean shores.</p>
        <p>The nearly total prohibition on shoreline armoring, a landmark step that would formally change longstanding policies of coastal management and property rights, is part of a larger scheme for a measured and orderly retreat from the coast backed by environmental groups and gaining support among New York State agencies and the Army Corps of Engineers, which has jurisdiction over the country's navigable waters and seashores.</p>
        <p>''We are going to severely restrict people from putting hardened structures in front of their homes,'' said Steven Kenny, the Southampton town councilman who introduced the proposal. ''As part of the generally accepted coastal policy of strategic retreat, we are going to get homes as far back from the dunes and oceanfront as possible.''</p>
        <p>The measure could become law in the town as early as March. But local property owners with deep pockets have mounted a determined effort to hold their ground, which is valued at hundreds of dollars per square foot, and an initial push to hasten their retreat has weakened even as the anti-armoring effort has advanced.</p>
        <p>Backers of the Southampton move, which would be carried out in amendments to the town's Coastal Erosion Hazard Law, say a ban on shore hardening is necessary to preserve the town's Atlantic beaches, regarded by some as among the finest in the world.</p>
        <p>They said that in cases where beaches vanish and water reaches armoring, the public right of use and passage below mean high tide, guaranteed by law, is taken away. A colonial patent also grants town trustees an easement above the high-tide line.</p>
        <p>''In an eroding area, if you have a hardened structure, over time you will actually have theft,'' said Carolyn Zenk, a Southampton town councilwoman and an environmental lawyer who supports the measure.</p>
        <p>Areas affected by the proposed amendments would include ocean shorelines in the hamlets of Water Mill, Bridgehampton and Sagaponack and in unincorporated areas on the Westhampton barrier island. Shorefront property within incorporated villages, including Southampton, Quogue, Westhampton Beach and West Hampton Dunes, would not be restricted.</p>
        <p>The amendments would put Southampton in the forefront of towns, cities and resort communities along the East Coast in setting policies that prevent shorefront property owners from throwing up walls against the sea. Many coastal experts say these structures, while protecting private property, end up obliterating beaches and causing erosion in adjoining areas.</p>
        <p>''We've learned our lesson -- they are a disaster,'' Ms. Zenk said.</p>
        <p>Existing armoring would be allowed to remain, but could not be rebuilt if -- or when -- it is destroyed by storm or a rising sea level. The only exception would be for one type of temporary structure, long tubes filled with sand, that the town would permit for a maximum of nine months for emergency protection or while buildings are repaired and/or relocated farther from shore.</p>
        <p>The tubing could not exceed six feet in height and would be intended to get a homeowner through one winter storm season only, after which the tubes would be cut open to release the sand. Owners would also be strongly encouraged and given incentives to move their homes back.</p>
        <p>Owners of oceanfront homes and properties in Southampton seemed to be taking all this in stride. But they are vigorously contesting a second part of the amendments that would increase home setbacks from 100 feet to 150 feet behind dunes and in other ways regulate the use of their land.</p>
        <p>They said the additional amendments trampled on their private property rights and in many cases would leave owners with too little room to rebuild or relocate if homes were damaged, destroyed or threatened by storm erosion. The amendments would expand regulation under the coastal erosion hazard law to areas inland of the dune and also restrict the clearing of natural vegetation.</p>
        <p>The owners also take offense at suggestions that they imperil the shore.</p>
        <p>''It's shockingly undemocratic,'' said John Bennett, a lawyer in Southampton for a group of about 15 oceanfront property owners. ''These people are wonderful stewards of their land. You see them planting dune grass and putting up snow fences and building up the dunes. They are the true stakeholders. The town board members who are pushing this just don't get the East End culture.''</p>
        <p>The owners' lawyers and coastal experts say there is nothing in the town's five-year study of its coastlines that suggests increased setbacks would have any impact on coastal erosion. Indeed, the amendments have given new momentum to a simmering campaign to create a new Village of Dune Hampton out of a seven-mile-long oceanfront area from the eastern boundary of the Village of Southampton to the East Hampton town line. Such a village, like the others in the town, could impose its own shoreline regulations.</p>
        <p>''We are looking to control our destiny in our little special area,'' said Stuart D. Baker, a member of the incorporation committee and an oceanfront owner, who said the committee would pursue incorporation regardless of what the town did.</p>
        <p>Laura Hildreth, a consultant to the committee, said the town board had alienated itself from the owners. ''They just don't trust the town board anymore because of the way that they have acted and the attitudes they have shown,'' she said. ''They seem not to be advocates, but more the adversaries of the people on the beach.''</p>
        <p>But to the surprise of supporters, the owners seem far less focused on the armoring ban, a signal of a general acceptance of the notion that private shore-hardening projects may be a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>''If this were just about hardened structures and clearing restrictions, the law would have passed already,'' Mr. Bennett said.</p>
        <p>Steven Kenny, the town coun-cilman who with Ms. Zenk advanced the amendments, said he made changes to provide incentives for owners to move homes farther from the beach and to ease proposed restrictions on setbacks on the inland side of properties. The changes will also make it easier for owners to rebuild homes.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to recognize property owners' pre-existing rights along the coastline,'' said Mr. Kenny, a professor of economics at Suffolk County Community College.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kenny, who spent summers on the ocean in what is now the highly developed Village of West Hampton Dunes while growing up in Freeport and Bay Shore, said that what he described as the suburbanization of ocean shore areas detracted from the town's heritage and natural beauty. ''We are beginning to see lawns and tennis courts,'' he said. ''There has been a trend in these beach areas of these looming structures right on the property line.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennett, who lives and practices in Southampton, sees a different picture. ''I have European clients who say what's so wonderful is that the beach is so lightly developed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kenny, a resident of Remsenburg since the mid-1970's, said he hoped for a meeting of the minds. ''This is one of those classic public policy issues where the private interest comes into conflict with the public interest,'' he said. ''And at the end of the day I am hoping that the property owners can share in preserving the natural beauty of the coastline.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kenny and Ms. Zenk, who is from Hampton Bays, now appear to have the support of the Town Board's swing vote, Dennis A. Suskind, a Democrat from Bridgehampton. Of the three, Mr. Suskind, a retired general partner in Goldman Sachs who lives in an oceanfront area, is the most connected to the affected property owners.</p>
        <p>In July, Mr. Suskind reluctantly joined the other Democrats, Mr. Kenny and Ms. Zenk, in approving a five-month moratorium on new construction in oceanfront areas within the town, provided it was not extended. The moratorium expired late last month.</p>
        <p>The board's two Republicans -- the town supervisor, Patrick Heaney, and Councilwoman Linda Kabot -- opposed the moratorium.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Suskind is again in the swing position. After initially opposing the proposed amendments to the Coastal Erosion Hazard Law as ''a little heavy on property rights,'' he said last week that the changes offered by Mr. Kenny had won his support.</p>
        <p>''As it is written now, except for little touch-ups, it accomplishes its goal of setting the stage for maintenance of our beaches as well as protecting the rights of people who built homes there over the last 50 years before we understood what was happening to the beaches,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suskind said he ''basically embraced'' coastal retreat. ''On the other hand, you don't have to retreat to Ronkonkoma,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Donna Giancontieri, an executive assistant to Mr. Heaney, said Mr. Heaney wanted to review the most recent changes in the amendments before commenting. Ms. Kabot did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The backers have been warned that a fourth vote may be necessary. Mr. Bennett and other lawyers contend that a super-majority is needed because the amendments, though couched within the Coastal Erosion Hazard Law, amounted to zoning changes. Mr. Bennett said that when enough owners protested such a change, as he said they had, state law required the super-majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kenny said he believed he would get the fourth vote. But backers acknowledged that the amendments, even in softened form, were unwelcome among owners. ''There are some people, I am sure, who would like this to go away forever,'' Ms. Zenk said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suskind said he had been repeatedly buttonholed. ''People I have known for many years and some people I don't know have come to see me and said they don't want us to do anything,'' he said. ''They say they will protect the beaches because they care about them. I believe them, but I don't think the town can just depend on 300 people doing what they think is right. And you also don't know who they are going to sell their house to.''</p>
        <p>Six states -- Maine, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Oregon -- have rules against armoring shorelines. But Orin Pilkey, a professor emeritus of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University in Durham, N.C., said exceptions made many of the restrictions ineffective.</p>
        <p>''Southampton is a community that has been trying to get to the bottom of this problem for many years,'' said Dr. Pilkey, an opponent of hardened structures. ''I'm impressed with their toughness.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pilkey said sea level rise made retreat from the ocean shore inevitable over the next several generations. ''We could either retreat in a planned and strategic fashion, or in tactical disarray in response to natural disasters,'' he said. ''Of course, we can build massive walls that will hold the shoreline in place for a longer time, but then you won't have a beach.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pilkey said he was not surprised that oceanfront owners in Southampton were paying more attention to setback requirements than a ban on armoring. ''People on the shoreline in general are very shortsighted,'' he said. ''The setback requirement is an obvious limitation to development. They won't get quite the same view of the sea, so that's an immediate problem.''</p>
        <p>Robert DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork, an environmental and planning organization, said the ban on armoring was the most meaningful part of the amendments. ''From our standpoint, that's the primary objective,'' he said. ''It is the strategy of getting out of the way of the ocean as opposed to standing in its way.''</p>
        <p>But Jay Tanski, a coastal geologist at New York Sea Grant who has studied South Shore erosion, questioned a blanket ban on hardened structures. ''As a rule, prohibitions against any particular form of erosion control is not necessarily the best way to go,'' he said. ''The decision should be made on a case-by-case basis. In some cases that might mean you would allow a bulkhead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tanski said that property owners' legal challenges to local restrictions left judges to manage shorelines. ''And a judge probably has a lot less of an understanding of what's happening on the shoreline than a lot of the other people involved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Wayne D. Bruyn, a lawyer in Southampton for several oceanfront property owners, said future challenges to the armoring prohibition were probable. ''The time will come when there are significant erosion issues, and the review of this statute, if it gets adopted, will be right in the forefront,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruyn argued that existing town regulations already effectively prohibited hardened structure on the beach. He said the amendments would take away owners' rights to apply to the town's zoning board of appeals for variances.</p>
        <p>The amendments now under consideration had their roots in the winter of 1998, when a series of punishing northeasters tore away ocean shores east of Southampton Village in an area where owners had sued the town for permission to erect steel bulkheads.</p>
        <p>One owner, the real estate magnate William Rudin, had erected a cofferdam that jutted into the sea, blocking public passage along the shore. Prior to the 1998 storms, Mr. Rudin replaced the cofferdam with a 20-foot-high embankment of sand tubes to protect his $1.6 million home. The town agreed to the structure as an alternative to a steel bulkhead.</p>
        <p>In January 1998, the structure, whose cost Mr. Rudin declined to reveal but which was locally estimated to have cost more than $1 million, was exposed by waves and collapsed. Mr. Rudin's house was damaged beyond repair and the remains of the exposed structure and the house became a spectacle.</p>
        <p>''This really strange, bizarre structure sat on the beach sort of like something from outer space, and visible for miles,'' said Ms. Zenk, who cited the event as her reason for running for the town board. Mr. Bruyn, a lawyer for Mr. Rudin, said Mr. Rudin now planned to build a new home.</p>
        <p>The sand has now returned to the shoreline area where the Rudin house stood, people familiar with the area said.</p>
