        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The caption on the photo of bicycle traffic in Ho Chi Minh City accompanying your ''Phnom Penh Journal'' (Jan. 9) calls bicycling a ''primitive'' means of transportation. The further implication is that although bicycles outnumber cars in traffic there, progress will reverse that.</p>
        <p>The situation for most developing countries is very different from the late 19th century in the West, where the bicycle industry was the precursor to the automobile and aircraft industries. Economic and resource constraints make it most unlikely that societies such as Vietnam will take this route.</p>
        <p>In global ecological terms, moreover, it is not clear that such development would be welcome. Air pollution, the greenhouse effect and resource depletion will escalate dramatically if the entire human population reaches the high energy use of societies that rely heavily on the private automobile.</p>
        <p>Sensible and sustainable transportation development will see industrial countries moving toward a combination of efficient mass transit and human-powered transport like the bicycle, rather than the automobilization of developing countries.</p>
        <p>Signs are in evidence. The president of the Volvo Corporation has called for elimination of cars from the urban areas of Sweden. Bordeaux, France, plans to eliminate motor traffic from 50 percent of its streets within 10 years. In Italy, partial car bans are in effect in the centers of Naples, Milan, Bologna and Florence.</p>
        <p>New York City public officials have yet to offer a serious initiative to restrict auto traffic. They will have to if New York is ever to become a truly livable city.</p>
        <p>JON ORCUTT</p>
        <p>New York, Jan. 23, 1990</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a bi-cycle advocacy organization.</p>
