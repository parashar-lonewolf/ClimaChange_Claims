        <p>LEAD: USING computerized measuring techniques, scientists are tracking with new precision the erosion that is eating away 90 percent of the nation's coasts.</p>
        <p>USING computerized measuring techniques, scientists are tracking with new precision the erosion that is eating away 90 percent of the nation's coasts.</p>
        <p>Their findings are bad news, especially for the 295 barrier islands that lie like beads on a necklace along the coast from New England to Texas. The islands, long sandy strips of land immediately off the coast, are home to many of the nation's shore resorts and coastal towns.</p>
        <p>The sea has been rising relative to the land for at least 100 years, geologists say, and most agree that erosion is going to accelerate as global warming melts the polar ice packs, sending sea levels even higher.</p>
        <p>The barrier islands are adapting to the rising sea by slowly migrating to higher elevations inland; as their seaward dunes erode, new dunes rise just behind them. But in the process, structures newly exposed to the sea are often undermined. When heavy storms hit, dozens of houses can be destroyed, as happened on the outer banks of North Carolina in March.</p>
        <p>Over the last 100 years, the Atlantic Coast has eroded on average 2 to 3 feet a year, said Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland. The average yearly erosion on the Gulf Coast is 4 to 5 feet, he said, and in some places, it is much worse. The south shore of Martha's Vineyard is losing about 10 feet a year, while Cape Hatteras, N.C., is losing 12 to 15 feet, and Louisiana is losing 30 to 50 feet a year.</p>
        <p>''It's no secret any more what's happening on the coast,'' Dr. Leatherman said. ''Ten years ago we didn't have good data on erosion rates. Now we do, and we know about 90 percent of the coast is eroding.''</p>
        <p>The threat has driven many communities to seek refuge behind seawalls and jetties, only to find that these costly engineering projects often make the erosion worse, either for them or for neighbors down the coast. Other resorts are spending vast sums to pump new sand onto their beaches, only to see the sand disappear again within a few years.</p>
        <p>Many engineers maintain that seawalls, jetties and replenished beaches are necessary to protect the valued developments already on the barrier islands. Too many people live or vacation at Atlantic City, Miami Beach and other barrier island towns to let their roads and buildings simply fall into the sea, these experts say.</p>
        <p>But many environmentalists and geologists contend that roads and buildings just do not belong on the unstable, migrating islands. At a minimum, some critics say, the Government should discourage further development on barrier islands by refusing to subsidize such projects as roads and waste treatment plants, or property insurance for owners. Seawalls Saving Buildings, Losing the Beach Although geologists say that nothing can stop the sea's inexorable march inland, few barrier beach communities are prepared to let themselves fall into the ocean block by block. Often, they try to halt erosion with bulkheads or rocky seawalls that protect the structures behind them.</p>
        <p>But many scientists now say that such structures accelerate the erosion of sand on the beaches in front of them.</p>
        <p>''Seawalls destroy beaches,'' said Orrin H. Pilkey Jr., a Duke University geologist. In a recent study of scores of sites on the Atlantic Coast, Dr. Pilkey and his colleagues found that beach width on stabilized beaches was dramatically lower than on beaches with no sea walls. Many of the stabilized ''beaches'' had no beach at all.</p>
        <p>Although the mechanics of wave action on beaches are imperfectly understood, geologists can suggest ways in which a seawall might hasten erosion. On a gently sloping beach, a wave's force is reduced as the surge of water, or swash, rushes onshore. Much of the water's energy is gone by the time it returns down the seaward slope as backwash, so it carries off relatively little sand.</p>
        <p>A seawall cuts this process off. Water hits it sharply and is reflected back strongly, carrying sand with it.</p>
        <p>''The wave hits the seawall and the energy doesn't dissipate,'' Dr. Leatherman said. ''A seawall is a last Draconian step to save property. You just kiss off the beach.''</p>
        <p>Sea Bright, N.J., for example, once had 300 feet of beach in front of its massive seawall, said Gilbert Nersesian, a coastal engineer for the New York District of the Army Corps of Engineers. ''But the beach that existed in front of that seawall is completely gone.''</p>
        <p>Maine and North Carolina have passed laws banning new hard stabi, lization along the shoreline. But property owners pay a heavy price for such laws. In March, a series of storms off of North Carolina eroded the beaches at Nags Head and Kill Devil Hills, on the Outer Banks, pitching several houses into the sea and damaging others so severely they were condemned.</p>
        <p>''We let a lot of houses fall in,'' Dr. Pilkey said. ''I'm proud of that.'' But houses threatened here and there are not the truest test of whether a state's politicians can withstand pressure for stabilization, he said.</p>
        <p>Pointing to a five-story condominium on the dune line on Bogue Bank, a heavily developed barrier island in North Carolina, he asked: ''Are we going to let a building like this fall into the sea?'' Stopping Sand Flow Feeding One Beach By Starving Another For centuries, people have built jetties of stone jutting out from the shore to keep sand from silting up channels. And for years they have tried to stem beach erosion by building smaller groins out from the shore to trap the sand carried along shore by currents.</p>
        <p>Now there is wide agreement that groins can only hold sand on one beach by starving another downstream.</p>
        <p>''Most people now believe you have to be very careful with groins,'' said Dr. James R. Houston, director of the Army Corps of Engineers Coastal Engineering Research Center in Vicksburg, Miss. ''They usually cause problems.''</p>
        <p>The 1938 hurricane that devastated Long Island and southern New England cut an inlet from the ocean into Shinnecock Bay, on the South Fork. The inlet and jetties built to keep it open blocked the longshore transport of sand, causing erosion at Westhampton Beach, Fire Island and even New York City beaches, Mr. Nersesian said.</p>
        <p>Groins at Ocean City, Md., have had a devastating affect on Assateague Island. When the groins were built, the rate of erosion on Assateague went to 36 feet a year, form 2 feet, Dr. Leatherman said.</p>
        <p>''The island is going to disappear,'' he said. ''It could happen in 20 to 30 years.'' Replacing the Sand Simple Approach, But a Costly One Many communities faced with the loss of their beaches are adopting a simple but expensive approach: replace the sand.</p>
        <p>Done right, officials at the Army Corps of Engineers say, beach replenishment can be a cost-efficient way to protect a community and provide needed recreational facilities, especially in resort towns dependent on income from tourism. Miami Beach was replenished 10 years ago, in a $65 million dollar project. ''It's in magnificent condition,'' Dr. Houston said.</p>
        <p>The Corps of Engineers is about to begin a replenishment project in and around Sea Bright, Mr. Nersesian said. ''It's quite expensive, probably over $100 million for 12 miles of shoreline,'' he said. The money will come from the Federal Government and the state.</p>
        <p>But scientists and environmentalists dispute the value of replenishment. For example, Beth Millemann, director of the Coastal Alliance, an environmental group, described beach replenishment as ''throwing dollar bills in the water.''</p>
        <p>In a recent study, researchers led by Dr. Pilkey studied 90 replenished beaches on the East Coast. North of Florida, he said, none of them lasted more than five years. On the Gulf of Mexico, only 10 percent last more than five years.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Houston and Dr. Leatherman said they questioned Dr. Pilkey's findings. ''Orrin and I disagree a lot on this,'' Dr. Houston said. ''You can name a lot of beach fills that have lasted a long time.''</p>
        <p>A lot depends on how the replenishment is carried out, he said. ''If you replenish a beach with the same material in the native beach, there's nothing in the laws of physics'' that would alter erosion rates, Dr. Houston said. ''If the sand you put in is finer, it will go faster. If you put coarser sand, it lasts longer, but coarser sand is usually more expensive.''</p>
        <p>One problem with beach replenishment programs, Dr. Leatherman said, is that ''beaches are like icebergs - only 10 percent of the active part of the beach is above water.''</p>
        <p>''The Corps of Engineers is pumping all the sand on the high part of the beach,'' Dr. Leatherman said. ''Some of that sand has to go underwater to maintain the slope of the beach, the gentle bottom profile. So it appears that the beach is eroding like crazy.''</p>
        <p>Once a beach has been replenished it must receive regular infusions of sand if it is to survive the assaults that diminished it in the first place. Dr. Houston said communities should look on this as a normal part of maintaining their infrastructure.</p>
        <p>''It's like everything else,'' he said. ''If you build a road you have to maintain it.'' Retreat From Beaches Insurance Pays Moving Costs In many places, property owners are being encouraged to bow to the inevitable and simply move their houses inland, a practice that has occurred on Long Island, the Outer Banks and other high-erosion areas for decades.</p>
        <p>In areas of high erosion hazard, the National Flood Insurance Program will pay the owners of threatened buildings 40 percent of either their value or the amount of their coverage to move them inland, said James L. Taylor, assistant administrator for the program. The money helps cover the costs of moving the house and re-establishing it on a new lot. If a property owner agrees to demolish the structure, the payment rises to 100 percent, plus 10 percent for cleanup costs. But anything later built on the property is ineligible for insurance, he said.</p>
        <p>In Texas, the Open Beaches Act requires owners to move their houses when erosion brings the beach to their foundations. After Hurricane Alicia, in 1983, about 100 houses in Galveston had to be moved, Dr. Leatherman said.</p>
        <p>But retreating from the shore is probably only likely in places where most structures are single-family houses and where land is abundant.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately,'' Dr. Leatherman said, ''if you look at New Jersey, the checkerboard is filled.'' The Next Big Storm Seeking Methods To Cut Damage To help people who cannot or will not move their buildings, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, working with the Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has commissioned scientists to recommend ways that developed barrier islands might reduce storm damage. Officials from FEMA, accompanied by Dr. Pilkey, recently toured Bogue Bank, a heavily developed barrier island off the coast of Beaufort, N.C., to learn more about lessening property damage.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pilkey pointed out some of the island's problems: protective dunes have been leveled for easy development; roads run straight back from the beach, providing overwash channels for floodwaters; marshes that could have absorbed storm water have been filled and built on. Even two low places on the island, where inlets formed in Hurricane Hazel in 1954, have houses on them now.</p>
        <p>And there has been no big storm to test what Dr. Pilkey calls ''stack-a-shack'' condominums that line the beach in the island towns of Atlantic Beach and Emerald Isle.</p>
        <p>The boom in coastal development over the past 20 years has occurred in a time of low storm activity. Max Mayfield, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said only about half as many major hurricanes have struck the United States mainland since 1970 as in the 30 years previous.</p>
        <p>To be covered by Federal flood insurance, buildings must conform with codes requiring, among other things, that they be elevated and that all ground-level walls be ''break-away'' to allow a storm surge to pass through. But many older houses do not meet such codes and many new buildings have been modified with solidly constructed living areas on the ground level.</p>
        <p>''They're like rotten apples in a barrel,'' Dr. Pilkey said. When these buildings are estroyed in a storm, surging water can crash the debris they produce into other houses.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Pilkey also pointed out steps property owners had taken to restore some of the protective beach landscape destroyed in development. For example, some homeowners are running sand fences across the beach in front of their homes. Sand collects at the fences, starting the process of dune formation. Others have planted sea grass and other vegetation to hold the dunes, and have built wooden walkways across them so that the plants are not damaged.</p>
        <p>Such steps will not save structures from destruction in a major hurricane, Dr. Pilkey said, but they can reduce damage in lesser storms. What of the Future? Difficult Choices Still Lie Ahead But what should public officials do when developed areas are threatened?</p>
        <p>In principal, said Dr. Leatherman, ''I'd say, let 'em take their licks.''</p>
        <p>''But,'' he said, ''the reality is that Ocean City is Maryland's major resort. It's a place where the average person can afford a vacation in, and it's a place the masses enjoy. I would say you can't let Ocean City fall in.''</p>
        <p>For now, he said, the best way to protect resorts like Ocean City is to nourish the beaches with sand. But as sea levels rise, such programs get more expensive. ''We may have to abandon more of the beach and wall up the rest'' of the island, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Houston also said that while he believed undeveloped barrier islands ought to be left that way, where development exists, ''Why not protect it?''</p>
        <p>''In California there are earthquakes,'' he said. ''In geologic time, which is the kind of time Orrin Pilkey likes to talk about, it's probably going to be destroyed. But we don't say people can't build in California. We don't say people can't build in Kansas because of tornadoes.''</p>
        <p>But for people like Dr. Pilkey, the choice is simple. ''I feel that beaches should be viewed as sacred,'' he said. ''I can't accept the idea that any development should have any consequence as opposed to a beach.''</p>
