        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax (24.4 cents for diesel) is widely understood to be a ''user fee'' that finances the Highway Trust Fund. Motorists and truckers who pay these taxes at the pump trust that their contributions will lead to better and safer roads.</p>
        <p>Your proposal to raise fuel taxes for new nonhighway purposes is a nonstarter. That policy would be regressive and unlikely to achieve the goals you set out.</p>

        <p>The 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax (24.4 cents for diesel) is widely understood to be a ''user fee'' that finances the Highway Trust Fund. Motorists and truckers who pay these taxes at the pump trust that their contributions will lead to better and safer roads.</p>
        <p>Your proposal to raise fuel taxes for new nonhighway purposes is a nonstarter. That policy would be regressive and unlikely to achieve the goals you set out.</p>
        <p>Artificially manipulating the price of energy in this way would have an insignificant effect on oil dependency. Gasoline at $3 or $4 a gallon could not come close to reducing our oil imports from the level of 58 percent now to even the 1973 level of 28 percent.</p>
        <p>Only a combination of increased domestic oil production and advanced research into finding alternatives that can truly compete in the market with oil offers any promise of achieving energy independence.</p>
        <p>In regard to climate change, we have found a less painful solution to reduce carbon dioxide emissions: traffic congestion relief.</p>
