        <p>IF SCIENCE IS A SURE EDIFICE OF knowledge, with each brick tested by experiment, then all scientists should agree on the main floor plan, with disputes generally reserved for matters of detail. Yet fundamental dissents are not so rare and occasionally prevail.</p>
        <p>The best-known dissenters in science today are probably the small group of biologists who repudiate the notion that the human immunodeficiency virus is the cause of AIDS. They complain they can't get financing to prove their ideas, and that the AIDS research establishment has self-interested reasons for ignoring their objections.</p>
        <p>Outsiders often have a hard time judging the merits of such disputes. Scientific establishments have been wrong in the past; for years, geologists resisted the notion of continental drift. And contemporary establishments sometimes seem unduly repressive of certain kinds of dissent. In cases of scientific fraud, universities have proved as zealous as the Pentagon in discouraging whistle-blowers. After years of inquiries, the fraud office of the Department of Health and Human Services recently declared that a disputed 1986 immunology experiment had indeed been falsified, by Thereza Imanishi-Kari, then an immunologist at M.I.T. (Imanishi-Kari is appealing the decision.)</p>
        <p>But Walter Stewart and Ned Feder, the two researchers from the National Institutes of Health who investigated the case and then took up other instances of alleged scientific jiggery-pokery, have been assigned to N.I.H. purgatory. They have received no official acknowledgment for their work on the Imanishi-Kari paper, but are delighted that their agency at last agrees with them.</p>
        <p>"The truth has the miraculous quality of being consistent with itself," says Stewart, without a trace of sarcasm.</p>
        <p>But not all whistle-blowers are pure in motive. And, in crowning dissenters with halos, historycreates an illusion, since it records only the few who were right and neglects to mention the many who were cranks or otherwise mistaken. Scientific establishments, while not infallible, are usually correct, or they would soon cease to be established.</p>
        <p>Science is a cumulative body of knowledge that is generated by a community of scholars who, at least in principle, carefully check one another's work. These safety checks are occasionally neglected -- usually when a whole community of scientists is led astray by some powerful passion, as happened to the 19th-century French physicists who believed in N-rays, and, more recently, to the psychologists who enthroned the strongly hereditarian views held by Cyril Burt. Then the way is open for a skeptic or dissenter to prove that N-rays don't exist, or that Burt's work was fraudulent.</p>
        <p>But these single-handed revolutions are the exception. That a small but distinguished group of scientists should completely reject the settled wisdom that H.I.V. causes AIDS is a matter of some perplexity. Their doyen is Peter Duesberg of the University of California at Berkeley, a well-known virologist and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. His supporters include two fellow biology professors from Berkeley, Harry Rubin and Richard Strohman, who feel that he has a case worth hearing, and Kary Mullis, the inventor of one of molecular biology's most powerful tools, the polymerase chain-reaction technique, for which he won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
        <p>Duesberg's argument, first published in 1987, is that AIDS is caused by drugs, illicit and otherwise, and that H.I.V. is just one of many harmless viruses that can be found infecting human tissues. As dissents go, this was a splendidly broad challenge to established wisdom, delivered with a fearlessness seldom seen since Barry Commoner challenged biology's central dogma that genetic information flows from D.N.A. to protein.  Since AIDS researchers have failed to produce a cure, vaccine or generally useful drug, Duesberg's arguments have gathered a certain following. But a careful examination of his position by Jon Cohen in Science magazine last month makes clear that the evidence for Duesberg's thesis rests mostly on the data of other scientists, and that they disagree with his interpretation of their work.</p>
        <p>The evidence that H.I.V. causes AIDS is extensive but not immaculate, since there are many facets of the strange disease that remain to be explained. Duesberg's posture is to dismiss every experiment that others regard as convincing, and to demand some higher standard.</p>
        <p>"You know what he'll say if we get a vaccine against H.I.V. and the epidemic vanishes?" asks Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute. "That we stimulated the immune system in a nonspecific way."</p>
        <p>A GROUP OF DISSENTERS THAT IS LESS WELL known but perhaps somewhat more credible than the Duesberg school are those who dispute the prevailing consensus on global warming. Their leader is Richard S. Lindzen, a meteorologist at M.I.T. who believes that computer simulations of the world's atmosphere considerably exaggerate the extent of warming to be expected from industrial waste gases.</p>
        <p>The consensus of almost all climatologists is that the computers have got it right and Lindzen is wrong. But the computer models are mathematical simulations of the atmosphere's behavior, not the atmosphere itself, and do not constitute experimental proof, the touchstone of science.</p>
        <p>Their makers can also be influenced by political goals, as with the considerably overdrawn predictions of the 1980's that nuclear war would be followed by a rubble-freezing nuclear winter. If a major flaw in the computer models should turn up, Lindzen may deserve some credit for his skepticism -- whereas a significant modification of the AIDS theory, like the discovery of a co-factor for H.I.V., would be no victory for Duesberg, since he denies H.I.V. any role at all in AIDS.</p>
        <p>Dissenters are infuriating almost by definition, since they repudiate large bodies of knowledge that other scientists regard as settled. They provoke the anger or contempt of colleagues because outsiders are prone to give them half a loaf instead of the often merited crumb. Their motives may be mixed, owing as much to ornery temperament as to devoted truth-seeking.</p>
        <p>But dissent can be as valuable in science as in other forums, and the edifice of science is robust enough to tolerate a few skeptics -- even ones who would tear much of it down.  METHOD &amp; MADNESS</p>
