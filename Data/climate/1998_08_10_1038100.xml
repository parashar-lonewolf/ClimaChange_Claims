        <p>Sonny Rollins could hardly wait to start improvising when he arrived with his tenor saxophone onstage at the Damrosch Park Band Shell on Saturday night. Before Mr. Rollins finished stating his first tune, ''Biji,'' he was already darting away from it with quick asides and looping runs, following impulses he was eager to share.</p>
        <p>Commanding, whimsical, unpredictable and telling, those impulses made for a set that transcended jazz factionalism through sheer force of personality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rollins was mainstream and avant-garde, abstruse and basic, conservative and anarchic, uncompromising and crowd-pleasing. The free concert, presented by Lincoln Center Out of Doors, drew an audience that overflowed the park.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rollins's structures were old fashioned. The set included standards, modal tunes, altered blues and calypsos, and each selection used the theme-solos-theme form.</p>
        <p>Clifton Anderson on trombone and Stephen Scott on piano played their solos with urbane intelligence, swinging over the beat and tracing linear narratives, keeping the music tonal and genial. Bob Cranshaw on electric bass, Perry Wilson on drums and Victor See-Yuen on percussion provided sure, easygoing support, despite some clutter from Mr. See-Yuen.</p>
        <p>And while the rest of the group played within mainstream rules, Mr. Rollins rocketed past them. Jazz is often compared to conversation, but Mr. Rollins had two discussions simultaneously: a witty discourse on the tunes and, bursting out between the lines, all kinds of alternatives and extrapolations and tangents, the stream of musical consciousness behind a typical solo's judicious phrases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rollins kept touching down on the melodies, as if knocking on wood, then streaking out to the further reaches of harmony and speed. He played breakneck lines that zigzagged through all kinds of chordal convolutions; he skipped up to high, hooting notes and an occasional overblown squeal, then dived down to foghorn honks. Unlike David Murray, whose solos turn into ecstatic glossolalia, Mr. Rollins made his seem like spectacular introspections and private dares.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rollins treated standards, including ''They Say It's Wonderful'' and ''More Than You Know,'' with jocular affection. He moved the original melodies around the beat and gently mocked romantic declarations with exaggerated vibrato or an extra edge in his sound. His saxophone crooned the melodies of his own ballads, including selections from his latest album, ''Global Warming'' (Milestone), and a new song written for the concert, ''Homecoming.'' The bluesy ''Clear-Cut Boogie'' ended with a repeated riff in a decrescendo until Mr. Rollins, true to the ecological titles on the album, declared, ''And then there were no more trees left.''</p>
        <p>But the tours de force were the calypsos: just three chords and endless possibilities. Mr. Rollins put dissonant tags on cheerful melodic hooks; he toyed with snake-charmer scales and nasal bagpipe tones; he cartwheeled through arpeggios and spiraled through harmonic transformations, then returned to the tune as if nothing had happened. It was the sound of a master deep in thought and equally deeply at play.</p>
