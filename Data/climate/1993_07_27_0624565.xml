        <p>IN a study with wide-ranging ecological implications, researchers at the University of Michigan say that regardless of whether rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, the gas itself may produce fundamental changes in the Earth's carbon and nitrogen cycles.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that photosynthesis, root development and plant growth increased significantly in bigtooth aspen seedlings grown in chambers with carbon levels twice as high as the level of 350 parts per million currently in the atmosphere. The summer-long study was conducted in 1991 at the university's biological station near Pellston, Mich.</p>

        <p>IN a study with wide-ranging ecological implications, researchers at the University of Michigan say that regardless of whether rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, the gas itself may produce fundamental changes in the Earth's carbon and nitrogen cycles.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that photosynthesis, root development and plant growth increased significantly in bigtooth aspen seedlings grown in chambers with carbon levels twice as high as the level of 350 parts per million currently in the atmosphere. The summer-long study was conducted in 1991 at the university's biological station near Pellston, Mich.</p>
        <p>"This study clearly shows that regardless of whether there is any greenhouse gas change in climate, that CO2 levels expected in the next century -- by themselves -- have the potential for exerting a fundamental effect on the Earth's ecosystems," said Dr. James A. Teeri, one of the researchers.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people have seen that elevated CO2 causes plants to grow faster," said Dr. Teeri, a professor of biology and the director of the university's biological station. "What we have seen that's new is that increased carbon that goes into the soil causes a rapid increase in the microbial biomass of the soil.</p>
        <p>"In addition, the increasing microbial mass in the soil causes an increase in available nitrogen. Nitrogen tied up in organic matter in the soil is decomposed and converted to available forms such as nitrates and ammonia by those microbes. So elevated CO2 by itself is accelerating, at the whole ecosystem level, the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle."</p>
        <p>In the carbon and nitrogen cycles, those elements are removed from air through a series of biochemical pathways and incorporated into living organisms; they find their way into the food chain and are later broken down, beginning the cycle again.</p>
        <p>The researchers studied three groups of seedlings throughout a growing season. One group was grown in open-topped chambers maintained at 700 parts per million of carbon dioxide, a second group was raised in chambers with the ambient level of 350 parts per million, and the control group was kept in the open air. Each seedling received identical amounts of water, fertilizer and sun. At the end of the summer, the trees were uprooted and the researchers analyzed the dried plants and the soil.</p>
        <p>In the study, reported in the June issue of the journal Plant and Soil, these differences were observed in seedlings grown in elevated carbon dioxide:</p>
        <p>*The rate of photosynthesis was twice the normal rate.</p>
        <p>*The weight of the dried root system was 50 percent greater.</p>
        <p>*Carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil were 1.5 and 1.8 times as great, respectively.</p>
        <p>To study the long-term effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, the researchers plan to start a three-year version of the experiment next spring, using a $735,000 grant from the Department of Energy.</p>
        <p>"We only have results for a single growing season in northern Michigan," Dr. Teeri cautioned. The researchers would like to see the experiment repeated in other areas.</p>
