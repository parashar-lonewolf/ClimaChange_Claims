        <p>For three decades, geologists probing beneath the Arctic Ocean near here and offshore Alaska have mapped the largest known untapped reserves of natural gas in North America: 165 trillion cubic feet, seven times what the United States will consume this year.</p>
        <p>But, until recently, with gas prices low, indigenous opposition high and environmental issues looming, energy companies never found a way to build pipelines to send the gas south to heat homes and to generate electricity.</p>
        <p>This is changing as fast as it takes to read a home heating bill.</p>
        <p>Wholesale prices for natural gas have doubled over the last year, and industry analysts expect that the 55 million Americans who heat their homes with gas will pay 25 to 40 percent more than they did last winter. And with the Energy Department forecasting that demand for natural gas in the United States will rise 40 percent in the next two decades, prices may go higher still.</p>
        <p>At the same time, native groups that once opposed development of the big gas fields near here now spy chances for economic development, and are campaigning for royalties and jobs.</p>
        <p>After a winter of planning and politicking, energy companies, pipeline operators and Indian tribes expect to announce next spring plans to build one, and possibly two, subterranean pipelines to carry Arctic gas to North America's pipeline grid. Building two pipelines, one from Alaska along the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the Alaska-Canada Highway, and the other from Canada's Northwest Territories, along the Mackenzie River Valley, would cost $10 billion and take seven years.</p>
        <p>While pipeline company executives say they are confident they can finance and engineer the projects, environmental problems remain unresolved and some conservation groups vow opposition. Development also portends radical change for isolated places like this one-stoplight town, where the barks of sled dogs herald the long Arctic night and the northernmost road in North America trails off into tundra.</p>
        <p>Arguments in favor of tapping the gas fields echo those heard three decades ago, when the United States debated building the Trans-Alaska pipeline to move crude oil south from Prudhoe Bay. The theme is self-reliance in energy in a world buffeted by higher oil prices orchestrated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
        <p>''We aren't dependent on OPEC for gas,'' said K. Terry Koonce, president of the Exxon Mobil Production Company. ''Gas is up to us Americans to bring about.''</p>
        <p>Often called a continental commodity, natural gas consumed in the United States comes from North America, delivered by pipelines. Canada, which doubled its exports to the United States in the 1990's, now supplies 16 percent of American consumption, and Canadian executives expect exports to the United States to grow 50 percent this decade.</p>
        <p>Last summer, as brownouts hit California and electricity bills jumped in New York, consumers and politicians started demanding new power plants. But with natural gas the fuel of choice for 90 percent of power plants now built in the United States, few people asked the follow-up question: With demand already outstripping supply, where is this gas for these plants going to come from?</p>
        <p>The Energy Department predicts that consumption will increase to 31.5 trillion cubic feet a year by 2020,  largely because it is a relatively clean fuel. Gas, when burned, produces only one-third the carbon dioxide for each unit of energy as coal and two-thirds as much as oil.</p>
        <p>While high prices led energy companies to double their exploration efforts in the United States over the last year, industry executives do not expect production in the lower 48 states to pace consumption. Energy companies and consumer groups see Arctic reserves as crucial to meet future needs.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, who bitterly opposed the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the 1970's, are split over building gas pipelines in the Arctic. Greenpeace opposes them, saying Americans should wean themselves off fossil fuels and invest the billions of dollars it would take to build pipelines in alternative energy sources like solar and wind. Other groups, recognizing that gas pollutes less than oil, plan to focus on reducing the environmental impact of the lines by pushing to have them follow the existing Alaska oil pipeline and the Alaska-Canada Highway.</p>
        <p>In Canada and the United States, federal and local authorities will have to approve drilling plans and pipeline construction, but industry executives said the rising price of gas made their case for the project.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day, consumers are going to make a lot of pressure to have this gas flow to the lower 48,'' said Michael E. Phelps, president of WestCoast Energy Inc. WestCoast is working with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. to build a gas pipeline from Alaska to Alberta, where it would tie into existing lines south to the United States.</p>
        <p>Some development has already begun, particularly in Alaska, where companies have been pumping oil from under Prudhoe Bay for more than two decades and sending it south through the Trans-Alaska pipeline.</p>
        <p>Canada, too, has moved ahead. Chasing what Canadians call frontier gas, the first pipeline nosed ''north of 60'' in May. This small link, connecting gas fields in Fort Liard, Northwest Territories, to the continent's pipeline grid, crossed a psychological barrier, the 60th parallel, a line on maps that separates the settled southern provinces from frontier northern territories.</p>
        <p>In Canada's first commercial gas development north of the Arctic Circle, Inuvik Gas Ltd. started pumping gas a year ago to houses in this town of 3,500 people on the Mackenzie River. The company is jointly owned by Enbridge Inc. and AltaGas Services Inc. of Calgary, Alberta, and the Inuvialuit Petroleum Corporation. The Inuvialuit company is wholly owned by the Inuvialuit people, one of two main native groups in this corner of the Canadian Arctic. Their participation represents an about-face in native attitudes toward energy development here.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's, tribal chiefs up and down the Mackenzie River Valley spoke out against any gas or oil development and obtained a court-imposed 10-year moratorium that stopped work during the 1980's.</p>
        <p>''We had no offices for our chiefs, no telephones,'' recalled Stephen Kakfwi, a member of the Dene tribe who fought the pipelines 25 years ago. ''Of our people, 75 percent were trappers. They weren't involved in the process. We had no understanding of the way that the government of Canada worked. We had no business experience.''</p>
        <p>In the intervening years, the federal and territorial governments settled virtually all native land claims in the valley, giving tribes legal standing to negotiate rents and royalties. Today, tribes own drilling companies and negotiate exploration royalty payments with multinational companies. Mr. Kakfwi is now premier of the Northwest Territories.</p>
        <p>In January, chiefs of all 30 tribes in the region unanimously approved a joint statement ''to build a business partnership to maximize ownership and benefit of a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.'' Their representative, the Aboriginal Working Group, which is seeking a majority stake in a pipeline, has hired the aboriginal banking unit of the Bank of Montreal to secure job guarantees, job training, service contracts and rent payments from pipeline companies. In May, Mr. Kakfwi flew to Calgary, where he pitched the pipeline to the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association.</p>
        <p>''What has changed? We are now in control, the majority of the territorial legislature is aboriginal,'' Mr. Kakfwi said in Yellowknife, the territorial capital. ''The nations have got their own land back. They have businesses. They have money.''</p>
        <p>With energy company engineers studying three possible routes from the Arctic Ocean to pipelines in Alberta, some environmentalists question spending billions of dollars to perpetuate North America's dependency on fossil fuels. They stress that Arctic gas would only feed United States needs for less than one decade.</p>
        <p>''Drilling for new oil, or putting in natural gas pipelines, is not how we are going to get energy security,'' said Melanie Duchin, a member of Greenpeace. ''Rather than opening up a fossil fuel frontier, such as trying to drill for these immense natural gas reserves, the money should go for developing renewable energy.''</p>
        <p>In the Canadian Arctic, however, Greenpeace has little credibility with aboriginal leaders. They say the group's anti-fur campaigns destroyed their traditional hunting and trapping economies.</p>
        <p>''My people were Stone Age people 30 years ago,'' Mr. Kakfwi said. ''We have embarked on a journey and we can't turn back. To say, 'You should be a happy little tree hugger, choking rabbits, while everyone else exploits your diamonds and gas' -- no, I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>In her office a block from Inuvik's stoplight, Nellie J. Cournoyea, chairman of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, dismissed environmentalists' objections. ''If these people want to be useful, they should start cleaning up the south, stop the pollution that is damaging to the Arctic wildlife and environment,'' she said, referring to windborne soot and smog.</p>
        <p>With northern native support solid and southern consumer support expected to solidify after this winter's home heating bills go out, the race is now on to to see who builds an Arctic gas pipeline first.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 14, rival companies presented proposals in Washington for a pipeline through Alaska to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which is run by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican of Alaska. Forrest Hoglund, chairman of the Arctic Resources Company of Houston, said the multibillion-dollar race to build a gas line out of the Arctic was the 21st-century ''equivalent of the first railroad to California.''</p>
        <p>Many Alaskans are eager to see a gas pipeline built because oil production on the North Slope near Prudhoe Bay dropped by half in the 1990's. As royalties dwindle, Alaskans face big tax increases in five years if there is no gas development.</p>
        <p>''Alaska is extremely interested in getting the gas out,'' Mr. Koonce, the Exxon Mobil executive, said after testifying in Washington. ''Frankly, we are, too.''</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said their respective candidates did not have positions on the pipeline proposals.</p>
        <p>Proponents of an Alaskan route said they could start pumping gas south in six years. They said they could work so quickly because permits and an international regulatory framework have existed since the late 1970's to place a gas pipeline parallel to the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline, and then east, along the Alaska-Canada Highway.</p>
        <p>At the same time, improved telecommunications, high-speed mechanized welding and the use of rock saws to cut permafrost have combined to make pipeline building faster and cheaper than ever, said Mr. Phelps, the executive at WestCoast, one of the companies planning to build a line.</p>
        <p>''The route using the Alaska pipeline and highway makes sense, because you are not dividing the wilderness any further; you are using existing corridors,'' said Charles M. Clusen, an Alaska policy analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group.</p>
        <p>Executives at BP Amoco, one of the largest gas owners in Alaska, have said they expect to make a decision on building a gas pipeline by the middle of next year.</p>
        <p>But the 1,700-mile Alaska-Yukon route, with a price tag around $8 billion, would leave the Canadian Arctic gas reserves stranded.</p>
        <p>To link the two reserves, other companies have proposed a second, $3 billion pipeline up the Mackenzie River Valley and 300 miles west to Prudhoe, running 15 feet below the floor of the Arctic Ocean. In March, four major companies that own gas in the Canadian Arctic plan to release results of a feasibility study for a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.</p>
        <p>Although this route could provide cheaper gas to consumers, environmentalists oppose a submerged line, saying it could endanger caribou and polar bear populations. Many Alaskans oppose a submarine pipeline because it would deprive their towns and cities of piped natural gas.</p>
