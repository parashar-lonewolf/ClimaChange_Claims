        <p>LEAD: The annual Administration report to Congress on voting practices at the United Nations has become a weapon in the hands of United Nations opponents. They use it to stir up anti-United Nations feeling in this country and to justify cuts in American contributions. Their efforts do not improve that organization, but they do diminish American influence.</p>
        <p>The annual Administration report to Congress on voting practices at the United Nations has become a weapon in the hands of United Nations opponents. They use it to stir up anti-United Nations feeling in this country and to justify cuts in American contributions. Their efforts do not improve that organization, but they do diminish American influence.</p>
        <p>The latest report trumpets the ''fact'' that member nations supported the United States only 18 percent of the time in General Assembly votes last year even though many of these countries accept our military and economic aid. That fact might well cause the Administration to think about the persuasiveness of its policies and positions.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Administration and right-wing public-policy organizations and commentators are busily churning out isolationist analyses that decry a supposedly frightening picture of anti-Americanism in the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the problem lies not in the United Nations but in the way the Administration categorizes United Nations votes. Congress should change the reporting requirements so that a more accurate picture of voting practices are presented.</p>
        <p>The report lends itself to distortions because it treats all votes in the General Assembly as equal in importance. It conveniently ignores the fact that many nations that differ with us on routine matters will support us on critical issues. For instance, many nations voted with us on our resolution calling for Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, one of our most notable accomplishments in the 43-year history of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The report also ignores issues resolved by consensus without recorded votes. During the 41st General Assembly, in 1986, the issue of greatest importance to the United States was United Nations budget reform. That issue was resolved by consensus, without a recorded vote.</p>
        <p>In 1987, 60 percent of the issues before the General Assembly were resolved by consensus, including important international issues relating to AIDS, crime, the ozone layer and narcotics control.</p>
        <p>Vernon A. Walters, the United States permanent representative to the United Nations, said last year: ''Vote tallies alone are not sufficient to measure the results of the General Assembly. The increased cooperation, reduced rhetoric and behind-the-scenes help which characterized the 42nd General Assembly are difficult to capture in statistics.''</p>
        <p>The failure to distinguish between important and less important measures is the report's most serious flaw. In fact, in 1987, 32 votes were judged by the United States mission to be important, but the statutory constraints under which the report is prepared permit only 10 votes to be characterized this way. A country could support us on all 32 ''important'' votes but receive a low rating because it did not side with us on many other occasions in which our mission felt the issue was less significant.</p>
        <p>By poisoning public debate, the report's blatant distortions damage America's global interests. While experts are well aware of the flaws in the vote analysis, much of the public is not.</p>
        <p>The artificially low support ratings for many countries are used wrongly to create the perception of hostility toward the United States at the United Nations. This perception is then used to mount new attacks on the world organization in the media and before Congress. In fact, the United Nations plays an important role in defusing world tensions and promoting international understanding. It also exerts a much stronger presence in other countries than in our own.</p>
        <p>The United Nations is hardly the hotbed of anti-Americanism that the President's annual report to Congress suggests. To its credit, the State Department's introduction to the report is a thinly disguised attack on the report's biased methodology. But the bias is entrenched by Congress in the statute that requires the report.</p>
        <p>Congress can fix the problem by amending the statute that requires the report. In so doing, it would end the misplaced criticism of nations that support us when we need them and put a stop to the self-defeating withholding of American contributions to United Nations operations.</p>
