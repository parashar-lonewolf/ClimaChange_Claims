        <p>The space shuttle Atlantis thundered into orbit today, carrying an array of scientific instruments to conduct atmospheric studies that could influence major policy decisions for protecting the global environment.</p>
        <p>After a one-day delay caused by fuel leaks, the Atlantis was launched on its planned eight-day mission at 8:14 A.M. Within hours, the seven astronauts were settled into orbit and busy preparing the 12 instruments for round-the-clock observations of the chemistry and physics of the upper atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the launching was one of the smoothest in memory; flight controllers said the shuttle's performance was nearly flawless. This is the 46th shuttle flight, and the 21st since the Challenger disaster in January 1986.</p>
        <p>"The whole flight is going very well, with no problems to speak of," said Lee Briscoe, mission operations director. He said officials were considering the possibility of extending the flight an extra day, providing a ninth day of observations.</p>
        <p>Although the shuttle was 14 minutes late getting off the ground because of unsettled weather conditions, scientists said the computer programs directing the planned atmospheric research were quickly modified to adjust the timing of observations to coincide with different sun angles and other factors influencing such studies.</p>
        <p>The Atlantis is circling Earth once every 90 minutes at an altitude of 184 miles, covering much of the globe by following an orbit always taking it to 57 degrees north latitude, then swinging down to 57 degrees south latitude.</p>
        <p>In the mission's only anomaly so far, the shuttle's three main engines did not quite deliver the full thrust needed to put the Atlantis into its intended orbit. Flight engineers said the shuttle was traveling about 4 to 6 feet per second, too slow at the time it reached orbit, leaving it in an orbit ranging from an apogee of 184 miles to a perigee of 177 miles.</p>
        <p>Because of the precise nature of some of the scientific experiments, it was necessary to refire the two orbital maneuvering system engines to circularize the orbit at 184 miles. This was accomplished early this afternoon. Multinational Undertaking</p>
        <p>Then Dr. Kathyrn D. Sullivan, a scientist who is one of the astronauts, began switching on and checking all systems in the research laboratory, which has been stored in the shuttle's cargo bay. The laboratory is called Atlas, for Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science, and is a multinational undertaking, involving NASA, the European Space Agency, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>No problems were encountered, and operation of the experiments was begun under the direction of scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.</p>
        <p>The astronauts will have little direct hand in the experiments, although they will be required to maneuver the spaceship as many as 180 times to put it in position for studying the atmosphere below and the Sun above.</p>
        <p>Commanding the crew is Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr. of the Marine Corps. He is making his third trip in space. The other crew members, besides Dr. Sullivan, are Lieut. Col. Brian Duffy of the Air Force; Capt. David C. Leestma of the Navy; Dr. Byron K. Lichtenberg, a biomedical engineer; Dr. Michael Foale, a British physicist, and Dr. Dirk D. Frimout, a physicist who is the first Belgian to fly in space.</p>
        <p>The cost of the mission includes $52.6 million for Atlas and $400 million in shuttle expenses. 'One of a Series'</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Richard H. Truly, who was watching his last liftoff as NASA administrator, said, "This is not just one flight; it's one of a series." He was referring to the fact that the flight was inaugurating an ambitious program of atmospheric, climatic and oceanographic surveys from space. The program is known as Mission to Planet Earth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Truly, a former astronaut, resigned his post in January, under pressure from the Bush Administration, and will leave next week. He said he had no specific career plans. Daniel Goldin, an aerospace executive, has been nominated as the new administrator but has yet to be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
        <p>The new laboratory installed in the shuttle cargo bay is to be reflown each year for the next decade for comprehensive surveys of atmospheric conditions during a complete 11-year solar cycle. This is the regular period in which the Sun goes from intense turbulence to relative calm.</p>
        <p>Scientists want to know how slight variations in solar energy, as little as one-tenth of 1 percent in an 11-year cycle, can affect atmospheric circulation and worldwide climate. Of immediate interest are observations concerning the chemical changes in the atmosphere that could lead to a global warming trend and the further depletion of the ozone layer that protects people from solar ultraviolet radiation.</p>
