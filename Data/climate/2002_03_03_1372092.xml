        <p>The day the Weather Channel went on the air, nearly 20 years ago, it was balmy out, clouds scudding in a high sky, no possibility of rain. Today, looking out my window, I see that is still the case. The weather's still nice. At least there's a breeze. The Weather Channel anchor is right now warning me the weather may change. A front is somewhere not too far away. They say there are five stories in Hollywood. With the weather, there has always been only one. It will get cold, and then it will get warm. Warm, cold, warm, cold.</p>
        <p>The huge effort the Weather Channel makes to cover this repetitive story -- 840 employees, 15,000 affiliated cable systems, a news budget of several million -- seems justified by its success. It has become a part of the cable landscape with CNN and ESPN. That was not always the case. When the channel started in 1982, people laughed. Even its own employees thought a national 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week weather network was overkill. Wasn't the very point about weather that it was local? And that we watched it only when we needed it? But to everyone's surprise, T.W.C. took -- the subscription base ballooned from 2 million to 85 million homes. It turned out there were a lot of avid weather watchers out there. ''We've provided heroin for the addicts,'' Ray Ban, the Weather Channel's chief meteorologist, says.</p>

        <p>The day the Weather Channel went on the air, nearly 20 years ago, it was balmy out, clouds scudding in a high sky, no possibility of rain. Today, looking out my window, I see that is still the case. The weather's still nice. At least there's a breeze. The Weather Channel anchor is right now warning me the weather may change. A front is somewhere not too far away. They say there are five stories in Hollywood. With the weather, there has always been only one. It will get cold, and then it will get warm. Warm, cold, warm, cold.</p>
        <p>The huge effort the Weather Channel makes to cover this repetitive story -- 840 employees, 15,000 affiliated cable systems, a news budget of several million -- seems justified by its success. It has become a part of the cable landscape with CNN and ESPN. That was not always the case. When the channel started in 1982, people laughed. Even its own employees thought a national 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week weather network was overkill. Wasn't the very point about weather that it was local? And that we watched it only when we needed it? But to everyone's surprise, T.W.C. took -- the subscription base ballooned from 2 million to 85 million homes. It turned out there were a lot of avid weather watchers out there. ''We've provided heroin for the addicts,'' Ray Ban, the Weather Channel's chief meteorologist, says.</p>
        <p>What are we addicted to? What are we looking for? Not whether they need their raincoats on the other coast, I don't think. We watch the Weather Channel for the global read, the state of the planet, for reassurance that it will be O.K. After a few years of big storms, bizarrely warm winters and drought warnings, we no longer want nice weather. We just want normal weather.</p>
        <p>Which may explain why, though we've never needed it less -- we've never been more able to live, work, eat without going outside -- we've never been bigger consumers of meteorological information. Today, there are some 4,000 Web sites covering weather. And the Weather Channel's marketing people have noticed an intriguing phenomenon. People are watching their programs for longer than anyone ever expected -- eight minutes was the original projection, but one in four now watch for 20 minutes or more at a time. People come for their own weather, but they stay for their neighbor's weather and finally for the weather around the world. No low in Asia is too obscure for them; no hiccup in the jet stream over Australia is too far removed. The phenomenon seems widespread in the weather industry. ''People are unsettled,'' says Ross Gelbspan, founder of Heatisonline.org, who has noticed a large increase in visitors to his site recently. ''It's the freakish weather we've been having.''</p>
        <p>The Weather Channel's viewers skew to the affluent and the educated. Indoor types, we watch it nervously, scanning the weather for deviations from the ancient pattern. How many Category 4 hurricanes will there be this year? Can El Niño explain this hot winter? La Niña? Or is it our combustible engines, our coolants, our C.F.C.'s? The scientific jury may still be officially out on global warming, this presidential administration may be skeptical, but in January, there were cherry blossoms in Brooklyn, and the thermostat in the Washington Metro turned on the air-conditioning. These facts fill me with unease. And it's not just me. I spoke to Faith Gemmill of the Gwich'in tribe in northern Alaska, who said that members of the tribe, who for thousands of years have looked at the sky and been able to read the next day's weather, are now confused. ''It's warm, then it gets cold, then the next day it snows, then it rains. No one can really predict anymore.''</p>
        <p>So it is appropriate that while local weather reports try to cheer you up and get you out the door, the Weather Channel doesn't. Its claustrophobic studio and low-tech effects -- yellow spiky sun, puffy white clouds, goofy jazz background music -- allow the depression over the Atlantic to merge with the one in your head. You feel invited to spend the day there, brooding. That the Weather Channel was born just as the hole in the ozone layer first came to our attention helps. It grew to maturity, so to speak, under the same cloud we did, never knowing the innocent time when 70-degree days in winter were cause for rejoicing. Its meteorologists understand modern-day original sin: the world is no longer as we found it.</p>
        <p>Where once we needed the weather, now we feel the weather needs us. This is part of a larger, inadvertent role we have assumed as custodians of our planet. We used to hunt. Then we just photographed. Now we restock. We run rivers, parks, species. We're responsible for reintroducing wolves to Yellowstone and reminding moose how to recognize their scent. The hope that an obscure woodpecker in Louisiana might not be extinct has made it a media celebrity, because if it's dead, we killed it. When a baby gorilla is born in the Virunga reserve in East Africa, researchers sometimes have a party to name it, like latter-day Adams.</p>
        <p>That's the same energy the Weather Channel draws on. As we watch it, we silently hope that ours won't turn out to be the story of the Garden of Eden. We ate the apple. Then we cut down the tree. We couldn't resist -- we wanted the wood. Now we are worried that we're going to die from the sun. Compare that with the story in Genesis with the original weather report: Bright morning, heavy rains, followed by clearing at dawn. After, the Lord promised Noah, for as long as the earth existed, ''cold and heat, and summer and winter . . . shall not cease.'' Watching, we wonder: how do we go back to that?</p>
