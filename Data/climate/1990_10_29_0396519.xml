        <p>Finally, the 101st Congress adjourned early this morning, its legislative accomplishments in the last two years almost lost amid weeks of bitter tangling over the budget that kept lawmakers practically captive for weeks in the Capitol.</p>
        <p>This was the Congress that passed measures to complete some of the unfinished domestic agenda of the 1970's, including landmark bills to clean up the environment, to make child care more accessible to people with low incomes, to extend protection against discrimination to the disabled and to greatly expand the number of immigrants allowed to enter the country.</p>

        <p>Finally, the 101st Congress adjourned early this morning, its legislative accomplishments in the last two years almost lost amid weeks of bitter tangling over the budget that kept lawmakers practically captive for weeks in the Capitol.</p>
        <p>This was the Congress that passed measures to complete some of the unfinished domestic agenda of the 1970's, including landmark bills to clean up the environment, to make child care more accessible to people with low incomes, to extend protection against discrimination to the disabled and to greatly expand the number of immigrants allowed to enter the country.</p>
        <p>But it was also the Congress that had more than its share of bumps and starts, and it is for those that this session may be best remembered. Although it began with high hopes among Democrats, Congress soon found itself off to its slowest start in years, thrown into disarray by the resignations of Speaker Jim Wright, the Texas Democrat, and then Tony Coelho, the California Democrat who was majority whip, amid questions of financial impropriety.  At the End, Much Activity</p>
        <p>This year, particularly toward the end, quite a bit was achieved, although the public's collective memory probably contains scenes of round-the-clock budget talks that were short on progress and long on angry rhetoric, and of last-minute deals that served the interests of powerful lawmakers' constituents.  [ Page B9. ]</p>
        <p>"Given the nature of the partisan divisions inside Congress and the complexity of the policy problems, they haven't done badly," said Christopher H. Foreman Jr., a professor of Government at the American University in Washington. "People should back off thinking the system is imminently bound to collapse, because it really isn't. Politicians are paid, after all, to deliberate and to work long hours and to make deals. And if that takes some doing, and blood and sweat, so be it."</p>
        <p>Although it was the longest pre-election session since World War II, Congress could not pass legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system, and the Senate could not bring itself to cut off outside speaking fees for members, as the House had done. The Democratic majority in Congress was unable to muster the necessary votes to override vetoes by President Bush of a major job discrimination measure and a bill guaranteeing paid leave to workers for childbirth or family medical emergencies.</p>
        <p>In all, Congress was unable to override any of Mr. Bush's string of 16 vetoes.</p>
        <p>Maintaining a time-honored tradition, Congress found itself distracted by issues that were tailor-made for contentious oratory but that had little to do with running the Government. These included a Constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning -- an effort that was defeated -- and moves to curb Federal money for the arts -- an issue for which a compromise was brokered. Congress at Its Worst</p>
        <p>The budget debacle brought out the best examples of Congress at its worst, particularly with the House rejection on Oct. 5 of a deficit-reduction package that was painstakingly crafted in months of negotiations by the Congressional leadership and the White House.</p>
        <p>The Government shut down that weekend, leaving bewildered and outraged tourists shaking their heads from the House and Senate galleries. With Congress held captive by the budget, buttons declaring "Free the 101st" began to sprout on lapels all over Capitol Hill, even appearing on those of many members.</p>
        <p>The budget crisis was finally wrapped up Saturday evening when the Senate voted 54 to 45 to approve a bipartisan plan that is expected to produce a deficit reduction of more than $40 billion in 1991 and nearly $500 billion over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Their action concluded a session that ran 23 days past its scheduled adjournment. Bleary-eyed legislators, some with their feet propped on the backs of seats in the dignified House chamber, were still around this morning to set their clocks back for Eastern Standard Time at 2 A.M.</p>
        <p>Thus it was just 1:02 A.M. Eastern Standard Time, when the gavel fell in the House, and 1:17 A.M. in the Senate. The House Republican cloakroom's tape-recorded message about the day's going-ons in Congress, in a fitting tribute, played a rendition of the "Hallelujah" chorus" from Handel's "Messiah." Sidetracked by Ethics Issues</p>
        <p>Aside from the thrashing over the budget, the 101st Congress endured case after case of ethical embarrassment. In the first year of the session, not long after the Senate rejected President Bush's nomination of John G. Tower for defense secretary because of his reputation for enjoying the cocktail circuit, the House found itself in stunned disarray over the personal breaches of Mr. Wright and Mr. Coelho.</p>
        <p>In the last year, Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican, and Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, were sanctioned on the floor of their respective chambers for ethical lapses.</p>
        <p>Just last week, Representative Donald E. (Buz) Lukens, an Ohio Republican, resigned rather than face an expanded inquiry by the ethics committee into allegations that he propositioned a Congressional elevator operator. And in the recess next month, the Senate will hold several days of public hearings into allegations that five senators overstepped the bounds of propriety in interceding with Federal officials to help Charles H. Keating Jr. at a time when his savings and loan was approaching insolvency.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers, anxious for some time off, are already looking beyond the Nov. 6 elections.</p>
        <p>"We're all going to have a lot of free time," Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader, said to reporters. "So if you'd like to come over and ride my treadmill or anything, why come on over. I haven't ridden it for 10 days. I'm weak, tired and exhausted." A SCORECARD ON THE 101st CONGRESS Accomplishments</p>
        <p>Budget Reduction -- Approved a package of spending cuts and tax increases intended to reduce the deficit by nearly $500 billion over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Savings and Loan Rescue -- Approved a bailout of the ailing industry that could cost $500 billion over the next 30 years. The measure created a new Federal agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation, charged with shutting down and selling the assets of more than 1,000 savings and loan institutions.</p>
        <p>Immigration &amp; Labor -- Raised the minimum wage to $3.80 an hour in 1990 and to $4.25 an hour in 1991, the first increases since 1981.</p>
        <p>Approved a major revision of the nation's immigration law that greatly expands the number of immigrants allowed into the country with an emphasis on bringing in more skilled workers and on unifying families.</p>
        <p>Airline Smoking -- Banned smoking on all flights in the continental United States and all other domestic flights of six hours or less.</p>
        <p>Environment -- Approved the first overhaul of the Federal clean air law in 13 years, with specific prescriptions for dealing with acid rain toxic pollutants, automobile emissions and urban smog.</p>
        <p>Approved a sharp increase in shipping companies' liabilities for oil spills also created a $1 billion fund to pay for additional clean-up costs;e and required that most tankers be equipped with double hulls over the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>Agreed to keep vast tracts of coastal waters from Alaska to New England off limits to oil and gas drilling.</p>
        <p>Farm Bill -- Approved a $41 billion, five-year farm policy that introduces changes in the structure of commodity price supports and includes the strong environmental provisions.</p>
        <p>Disabled/Child Care -- Approved legislation that provides grants to states to help pay for child care and expands the existing Federal tax credit for low-income working families with children. Expansion of the tax break would cost the Government $12 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>Approved legislation that would guarantee disabled Americans broadened employment opportunities and greater access to public accommodations and transit systems.</p>
        <p>Crime -- Approved an anti-crime bill after negotiators removed death penalty provisions and curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons in an effort to make the bill more acceptable. Other provisions address victims rights, juvenile justice and prisoner drug testing.</p>
        <p>Military Budget -- Approved a $268 billion military spending plan for fiscal 1991, $17 billion less than last year. Sets financing for "Star Wars" anti-missile system at the lowest level of spending in several years; continues the Stealth bomber program at sharply reduced levels, and calls for a troop cut of 78,500 from the 2.1 million member active force. Failures:</p>
        <p>Civil Rights -- President Bush vetoed a bill that would reverse recent Supreme Court decisions that limited the effect of Federal laws against job discrimination, saying would lead to job quotas. The veto was sustained in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Family Leave -- President Bush vetoed legislation that would have required businesses with 50 or more employees to grant workers up to three months of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or when a family member falls ill. The veto was sustained in the House.</p>
        <p>Campaign Financing -- Senate and House each passed campaign finance bills. The Senate bill would have barred contributions from political action committees in federal elections, while the House measure would have limited campaign contributions from PACS. The two bodies also differed on the question of voluntary spending limits. In the end, the differences could not be resolved and the legislation died.  Delayed</p>
        <p>Savings and Loan Rescue -- Congress failed to provide additional money the Treasury Department said was immediately needed for the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency handling the bailout of the savings and loan industry. RTC was given $50 billion for clean up in fiscal 1990, but this is almost gone.</p>
        <p>Money Laundering -- Failed to complete action on a bill toughening sanctions against banks and other financial institutions convicted of money laundering for drug dealers.</p>
