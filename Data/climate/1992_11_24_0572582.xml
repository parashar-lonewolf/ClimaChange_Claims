        <p>Wave Damage</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>Does a violent storm at sea cause damage on the ocean floor?</p>
        <p>A.  Big waves can damage a coastal reef when they break, said Dr. Tim Barnett, an oceanographer in the climate research division of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla, but 100 miles at sea, waves do not affect the sea floor.</p>
        <p>As a rough formula, he said, if the wavelength, the distance between successive crests, is less than four times the depth of the ocean at that point the waves do not affect the bottom.</p>
        <p>In other words, he said, with a thousand-foot wavelength, (a fairly big wind-generated wave, "250 feet is where it begins to feel the bottom and the bottom begins to feel it."</p>
        <p>If a submarine is deeper than that, he added, it also avoids the effects of the turmoil on the surface. Champagne Foam</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>Why does fanning a just-opened bottle of champagne keep it from foaming over?</p>
        <p>A. Vigorous fanning simply breaks the bubbles, said Dr. Georges Halpern, M.D. and Ph.D., an allergist who also studies the chemistry of sparkling wines.</p>
        <p>A bubble is made of a envelope of liquid around a gas, he said; in the case of champagne, it is carbon dioxide and wine.</p>
        <p>"If you break the bubble, you release the gas, not the liquid, and the liquid goes back into the bottle," he said.</p>
