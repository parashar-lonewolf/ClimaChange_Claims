        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>3-20</p>
        <p>Taliban Surges in Afghanistan  A large springtime offensive by the Taliban has turned into their strongest show of force since American forces chased them from power in late 2001, and Afghan and foreign officials and local villagers blamed a scarcity of United States-led coalition forces for the resurgence.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Hamas Rockets Hit Israel  Hamas fired at least 15 Qassam rockets from Gaza into Israel, ending a 16-month truce with Israel, a day after eight Palestinians, including four children, were killed on a Gaza beach, apparently by an errant Israeli shell.</p>
        <p>8</p>
        <p>Iran to Present Counteroffer  Iran's foreign minister said that the government would issue a counteroffer to an proposal by Europe, China and the United States to get Iran give up enriching uranium in the short term.</p>
        <p>26</p>
        <p>Iraq Delays Decision on Troops  The new government of Iraq has decided to postpone any demand for negotiations to establish a more formal legal basis for the presence of American and other foreign troops on its soil, Iraqi and American officials said.</p>
        <p>20</p>
        <p>Concern Over China's Coal Use  China uses more coal than the United States, the European Union and Japan combined, and the increase in global-warming gases from China's coal use will probably exceed that for all industrialized countries combined over the next 25 years, surpassing by five times the reduction in such emissions that the Kyoto Protocol seeks.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Progress in Hariri Inquiry  The head of the United Nations inquiry into the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister, said he was making ''considerable progress'' and had established the case was probably a suicide bombing, but he revealed nothing new about who was behind the killing.</p>
        <p>27</p>
        <p>Zarqawi Planned Expansion  At the time of his death, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was still trying to transform his organization into a global operation capable of striking far beyond Iraq's borders, recruiting terrorists both in Iraq and abroad, intelligence experts agree.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Venezuela Forges New Force  President Hugo Chávez is attempting to create Latin America's largest civilian reserve force as part of Venezuela's rising military profile, in preparation for what Mr. Chavez insists is the threat of invasion by the United States.</p>
        <p>3</p>
        <p>NATIONAL</p>
        <p>28-37</p>
        <p>Suicides at Guantánamo  Three detainees being held at the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, apparently committed suicide, the first deaths of detainees to be reported at the military prison since it opened in early 2002, American military officials said.</p>
        <p>1</p>
        <p>Medicare Problems Continue  Bush administration officials say Medicare's new prescription drug program is humming along smoothly, but many patients still say they have difficulty getting the drugs they need.</p>
        <p>32</p>
        <p>Democrats Courting Bloggers  If there is an emerging consensus among much of the Democratic Party establishment, it is that blogs are an important emerging power in American politics. What is less clear is how mainstream politicians grapple with an audience that has defined itself in part by its dissatisfaction with mainstream politicians.</p>
        <p>37</p>
        <p>Recruiters Look to MySpace  Many companies that recruit on college campuses have been using search engines to conduct background checks on seniors looking for their first job. But now, college career counselors and other experts say, some recruiters are also looking up applicants on social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace.</p>

        <p>HEALTH/SCIENCE</p>
        <p>Teenage Smoking Holds Steady  After long steady decline, a new survey shows that smoking among high school students held steady at around one in four teenagers from 2003 to 2005.</p>
