        <p>THE future of European ski resorts -- or so some environmentalists hope -- may well be found in five eight-foot-high white geodesic-dome tents perched 5,600 feet up a mountain in the Swiss Alps.</p>
        <p>Accessible only on foot or on skis, and anchored to wooden platforms, these one- and two-person insulated tents are designed to leave absolutely no trace when they're pulled up in the spring. They have no plumbing or electricity, but each has a highly efficient wood stove. They're grouped around a restored 19th-century farmhouse that has a solar shower and generator-powered electricity for just a few hours each day.</p>
        <p>But a trip to Whitepod, as this collection of tents is known, hardly means roughing it. Guests sleep in their ''pods'' on full-size beds, snuggled into sheepskin rugs and brushed cotton duvets, and sated on local wines, cheeses and produce like hand-gathered morels. Each pod has a wide clear vinyl front window with an unobstructed view south toward Mont Blanc.</p>
        <p>Huddling under a duvet in a pod in the late afternoon, as the wood stove throws off a flickering light, and the east faces of the mountains glow pink with the setting sun, can be infinitely more satisfying (and romantic) than anything any four-star hotel can deliver.</p>
        <p>Whitepod, (41-79) 744 62 19 or at www.whitepod.com, is near Villars, Switzerland, an old-fashioned family-style ski resort southwest of Lake Geneva. Laced with streams, dotted with pines and ringed by the jagged tops of higher mountain ranges, including Mont Blanc, the tallest in the Alps, it's a quintessential Alpine ski spot.</p>
        <p>But this resort is also on the front lines of the climate change that is threatening ecosystems (and winter tourism) throughout the mountain range. Some studies suggest that resorts at the altitude of Villars (about 4,000 feet) will no longer be sustainable ski areas in as little as 30 years, as warming temperatures limit snowfall. Visitors in early January found just a few traces of a Christmas snowfall, with many slopes dotted with bare patches.</p>
        <p>It's not that Villars never gets the huge dumps of powder that skiers crave -- it's just that most of the snow now falls in late January and February, rather than all through the winter months, as it did just decades ago. The phenomenon is widespread throughout the Alps, and scores of small, family-run resorts in lower altitudes have shut in recent years as visitors fled to spots higher in the mountains, or areas with all-around snowmaking, or towns with alternative attractions to skiing.</p>
        <p>According to a United Nations Environment Program study, the snowline in the Alps could rise as much as 1,000 feet during this century. Resorts that are only 200 yards below Whitepod's altitude including the lower slopes of Villars, may no longer have enough snow to be viable ski areas in 30 to 50 years, the report said.</p>
        <p>Efforts to encourage ski areas to adapt to less snow by finding other ways to draw visitors have encountered tough going in the Alps, according to the idea's proponents. Generally, big ski area operators have adapted to warming temperatures by purchasing more snow guns to make snow when the mercury drops at night, a decision that some critics say just creates more environmental problems, such as freshwater consumption and hard-packed snow that may slow the spring growth of some plants.</p>
        <p>In fact, even as the green-skiing movement in the United States has progressed, some resorts in the Alps seem to be going completely in the other direction. Switzerland's most famous resort, Davos, is in the throes of a controversial building plan that includes a 26-story hotel and condominium that will be built hundreds of feet higher than the village, next to Der Zauerberg, the site of the sanitarium in Thomas Mann's ''Magic Mountain.''</p>
        <p>Part of Whitepod's raison d'Ãªtre is to create an alternative reason for tourists to come to the region. Billed as a place for hip eco-tourism, the camp has drawn a whirlwind of attention and a slew of city-dwelling guests since it opened this winter, as much for its modish good looks and luxury touches as for its environmentally friendly stance.</p>
        <p>Arriving at Whitepod means escaping your ordinary life in stages. When my boyfriend, Paul, and I went in January, the taxi drive from the Geneva airport skirted the north shore of Lake Geneva and whisked us through increasingly breathtaking scenery -- past the lakeside towns of Vevey and Montreux, then into the mountains on a steep, winding and mainly guardrail-free road fringed with farms and vineyards.</p>
        <p>At the top of the road was the village of Bretaye, at the foot of the slopes of Villars, where the owner of Whitepod, Sophia de Meyer, greeted her visitors. (The only other person there during our two nights was a lawyer from London.) Ms. de Meyer, who grew up in the area, turned her back on a career in corporate law in London to return home to open Whitepod. She cheerfully ushered those of us without skis into a rental shop, then onto a train up the mountain.</p>
        <p>At about three-quarters of the way up the rail line, we debarked, leaving behind skis and luggage to be picked up by snowmobile, and set off on foot for camp, ski poles in hand. After 20 minutes of slippery but hardly treacherous walking, we were seated in the late afternoon sun behind Whitepod's farmhouse, drinking tea and munching thin waffle cookies made by the resident chef, Camille Erbetta.</p>
        <p>The pods, we soon learned, are surprisingly spacious inside, with room for an armchair and a bleached pine vanity, and pleasantly warm even as night falls. They're also fully outfitted with oil lamps, slippers, a neat stack of dry wood and an I-pod with tunes ranging from Britpop to Barry White. The entrance zips closed, shutting out any hint of a breeze.</p>
        <p>Rates at Whitepod, $474 a person a night at 1.2 Swiss francs to the United States dollar, with a two-night minimum, include all meals, ski passes, guides and transfers to and from Geneva's airport.</p>
        <p>Dinners at Whitepod are made of locally obtained meats, cheese and vegetables, and served in the candlelit farmhouse kitchen, at a table with other guests. They're accompanied by local wines, which are a pleasant surprise, like Le Caviste, a vaguely citrusy white from the nearby village of Ollon.</p>
        <p>After our first dinner, we pulled on cold-weather gear for an evening snowshoe expedition. Thickets of stars hung overhead as we headed breathily up the hill. The only other noise was the squeaky crunch of the snowshoes on the ground, and the combination of moonlight, wine and the occasional shooting star gave the whole walk a dreamlike quality. As we headed back, I saw the constellation Orion hanging directly over our pod, brighter and more distinct than I have ever seen it. A night's sleep involved the occasional foray from under the covers to put another log into the wood stove. (Yes, the farmhouse is equipped with two toilets, but it's a cold walk outside.)</p>
        <p>The early morning sun peeking over the jagged edges of the Alps found its way through the pod's small circular side windows. Wheeling flocks of small black birds flew overhead, casting flickering momentary shadows inside the tent. They were enchanting, but over breakfast, we learned they are a variety of finch that until recently was only seen much farther north, and traditionally migrated south for the winter.</p>
        <p>After a breakfast of eggs, muesli, pancakes and fresh juice, Ms. de Meyer, a former ski instructor, leads our small group straight from the front door on our skis, for a full day of crisscrossing Villars. Many of its intermediate slopes are open despite the lack of snow cover. The still-melting snow is by turns slick and slushy, but poor snow conditions are offset by the unseasonably comfortable temperatures and sunny skies.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Meyer said that despite Whitepod's popularity, her attempts to get Villars resort officials to eschew snowmaking and push sports like snowshoeing instead have met with little enthusiasm. ''Mostly they feel that the market is a skiing market, and that a lot of investment has already been put into ski resorts, so why spend time and money looking into an alternative,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Skidding across the muddy slopes of Villars in January, it's hard not to agree that Ms. de Meyer's approach might be more on target.</p>
