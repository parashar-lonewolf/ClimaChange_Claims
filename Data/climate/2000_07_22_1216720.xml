        <p>The death of a man who was shot this week with a high-powered pellet rifle in the East New York section of Brooklyn was the first killing in the city with such a weapon in recent memory, law enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>During a five-hour nighttime spree by a rooftop sniper that continued into Thursday morning, four other people were wounded -- including one man who lost an eye -- by a weapon that is illegal in New York City but generally unregulated.</p>
        <p>The incident was only one of a number of recent attacks across the nation with pellet guns, which are increasingly high-powered and dangerous. In Chicago, for example, a police officer wearing a bulletproof vest was struck and bruised this week by a shot fired from a pellet gun powered by a carbon dioxide cartridge. And two weeks ago in Carmel Valley, Calif., several migrant workers were reported to have been sprayed by pellets in an attack by  men yelling racial epithets.</p>
        <p>Despite the apparent rarity of killings with air guns, the American Academy of Pediatrics found in the early 1990's that ''nonpowder firearms'' were becoming increasingly dangerous as they became more high-powered. Over a 10-year period,  they were blamed for 35,000 hospital emergency department visits a year and 25 deaths in the United States, the association found. Air guns include handguns, rifles and shotguns that fire BB's, darts and pellets using compressed air instead of gunpowder.</p>
        <p>The slain man in the Brooklyn shooting early Thursday was Joffre Cedeno, 30. Mr. Cedeno, an Ecuadorean immigrant, was struck in the chest by a pellet that nicked his aorta, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The police have charged Marcel Vache, 19, with murder and five counts of assault. According to the police, Mr. Vache opened fire with a pellet rifle on passers-by below the four-story apartment building at 190 Jerome Street where he lived.</p>
        <p>The shooting began at 11:40 p.m. Wednesday when Zi-Chan Chen, 21, was struck twice in the back by pellets. About 4:10 a.m. Thursday, Lee Pointer, 59, was hit once in the back. Another man, Jose DeJesus, 34, was also hit. All were treated for minor injuries at local hospitals.</p>
        <p>At 4:30 a.m., a pellet struck the right eye of Walter Brown, 50, as he walked along nearby Atlantic Avenue. He was treated at Brookdale Hospital, where he was expected to be released last night, a hospital spokesman said. Mr. Cedeno was shot and killed at 5 a.m.</p>
        <p>Despite the long documented use of pellet guns in robberies, law enforcement officials said they could not remember a person dying from being shot by one of the weapons.  ''We have not had one back in 20 years'' in Brooklyn, said Kevin Davitt of the borough's district attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Possession of a pellet gun is a violation of the city's administrative code, which carries a fine, he said.  ''But having used it in the manner he used it, he's got a problem,'' Mr. Davitt said.</p>
        <p>The police said they have not determined a motive for the shooting, but one law enforcement official said Mr. Vache apparently fired randomly from the rooftop. There is no evidence that he knew the people he shot or intended to kill anyone, the official said.</p>
        <p>At the apartment building where Mr. Vache lived, Jahayar Robles, 22, who described herself as his friend, said she met Mr. Vache about two years ago. He was homeless, and she invited him to live with her. ''I treated him like my son,'' Ms. Robles said. ''He used to call me Mom.''</p>
        <p>Last November, he moved into another apartment in the building with his girlfriend and recently had been looking for a job. ''I used to give him a Spanish blessing to be safe,'' Ms. Robles said, crying. ''I used to tell him to stay out of trouble.''</p>
        <p>About a dozen blocks away, Mr. Cedeno's sister, Margie Demarize, 46, stood by the gate of her family's home, demanding justice. She said her brother, a welder who was known by his middle name, Bayro, lived with his mother, father and two other sisters.</p>
        <p>He loved playing soccer, she said, and on Wednesday night, he had gone out to watch a match. He was on his way home when he was shot.</p>
        <p>''We know we're not going to be able to bring him back to life,'' she said. ''But the law must do something so this kid does not commit another crime.''</p>
