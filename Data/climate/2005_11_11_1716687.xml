        <p>New York State announced Wednesday that it would adopt California's strict new limits on automobile emissions of carbon dioxide, a major global warming gas. The announcement fulfills Gov.

It also puts him on a direct collision course with the Bush administration, which has joined with the major automobile manufacturers in opposing the California program.</p>
        <p>The California program, approved by the State Legislature in 2002, requires manufacturers to begin cutting carbon dioxide emissions in the 2009 model year, with a goal of reducing these emissions by 30 percent by the 2016 model year.

        <p>New York State announced Wednesday that it would adopt California's strict new limits on automobile emissions of carbon dioxide, a major global warming gas. The announcement fulfills Gov. George Pataki's pledge in his State of the State address in 2003 to make all cars sold in New York State adhere to the California standards. It also puts him on a direct collision course with the Bush administration, which has joined with the major automobile manufacturers in opposing the California program.</p>
        <p>The California program, approved by the State Legislature in 2002, requires manufacturers to begin cutting carbon dioxide emissions in the 2009 model year, with a goal of reducing these emissions by 30 percent by the 2016 model year. This is an ambitious target, and absent a sudden technological breakthrough, the only feasible way to meet it is to force the automakers to produce more fuel-efficient cars, which produce less emissions.</p>
        <p>The program faces a legal siege. The automakers and the administration argue that this is merely a backdoor way of mandating tougher fuel-economy standards, which under current law are the responsibility of the federal government. California's reply is that it has a right -- indeed, an obligation -- under the Clean Air Act to remove pollutants of any kind from California's air.</p>
        <p>The larger issue here is one of political leadership. President Bush has refused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from any source -- cars, power plants or industrial sites -- preferring instead a softer, voluntary approach that has yielded little progress. Congress, meanwhile, has refused to mandate significant increases in fuel efficiency.</p>
        <p>Impatient governors who take global warming more seriously than Mr. Bush and Congress do -- including Republicans like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mr. Pataki -- have therefore decided to take matters into their own hands.</p>
        <p>Altogether, more than 30 states have approved global warming laws of one sort or another. And in a few weeks, a consortium of Northeastern states will announce a breakthrough program imposing regional caps on power plants' emissions and setting up a trading program to help cut these emissions in a cost-effective manner.</p>
        <p>The impact of the automobile program could be huge if it survives legal challenges. Cars and light trucks (a category that includes sport utility vehicles) account for one-fifth of America's greenhouse gas emissions and about 40 percent of its oil consumption. In addition to New York, seven Northeastern states as well as Washington and Oregon have either adopted the California program or are moving in that direction.</p>
        <p>This means that by the end of the year, nearly one-third of the automobile retail market is likely to be covered by the new regulations -- a tremendous incentive to the industry to start making fuel-efficient cars for everyone.</p>
