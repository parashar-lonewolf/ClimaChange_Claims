        <p>LEAD: Beginning tonight at 9 and continuing through to 1, Channel 13 carries ''The Endangered Earth,'' a package of four programs frankly intended to unnerve us.

        <p>Beginning tonight at 9 and continuing through to 1, Channel 13 carries ''The Endangered Earth,'' a package of four programs frankly intended to unnerve us. The subjects are not new to viewers of public television. If Americans are still insufficiently unnerved about what manmade pollution is doing to the world's ecology, it is not for want of documentaries.</p>
        <p>Tonight's programs begin what Channel 13 says will be a weekly series on the environment. The first two of the documentaries, made by Norwegian Broadcasting, deal with that most ominous development of recent years, the thinning of the ozone layer. Scientists explain what is happening, why it is happening and what is likely to happen in the next few decades if the process continues unchecked. Scandinavia gets a lot of attention, but the ozone knows no national boundaries.</p>
        <p>In brief, the world is getting warmer, and more ultraviolet rays are passing through to the earth. Worst-case scenarios are delivered in the form of newscasts from the year 2048, telling graphically of flood and famine, disease and drought, political upheaval and devastation on a monumental scale. The technique is slightly sophomoric, but it does make its point.</p>
        <p>The programs also suggest why, despite countless international symposiums delivering countless warnings, there is still so much resistance to doing what needs to be done to cut down on the gases that are causing the trouble. They emanate from such amenities as refrigerators and air conditioners, not to forget the good old internal combustion engine, items that neither consumers nor producers are inclined to part with. Changing people's habits or interfering with their pleasures is not easy. As the documentary makers show, in the pleasant form of topless bathers, sun lovers keep subjecting themselves to the sun's rays despite a growing incidence of skin cancer.</p>
        <p>Channel 13 tops off its evening at the brink with two documentaries, also from Scandinavia, on acid rain and chemical pollution. Next Tuesday brings ocean dumping, cancer research and, finally, at 10:30, a half hour, with Walter Cronkite, called, ''Big Fears, Little Risks,'' which takes a more sanguine point of view about carcinogens.</p>
        <p>One scientist in tonight's report on the ozone layer says, ''We cannot predict what the outcome will be.'' But he fears it will be dramatic and destructive, if not for this generation, then for our children and grandchildren. It is possible, of course, that the scientists called on here are pessimists, that nature will adapt without undue disruption or that timely action will yet be taken - but the evidence does not make for optimism. As long as the dangers seem remote to most people, that is justification enough for a series of this sort.</p>
