        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 9 news article on the Clean Water Act examines the wetlands controversy but does not address another provision of the bill that threatens the country's most important renewable energy source: hydropower.</p>
        <p>A Supreme Court decision last May in a Washington State case gives state water quality agencies, through the Section 401 process of the Clean Water Act, the ability to veto a hydro project owner's request for a license. However, Congress, through the Federal Power Act, has given hydro licensing authority to the Federal Energy Regulation Commission. Thus, there is a conflict between the Clean Water Act and Federal Power Act that places a redundant and unnecessary regulatory burden on the hydro industry.</p>
        <p>About 12 percent of the nation's electricity comes from clean, renewable hydropower. It does not produce or emit pollutants, toxins or any greenhouse gases. At Niagara Mohawk, hydropower accounts for 22 percent of the electricity we supply to our 1.5 million customers in upstate New York. In addition to being a critical part of our energy mix, our more than 70 hydro plants also play an integral role in achieving our overall emission reduction goals.</p>
        <p>If the conflict over control of the hydro licensing process is not corrected, the industry will be regulated right out of the energy market. If this happens, we will all pay -- through higher energy costs and through a negative impact on the environment due to the loss of the largest source of renewable energy.</p>
        <p>Congress can make sure this does not happen by removing hydro licensing from the scope of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, or at the least by insuring that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission be the final decision maker in cases where there is conflict between a state water quality agency and Federal licensing authority. WILLIAM E. DAVIS  Chmn., Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. Syracuse, May 9, 1995</p>
