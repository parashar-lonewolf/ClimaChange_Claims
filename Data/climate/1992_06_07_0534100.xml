        <p>The United States, the Earth Summit reminds us, is the world's biggest energy user, and thus its biggest carbon dioxide producer.

        <p>The "E-Lamp," for electronic lamp, is only slightly more efficient than existing compact fluorescent bulbs and will cost about the same: $12 to $15 when it comes on the market next year. But it is smaller, so it will be useful in more places, and with a 20,000-hour life, is close to eternal, which will make it attractive in factories and stores that can lay off a worker with a ladder.</p>
