        <p>LEAD: IN HIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK, ''Italian Wines,'' Victor Hazan has this to say about rose:</p>
        <p>IN HIS DELIGHTFUL BOOK, ''Italian Wines,'' Victor Hazan has this to say about rose:</p>
        <p>''I hope no one who likes roses will take offense, but I am unable to conceal the fact that I find them nearly always boring. Beyond the charm of their color, with which I am quickly satiated, they have little to say to me.''</p>
        <p>He goes on to give the nod to a handful -Castel del Monte, from Apulia; Riviera del Garda from the western shore of Lake Garda; Faustus, from Sicily, and a few others - but that's it.</p>
        <p>Poor rose wines! Mr Hazan misses the point. Of course most of them are boring. But so are a lot of other things - like half the people you know - if you take them too seriously. Rose wines are for blue water, white sand and limitless skies. For a terrazza at Portofino, the Croisette at Cannes or a deck at Malibu. They are for easy, lazy times of trashy novels and silly clothes, when deciding on lunch is a major effort. In such a delightful, torpid state, who can worry about the wine?</p>
        <p>Rose wines should be cold and wet, pretty to look at and easy to drink. They should be dry, or only slightly sweet, a bit sharp. Around the Mediterranean, where so many of them are consumed, roses invariably accompany fish and need enough acid to cut through the oiliness of the sole or rouget or Saint-Pierre.</p>
        <p>Rose wines can be made from just about any red wine grape. The cheapest roses are made by mixing red and white wine until the desired pink tint is obtained. Genuine rose is made by crushing red grapes, then quickly removing the skins from the fermentation vat. The juice of red grapes is white; the color comes from the skins. The longer the juice remains in contact with the skins, the redder the wine will be.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a wine maker will tap into a vat of, say, cabernet sauvignon in its early days to draw off some of the wine while it's still rose. This gives him a more concentrated red when the remainder is fully fermented and aged. It also gives him some cash flow because the rose will be ready to be bottled - and drunk - in just a few months.</p>
        <p>The Italians are probably the most dedicated rose makers. They seem to have several hundred rose DOCs, or legal wine names, from Bolzano to Palermo, and some of them, often called chiaretto, are very good. Alas, few ever make it to our shores. The Spanish make roses; so do the Moroccans and Algerians and Greeks and Israelis. The Australians make a few lively roses that are available here the same year as the harvest. Because of the switch in seasons from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, they pick in April Down Under.</p>
        <p>The two best-known French roses are from Anjou in the Loire Valley, where the principal grape is the cabernet franc, and the Tavel, from the Rhone Valley, which is made from the grenache and other local grapes. Tavel, which often has a slight orange tinge to it, can be a big wine for a rose, thanks to the hot Rhone sun; it has up to 13 percent alcohol, which means it's not to be gulped like a Diet Pepsi. Unless you get headaches from Diet Pepsi.</p>
        <p>The Burgundians make an attractive rose in a little town near Dijon called Marsannay. It's not easy to find these days, which may be just as well because it might cost what most other Burgundies cost - too much.</p>
        <p>Among the French, the most popular roses are the anonymous wines they consume in vast quantities every summer along the Riviera. No matter if you're staying with the haut monde, or in a trailer camp much favored by Dutch tourists, the wine will be rose, often cut with mineral water or ice. No matter. It goes great with fried fish. L'Estadon is a popular rose label along the Mediterranean littoral, and there are a couple of rather expensive versions, including the wines of the Domaine Ott, which are sold in this country, too.</p>
        <p>Not that there is really any need to go abroad to find good roses; we have plenty of them right here. In fact, the array is bewildering. Would you believe Red Rose? Or Pink Chablis? Or how about Pink Catawba, or that old standby of the pint-bottle crowd, Richard's Wild Irish Rose - with no accent on the e?</p>
        <p>The big news in rose wine is, of course, white zinfandel, which, according to some of its producers, really isn't rose at all. Well, it isn't green and it isn't white either. It's made from the red zinfandel grape, and there is always a pink or orange-pink tint to the wine. Some California wine makers, not necessarily using the same grape, call the wine ''blush,'' but white zinfandel is the name that has caught on.</p>
        <p>The wine is made with a touch of added sugar, to make it slightly sweet, and a bit of carbon dioxide, to make it lively. It has become an enormous success in the last two years, competing strongly with lambrusco, the cold, sweet, slightly fizzy fad of the early 1980's. Almost 8 million cases of California white zinfandel were sold last year; not bad for a wine that didn't exist a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Most of the white zins, as their fans call them, are soft and characterless. A few are not: Ridge Vineyards, for example, or Bel Arbres, which is the second label of Fetzer Vineyards, or Buehler Vineyard. These wines are crisp and fresh, with little or no cloying sweetness.</p>
        <p>The best American roses are those made from premium grapes such as the cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir, and vinified dry, not sweet.</p>
        <p>Among the top dry roses are Firestone Vineyard's Rose of Cabernet and Simi Winery's Rose of Cabernet. No vintages are listed with any of these wines. The idea is to find the youngest and freshest and to avoid any one of them more than a year or two old. Rose can be fun, but it's no wine for the ages.</p>
