        <p>With national parks and forests, there is not much posted land in the Smokies, though thick growths of wild rhododendron block access to miles of stream banks. But the Deep Creek Missionary Baptist Church does warn: ''No Fishing on Sundays.''</p>
        <p>But this was Saturday. There was a light hatch and a few fish rising, which was a few more than we had seen anywhere else that morning on the Oconaluftee River or the day before on the East Fork of the Pigeon River. And there were easy steps down from the church parking lot to a deep pool on Deep Creek.</p>
        <p>After back surgery last winter, my wading is tentative, but Roger Lowe, a trout fisherman for 40 years and a guide for 20, led me out on a shelf. The fish were in casting distance. One swirled and rejected a No. 18 parachute blue-winged olive. Another took it and Lowe shouted, ''Nice one on, Buddy-ro.''</p>
        <p>It was a nine-inch rainbow that jumped twice, and soon a 10-inch brown followed, and a couple of smaller fish. They were all natives: stocking ended in the 1970's in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Both rainbow were lighter than fish of their length out West; there is not much food in the slightly acidic streams of the Smokies.</p>
        <p>''Our limestone was washed away millions of years ago,'' explained Matt Ray, a fish biologist in Canton, N.C. In the last 20 years, pollution, especially from the coal-fired electricity plants of the Tennessee Valley Authority, has made things worse.</p>
        <p>The streams were not muddy, and had not been during the downpour on Friday. Lowe said that with thick ''rhododendron and hardwood forest, there is not enough runoff there to create what we would call real muddy water. Most of the time it kind of turns dark in color, but clear.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Lowe's best guess for the slow fishing on Saturday was that the fish were full. It had poured on Friday, for the third time that week, washing a lot of terrestrials into the streams. ''We simply had some fish that couldn't eat any more,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That seemed plausible, based on the fishing we had the day before. The rain had led another of his customers to cancel, but Lowe was optimistic. Anyway, he said, ''Can't catch fish sitting on the couch.'' We went southeast from his fly shop in Waynesville (31 miles west of Asheville) to the Pisgah National Forest, and a catch-and-release section of the Pigeon maintained by the national conservation organization, Trout Unlimited.</p>
        <p>The walk through the woods was strenuous, but the river had several big pools. It was lovely, dry fly water, but nothing was rising, though the splashes of big raindrops looked like a feeding frenzy. Lowe tied on an inch-worm imitation, about an inch of green fuzzy foam material on a No. 12 hook. I caught a couple of little fish quickly, and then a 17-inch brown that went deep and tried to stay there, followed by a 16-inch rainbow.</p>
        <p>I looked on the collar of my rain jacket and saw why. An inch-worm had just fallen on it from a birch tree, and when I looked around, they seemed everywhere. No wonder the trout were taking them after the rain washed them off the leaves. About the only adjustments needed were adjustments in how much split shot to use in different pools; we landed a dozen trout in about five soggy hours; it turned out my new waders had pinhole leaks in both legs.</p>
        <p>We did not catch any brook trout. You cannot fish for them in the national park, where many streams are closed off to protect brookies as part of a restoration effort that has involved electroshocking browns and rainbows toward the headwaters of many streams and releasing them below natural barriers like waterfalls.</p>
        <p>One difficulty is that most of the brook-trout waters are higher than 3,000 feet, where the acid rain has had the most harmful impact. The restoration effort does not involve merely any brook trout, according to Matt Kulp of the National Park Service, but a distinct strain, possibly a subspecies, found in the Southern Appalachians.</p>
        <p>These brook trout do not grow as big as their northern cousins, though that may be because of the limited food supply. (Northern brook trout stocked in these streams are also small.) Kulp said the most obvious difference is that the ''southern strain fish have brighter and more pronounced red spots on the side. Their colors are much more vivid, not just at spawning time.''</p>
        <p>Maybe next trip. Lowe said ''there are still a lot of them around -- but not a lot of people enjoy getting on your hands and knees and bow and arrow casting.''</p>
