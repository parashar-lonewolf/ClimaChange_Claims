        <p>LESTER COHEN seems an unlikely candidate to revolutionize the field of surgery.</p>
        <p>A business major at New York University in the 1950's, he went on to help run a successful family business that produced, among other things, elastic straps for brassieres.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, Mr. Cohen will receive his second patent for a device that he contends should make certain kinds of surgery safer and faster. Some experts in the surgical field think Mr. Cohen might be right.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen has developed a novel clamp that he says ''takes the best of both worlds'' -- from traditional surgery and newer laparoscopic surgery -- and combines these two approaches into a new hybrid type of surgery. It allows the surgeon a fuller view of the inside of the patient -- as if there was a full surgical incision -- but through the smaller incisions of laparoscopic procedures.</p>
        <p>''It almost takes a guy like Lester to do this sort of thing because he didn't come to the field with any preconceived notions,'' said Donald Kaplan, a materials scientist who is a consultant to Mr. Cohen and who used to design equipment at U.S. Surgical.</p>
        <p>Laparoscopic surgery enables a surgeon to operate through small incisions by watching a magnified image captured by a tiny camera snaked into the patient's body.</p>
        <p>This type of surgery is often used for procedures that used to involve extensive cutting for access to organs and other body parts like tendons and muscles. Because laparoscopy requires only a few small incisions instead of one large one, it allows patients to recover much more quickly than traditional surgery.</p>
        <p>Laparoscopy has its drawbacks. For one, it requires a large investment in training on the part of surgeons.</p>
        <p>But the surgery can be tricky even for experienced surgeons. In its April issue of last year, the Annals of Surgery published a paper on bile duct injuries inflicted during laparoscopic gallbladder surgery.</p>
        <p>The author, Lawrence W. Way, concluded that most of the injuries were due to ''visual misperception.'' While such injuries occurred in only about one-half of 1 percent of these surgeries, they are serious and sometimes result in death.</p>
        <p>''It's like trying to tie a bow tie in the mirror,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''What the surgeon sees is a mirror image. It takes a great deal of training.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen has invented a miniature version of surgical clamps, which hold open traditional surgical incisions. But Mr. Cohen's invention has a unusual feature: blades that splay the incision open beneath the surface of the skin.</p>
        <p>By dialing a little knob, the surgeon or nurse makes the blades slowly swing open, like shutters on a window. As the blades open, they push flesh, fat and viscera out of the way, giving the surgeon a clear window on the organ under scrutiny. Thus, according to Mr. Cohen, a surgeon can see as well through a small incision as he could through a large one.</p>
        <p>With his invention, a surgeon can perform an operation in the traditional way or choose to use laparoscopic equipment, Mr. Cohen said. In addition to better visual access, he said, the clamp obviates the need for insufflation, pumping up the patient's stomach with carbon dioxide so that the surgeon can get a better view.</p>
        <p>The device has been used in about 1,500 surgeries and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said that he had been developing his invention for about decade but that the technology was only now coming to fruition.</p>
        <p>The main hurdle, as he sees it, is cultural rather than technological. ''It's a disruptive technology,'' Mr. Cohen said, noting that the surgical supply industry is reluctant to retool to supply new products.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Cohen's own gallbladder is troubling him. He seems to be waffling on whether to have it removed.</p>
        <p>''I haven't decided whether to have surgery or not,'' he said, ''But if I do, the surgeon will be using my own equipment.''</p>
        <p>The U.S. Patent Office is expected to issue patent No.6,712,795 tomorrow.</p>
