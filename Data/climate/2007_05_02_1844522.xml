        <p>Secretary General Ban Ki-moon chose three international figures to help him chart a way for the United Nations to take the lead in addressing climate change. The special envoys are Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway; Ricardo Lagos, a former president of Chile; and Han Seung-soo, a former foreign minister of South Korea and president of the General Assembly in 2001. Michèle Montas, Mr. Ban's spokeswoman, said the three would prepare proposals for the opening of the General Assembly in September when national leaders come to New York and for a United Nations conference in Bali, Indonesia, in December. Last month, the first-ever debate on climate change was held in the Security Council.</p>
