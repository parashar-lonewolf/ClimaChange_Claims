        <p>LEAD: Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said today that he had urged the United States Sentencing Commission to adopt guidelines that would result in tougher sentences for corporations convicted of white-collar crimes and other offenses.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said today that he had urged the United States Sentencing Commission to adopt guidelines that would result in tougher sentences for corporations convicted of white-collar crimes and other offenses.</p>
        <p>The department's position, as outlined in two letters to the commission, appeared to be largely unchanged from an earlier letter of support for stiff corporate sentences that was abruptly retracted in March after the chief White House legal officer inquired about it.</p>
        <p>The commission, whose guidelines for sentencing individual offenders have been in place since November 1987, is preparing its first guidelines setting penalties for corporate offenders. The final proposal is expected to be submitted to Congress early next year.</p>
        <p>In the letters disclosed today, Mr. Thornburgh said he supported proposals that would lead to longer sentences for defendants convicted of savings and loan fraud, money laundering, antitrust offenses and environmental crimes. Department officials said White House officials raised no objection.</p>
        <p>Return to Former Stance</p>
        <p>The department's position appeared to be similar to its stance on Feb. 26, when Donald B. Ayer, the former deputy attorney general, wrote to the commission endorsing a draft proposal of guidelines that recommended stiff sentences on corporations.</p>
        <p>In March, after meeting with members of the Business Round Table, which represents many leading corporations, C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, sent a note to Robert Ross, who was then Mr. Thornburgh's chief of staff. Mr. Ayer then wrote a note to the commission saying he was withdrawing his earlier letter because the issue required careful study.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what happened in the intervening eight months that led Mr. Thornburgh to endorse the sentencing proposals, but he said the department reached its position after analyzing various sentencing ideas, along with public comments made to the commission and the department.</p>
        <p>One of the most hotly debated issues in setting the guidelines was how to calculate fines against corporations. Business groups have vigorously opposed the draft proposal that was offered for public comment last year, saying the fines contemplated by the guidelines were far too high.</p>
        <p>Alternative Plan Dropped</p>
        <p>The department has endorsed a system in which fines would be calculated according to the seriousness of the offense, rather than the amount of loss or gain involved in the crime.</p>
        <p>In one change since the earlier letter, Mr. Thornburgh dropped his endorsement of a proposal that would create an alternative sentencing procedure in which the maximum fine against a corporate offender would be twice the amount of gain or loss resulting from the offense.</p>
        <p>''While the amount of loss is often a good indicator of the seriousness of an offense, a serious offense does not always result in any great provable loss,'' Mr. Thornburgh said. ''For example, a serious environmental offense involving danger to the ozone layer could not be adequately punished under the loss approach.''</p>
        <p>Some experts said the change might reduce the financial liability of a corporate offender in a few circumstances, for example, in the case of a company convicted of intentionally causing a large oil spill, which could result in fines of billions of dollars. But others said the change would have little impact.</p>
