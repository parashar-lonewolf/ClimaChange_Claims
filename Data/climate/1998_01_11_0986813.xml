        <p>Worried that sales might be hurt by growing public awareness of light truck pollution, the Ford Motor Company said that all of its sport utility vehicles, including the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator, would be low-emission vehicles for the 1999 model year. This will make them roughly as clean as new cars, at a cost of a little more than $100 a vehicle. Chrysler said that it would make clean-running Jeep Cherokees and Grand Cherokees, but not a cleaner version of the highly popular Dodge Durango. General Motors and foreign auto makers said they would study the issue.</p>

        <p>Reducing smog will not address another environmental problem of sport utility vehicles: their poor gas mileage, which makes them produce more global warming gases than cars. Detroit auto makers did say, however, that between 2001 and 2004 they would start building some high-technology cars that would get 60 to 80 miles per gallon.</p>
