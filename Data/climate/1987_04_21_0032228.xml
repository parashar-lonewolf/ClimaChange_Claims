        <p>LEAD: Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel today recommended to Congress that the entire 1.5 million-acre coastal plain within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil development.</p>
        <p>Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel today recommended to Congress that the entire 1.5 million-acre coastal plain within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodel said that the coastal plain in Alaska, less than 100 miles east of the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field, offered the best hope for a major new onshore oil strike in the United States.</p>
        <p>His decision sets the stage for what promises to be a spirited and protracted legislative battle on Capitol Hill over the future of the 18.9 million-acre wildlife refuge. Legislation already has been introduced to turn the entire refuge into a wilderness area, a designation that would effectively bar oil drilling or any other development.</p>
        <p>Experts on both sides of the issue said the outcome of the Congressional debate was uncertain. U.S. Need for Oil Find Cited</p>
        <p>At a news conference here, Mr. Hodel said that the nation badly needed a major oil discovery if it was not to become dangerously dependent on foreign energy supplies by the end of the century.</p>
        <p>Conservationists and some members of Congress attacked the decision, saying it was a ''drain America first policy'' that would use up the nation's oil reserves quickly while unnecessarily posing a threat to the wildlife within the delicate environment of the Arctic refuge.</p>
        <p>The environmental groups contended that conservation of energy along with the development of new and renewable energy sources would meet the nation's future needs without endangering the caribou, musk oxen and other wildlife that depend on the refuge.</p>
        <p>According to the data compiled by the Interior Department, there is only a 19 percent chance that a major oil field will be found under the coastal plain. But if there is such as strike, it could produce 600 million to 9.2 billion barrels of oil, with the mean estimate 3.2 billion barrels. End to Oil Reserves Seen</p>
        <p>Prudhoe Bay's oil reserves are estimated at 9 billion barrels. Mr. Hodel said today that those reserves would be running out by the end of the century and that that was a major reason a new strike in the wildlife refuge was needed. Without such additional domestic reserves, he said, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be in the ''driver's seat'' and national security would be compromised.</p>
        <p>The coastal plain stretches 104 miles from east to west along the Beaufort Sea facing the North Pole and is 34 miles from north to south at its widest point. With the sea covered with ice most of the year and no roads leading into the area, it is remote. But plans call for any oil found in the refuge to be shipped south by way of the Transalaska Pipeline, which begins at nearby Prudhoe Bay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodel said the consequences of oil development would be ''negligible'' for grizzly and polar bears, snow geese, wolves and moose. The only species that might be affected are musk oxen and the great migratory Porcupine caribou herd. The musk oxen herd is not likely to decline as a result of oil activity, he said.</p>
        <p>As for the Porcupine caribou herd, which uses the coastal plain as a calving area for relief from mosquitoes, there would be a possible ''displacement'' of calving populations, but that ''it is considered unlikely, though possible, that such displacement would result in any appreciable decline in herd size,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A report issued by the Interior Department last fall indicated that the caribou population might decline by as much as 40 percent as a result of oil activity in the coastal plain. Today, however, Mr. Hodel said that that projection had been an ''error.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodel said that the experience of the oil industry at Prudhoe Bay and with building and operating the Transalaska Pipeline showed that oil development need not harm the environment.</p>
        <p>''Our nation has proven that we need not choose between exploring for and developing the energy necessary for survival and growth on one hand, and protecting the environment on the other,'' he said. Udall Warns of 'Gamble'</p>
        <p>But his contention was sharply questioned. Representative Morris K. Udall, chairman of the House Interior Committee, who is the author of legislation to make the refuge a wilderness area, said today that the Reagan Administration ''is taking an enormous gamble with one of the irreplaceable ecosystems left in the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Udall, an Arizona Democrat, said, ''Congress now has a grave responsibility to the country and the world to protect it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodel, in response to a question, said that the Canadian Government was also urging that the Arctic refuge be made a wilderness area. The Porcupine caribou herd and other wildlife that use the refuge migrate back and forth into Canada.</p>
        <p>George T. Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society, an environmental group, said: ''In its rush to be chief advocate for the oil companies, the Reagan Adnministration has lost all credibility when it comes to the Arctic Refuge. Its agenda is clear: oil at any cost. But the American public will not stand for it.''</p>
        <p>Peter A. A. Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, said: ''There are practical alternatives -through cost-effective energy conservation - to exploiting the Arctic Refuge. The United States can leave wilderness alone and still solve its need for a safe and assured supply of oil.'' He charged that the Administration had pushed the nation toward greater reliance on foreign oil by failing to develop a comprehensive energy plan that included conservation. Oil Imports Put at 40 %</p>
        <p>But Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said that the nation was importing 40 percent of its oil and that ''without question, new sources of oil must be located.''</p>
        <p>Senator Murkowski said that the caribou herd in the Prudhoe Bay area had increased in the oil development years and added that the Interior Department report had found the impact on the caribou in the wildlife refuge would be ''minimal.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, said: ''Continued petroleum development in Alaska, which now contributes one-fifth of the oil production in our country, is essential to a sensible American energy policy.</p>
        <p>''The petroleum industry has demonstrated day in and day out, year in and year out, for more than two decades of oil and natural gas development in Alaska that its operations are conducted in a sound, environmentally sensitive way with minimal disturbance to wildlife.''</p>
        <p>Last year's proposal by the Interior Department recommended that core calving areas be avoided in the oil development process. However, Mr. Hodel's final recommendation said that there were no ''core'' calving areas and recommended that the whole coastal plain be made available.</p>
        <p>However, the report did note that the caribou did return most years to an 85,000 acre area near the Jago River. This area is believed to contain about 25 percent of the potential oil reserves of the area.  ARCTIC WILDLIFE REFUGE: AT A GLANCE  HISTORY  An 8.9-million-acre protective area was established in 1960 to preserve unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values after more than a decade of efforts to preserve this part of Alaska.</p>
        <p>Ten million acres were added to the area in 1980 to make the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The act establishing the Refuge directed the Interior Department to conduct a five-year study of the area's oil potential, but it also provided that development could only proceed with Congressional approval. Some 8 million acres was designated wilderness, which effectively bars drilling.  GOALS  The refuge was established to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity including, but not limited to, the Porcupine caribou herd, polar bears, grizzly bears, musk-oxen, Dall sheep, wolves, wolverines, snow geese, peregrine falcons and other migratory birds, and Arctic char and grayling; to fulfill international treaty obligations with respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats; to provide the opportunity for continued subsistence uses by local residents; and to insure water quality and necessary water quantity within the refuge.  GEOGRAPHY  The area is in the tundra-covered Arctic Coastal Plain Province, the only extension of the Interior Plains of North America in Alaska. Such low-growing plants as sedges, grasses, mosses, lichens, small herbs and dwarf shrubs cover much of the area. Except for a small section, the Refuge is believed to be completely underlain by permafrost. Water and wind are the major shapers of the landscape. There has been some earthquake activity in the area, but historically the level of this activity is low.  Source: Dept. of the Interior)</p>
