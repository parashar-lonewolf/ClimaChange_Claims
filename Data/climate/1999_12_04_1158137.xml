        <p>There were roadshows and beach parties, rock concerts and free handouts to refurbish the European image of Coca-Cola, the world's most famous brand. Yet, five months after 250 people in Belgium complained of sickness they attributed to contaminated soft drinks, prompting the biggest recall in Coke's 113-year history, a number of obstacles are frustrating the company's effort to put the scandal to rest.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola's sales have sharply increased and it has achieved what a spokesman, Steve Leroy, called a ''significant success'' in recovering its dominant market share. But Coke's competitors have taken umbrage at its giveaways, forcing the Atlanta-based beverage giant, through a court ruling this week, to suspend the free products it has been offering to 40,000 outlets in Belgium.</p>
        <p>In October, the company confronted another flurry of health scares when four Belgian children reported illness from drinking Coke. Prosecutors cleared the company of responsibility in these incidents, but the publicity reminded customers once again about the mass illnesses in June.</p>
        <p>The product recall, and its consequences, have cost the Coca-Cola Company at least $200 million, and its bottler in Belgium, Coca-Cola Enterprises, estimates its losses at $103 million.</p>
        <p>Now, as Coca-Cola reasserts its hold on the palates of Belgians -- who drink two million liters, or 543,000 gallons, of its products every day -- the recollection of those June illnesses has returned to haunt it.</p>
        <p>The parents of four teenagers say their children, taken sick then, have yet to fully recover. The parents of the 13-  and 14-year-olds, all of whom attend the same school at Bornem, south of Antwerp, have demanded a face-to-face meeting with company representatives. Coke has essentially agreed to a meeting, though a time has not yet been scheduled.</p>
        <p>What they want, the parents say, is to discover what Coca-Cola knows about the mysterious complaints afflicting their children and to demand more money in compensation than the company has been prepared to pay to other families. Their children, they say, still suffer from headaches, knee pain and exhaustion.</p>
        <p>''They spent millions apologizing to people who hadn't had problems,'' said Luc Schroyens, the father of 13-year-old Elke Schroyens, one of the four reporting persistent complaints. ''But they still didn't apologize to these children who did have problems. We don't say there's a crime, but we see Coca-Cola as the cause of the problem and they should solve the problem.''</p>
        <p>Based on accounts pieced together from interviews with lawyers, doctors, parents, the teenagers and Coca-Cola officials, the four did not recover with the same speed as more than 30 others from the same school. In July, the teenagers' parents agreed with Coke that they should be examined by two doctors, one appointed by the parents and one by the company.</p>
        <p>Those examinations took place after the summer, but exhaustive medical tests were made almost impossible because all the blood samples taken from the students in June had apparently disappeared.</p>
        <p>The two doctors who examined the teenagers reached identical conclusions, according to Dr. Roger Eeckels, a leading Belgian pediatrician, who had been appointed by Coke. Neither he nor the physician appointed by the parents, Dr. Albert Woods, would discuss the diagnosis, citing strict confidentiality laws.</p>
        <p>But both the parents and others who have seen the diagnosis said it concluded that the teenagers' symptoms related in some way to drinking Coke products, possibly inducing a stressful reaction compounded by subsequent psychological factors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leroy, the Coke spokesman, said it was ''factually incorrect that the medical reports state that the Coca-Cola made them physiologically sick.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroyens, who acts as a spokesman for the parents, insists, however, that they were told otherwise. ''The conclusion was that drinking Coca-Cola was responsible. That's what we were told,'' Mr. Schroyens said in an interview, flanked by his wife, Monique Uytterhoeven, and Wilfried Fleurackers, the father of another teenager involved in the incident. ''But they couldn't define exactly what the sickness is.''</p>
        <p>Late Thursday, Carl Bevernage, Coca-Cola's lawyer in Belgium, said the company agreed in principle to meet with the parents.</p>
        <p>All four teenagers are attending classes at their school in Bornem, but all said in interviews that the lingering effects of illness still trouble them. ''I used to play a game of soccer lasting 80 minutes,'' said Christoph Fleurackers, 14. ''Now I'm finished after half an hour.''</p>
        <p>Christine Boodts, 13, said all four suffered from pain in the knees. All of them -- Ms. Boodts, Mr. Fleuracker, Elke Schroyens and Ann de Man, 14 -- said they tired easily.</p>
        <p>Did she still drink Coke?</p>
        <p>''No,'' Ms. de Man replied.</p>
        <p>The company's European troubles began when the Belgian authorities enforced a 10-day ban on its products in June, forcing it to cease production after scores of Belgians blamed its sodas for a wave of such symptoms as vomiting, cramps, dizziness and headaches.</p>
        <p>Authorities in France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands also restricted Coca-Cola products, while Portugal, Italy, Spain and Germany conducted inquiries into Coke-related health scares.</p>
        <p>The precise nature of the June illnesses in Belgium remains a mystery. But at the time, M. Douglas Ivester, Coca-Cola's chief executive, acknowledged that there had been some levels of contamination, saying sulfur used in the production of carbon dioxide -- the source of bubbles in soda -- had not been properly cleansed, producing what he termed ''an off-taste and an off-smell.''</p>
        <p>And he said that wooden pallets used to transport Coke cans had been contaminated by a cleaning preservative, creosote, contrary to company rules forbidding its use.</p>
