        <p>In a sudden shift from merely calling for more research, the Bush administration sent a report to the U.N. listing many likely harms from global warming, including more heat waves and the disappearance of coastal marshes and Rocky Mountain meadows. But the report seemed to please no one: environmentalists were upset it called only for voluntary measures to cut emissions linked to the problem. And groups financed by coal, oil and car companies said President Bush erred by accepting that humans were the likely cause of most of the warming. In California, The Santa Rosa Press Democrat searched for the positive. Its editorial page said, ''If there is a 12-step program for global warming, last week President Bush took the first step: He acknowledged that the problem exists.''</p>
