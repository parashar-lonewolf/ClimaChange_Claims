        <p>A new series of whimsical public service announcements from the Environmental Protection Agency are lampooning the notion that cars can be made more energy efficient while the ads encourage conservation at home.</p>
        <p>A top E.P.A. official said the $1 million campaign was developed by a branch of the agency that specializes in energy-saving home appliances and was not intended to send a message about cars. But it comes at a time of heightened awareness of oil consumption and energy security, and despite the fact that many analysts say consumers can make their greatest single contribution to air quality when choosing a car.</p>
        <p>It also comes less than two months after an E.P.A. report emphasized how much more fuel efficient new cars and trucks were in the mid-1980's. The E.P.A.'s transportation division was not consulted for the new public service announcements, the E.P.A. official, Brian McLean, said, despite the fact that a car plays a starring role.</p>
        <p>In a 60-second version of the public service announcement, a woman named Suzanne says she is concerned about pollution and global warming, but laments the homegrown efforts of her husband, Mark, to cut emissions from the family car. Mark -- nerdy, pudgy, harried -- is shown rigging up their car, first with a sail, then a microwave contraption using huge satellite dishes, and finally a helium tank with a bulbous hose.</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. says the energy we use in our home can cause twice the greenhouse gases of a car,'' Suzanne says, adding that she has started buying energy-saving household products.</p>
        <p>Buying a cleaner car, or say, a smaller sport utility vehicle, does not appear to be a viable alternative for reducing emissions. The ad ends with a shot of Mark pushing the car down a hill and Suzanne saying, ''He still marches to the beat of a different drum.'' At one point, the car fills with helium, Mark starts talking like Mickey Mouse and two men in the backseat shake their heads and say ''Genius!''</p>
        <p>Indeed, as the E.P.A. says, energy use at home can cause twice the emissions of a single car. But most families have more than one car and emit roughly the same amount of global warming gases in their vehicles as in their homes, said David Friedman, senior policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental research and advocacy group.</p>
        <p>''With a car, you can cut your fuel use in half by using a hybrid,'' he said. ''You're not likely to cut your electricity use in half by using more efficient appliances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLean, the E.P.A.'s director of the Office of Atmospheric Programs, said, ''We were just trying to give people a benchmark.''</p>
        <p>''If you have two cars,'' he added, ''they would be equal.''</p>
        <p>The ads were made by the New York office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. They promote the 12-year-old Energy Star program, which allows manufacturers to earn a special label if their products meet stringent emissions goals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman and other environmentalists praise the program, which is part of Mr. McLean's office. But they wonder why new public service announcements set up saving energy at home in opposition to saving energy on the road.</p>
        <p>''The practical way to stop pollution is for the Bush administration to advance energy savings for homes without pushing the auto and oil industry's line that we can't improve pollution from cars,'' said Daniel Becker, director for the global-warming and energy program at the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLean said ''many people are not aware that the things they do in their homes could have an effect on emissions.''</p>
        <p>''Its intent was to say, 'Did you know this?''' he added.</p>
        <p>He said that the campaign was reviewed by various officials at E.P.A., but added: ''There wasn't a lot of consultation with transportation on it. They don't consult with us about how to promote homes.''</p>
        <p>In a shorter version of the ad, Mark's car sails down the road -- literally -- while a narrator says, ''there is a practical way to reduce air pollution.'' Viewers are then directed to a Web site that lists energy- efficient furnaces, computers and dishwashers -- in fact, just about everything but cars.</p>
        <p>The government does provide detailed information on emissions that come from the tailpipes of specific vehicle models, at the Web site www.fueleconomy.gov. For instance, most versions of the Ford Expedition emit more than 12 tons of global warming gases each year, in average driving conditions, according to the site. By contrast, the smaller Ford Escape S.U.V. emits just more than 9 tons a year.</p>
        <p>In late April, the latest version of the E.P.A.'s annual fuel economy trends report showed that it would not take innovative technology -- not to mention sails or microwaves -- to improve vehicle efficiency. In fact, new cars and trucks would be 20 percent more fuel efficient if they simply had not become so much heavier and faster since the mid-1980's, the report's executive summary stated.</p>
        <p>The ads underscore how far Washington has diverged from California and Canada on auto regulations. Last week, California released an initial draft of a plan to cut automotive emissions of global warming gases by nearly 30 percent, a strategy sharply different from that of the Bush administration, which has withdrawn from a global accord on curbing such emissions.</p>
        <p>California, which has long battled smog, has the unique authority to set its own air quality rules, and other states are permitted to follow its air regulations.</p>
        <p>Canada also appears poised for tougher auto regulations. This week, ahead of national elections next week, the Conservative Party joined a call by other parties for a 25 percent increase in Canada's fuel economy standards, which now mirror those of the United States.</p>
