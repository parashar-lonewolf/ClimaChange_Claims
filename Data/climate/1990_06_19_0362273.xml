        <p>LEAD: Christopher Patten, the British Cabinet Minister for the Environment, is at the very center of the storm over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's ''poll tax.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Patten, the British Cabinet Minister for the Environment, is at the very center of the storm over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's ''poll tax.''</p>
        <p>Local government finances, with other matters like how to deal with global atmospheric warming and the destruction of the ozone layer, come under the environment portfolio, and so part of his job now is to figure out how to make the new tax more palatable.</p>
        <p>He thinks the worst is over, but, he said only half jokingly in an interview, ''if I had to do it all over again, I'd make sure to volunteer somebody else for the job.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Patten has been in the post only a year, his political skill has added to his reputation, at 46, as one of his generation's most likely successors to Mrs. Thatcher as Conservative Party leader one day.</p>
        <p>Thatcher's Choice for the Job</p>
        <p>Another is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, 47, with whom Mr. Patten is now reportedly engaged in a lively battle over how much central Government money should be used to keep the unpopular new tax, officially called the community charge, from rising even higher next year than the current national average of $612 a person.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patten did not exactly volunteer; he was thrust into the job by Mrs. Thatcher in an extensive Cabinet shuffle a year ago, after having served three years as a Minister for Overseas Development in the Foreign Office.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister reportedly wanted a more ingratiating personality than the crusty Nicholas Ridley to preside over the difficult issues of privatization of Britain's 16 water companies and the introduction of the poll tax, which went into effect in Britain and Wales on April 1.</p>
        <p>Some cynics argued then that what she really wanted was a scapegoat, picking Mr. Patten because he had dissented from Government cuts in housing and unemployment benefits in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Wolsey's Fate Recalled</p>
        <p>Asked if he indeed had ever entertained the thought of trying to become Prime Minister after Mrs. Thatcher had left the scene, Mr. Patten jokingly demurred that her departure was ''unthinkable.''</p>
        <p>He thought a minute and then added: ''The truth is, if you're a professional golfer, you want to win the Masters. At the same time, there may be others on the circuit who can probably hit the ball farther down the fairway.''</p>
        <p>He did not feel his Roman Catholic religion was a handicap, he said, though he reflected that the last Catholic with the power of a present-day British Prime Minister had been Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor, who was educated like Mr. Patten at Oxford. ''And look what happened to him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Wolsey died in 1530 while on his way to face trial for treason.</p>
        <p>The community charge could have been just as fatal. Replacing a tax on the assessed rental value of property that had been paid by only a minority of taxpayers, the new charge is paid by everyone over 18 at rates set by local government authorities. It finances about a third of the cost of providing local services like education and trash collection, with the rest coming from business taxes and central Government allocations.</p>
        <p>'A Very Radical Change'</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Thatcher was under fire this spring for imposing the new system, local authorities, many controlled by the opposition Labor Party, increased expenditures by an average of 14 to 15 percent this year, Mr. Patten said. The Prime Minister appears to be confident that voters who think they are paying too much will eventually take out their ire on the local authorities who set the rates, instead of the Government, but others are not so sure.</p>
        <p>''It's been a very radical change, and a change of excessively heroic proportions, some would argue,'' Mr. Patten acknowledged, but he said the Government was now debating various proposals to ''bed it down'' and people would soon get used to paying it.</p>
        <p>''The difficulty is the level,'' he said, though the average rate of $612 is partly rebated for 15.5 million low-income taxpayers. A court in London ruled last week that he acted lawfully in April when he imposed a ceiling on the community charges set by 21 local authorities. One of the questions Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet is now debating is whether Mr. Patten should impose spending limits on more municipal councils next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patten is also in charge of preparing a Government white paper, or outline of policy, on environmental issues, which is expected to play a major role in the next general election campaign a year or two from now. He will also preside on June 27-29 over an international conference in London on protecting the ozone layer in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>U.S. Now Backs Fund</p>
        <p>Both he and Mrs. Thatcher pressed the White House to change its mind and agree to set up a fund to help developing countries use substitutes for the industrial chemicals that are said to be destroying the ozone. American refusal, Mr. Patten said, would have scuttled the conference. The Bush Administration agreed to support the measure last Friday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher has also broken ranks with the White House on the urgency of doing something to reduce global industrial emissions of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''We were wholly persuaded,'' Mr. Patten said, ''that the likelihood is that man-made emissions are responsible for global warming, with consequential climate change. We accept that a lot more research has to be done before one can be certain, but the difference between likelihood and certainty is not in our judgment a reason to do nothing.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher announced on May 25 that Britain would stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2005, but did not say how. Nuclear power, the most obvious substitute for Britain's coal-fired generating plants, is unpopular here.</p>
        <p>''The obvious ingredients are greater energy efficiency, greater car efficiency, and changing the mixture of fuels you use to generate electricity, with natural gas obviously making a contribution,'' Mr. Patten said. ''Personally, I think that the more we discuss the implications internationally, the more we'll find ourselves debating the nuclear component.''</p>
