        <p>A dissident shareholder of the El Paso Corporation kicked off what is expected to be an especially rancorous corporate proxy season yesterday by saying he hoped to oust the company's entire board.</p>
        <p>The shareholder, Selim K. Zilkha, a wealthy entrepreneur whose father was an Iraqi banker, sent a letter to his former fellow directors of El Paso saying that he would seek support for replacing them with a slate of nine new directors, including himself. El Paso, a struggling pipeline operator whose chief executive said last week that he would resign, said yesterday that Mr. Zilkha's proposal lacked substance and asked shareholders to reject it.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, El Paso, based in Houston, laid out a plan to sell assets, cut its dividend and pay down its debt. But its stock has dropped 50 percent since then and its debt rating has been reduced so that its bonds are at junk level.</p>
        <p>William A. Wise, the chairman and chief executive, said last week that he would step down as chief executive as soon as a successor was chosen and would leave the company by the end of the year. Some investors said they thought Mr. Wise, who led El Paso's ill-fated expansion into energy trading, had too much invested in the company to pare it down properly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zilkha, who is El Paso's largest individual stockholder but owns less than 2 percent of its stock, or about 9 million shares, said in his letter that Mr. Wise's planned departure was ''woefully inadequate to address the many problems that plague El Paso.'' He said he had the support of Oscar S. Wyatt, another big shareholder who has sued the company on behalf of other investors.</p>
        <p>''I can no longer watch passively as the value of the company continues to decline,'' Mr. Zilkha said in the letter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zilkha, 75, was not available to comment, according to Craig Van de Mark, general counsel of Zilkha Renewable Energy, a Houston-based company owned by Mr. Zilkha and his family.</p>
        <p>El Paso's shares rose yesterday after Mr. Zilkha announced his proposal, but fell back to end the day down 14 cents, to $4.05. The stock is down nearly 90 percent from its high of $46.89 on March 21, 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wise was not available to comment, said Tom Daly, a spokesman in New York for El Paso.</p>
        <p>In an open letter to its shareholders, El Paso said that it ''believes that Mr. Zilkha's decision to take such action at this time is highly disruptive for the company.'' The company also said that it had added one outside director and was trying to recruit others. It said that it had invited Mr. Zilkha, who has been agitating for change for several weeks, to submit candidates for the board.</p>
        <p>''Despite the company's efforts to reach out to Mr. Zilkha, he has rejected its proposals and chosen to launch this counterproductive and disruptive proxy campaign,'' El Paso's letter said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zilkha named eight other men, including several former executives of energy companies, to his proposed slate of directors.</p>
        <p>''They have proposed a very deep bench,'' said John Olson, chief investment officer at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. ''The eight directors have as strong a background in the energy business as any board in America. It's that good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Olson, who owns El Paso shares and rates the stock a hold, said he thought that Mr. Zilkha would file a formal proxy later this week and would nominate a chief executive to replace Mr. Wise soon. He said he expected the dissidents to spell out their ideas for how the company should be run over the next several weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zilkha was a director of El Paso from November 1999 to February 2001 and an advisory director until June 2002.</p>
        <p>With his relatively small stake in the company, Mr. Zilkha would need to persuade some large shareholders to vote with him at the annual meeting, which an El Paso spokesman said had not been scheduled. Several institutions own more than 2 percent of the stock, including a pair of mutual fund companies that own a combined 20 percent after heavy buying last year.</p>
        <p>Waging a battle for control of a public company is an unusual tactic for Mr. Zilkha, whose father, Khedoury, ran a bank in Baghdad at the start of the 20th century. After his father died in 1956, Selim Zilkha started a London-based chain of maternity-goods stores that he later sold.</p>
        <p>His next venture was the 1983 purchase of a 44 percent stake in Towner Petroleum. A year later, he bought the rest and renamed it Zilkha Energy Company.</p>
        <p>He and his son, Michael, owned that Houston-based company, which used computers to find oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico, until 1997. They sold it to Sonat for more than $1 billion. El Paso later bought Sonat in a transaction that left Mr. Zilkha, who now lives in Los Angeles, as the largest individual owner of El Paso and, possibly, its most troublesome shareholder.</p>
