        <p>LEAD:  Leslie Caron as Chanel</p>
        <p>Leslie Caron as Chanel</p>
        <p>Tonight and tomorrow night from 8 to 10 o'clock, Channel 9 will present ''The Man Who Lived at the Ritz,'' a mini-series based on a novel by A. E. Hotchner about a young American artist living at that Paris hotel during the Nazi occupation of France. Leslie Caron appears as the couturier Coco Chanel, a character the actress relished portraying.</p>
        <p>''Her trajectory throughout life was stupendous,'' Miss Caron said in an interview from Paris. ''She was less than a farmer's daughter; her father sold socks and aprons in fairs. And she was such an innovator. Her lovers were among the most famous men in the world.''</p>
        <p>There were two reasons in particular that she wanted the role, Miss Caron said: ''First, I was intrigued by the legend, you know. Then there was the fact that I was offered the chance to play tennis with Goring. That was an outrageous idea, and it made me want to play the part.''  'Burning Questions'</p>
        <p>ABC News will present four special broadcasts in December as part of the ''Burning Questions'' series begun in September by the executive producer, Av Westin. The manner in which the Pentagon does business with military contractors and consultants comes under scrutiny in Thursday's program, for which Tom Jarriel will be the anchor. On Dec. 15, Sander Vanocur will examine America's loss of prestige as a maker of quality goods. On Dec. 22, Paula Zahn will assess what American children are eating and how that diet will affect their growth. Finally, on the 29th, Forrest Sawyer will be the anchor on a program about the safety of the American work place. ''The series is designed to sound an alarm,'' said an ABC spokeswoman, Maurie Perl. Each program will run from 10 to 11 P.M.  'Coming of Age' on Hold</p>
        <p>CBS has placed its critically acclaimed Monday night series, ''Coming of Age'' ''on hiatus''; generally, that's networkese for sitcom graveyard. Apparently, the strong ensemble cast (Paul Dooley, Phyllis Newman, Alan Young, Glynis Johns and Kevin Pollak) wasn't enough to pull viewers away from the competition. But for ''Coming of Age'' there may be some solace in the notion that it's being replaced by ''Kate and Allie,'' a series that was itself put on hold last season. ''Kate and Allie'' officially returns to the 8:30 P.M. time slot on Monday, Dec. 12. The night before, CBS will run special editions of ''Kate and Allie'' and its new series, ''Murphy Brown,'' in the 8 to 9 P.M. time period generally presided over by the popular ''Murder, She Wrote.''  'Today' Documentary</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday on the ''Today'' show on NBC (Channel 4, 7 to 9 A.M.), Viscount Charles Althorp will report on Hong Kong and New Zealand. The Viscount, by the way, is the brother of the Princess of Wales.</p>
        <p>Speaking of New Zealand, that's where William F. Baker, the president of WNET in New York City, will be later this week, as he and his brother, Lawrence, set out on a three-week expedition to Antarctica. There, the Baker brothers (Lawrence is a Cleveland-based cameraman and producer for NBC) will film a documentary about scientific issues and about such environmental problems as the deterioration of the ozone layer. Some of the record of the journey will be broadcast on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour. The complete documentary will be offered to the Public Broadcasting Service next year.</p>
