        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman's analysis of the effect of oil prices on Middle Eastern politics (''War on Daddy's Dime,'' column, Aug. 18) is right on the money. Iranian taxpayers are just suckers to subsidize their Middle Eastern client states and political proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman's analysis of the effect of oil prices on Middle Eastern politics (''War on Daddy's Dime,'' column, Aug. 18) is right on the money. Iranian taxpayers are just suckers to subsidize their Middle Eastern client states and political proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>This brings up the sore point for the taxpayer in the United States, which has for many years now been running trade and fiscal deficits with the rest of the world, but continues to operate as if it were a center of world financial and economic resources.</p>
        <p>How much more of a sucker does it make us, to subsidize the government of Iraq, with blood and treasure we can ill afford, in order to protect the Saudis from a 16-year-old attack by Saddam Hussein on Kuwait, at our expense?</p>
        <p>Ben Burrows  Elkins Park, Pa., Aug. 18, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman is right to be obsessed with the price of oil. We should all be so obsessed.</p>
        <p>Reducing our dependency on and subsequent cost of this product is a triple win: For foreign policy wonks, it lessens the influence and importance to us of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria, all areas that are either unstable, or hostile to America.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists pick up a chit in the global warming game, while the average consumer need not take out a bank loan to fill up his or her tank.</p>
        <p>If this country can build an atomic bomb from scratch in less than four years, and put a man on the moon in less than 10, then surely a national effort to Mr. Friedman's end is not an impossible task.</p>
        <p>Where, one wonders, is the will of the people to demand that this get done?</p>
        <p>Jack Kay  Framingham, Mass., Aug. 18, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman writes correctly that our president says we're ''addicted to oil'' but won't do anything about it.</p>
        <p>President Bush once said, ''You're either with us or against us in the fight against terror.''</p>
        <p>Should we now be telling him, ''If you don't to do something about the high oil prices, then you are against us in the fight against terror''?</p>
        <p>Prakash Navare  Succasunna, N.J., Aug. 18, 2006</p>
