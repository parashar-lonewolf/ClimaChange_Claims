        <p>If the Republican convention was an infomercial, the Democratic convention is a minefield.</p>
        <p>With friends like Bill and Hillary hijacking the spotlight (and trailing the noxious memories of Monica behind them), and with anarchists and other protesters threatening to turn parts of the city upside down, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will be lucky to escape L.A. with any momentum at all.</p>
        <p>For a while last week, Mr. Gore looked like a genuine leader. The bold choice of Joe Lieberman as his running mate was deftly handled and widely hailed. But then the Clintons took over. On Thursday we were treated to the spectacle of the president appearing before thousands of evangelical ministers in a Chicago suburb, where he very publicly revisited -- in the name of contrition -- the incredible stain he put on the nation's highest office.</p>
        <p>By week's end the first couple had arrived in Los Angeles, where they immediately began hobnobbing with the stars and fund-raising for themselves. It was another blatant display of the Clintons' well-known selfishness, and there was little the vice president could do but try and put the best face on it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had other problems, one of them being the fallout from the plan by Representative Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat, to hold a fund-raiser at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion. Ms. Sanchez was one of the few people in the entire country who failed to recognize that anything even remotely connected with playboys and naked ladies is a no-no for the duration of this campaign. Under tremendous pressure, she finally backed off.</p>
        <p>While these internal conflicts were being played out, the forces intent on disrupting the convention -- protesters, demonstrators, anarchists and assorted zanies -- were steadily mobilizing. One police official said that on a scale of 1 to 10, the likelihood that violence would erupt was 10.</p>
        <p>Some demonstrators said they hoped to thwart legal proceedings by refusing to wear clothes if they were arrested. The Los Angeles Times quoted a judge as saying, ''We'll have naked court, if necessary.''</p>
        <p>None of this does Al Gore need. What he needs is a dignified convention, where he and Senator Lieberman can attempt to make the case that their leadership and their policies -- not Bill Clinton's and not the Republicans' -- are the best course for the U.S. to follow.</p>
        <p>Gore-Lieberman is not a charismatic ticket. They either win on substance or not at all. But it's awfully hard to get your message heard amid the din of Clinton narcissism, dumb distractions and demonstrations in the street.</p>
        <p>Forty years ago John Kennedy was nominated by the Democrats in Los Angeles. In his acceptance speech he said that America stood ''on the edge of a New Frontier.''</p>
        <p>''Beyond that frontier,'' he said, ''are the uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.''</p>
        <p>In these very early days of the 21st century, the United States enjoys unrivaled power and prosperity. But the challenges facing the nation fall into categories remarkably similar to those identified by Kennedy.</p>
        <p>This is the week for Al Gore to make his case, to argue convincingly that government is not the enemy of the people, and not a servant of the rich, but rather, as Abraham Lincoln said, a collective effort ''to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all in their separate and individual capacities.''</p>
        <p>Conventions are traditionally exercises in zaniness and egomania. But they are also serious forums for the expression of important ideas.</p>
        <p>Nearly one in five American children are poor, and many working families, despite the extraordinary economy, are having trouble paying bills and putting food on the table. What do Gore and Lieberman have to say about trying to bring them into the mainstream? What do they have to say about the nation's school system, and health care, and global warming, and gun control and abortion and the Supreme Court?</p>
        <p>This is the week to find out. Bill Clinton is not running this year, and he could help his party and his country by adopting a lower profile. This election should not be about a stain on a blue dress. It's time to move on.</p>
