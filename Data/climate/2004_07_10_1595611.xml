        <p>Correction story; June 27 article about study predicting long-term climate changes in New York region referred imprecisely to finding that sharpest increases in heat-related deaths would occur in most developed areas</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on June 27 about a study predicting long-term climate changes in the New York region referred imprecisely to a finding that the sharpest increases in heat-related deaths would occur in the most developed areas. While Staten Island was included in the study, it was not among the boroughs where the study said the increases would be steepest. The article also misstated the impact of development on temperatures. Uncontrolled development could cause them to increase over the next 50 years by two to three degrees Celsius, not 2 to 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The article misattributed predictions about a rise in sea levels due to climate change. They were part of the 2001 Metro East Coast Report, not the climate study.</p>
