        <p>With state regulators poised to collect nearly $1 billion from utility customers for energy conservation measures over the next seven years, a recent audit concluded that the plan was flawed and warned that New Jersey might be in danger of wasting much of the money.</p>
        <p>''You should have a long-term plan to measure these things, and they don't,'' said David Llewellyn Davies, chief executive of Davies Associates, the Maryland-based auditor that conducted the study for the state Board of Public Utilities. ''They are sort of winging it at the moment, and they are trying to back into a long-range plan.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, when regulators and the state's power utilities unveiled the program last year, auditors said, they began spending money without clearly identifying the desired results.</p>
        <p>By year's end, the state expects to have spent more than $200 million on programs ranging from rebates for energy-efficient equipment to training for building contractors. Yet in the report, completed in April, auditors recommended that the state more clearly define the goals for each of its energy efficiency programs and scale back or eliminate those not expected to produce long-term results.</p>
        <p>Jeanne M. Fox, president of the Board of Public Utilities, said her staff had already begun to work on long-term plans. ''It is a priority for all of us to get a handle on this,'' said Ms. Fox, who was recently appointed to the board. ''I would like to have something in place by early fall.''</p>
        <p>State legislators created the energy conservation fund when they passed a 1999 measure deregulating the state's electricity market. The clause establishing the conservation fund was one of the most hard-fought sections of the law, with various groups from utilities to environmentalists clashing over how the money should be spent. The arguments tied up the money until last year, when the state reached a compromise solution.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, every ratepayer pays a small fee, called a societal benefits charge, in addition to the bill for the power itself -- some of which goes to the energy conservation fund. Under the deal struck last year, 75 percent of the energy conservation fund will be used to promote more efficient use of power, and 25 percent will support renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.</p>
        <p>To get the fund up and running quickly, the state regulators turned to the utilities, which had been administering their own, smaller funds for decades. The utilities, in the past limited to handing out high-efficiency light bulbs or pamphlets on home insulation, were asked to operate more ambitious programs.</p>
        <p>But from the beginning, opponents criticized the decision to rely on the utilities to manage the funds.</p>
        <p>''It is the fox managing the henhouse,'' said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. ''The people who have the most to gain by not having energy efficiency programs are in charge of it.''</p>
        <p>The auditors found that the utilities did a good job establishing the programs and ensuring efficiency, but that many of them were modified versions of the utilities' original conservation efforts. Consequently, auditors questioned whether they would achieve the results the board wanted.</p>
        <p>Rather, the auditors said that the programs should be aimed at the eventual transformation of the state's energy market so that customers would use less energy because it made economic sense rather than because of state subsidies. ''A lot of the programs are not meeting the objectives,'' Mr. Davies said. ''The utilities did a good job, but now you have to get in there and direct them.''</p>
        <p>The utilities disagreed. One disputed program, for example, trains heating contractors to install energy-efficient equipment to minimize the amount of power used for central air-conditioning. But the auditors criticized the state plan because there were no benchmarks to measure electricity savings or to determine whether the training affected the market for air-conditioning equipment.</p>
        <p>Still, Chris Neme, a consultant working on the program, said the training had already shown results.</p>
        <p>''The market share for energy-efficient equipment in New Jersey is 30 percent; nationally the average is 4 percent,'' Mr. Neme said. ''New Jersey is way ahead of the national average, largely because of this program.''</p>
        <p>Frederick A. Lynk, a marketing manager for PSE&amp;G, argued that Mr. Davies's report underestimated the amount of planning that went into the programs. ''We had a very short time to get to market with these programs,'' Mr. Lynk said. ''We did a lot of baseline market research about where the markets were, and that market research was an underpinning for the design of these programs.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Davies said the auditors did not disagree that many of the individual programs worked well, he noted that the state needed to develop an overall plan to determine which ones should be emphasized.</p>
        <p>''If you are going to transform a market, you need a long-term strategy,'' he said. ''And they don't have it, and that is the critical problem.''</p>
        <p>While the auditors felt the utilities could manage the energy efficiency programs -- with greater involvement by the state Board of Public Utilities -- they said the supervision of renewable energy funds should go to an independent group.</p>
        <p>''This is the exploitation of new technologies, and utilities are not known for doing that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While supporters of the current plan say it has been successful in promoting alternative energies like fuel cells, critics contend that it has not done enough to encourage the use of renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>''The fund has left solar businesses dead in the water,'' said Lyle K. Rawlings of Advanced Solar Products.</p>
        <p>The auditors concluded that the money spent under the current program was unlikely to foster a viable renewable energy industry, and that the current system had spent too much on one technology -- natural-gas-fired fuel cells -- and not enough encourage homeowners to install renewable energy devices.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fox said the Board of Public Utilities would examine the plan for renewable energy sources as well as the energy efficiency programs, but that it was too early to call for any changes.</p>
        <p>''We are going to look at what structures will work,'' she said.</p>
