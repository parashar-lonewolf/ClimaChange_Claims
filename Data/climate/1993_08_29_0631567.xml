        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Messrs. Morris and Lewis state that "the funny thing" is that when a broad-based energy tax was proposed in the budget discussions, it was cited as having only a deficit-reduction benefit. They may have been napping during the long debates, but it was proposed as having three benefits: reduction of the budget deficit, of the foreign trade deficit and of carbon dioxide emissions. And it still lost.</p>
        <p>Morris/Lewis do not even make their case for efficiency as its rationale. Their theme is simply that if any tax causes the price of a commodity to rise, less of it will be used, and that by definition means a higher efficiency. But the market is already determining how much less is efficient. It is not true that if the price of energy rises by 6 percent, users who use 6 percent less are held even. They are still paying the same energy bill, 6 percent more per unit for 6 percent less consumption.</p>
        <p>A leap is then made to the proposition that "renewable" energy sources -- usually defined as energy derived from wind, waves, falling water or as direct conversion from solar rays -- do not deserve a tax. But the investments needed for damming rivers or covering acres of land with windmills are probably more costly and less environmentally acceptable than the authors believe.</p>
        <p>Indeed, all energy sources may incur hidden costs that someone may wish to recover via taxes, but artificially adding costs in the name of efficiency is not, well, efficient. ROBERT C. BAKER Darien, Conn.</p>
