        <p>William Safire Op-Ed column says most Democratic Party leaders and liberal media voices have distanced themselves from Israel in midst of its defense against Yasir Arafat's war; says Al Gore, titular leader of party, did not even mention Israel in recent speech in Florida; says liberal pundits have transmogrified Arab aggressor into victim; notes that eight out of ten American voters who are Jewish vote for candidates of Democratic Party that now only tepidly supports government overwhelmingly chosen by Israelis; says maybe these voters should think about voting Republican in future (M)</p>

        <p>Most of the leaders of the Democratic Party and its liberal media voices distanced themselves from Israel in the midst of its defense against Arafat's war. Their echo-chambered furor caused George W. Bush to waver temporarily, but an outcry of moral dismay from Republicans stiffened his administration's spine.</p>
        <p>Too partisan a reading? Consider: As the Palestinian murder of Jewish civilians exploded, Democrats blamed Bush for having been ''disengaged.'' This charge of ''noninvolvement'' had one plain meaning: Bush should have continued the failed policy of Bill Clinton, pressuring Israel's newly elected leader to offer again the dangerous concessions of Camp David and Taba.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' line was laid down by Clinton himself. He told Reuters on April 10 that U.S. ''involvement'' was indispensable, that he was ''thrilled'' by the dispatch of Colin Powell to negotiate. He took the Palestinian side that ''there cannot be a cease-fire without a withdrawal'' and equated Arafat and Ariel Sharon as ''bull-headed.''</p>
        <p>Democrat Tom Daschle, Senate majority leader, then blocked a bipartisan resolution by Senators Mitch McConnell and Dianne Feinstein to designate the P.L.O. as a terrorist group. ''Counterproductive,'' said Daschle, preferring to send his Democratic whip, Harry Reid, to repeat the mantra that Bush ''should have been involved in this much earlier.''</p>
        <p>Democrat Joe Biden then refused to allow Bibi Netanyahu to appear before Senate Foreign Relations. The former prime minister's purpose was to call attention to Sharon's acceptance of -- and Arafat's rejection of -- the U.S. proposal for a cease-fire that would have saved hundreds of civilian lives.</p>
        <p>''Totally inappropriate,'' decreed Biden, forcing his fellow Democrat Joe Lieberman and Republican Jon Kyl (denounced as a ''sicko'' by the chief U.S. Arab lobbyist) to provide a less prestigious forum to get Israel's message across.</p>
        <p>Lieberman, as he famously did in another moral matter a few years ago, went against the Democratic leadership. He said Bush's call to stop the counterattack ''muddled our moral clarity'' in the war against terror.</p>
        <p>This emboldened other presidential candidates, Senator John Kerry and Representative Richard Gephardt, to speak out against the liberals' crusade to force Israel to abort its clean-out of terrorist nests. New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, had been blasting the hypocrisy of blaming Sharon for responding as Bush did to terrorist outrage, while the junior senator's office ritually co-signed a note and put out a release.</p>
        <p>But not Al Gore, titular leader of the Democratic Party. Gore re-entered the political fray in Florida with a harangue about lockboxes and global warming -- and not a word about Topic A. Gee, Al used to be an outspoken supporter of Israel.</p>
        <p>In refusing to take a stand, Gore avoided the ridicule of liberal pundits. From Mary McGrory in The Washington Post to Mark Shields on CNN, a falafel curtain has descended across our continent, transmogrifying the Arab aggressor into the victim. ABC-Disney leads that parade, as the BBC vies with Al Jazeera to inflame the European street. Pro-Palestinian journalists gain cover from Israel's dovish Haaretz, but such dissent is a democracy's strength; if a Ramallah paper criticized Arafat, the editor's body would be dragged through the streets as a ''collaborator.''</p>
        <p>Contrariwise, what voices were first to blow the whistle on Bush's misbegotten need to placate the shaky regimes in Egypt and Jordan? Conservative commentators, of course. The editorials of The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times; the columns of Charles Krauthammer, George Will, John Leo, Bill Kristol, Michael Kelly and other right thinkers in what the left still calls ''the vast conspiracy'' -- all were well ahead of late-arriving Lieberman and his tiny band of principled Democrats.</p>
        <p>We are accompanied in support of embattled Israel, as Tish Durkin notes in the current National Journal, by the much-maligned Christian right, to which Menachem Begin wisely reached out. These voters are an active part of the Republican base.</p>
        <p>Here is the political paradox in all this: Eight out of ten American voters who are Jewish have been voting for candidates of a Democratic Party that now only tepidly supports the government overwhelmingly chosen by Israelis. Though foreign policy is not always decisive, perhaps that 80 percent should think again.</p>
