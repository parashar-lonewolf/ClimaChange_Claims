        <p>LEAD: IT'S Saturday afternoon. You've just finished all the little jobs you've had to do around the house, and now you're relaxing in a comfortable chair in the backyard. This is why you moved to the suburbs, isn't it? The peace, the quiet, the good smells. Ah, it's wonderful.</p>
        <p>IT'S Saturday afternoon. You've just finished all the little jobs you've had to do around the house, and now you're relaxing in a comfortable chair in the backyard. This is why you moved to the suburbs, isn't it? The peace, the quiet, the good smells. Ah, it's wonderful.</p>
        <p>Then it begins. A neighbor next door starts his gas lawn mower. The noise isn't overwhelming, but it gets to be annoying as it drones on. It's a 10-horsepower monster that propels itself as it cuts a three-foot swath through the lawn. It's also a model that lets you ride it as it cuts the grass. And as if the noise isn't enough, the fumes from the mower's exhaust drift into your yard.</p>
        <p>This goes on for a half-hour, and then you hear the droning noise wind down to a purr. Ah, it's over, you think. And it is, except that now it's time for the neighbor to edge his lawn. He won't get down on his hands and knees and do this job with clippers. No, he's going to use his gas-powered, 1.5-horsepower lawn edger, another source of noise and smells. This process takes 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>It's quiet again, and your mind returns to the days when your area was a quiet little hamlet, especially in summer. Other than the sounds of birds and insects, all that you'd hear would be the quiet rumble of hand-reel lawn mowers and the sound of rakes quietly scratching at clippings on the lawn. You're jarred from your reverie by a new noise: your neighbor's going to clean his sidewalk and other walkways around his house. He's using gardening's latest high-tech helper, the jet air blower. This has its own peculiar sound, a whining form of variable pitch, as it pushes grass clippings, dead leaves and everything else in its path. It's a space-age broom that uses blasts of air and accompanying din to save the homeowner the expense of a corn broom and the exertion of some energy.</p>
        <p>It's finally over, you think. He's cut the grass, edged it and picked up the clippings. Time to relax. But wait! Suddenly there's another sound of steel meshing against steel, grinding twigs and branches into sawdust. It's the power garden shredder, a device that fears no form of garden debris. It eats, swallows and spits out branches, twigs and leaves as it shreds, chips and mulches, with the noise of five horsepower and the noxious smell of a gasoline engine.</p>
        <p>This process takes 10 minutes or so, but finally it's over. The noise has ended, and the gasoline exhaust has drifted off into the ozone layer. You count yourself lucky. He didn't cut his hedges with his electric hedge trimmer, nor did he decide to prune some branches with his chain saw. Had he done so, you might have wound up in the house with your head jammed under several pillows.</p>
        <p>As quiet descends on the neighborhood, you think back to when taking care of your lawn meant pleasant, meaningful physical activity and when lawn mowers were powered by people, not gas or electric. You also think back to when cutting the lawn and related duties produced muted sounds that blended into the foliage instead of intruding on the quiet of scores of nearby homes. When a broom was an important part of the cleanup process, when arms, back and legs all played an important role in cutting the grass, not to say contributing to one's physical fitness.</p>
        <p>You're thinking of this as you see your neighbor leaving with his car keys, dressed in his jogging suit. He's been complaining to you lately about his lack of physical activity, noting that ''we don't get enough physical exercise - any of us.'' He's on his way to the spa, where he'll work out on the exercise machines, lift weights, swim a lap or two, and all that good stuff. True to form, he drives a high-performance sports car, a noisy one that grinds its gears as it pulls away from the curb, belching smoke.</p>
        <p>He's gone, and peace descends on the neighborhood. You stretch out on your lounge, and all that you hear is the sound of birds and the rustle of leaves as the wind weaves its way through the trees. In a moment, you're asleep.</p>
