        <p>The Bush Administation, defending itself against rising criticism at the Earth Summit, suggested today that Japan, Germany and other countries opposing United States policies were distorting Washington's environmental positions for political and diplomatic gain.</p>
        <p>The Administration's response was made at a White House briefing called to describe President Bush's positions before his departure for Rio de Janeiro later this week. The White House imposed ground rules under which reporters were not permitted to identify the briefing officer.</p>
        <p>Germany and Japan have both broken with the United States and endorsed strong environmental measures, including a treaty to protect plants and animals and an accelerated and fixed timetable for the curbing of carbon dioxide emissions, which are believed to cause global warming.</p>
        <p>The Administration official said the two countries had opposed United States positions as a "politically correct" means of displaying their status as emerging world powers.</p>
        <p>He also suggested that some nations, which he did not name, were backing stricter environmental measures largely because they do not intend to abide by treaties to carry out those measures. He also maintained that a representative from a major European nation had told the Administration that European countries do not take Earth Summit treaties as seriously as agreements on security matters.</p>
        <p>The statements reflected attempts by Mr. Bush's top aides to counter a cascade of criticism of the Administration's environmental policies.</p>
        <p>The bad publicity is widely seen to have all but buried Administration efforts over the last week to portray Mr. Bush as an environmentally friendly leader who has dramatically increased spending on forests and wildlife refuges and sponsored programs to reduce air pollution and repair the Earth's ozone layer.</p>
