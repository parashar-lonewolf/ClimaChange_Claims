        <p>To Gracelyn Johnson, Camden's best learning environment is its environment. Ms. Johnson, a science teacher at Camden High School, is this year's recipient of the Cartledge Award for Excellence in Environmental Education, presented in Washington earlier this month by the nonprofit Conservation Fund and by Union Camp Corporation of Wayne, the paper products manufacturer.</p>
        <p>In a program she began three years ago, 40 Camden seniors are studying the relationship of the Cooper River to the city's economic growth. They gauge water quality, investigate sources of pollution and hear from environmental professionals. Twenty students from the more affluent, suburban Cherry Hill High School West also participate. ''One Cherry Hill student said she could not take part because there would be drive-by shootings,'' said Stanley Krantz, a teacher in Cherry Hill.</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson talked about the river as she strolled along its banks.</p>
        <p>Q. How is the river related to the city?</p>
        <p>A. Historically, the river was very important to farmers and manufacturers upstream. Back in the early part of the century, they wanted to dredge the river and they wanted to get Federal funds for that. And the Federal funds were only available for rivers. It was called Cooper Creek, so they changed the name to Cooper River and then they were eligible for the funds.</p>
        <p>Historically, it's been important commercially. In more recent times, no, it's not. It is important in a sense that it's the watershed, and if we don't protect the watershed we have all kinds of problems with flooding and recharging our aquifer. And it's a big recreational thing now. All through Camden County there are parks all along it. There's a yacht club, they scull along the river, you have picnicking and baseball fields.</p>
        <p>Q. Is pollution still dumped into the river?</p>
        <p>A. Not any more. There were something like 40 sewage plants, and all these little towns and communities were dumping their primary treated sewage, which is just barely treated, into the river. So the river was nasty. But since the early 70's, when the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority came on line, the river is almost swimmable -- not quite, but almost swimmable. The main pollution you see now is runoff from the oil from cars. Anything in the streets ends up in the river. If they salt streets in the winter, that ends up in the river. Fertilizers that people put on their lawns end up in the river.</p>
        <p>Q. What your program like?</p>
        <p>A. It's called an integrated environmental study. Integrated in the sense that you're not just using science to teach something. You're using science, math, English, writing, social studies, history. And you can use any environmental topic.</p>
        <p>Talking about global warming and endangered species is interesting, but in order to grab their interest and keep students' interest, finding a local issue was real important. And that's what we do in this program; we find something that's in their neighborhood, in their backyard.</p>
        <p>Q. Does poverty hurt the environment?</p>
        <p>A. In areas where people are scratching for a living and trying to keep their families fed, protecting the environment is not high on their list. But in this class, we're trying to show students that you don't have to be living in Cherry Hill or Haddonfield or some affluent area to care about your environment.</p>
        <p>Q. Do the negative stereotypes about Camden bother you?</p>
        <p>A. This happens to me all the time: people say, ''Where do you work?'' And I say Camden High. And they go, ''You work there? Aren't you afraid? Do you feel safe?'' I mean, I had two children and worked right up to the end of my pregnancy. Would I go to work pregnant if I was afraid?</p>
