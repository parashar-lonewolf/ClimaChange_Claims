        <p>Clinton Policy on Tibet A Sore Point With China  The Clinton Administration's pledge to appoint a ''special coordinator'' to oversee American policy toward Tibet has brought protests from China before President Jiang Zemin's state visit, which begins Sunday.</p>

        <p>Retirement Called Political  Gordon C. Oehler, the director of the C.I.A.'s Nonproliferation Center, which monitors nuclear weapons and missile development around the world, said he would take early retirement. He has been criticized by the Clinton Administration for his secret briefings to Congress on Russian and Chinese aid to Iran. While Mr. Oehler said he was leaving voluntarily, a Republican Congressman contended the retirement was forced and demanded an investigation.</p>

        <p>Nuclear Test Report Challenged  Civilian scientists are strongly criticizing the Federal Government for saying that a seismic event on a remote island in the Arctic Ocean two months ago might have been a Russian underground nuclear blast. They say that foes of the nuclear test ban treaty are distorting the truth in hopes of stopping the treaty's ratification in the Senate. Russia has outlawed nuclear tests and contends the tremor was natural in origin.</p>

        <p>Partial Repairs to Mir Station  Two Russian astronauts on the Mir space station made an ''internal spacewalk'' in the Spektr module that was punctured in a collision with a cargo ship in June. They found equipment bags and a refrigerator door floating around and secured them to the wall with tape. But they were unable to connect one of six new cables to solar panels.</p>

        <p>Writer Irks German Officials  The writer Gunter Grass, presenting the German book publishing industry's Peace Prize to the Turkish author Yasar Kemal, said Germany's policies toward immigration reflected ''closet racism.'' His remarks touched a raw nerve and irritated senior Government officials.</p>

        <p>Vote Hurts Yugoslav Leader  President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia lost key support when Milo Djukanovic was elected President of Montenegro. Mr. Djukanovic has denounced Mr. Milosevic's authoritarian rule. Montenegro and Serbia share the upper house of the federal Parliament, which has the power to choose or dismiss the Yugoslav President.</p>

        <p>British Labor Setback on Euro  Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Labor Government appeared to have suffered their first major setback over contradictory statements about the timing of Britain's acceding to European monetary union. Finance Minister Gordon Brown, who had recently been reported to favor joining early, said it would not be possible before the year 2002. That prompted financial markets to plummet and tarnished the credibility of the ''New Labor'' Government.</p>

        <p>Mental Health Benefits May Be Watered Down  New rules being drafted by the Clinton Administration would allow many employers to exempt themselves from a landmark law intended to expand health insurance benefits for millions of Americans with mental illnesses, Federal officials and mental health advocates said.</p>

        <p>Abortion Debate Shifts  Many Democrats fear that Republicans have gained the upper hand in the abortion debate by focusing it on the form of late-term abortion that its opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.''</p>

        <p>Electricity From Gasoline  The Energy Department and an engineering firm plan to announce today that they have produced electricity from gasoline through a new method that yields twice as much useful energy per gallon as a car engine does, and with 10 percent of the pollution. The development raises the prospect of an electric car, still quiet, swift and clean, but without the  problem of heavy batteries that must often be recharged. Instead, such a car would be refilled with energy in minutes from the pump at the corner gasoline station and get twice the gas mileage of a comparable car with an internal combustion engine.</p>

        <p>Judges Miss Pay Raise  Federal judges, already beset by criticism from many in Congress, have found a new reason to be uneasy: last month, for the first time, Congress approved a pay raise for itself without including the judges. Their last raise was in 1993.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Death Penalty Rule Upheld  The Supreme Court refused to hear a case challenging a provision of the Texas death penalty law. The law prohibits telling jurors that if they choose a life sentence instead of the death penalty, the defendant will not be released on parole for at least 40 years.</p>

        <p>U.S. Emissions Increase  As negotiations resume in Bonn on a new treaty to curtail global warming, the United States said its emissions of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere grew last year at the highest rate since the nation pledged in 1992 to cut them back.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>Trees Used to Fight Runoff  The Federal Government began a new approach to battling water pollution by planting trees to control runoff from farm fields in the Chesapeake Bay area of Maryland, where the deaths of thousands of fish this year were linked to the widespread use of chicken manure as fertilizer on nearby cornfields.</p>

        <p>Gephardt Backs I.R.S. Review  Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, has tentatively decided to support legislation that would bring sweeping changes to the way the Internal Revenue Service is run, giving the bill broad bipartisan backing despite objections from the Clinton Administration.</p>

        <p>2 Weeks Before Election, Messinger Still Struggles  Two weeks before Election Day, Ruth W. Messinger remains an essentially unknown figure to a vast segment of New Yorkers, suggesting that the Democratic challenger to Rudolph W. Giuliani, and indeed the mayoral race itself, has not captured the attention of the city, according to the latest New York Times poll.</p>

        <p>Carpool Lane Scratched  Gov. George E. Pataki canceled a $400 million project to build a new carpool lane on the center median of the Cross Westchester Expressway, a major conduit for east-west travel north of New York City. Once thought to be an environmentally progressive solution to traffic jams, newer studies have concluded that high-occupancy vehicle lanes do not generally work, actually producing more traffic rather than less.</p>

        <p>Trump Turns on Whitman  Donald Trump, a longtime supporter of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, has now become a spoiler in her reelection campaign, publicly revealing incidents that he says show that the New Jersey Governor has treated him improperly in response to his opposition to a road and tunnel project planned for Atlantic City that would benefit a rival developer.</p>

        <p>City Agency Faces Bias Charge  The agency that enforces New York City's laws against discrimination may itself have discriminated against two female staff lawyers when it rejected their applications for a supervisory position and promoted a man who had less seniority and litigation experience, a Federal agency has found.</p>

        <p>Caesarean Risk Challenged  Contradicting highly influential reports, four new studies of more than 20,000 women conclude that the use of epidural anesthesia for labor pain does not increase a woman's risk of having a Caesarean section. Previous studies found that the Caesarean rate was four times as high among women who had the anesthesia, as it was for other women.</p>

        <p>Starwood Makes ITT Offer  Starwood Lodging Trust said it had agreed to buy the ITT Corporation for $9.8 billion in cash and stock. The $82 per share offer appears much higher than the $70 a share, $8 billion hostile offer from the Hilton Hotels Corporation that ITT shareholders were scheduled to consider at a meeting next month.</p>
