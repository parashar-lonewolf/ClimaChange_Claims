        <p>OIL for $20 a barrel? Is OPEC on the march again?</p>
        <p>It would be precipitous to rush to the corner gas station to top off the tank. The surge that has raised crude oil prices by one-sixth in two weeks is largely being written off as a speculative bubble, another symptom of Wall Street's current inclination to discover inflation lurking under every bed.</p>
        <p>But the oil boomlet is a reminder that the cheap fuel enjoyed by consumers over the last decade is not guaranteed by the laws of economics or nature. Indeed, some experts are convinced that the long-term trend is toward higher prices. "We've turned the corner in the cycle," said Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy research Associates.</p>
        <p>One recent projection, offered by the business-oriented World Energy Council in London, suggests that oil consumption will press against available supply by early in the next century. And last week the Economist magazine published a lengthy jeremiad explaining why "world energy markets will soon be roiled by surging demand."</p>
        <p>Those inclined to such pessimism focus on projected demand from the developing countries. According to the International Energy Agency in Paris, urbanization alone sharply increases consumption, as people abandon animal power for the internal combustion engine and discover the joys of central heating. The I.E.A. believes industrializing countries will increase their energy consumption by 4 percent annually through the year 2010, compared with about 1 percent in the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>China, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, has just become a net oil importer. Over all, Cambridge Energy Research Associates predicts, Asia will increase consumption by some eight million barrels by the year 2005 -- as much oil as is currently produced by Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>There is certainly plenty of fossil fuel left below ground to meet rising demand. A good proportion of it, however, is coal, which emits roughly twice as much greenhouse-inducing carbon dioxide per unit of heat as oil or natural gas. Renewable forms of energy, like hydropower, could yield a lot more power, but at high cost. Likewise nuclear energy, whose future would be bleak even if Chernobyl was still just another anonymous provincial city in the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>There is also plenty of oil and gas left, much of it extractable at low cost. The catch is that the cheap stuff is almost all in the Persian Gulf, where development and production are largely determined by geopolitics and maneuvering within the OPEC cartel. Figuring how much oil Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will sell is thus as much "a problem in game theory," as it is a question of supply and demand, notes Dale Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Convinced now that prices are headed up? Morris Adelman, an economist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, begs to differ. "It's an old story," he says; "industry opinion just doesn't take account of basic economics."</p>
        <p>For starters, he is skeptical of the assumption that rapid economic growth in China, India and Latin America will sharply accelerate world demand for oil. As these regulation-hobbled economies modernize, he argues, they are likely to allow energy prices to rise to free market levels, which in turn, will induce conservation of energy. "The more the third world develops," he said, "the less it acts like the third world."</p>
        <p>Then there is the question of energy supply from outside the Mideast. Lots of oil remains to be found and extracted in Russia, China, Colombia, Mexico, Vietnam and even Australia. And while capital for investing in these new areas is not plentiful at the moment, Mr. Adelman is confident that countries yearning for oil royalties are growing more realistic about sharing the risks of development with the international oil companies.</p>
        <p>Despite differences in opinion about the future of the oil market, it is possible to find some common ground. Almost no one is predicting a rerun of the 1970's oil shocks anytime in the foreseeable future. By the same token, almost everyone agrees with William Hogan, an economist at the Kennedy School at Harvard, "that the combination of low prices and rising demand can only be sustained over the next few decades with the cooperation of the Persian Gulf producers."</p>
        <p>In essence, then, the key difference between the optimists and the pessimists is how they expect the low-cost producers in general and Saudi Arabia in particular to behave. Mr. Adelman doubts that the Saudis have the will or the way to follow a high-price strategy. Mr. Hogan doubts that Mr. Adelman or anyone else can predict the oil producers' response to current events. "With cartels," he said, "we just don't know what we're talking about."</p>
