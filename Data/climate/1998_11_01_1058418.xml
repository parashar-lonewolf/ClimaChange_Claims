        <p>HER classmates cheering her on --  ''Come on, Shay, you can do it!'' -- Sunscherray Bronson made a third attempt to cast a wire minnow trap past the marsh grass and into the channel where, presumably, the mummichog swam.  The trap's yellow nylon tether line slipped out of Shay's grasp, eliciting a chorus of ''Ooh' '' and a round of tittering laughter.</p>
        <p>The trap was well positioned, however, and Dr. Joseph F. Crivello, a biology professor at the University of Connecticut, recaptured and secured the line.</p>
        <p>Seven students and three teachers from the E. C. Goodwin Regional Vocational Technical School in New Britain had met Dr. Crivello at the tidal salt marsh that wound through a cemetery in Old Lyme on a pleasant autumn morning to participate in a project starting with serious scientific research and running through to the Internet.</p>
        <p>The marsh is as near to pristine as can be  found in the state. ''There's no debris or trash,'' Dr. Crivello noted as the students  wandered among fish traps, baited with chunks of English muffins.</p>
        <p>As if to punctuate the Arcadian character of the marsh, the cemetery is the site of a monument to the naturalist Roger Tory Peterson, the author of popular bird watchers' guides whose ashes were scattered over Long Island Sound nearby.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Crivello also pointed out some potential sources of pollution. Through the trees, a few houses overlooking the marsh  could be seen, whose owners might well be using fertilizers and herbicides on their lawns. Those chemicals would easily find their way into the marsh, he noted. ''If there are any problems with this marsh they aren't the kinds you can readily see,'' Dr. Crivello said.</p>
        <p>Determining the extent of human impact on Connecticut's salt marshes is, in fact, the point of Dr. Crivello's research project, the  Estuary Watch Program. Armed with a scientific collector's permit, he is surveying  marshes from Stonington to Westport to measure their comparative healthiness by catching and analyzing the health of the  mummichogs, among other things, that live in them.</p>
        <p>The common mummichog, or killifish, or Fundulus heteroclitus, if you will, is an unassuming, two- to three-inch-long being  occupying a middle point in the food chain. Mummichog eat smaller fish, insects and whatnot, and in turn are eaten by bigger fish and birds.</p>
        <p>The mummichogs collected by the teen-agers will be examined and tested at the laboratory at the University of Connecticut to determine the size of their livers and the amount of sugar stored there. The more polluted the water that they lived in, the larger their livers will be and the lower the level of stored sugar.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crivello believes these tests may be able to prove what people intuit, that pollution levels in Long Island Sound are higher the farther west one goes.</p>
        <p>He had personal reasons for involving high school students, however. Dr. Crivello's son had taken high school biology and wound up hating science, a fault of the teaching method, the father felt. So he designed his research project to show high  school students what science is really like.</p>
        <p>''This is not just something to get the kids out into the fresh air,'' he said. ''This is a real scientific project. The purpose is not to show kids that science is fun, though it is fun, but to show them what it's like to be a scientist.''</p>
        <p>In all, nearly 300 students from 11 schools are taking part in the September-November field collections. After recording their data, they will wait for Dr. Crivello to post it and his analysis on Internet pages of the University of Connecticut Web site. They will then evaluate it, and prepare graphs and papers on their conclusions.</p>
        <p>He secured a $25,000 grant from the Department of Environmental Protection's Office of Long Island Sound Programs, the  maximum given through the Long Island Sound license plate program, according to Kate Hughes, the fund coordinator.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Crivello sees it, ''When you approach a complex scientific problem there are no simple solutions. It's true for science, it's true for politics, it's true for life.''</p>
        <p>At the start of the collection procedure in Old Lyme, he stressed careful, accurate recording of observations. Clipboards and data recording forms were distributed, and the teen-agers divided into two teams.</p>
        <p>Minnow traps were placed in the marsh waters at six locations. While they waited a half hour or so for the mummichogs to find their way into the traps, the students took out test kits and measured and recorded the temperature of the air and water, the acidity of the water and the mud, and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the water.</p>
        <p>They went beyond what students from  other schools might do because they have their own environmental studies program, and they came with their own test kits. They will post their data on their school's Web site, including the data on the water and mud pH and dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations.</p>
        <p>When they pulled the traps out of the water, wiggling mummichogs abounded. The fish were counted, weighed, measured and their sex determined (males are smaller and have silver stripes, females have dark stripes).</p>
        <p>''It's as close to doing real science as they can get,'' noted Gary Bashura, a science teacher at Emmett O'Brien Tech, who accompanied 18 of his students on their field collection in the Great Meadow Marsh in Stratford in September.</p>
        <p>He noted that student data will be put to a real scientific purpose, and that the project also makes effective use of the Internet, which was originally designed as a way for scientists to share their research findings, as an educational tool. Finally, the project is interdisciplinary, making use of students' math an English skills.</p>
        <p>Marco Kinsella, who teaches chemistry at E. C. Goodwin, noted that the kind of thinking that students have to do for this project is the same that is measured on the science portion of the Connecticut Academic Performance Test, the state's standardized test given to 10th graders in the spring.</p>
        <p>His students also went to a salt marsh in Guilford where there was a more diverse range of species, more tidal action and dirtier water than they saw in Old Lyme.</p>
        <p>And what was most interesting for the teen-agers in his group? Dr. Kinsella said it was learning how to determine the sex of the fish.</p>
        <p>But the real goals are apparently both longer term and adult-driven. ''I hope some of these kids pursue careers in chemistry or environmental science,'' he said, ''because that's where the jobs are.''</p>
