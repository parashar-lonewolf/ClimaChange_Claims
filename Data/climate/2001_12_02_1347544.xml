        <p>This list has been selected from books reviewed since the Holiday Books issue of December 2000. It is meant to suggest some of the high points in this year's fiction and poetry, nonfiction, children's books, mysteries and science fiction. The books are arranged alphabetically under genre headings. The complete reviews of these books may be found at The New York Times on the Web: nytimes.com/books.</p>
        <p>FICTION &amp; POETRY</p>
        <p>THE ABOMINATION. By Paul Golding. (Knopf, $26.) A smart, angry first novel full of beautiful surfaces, including that of the hero, if that's the word, who wanders through gay London seething with contempt for his milieu and hatred for the grown-ups who deformed his childhood.</p>
        <p>ACCORDING TO QUEENEY. By Beryl Bainbridge. (Carroll &amp; Graf, $22.) Samuel Johnson and his friend Hester Thrale are the subjects of this novel as they appear to Hester's daughter; her case of mother-daughter conflict urges her toward forgetfulness, not understanding.</p>
        <p>AFTERIMAGE. By Helen Humphreys. (Metropolitan/Holt, $23.) A Canadian writer's lyrical, alluring novel, a kind of gloss on the life of the Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron; the character at its heart, however, is a passionately self-educated housemaid from starving Ireland who serves as a model and as the prize in a family tug of war.</p>
        <p>AGAINST LOVE POETRY. By Eavan Boland. (Norton, $21.) Poems consistently feminist, domestic and devoted to the poet's native Ireland; Boland argues that the sweet, icky stuff that passes for love poetry is no such thing. Her concern is with polarities of love and control, against thoughtless submission but much in favor of sacrifices in partnership.</p>
        <p>AIDING AND ABETTING. By Muriel Spark. (Doubleday, $21.) Spark at 82 can still manipulate characters so daringly their most improbable acts seem self-generated; in this instance, two men who claim to be the murderous Lord Lucan (missing since 1974) gang up to blackmail a Paris psychiatrist who is as unlikely as they are.</p>
        <p>ALMOST. By Elizabeth Benedict. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) A nearly-mystery novel nicely constructed around a ghastly premise: Sophy, the narrator and protagonist, has found new love with Daniel in the last stage of her divorce from Will when Will is found dead in dreadful circumstances. Complications ensue, of course.</p>
        <p>AMERICAN SON. By Brian Ascalon Roley. (Norton, paper, $13.) Two half-Filipino brothers can pass for white, but their mother cannot; painful conflicts are in store for everybody in this novel's complex exploration of racism in California, starting in 1993, a year after the Rodney King riots.</p>
        <p>AMONG THE MISSING. By Dan Chaon. (Ballantine, $22.) This unnerving collection of stories concerns mothers who hit the road, fathers who fly the coop, a husband who keels over, a boy who steps behind a bush and is never seen again. The characters seem not to know what they are doing, but the author does.</p>
        <p>THE ARTIST'S WIFE. By Max Phillips. (John Macrae/Holt, $23.) Phillips's novel is narrated from inside the selfish, mean, witty head of Alma Mahler (1879-1964), who married, in succession, Gustav Mahler, Walter Gropius and Franz Werfel, when not playing around with Oskar Kokoschka, and outlived just about everybody.</p>
        <p>BABE IN PARADISE. By Marisa Silver. (Norton, $23.95.) A disquieting first collection of short stories, set in Los Angeles, where fame and wealth are the core of life and Silver's characters rotate on the periphery, doing what they must to develop wisps of hope.</p>
        <p>BACK WHEN WE WERE GROWNUPS. By Anne Tyler. (Knopf, $25.) A kind of optimistic fatalism pervades Tyler's 15th novel, in which a 53-year-old mother, stepmother and widow abandons false starts and fantasy, realizing that ''your true life is the one you end up with, whatever it may be.''</p>
        <p>THE BAY OF ANGELS. By Anita Brookner. (Random House, $23.95.) In her 20th novel, Brookner shifts her customary focus on an anomie-bedeviled heroine caught in the confusion between life and literature to ponder the freedom that accompanies the acceptance of limitations.</p>
        <p>THE BEAUTY OF THE HUSBAND: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos. By Anne Carson. (Knopf, $22.) Poems are they, these objects? Whatever, they are bold and abbreviated, they fear no free association and no kind of knowledge or desire and are overtly concerned with the ways intellectual discernment can clash with erotic taste.</p>
        <p>BIG AS LIFE: Three Tales for Spring. By Maureen Howard. (Viking, $23.95.) A triptych of novellas somehow based on the seasons: a professor's love affair with an executive; an Irish beauty's moral and charitable discoveries in New York; and a thematic exploration of John James Audubon, the birdman who killed for his art.</p>
        <p>THE BIOGRAPHER'S TALE. By A. S. Byatt. (Knopf, $24.) An exhilarating fable that divides the house of letters into theorists, scholars and practitioners; its hero, a small but ''perfectly formed'' scholar, is writing the life of a writer who wrote the life of a writer who wrote, or maybe intended to write or not, about Galton, Linnaeus and Ibsen.</p>
        <p>BLUE DIARY. By Alice Hoffman. (Putnam, $24.95.) Sunny magic realism and weather to match give way to Hoffman's characteristic themes of loss and deception in this novel when the husband of an otherwise happy family is arrested for a rape and murder; he confesses the crime to his wife, who must figure out how much truth she will be able to tolerate.</p>
        <p>THE BODY ARTIST. By Don DeLillo. (Scribner, $22.) A tiny, intimate metaphysical ghost story by a master creator of huge, panoramic fiction; it concerns a woman alone in a large seaside house, where a strange man appears in an unused room. DeLillo's pinpoint prose copes with big themes, like the structure of time and the artist's approach to calamity.</p>
        <p>THE BONESETTER'S DAUGHTER. By Amy Tan. (Putnam, $25.95.) A novel of multiple narratives that puts to use the experiences, in very different countries and ages, of daughter, mother and grandmother to construct a family story and find the place in it for the youngest generation.</p>
        <p>BORDER CROSSING. By Pat Barker. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $22.) An emotionally astute novel on public themes, in which a charming 23-year-old psychopath comes back to wreck the life of the child psychologist who helped send him to jail 13 years earlier.</p>
        <p>THE BOSTONS. By Carolyn Cooke. (Mariner/ Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) A network of connections between these short stories illuminates from more than one point of view a sort of clique of aging, prosperous Bostonians and the rough, unprosperous Maine community where they traditionally spend their summers.</p>
        <p>CARRY ME ACROSS THE WATER. By Ethan Canin. (Random House, $23.95.) The water is almost certainly the Styx, as contemplated from some small remove by this novel's protagonist, a Pittsburgh beer baron whose protective arrogance is compromised by the eruption, unbidden, of 78 years' worth of memory.</p>
        <p>CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL. By Glen David Gold. (Hyperion, $24.95.) A grandly plotted novel with a framework of real history that recaptures a lost era of live entertainment; Carter, a brilliant stage magician with some connection to the death of Warren G. Harding, tangles with a Secret Service out to hurt him.</p>
        <p>THE CENTER OF THINGS. By Jenny McPhee. (Doubleday, $22.95.) Marie Brown, the heroine of this engaging, amusing first novel, is an aspiring tabloid writer and quondam graduate student in philosophy of science. Now 39, she still hopes for true love, professional advancement and an understanding of physical reality.</p>
        <p>THE CHEESE MONKEYS: A Novel in Two Semesters. By Chip Kidd. (Scribner, $25.) Fiction, by a notable graphic designer, that feels autobiographical and sometimes acts like a manifesto on graphic design; its hero, a student at a big state university in 1957-58, himself has heroes: a bold, sexy, bohemian woman and a challenging, confrontational design professor.</p>
        <p>THE COLD SIX THOUSAND. By James Ellroy. (Knopf, $25.95.) America teems with conspiracy in this novel of the period between the Kennedy assassinations; the Klan, the F.B.I., the Mormons, the C.I.A. and Howard Hughes all seem to be involved, none of them on the side of truth or justice.</p>
        <p>COLLECTED POEMS. By James Merrill. Edited by J. D. McClatchy and Stephen Yenser. (Knopf, $40.) A big, handsome volume that displays Merrill's absorption and re-emission, transfigured, of every kind of experience this planet has to offer.</p>
        <p>COLLECTED STORIES. By Ellen Gilchrist. (Little, Brown, $27.95.) This thick sampling of Gilchrist's work over two decades gives plenty of scope for tracking her recurrent Southern heroines through her recurrent theme: that we are saved from regret and free-floating cynicism by the wonders of chance and love.</p>
        <p>THE COLLECTED STORIES OF RICHARD YATES. (Holt, $28.) Yates's focus on human weakness and self-deceit never made him all that popular in his lifetime (1926-92), so it's a joy tempered with apprehension to see this unflinching volume in which people trick themselves into seeking what they don't want.</p>
        <p>COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME. By Erika Krouse. (Scribner, $22.) Short stories populated by intelligent, wisecracking, bruised women, insecure, white and around 30; to find and keep love is what they want to do but can't, and Krouse's grasp of dark comedy lets her squeeze them beyond the limits we are used to.</p>
        <p>THE COMPLETE WORKS OF ISAAC BABEL. Edited by Nathalie Babel. (Norton, $39.95.) The total product of the marvelous writer who tried to create a synthesis of the Russian, the Jewish, the literary and the revolutionary, a mix that bestowed life on his fiction but could not save him from death on Stalin's orders in 1940.</p>
        <p>THE CONFESSIONS OF MYCROFT HOLMES: A Paper Chase. By Marcel Theroux. (Harcourt, $23.) The title is a tease about sibling rivalry; beyond it, there's a mystery involving a balance of forces somewhat like those in the author's real-life family, a burglary, a manuscript and an exercise of the novelist's imagination.</p>
        <p>CRAWLING AT NIGHT. By Nani Power. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) In this first novel by a young writer with a strong feel for the grim and the squalid, the central characters, a Japanese sushi chef in Manhattan and an alcoholic waitress, fall for each other and hit the road, intending reform but showing few of the necessary skills.</p>
        <p>THE DEATH OF SWEET MISTER. By Daniel Woodrell. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $23.95.) An unattractive 13-year-old boy, Shuggie, is the narrator of this violent, intense novel set in the Ozarks, acute in its rendering of the boy's incestuous jealousy for his mother and his rage at the men who bid for her attention.</p>
        <p>THE DEATH OF VISHNU. By Manil Suri. (Norton, $24.95.) A deft, confident first novel that rarely departs from the landing of a Bombay apartment building, where a servant with the name of a god lies dying, while upstairs a nominal Muslim struggles with spiritual difficulties, seeking ''the rapture of faith.''</p>
        <p>DEMONOLOGY: Stories. By Rick Moody. (Little, Brown, $24.95.) Accomplished, fearless short stories that examine the exchange of energy between language and loss; inhabited mostly by young people whose heads are smarter than their hearts, and illuminated, sometimes, by barrages of emotional and rhetorical fireworks.</p>
        <p>THE DEVIL'S LARDER. By Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $20.) Sixty-four brief fictions that require the reader to settle for not knowing exactly what is going on when tourists, for example, are tormented with snacks that induce ''chemical mirth.''</p>
        <p>DIRTY HAVANA TRILOGY. By Pedro Juan Gutiérrez. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) A ribald, earthy novel by a Cuban living in Cuba; the narrator, a former journalist who has fallen out with the Castro government, expertly evokes sensuous experience in his prose, and that experience is chiefly of poverty and sex, one of which helps him to survive the other.</p>
        <p>THE DYING ANIMAL. By Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) The third Roth novel to star David Kepesh (title character of ''The Breast'' back in 1972) brings an old man's perspective to the characteristic needy, argumentative voice of Roth's heroes without cracking the solipsism and self-regard.</p>
        <p>ECLIPSE. By John Banville. (Knopf, $23.) In Banville's 12th novel, an actor, a man already heartlessly detached from his wife and daughter, loses all sense of being himself and hides out at his childhood home, alone with himself, the reader and a highly communicative narcissism.</p>
        <p>ELECTRIC LIGHT. By Seamus Heaney. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $20.) Heaney's new book of poems is a compendium of poetic genres set in an array of forms and tuned to many kinds of experience, the work of a mature poet and world citizen, aware of his cultural authority as a public man and of the rights and responsibilities that go with it.</p>
        <p>EMBERS. By Sandor Marai. (Knopf, $21.) First published in Budapest in 1942, this elegant novel, set in a vast estate and the vanished splendor of Hapsburg empire, peaks in an amazing confrontation after 40 years between two of the parties in an adulterous turn-of-the-century triangle.</p>
        <p>EMPIRE FALLS. By Richard Russo. (Knopf, $25.95.) A humane sympathy for weakness does not rule out stern satiric judgment in this satisfying novel about several generations in a Maine mill town that sickens as the textile industry that sustained it perishes; Russo is brave enough to conceive a large ambition, but too smart to overreach.</p>
        <p>ESTHER STORIES. By Peter Orner. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) A first collection of short stories, many of them revolving around two Jewish families; history and geography invest characters with a real-life sense of passing time and changing place. Cause and effect are little invoked; life is understood in sidelong glances.</p>
        <p>EVA MOVES THE FURNITURE. By Margot Livesey. (Holt, $23.) A Scottish woman, born in 1920, is accompanied all her life by a woman and a girl who are invisible to everyone else in this often sad and scary novel. Sometimes they help her out, sometimes they determine her life without regard to her own preferences. And they never explain themselves.</p>
        <p>the faithful narrative of a pastor's disappearance. By Benjamin Anastas. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) Not really a narrative at all, for starters; a seductive, virtually plot-free examination of American culture, and particularly of a family of conspicuous consumers who are conscious of their sin but unable to stop committing it.</p>
        <p>FAITHLESS: Tales of Transgression. By Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $27.) Stories featuring themes like terror, female passion, male identity, loneliness, divorce, death and gun ownership, by an immensely productive author who wants us to be afraid of ourselves and shows us why.</p>
        <p>THE FEAST OF THE GOAT. By Mario Vargas Llosa. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) A bloody end is never in doubt in this novel starring Gen. Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic for 30 years; the suspense comes from wondering which of Vargas Llosa's nightmare characters will be the one to succeed him.</p>
        <p>THE FLIGHT OF THE MAIDENS. By Jane Gardam. (Carroll &amp; Graf, $25.) A subtle, clever coming-of-age and generational-conflict novel involving three girls in England and their families (or the missing members of families); set in 1946, it makes excellent use of the dislocations and deprivations caused by World War II.</p>
        <p>FLIGHTS OF LOVE: Stories. By Bernhard Schlink. (Pantheon, $23.) A first collection of fiction that features chiefly repressed, depressed men, emotionally buffered by success and propriety; the author, a German lawyer and judge, examines his characters with a powerful analytic intelligence as they awaken to see what they have lost by self-deception.</p>
        <p>THE FOURTH HAND. By John Irving. (Random House, $26.95.) The protagonist of this novel loses one hand to a circus lion, but on balance the encounter seems profitable, leading toward occupational sobriety and the love of a good woman who imposes her moral priorities on him.</p>
        <p>FURY. By Salman Rushdie. (Random House, $24.95.) In the first of Rushdie's novels to be set squarely in New York, a dapper Cambridge professor from India who is also a successful deviser of television puppets participates in replays of the creator-creature question and denounces a good many things that he sees in America.</p>
        <p>GABRIEL'S STORY. By David Anthony Durham. (Doubleday, $23.95.) Fifteen years old and black in the post-Civil-War West, the hero of this keen first novel is as outside as an outsider can be; he has every qualification for the self-sufficiency that enables the classic confrontations of cowboy, Indian and nester.</p>
        <p>THE GARDENS OF KYOTO. By Kate Walbert. (Scribner, $24.) An elusive, eloquent first novel whose plot moves back and forth in America, Paris and Japan, as its narrator, a woman coming of age in the 1950's, construes the past in a way that obscures some uncomfortable facts but never involves her in emotional dishonesty.</p>
        <p>GETTING A LIFE: Stories. By Helen Simpson. (Knopf, $22.) Unsentimental, stylistically playful, acutely observed British stories featuring two victim classes: women who sacrifice their lives for their children, and career women who rarely see the kids except on weekends.</p>
        <p>THE GLASS PALACE. By Amitav Ghosh. (Random House, $25.95.) A morally and psychologically complicated novel that examines the frequent deceptions and self-deceptions of India's Anglicized elite, a tribe deliberately created by Britain to think and act Britishly, still going strong after 50 years of independence.</p>
        <p>GLUE. By Irvine Welsh. (Norton, paper, $14.95.) Imbued with the quality of oral epic by the argot of the Edinburgh pubs and projects, this novel follows the growth to middle-aged dissolution of four boyhood friends whose only limitless prospect is for self-destruction.</p>
        <p>GOATS. By Mark Jude Poirier. (Talk Miramax/Hyperion, $22.) When the hero of this first novel, a 14-year-old straight-A stoner from Tucson, goes east to a fancy prep school, he leaves behind not only his infantile New Age mother but also his surrogate father, a handyman who tends the flatulent bovid ruminants of the title.</p>
        <p>THE GOOD GERMAN. By Joseph Kanon. (Holt, $26.) The deepest considerations of right and wrong pervade this novel about an American journalist searching for his prewar lover in the ruined (and harrowingly described) Berlin of 1945, where everything is for sale and experience with rocket weapons commands a very high price.</p>
        <p>THE GRAND COMPLICATION. By Allen Kurzweil. (Theia/Hyperion, $24.95.) A librarian whose life strategy depends on rules and compulsions acquires and then escapes a peculiar benefactor and his obsessions in this engaging, multilevel novel.</p>
        <p>HAUSSMANN, OR THE DISTINCTION. By Paul LaFarge. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) A novel that invents fanciful variations (including a peculiar love affair with a foundling) on themes from the life of the great city planner Georges Eugène Haussmann, who tore up a still medieval Paris, beginning in 1853, and transformed it into the light-filled city it is now.</p>
        <p>HONEYMOON: And Other Stories. By Kevin Canty. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.) Elliptical, impressionistic short stories, in a style at once tender and telegraphic, featuring characters who do the wrong things for the wrong reasons; for starters, in the first story Godzilla declares his love for Tokyo.</p>
        <p>HONEYMOONERS: A Cautionary Tale. By Chuck Kinder. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $24.) A production by a close friend of Raymond Carver that projects Carver's alcoholism and profligacy, and even some of his well-known short stories, onto a character called Ralph Crawford in a sort of eulogy à clef for a great American writer.</p>
        <p>HOTEL HONOLULU. By Paul Theroux. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) ''Fawlty Towers'' goes darkly Hawaiian in this comic novel, in which the author uses the grotesque denizens of the title hostelry to explore the exoticism of ordinariness -- or is it the other way around?</p>
        <p>THE HOTHOUSE. By Wolfgang Hoeppen. Translated by Michael Hofmann. (Norton, $23.95.) A masterpiece of German literature, first published in 1953 and now in English, about an honest politician attempting to rebuild postwar Germany.</p>
        <p>HOW TO BE GOOD. By Nick Hornby. (Riverhead, $24.95.) A surprisingly sentimental novel in which a British physician's snarling husband falls under the influence of a faith healer and embarks on the venture of transformation to goodness, perhaps excessive goodness.</p>
        <p>THE HUNTER. By Julia Leigh. (Four Walls Eight Windows, $20.) A moody first novel that follows an obsessed Australian hunter in his effort, undertaken on a mission for a biotech company, to find and kill a Tasmanian tiger, a beast as fierce as the hunter himself but believed extinct since 1936.</p>
        <p>THE HUNTERS: Two Short Novels. By Claire Messud. (Harcourt, $23.) The first, titled ''A Simple Tale,'' intensely and compassionately written, illuminates the deadly bleak life of an old woman whose luck failed her repeatedly; the second concerns a tenant in a London flat who fears his neighbor may be a mass killer.</p>
        <p>I CANNOT TELL A LIE, EXACTLY: And Other Stories. By Mary Ladd Gavell. (Random House, $21.95.) The inevitable losses between mothers and children are at the heart of these subtle, polished stories, whose author died at 47 in 1967, when ladies still approached their goals by indirect means.</p>
        <p>IN CUBA I WAS A GERMAN SHEPHERD. By Ana Menéndez. (Grove, $23.) A collection of wise, painful stories about the Cuba in Miami and the Miami in Cuba, after 40 years of what is neither migration nor exile but a condition of joint obsession for those who never left and for those who did.</p>
        <p>INSPIRED SLEEP. By Robert Cohen. (Scribner, $25.) An elegant, witty novel whose protagonist is a struggling 39-year-old single mother and adjunct professor whose gravest need is just a little sleep; she gets it, eventually, through involvement with a not particularly scrupulous experimental sleep laboratory.</p>
        <p>IN SUNLIGHT, IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN. By Kathleen Cambor. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) A sober, indeed stoical, novel, incorporating class conflict and observing the personal and emotional reticence of the 19th century, set in Johnstown, Pa., in the year a flood morally attributable to rich people upstream killed more than 2,000 of the less rich.</p>
        <p>IN THE FLOYD ARCHIVES: A Psycho-Bestiary. By Sarah Boxer. (Pantheon, paper, $15.) A smart, droll, original series of interconnected cartoons in which a Mr. Bunnyman is psychoanalyzed by Dr. Floyd in a universe that drifts, dreamlike and inexorable, in parallel with the real history of Freud and his cases; by a reporter for The Times.</p>
        <p>ISLAND: The Complete Stories. By Alistair MacLeod. (Norton, $25.95.) The small but highly concentrated output of 33 years' work, all of it dealing with life in Nova Scotia, where generations of hardship and authenticity, once stubbornly borne, are on the cusp of yielding to prosperity, education and cultural impoverishment.</p>
        <p>THE JOURNEY HOME. By Olaf Olafsson. (Pantheon, $24.) This novel's heroine, a tough woman who has been running a hotel in England for 20 years, returns to her native Iceland, keeping a diary in which a lifetime's grave issues burble up; the author, vice chairman of Time Warner Digital Media, wrote the book in Icelandic, then Englished it himself.</p>
        <p>KISSING IN MANHATTAN. By David Schickler. (Dial, $21.95.) Eleven linked stories that seem to come from an ancient world of happy endings; die-hard romantic strivers seek redemption from their ordinary problems in the dark whirl of a mythical city, some of them in the Preemption, a gargoyle-encrusted apartment house dominating the Hudson at 82nd.</p>
        <p>THE LAST REPORT ON THE MIRACLES AT LITTLE NO HORSE. By Louise Erdrich. (HarperCollins, $26.) A beguiling novel that takes place in Ojibwa country in North Dakota and centers on the innocence of Father Damien Modeste, a wilderness priest who lives for a century and is really a woman.</p>

The Baltimore sleuth Tess Monaghan is on hand when the mysterious figure who visits the grave of Edgar Allan Poe each year on his birthday is joined by a second Poe Toaster who is murdered on the spot, necessitating a witty survey of local legends surrounding the father of the American mystery story.</p>
        <p>MYSTIC RIVER. By Dennis Lehane. (Morrow, $25.) In this wrenching study of how a crime in the neighborhood can bring down the entire community, a savage murder in a working-class section of Boston forces three former friends to return to an earlier crime and relive the exact moment when the world of their boyhood lost its innocence.</p>
        <p>OPEN SEASON. By C. J. Box. (Putnam, $23.95.) In this sinewy first novel set in the Bighorn Mountains, the author articulates his concern for endangered lives and liberties in the laconic voice of Joe Pickett, the new game warden of Twelve Sleep County, Wyo., and a stand-up guy who isn't intimidated by poachers, survivalists, or his own preternaturally smart child.</p>
        <p>OVER TUMBLED GRAVES. By Jess Walter. (Regan Books/HarperCollins, $25.) If every city gets the serial killer it deserves, Spokane, Wash., is stuck with a creep who preys on prostitutes who ply their trade along the river -- a lonely place that attracts the kind of people who have always lived on the edge of the water, condemned to dead-end lives.</p>
        <p>THE SHAPE OF SNAKES. By Minette Walters. (Putnam, $24.95.) Haunted by guilty memories of her role in the murder of a black woman with Tourette's syndrome, a British schoolteacher uses newspaper clips, police reports and personal letters to narrate the cruel event and to force her biased neighbors to acknowledge their own complicity.</p>
        <p>SCIENCE FICTION</p>
        <p>THE CHRONOLITHS. By Robert Charles Wilson. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95.) In novels like ''The Divide'' and ''The Harvest,'' Wilson has produced one of the most impressive bodies of work in contemporary science fiction. ''The Chronoliths,'' in which a man tries to turn his life around in a world stunned by the arrival of colossal monuments from the future, is among his best.</p>
        <p>DANCE OF KNIVES. By Donna McMahon. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $25.95.) This ambitious first novel, set in a 22nd- century Vancouver much altered by an unspecified ''Collapse,'' brings together a naïve young woman and a deadly, brain-damaged human ''tool'' in a wrenching twist on the old tale of Beauty and the Beast.</p>
        <p>THE GHOST SISTER. By Liz Williams. (Spectra/Bantam, paper, $5.99.) An anthropological puzzle story in the mode of Ursula K. Le Guin. Explorers from a neatly tamed ''Gaian'' world discover that communing with nature can mean something quite different on a planet whose inhabitants, under the influence of what they call the ''bloodmind,'' become predators in rapturous rapport with their environment.</p>
        <p>THE LAST HOT TIME. By John M. Ford. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95.) In an America greatly changed by the re-emergence of magic, a young paramedic falls in with a Chicagoland gang of humans and elves headed by the enigmatic Mr. Patrise. Although the narrative takes the shape of myth, Ford keeps the focus on a love story as touching as it is surprising.</p>
        <p>LOOK TO WINDWARD. By Iain M. Banks. (Pocket Books, $23.95.) Set in a far-future, multi-species galaxy rife with hope and despair, this sophisticated space opera deals artfully with the appeal of terrorism and the necessary dangers of a free society.</p>
        <p>NEKROPOLIS. By Maureen F. McHugh. (HarperCollins, $24.) A slow-paced, tightly focused novel about the search for love in all the wrong places. Hariba, a 26-year old woman who chooses the life of a brain-controlled servant over freedom, falls for an artificially bred humanoid who, though programmed to please all true humans, can only feel close to his own kind.</p>
        <p>PAVANE. By Keith Roberts. (Del Rey Impact, paper, $12.95.) What better choice to begin a new series of quality reprints than this classic alternative-history novel, first published in 1968 and set in a 20th-century England that reverted to Roman Catholicism after the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I? Roberts evokes this imaginary time and place with a persuasive attention to detail and an irresistible narrative sweep.</p>
        <p>RETURN TO THE WHORL. By Gene Wolfe. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $25.95.) A weighty addition to Wolfe's far-future epic about faith and its consequences. To understand it, readers should be acquainted with at least some of the earlier volumes in his Long Sun series. As fine a writer as science fiction has produced, Wolfe demands a lot from his readers, but here, as always, it's worth meeting him more than halfway.</p>
        <p>SHIP OF FOOLS. By Richard Paul Russo. (Ace, paper, $12.95.) A heady blend of religious allegory and first-contact puzzle story. Having lost sight of their original mission, the inhabitants of a self-sufficient starship break into bitterly opposed factions. An encounter with an alien vessel forces everyone to confront the age-old question: how can evil exist in a divinely ordered universe?</p>
        <p>TALES FROM EARTHSEA (Harcourt, $24) and THE OTHER WIND (Harcourt, $25). By Ursula K. Le Guin. In these two books, one of science fiction's most acclaimed writers returns to Earthsea, a world of islands where magic is as familiar, and dangerous, as science is in our world. The five short tales, all new, deepen the portrait of Earthsea that Le Guin sketched out in earlier novels. In ''The Other Wind,'' a new novel, Le Guin takes a hardheaded look at the efforts of Earthsea's contentious peoples to live together.</p>
        <p>VENTUS. By Karl Schroeder. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $27.95.) Nothing is what it seems on Ventus, a planet that has been transformed into an Earth-like ''paradise'' by nanotechnology. On a world where everything is, in some sense, alive, why are humans barely tolerated? While more-than-human powers contend for control of Ventus, a handful of humans, often working at cross-purposes, try to avert a tragedy of cosmic proportions.</p>
        <p>WILD SEED. By Octavia E. Butler. (Warner Aspect, paper, $13.95.) First published in 1980, this mesmerizing tale combines traditions of African and African-American storytelling with a keen understanding of biological and evolutionary imperatives. An important work of modern science fiction by the only science fiction writer to win a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant.</p>
