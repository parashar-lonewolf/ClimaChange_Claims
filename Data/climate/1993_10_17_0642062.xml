        <p>In the most ambitious effort yet to use free-market forces to clean up urban smog, regulators here have approved a long-awaited plan to allow companies to buy and sell the rights to pollute in the same way baseball cards and pork bellies are traded.</p>
        <p>The new regulatory approach, approved on Friday by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, establishes pollution allowances for 390 of the region's largest polluters, which each emit more than four tons a year of either nitrogen oxides or sulfur oxides, the two main ingredients of Southern California's brown haze.</p>
        <p>In the past, the government told companies like power plants, oil refineries and glass factories what techniques they must use to reduce emissions. Under the new regulation, companies will simply be told how much they must reduce their emissions each year and allowed to use whatever means they see fit to achieve the goal.</p>
        <p>The rationale behind the new regulation is to encourage companies to invest in anti-pollution technologies that could cut their emissions and allow them to sell off their valuable pollution rights to companies that cannot afford to clean up their operations.</p>
        <p>Ideally, the trading of pollution credits will take place on something akin to a smog market that will be monitored by the air management district, which oversees the region's environment.</p>
        <p>The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is developing a similar pollution-trading program on a national scale to promote reductions in the pollutants that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>Other regions with air-quality problems have been watching Southern California in hope of adopting the emissions-trading program to reduce pollution in their areas.</p>
        <p>"It provides greater certainty that we will achieve healthful air while allowing industry to seek the most cost-effective means to reduce emissions," said James M. Lents, the management district's executive officer. "Environmental policy makers have talked for two decades about the merits of market-based pollution controls. We've gone beyond talk and worked out an actual plan." Environmentalists Angered</p>
        <p>The board of the air management district voted 11 to 1 to approve the new regulatory framework, rejecting amendments that would have limited the program by requiring only those companies that emit 10 tons or 50 tons of air pollutants to participate.</p>
        <p>Still, some environmentalists and polluters lambasted the new regulation, saying it would cost jobs by encouraging smaller businesses to leave California because moving would allow them to sell all their pollution rights and use the proceeds as they see fit.</p>
        <p>Jim Jenal, the director of clean air programs for Citizens for a Better Environment, a state advocacy group, said raising the threshold to 50 tons would have reduced the number of polluters in the program to 88 and allowed the air management district to monitor larger polluters better. "We are very concerned that they won't be able to properly monitor all these polluters," he said.</p>
        <p>The 390 polluters in the program will have to reduce their nitrogen oxide emissions by an average of 8.3 percent a year, from 103 tons a day to 26 tons a day or by a total of 77 tons. In addition, 41 of the polluters must reduce sulfur oxide emissions an average of 6.8 percent a year -- from 26 tons to 10 tons a day -- or by a total of 16 tons.</p>
        <p>By comparison, a single pollution regulation now takes about two years to adopt and results in less than a ton a day of emission reductions, the air management district said. The new program begins on Jan. 1. Plan Is SmallerDown-Sized</p>
        <p>The plan approved by the air management district involves far fewer than the 2,700 companies that were proposed under the initial pollution-trading regulation put forward in 1992.</p>
        <p>The air management district plans a second program next year to cover polluters that emit organic compounds from paints, solvents and other materials used in manufacturing electronics, furniture and aircraft.</p>
