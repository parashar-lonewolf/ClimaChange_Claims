        <p>ANYONE who has traveled in the summer most likely has a tale of a trip marred by visitors who have a tendency to appear just as a picnic dinner is spread out or alfresco evening drinks are served.

As one of their regular picks, I can catalog an impressive number of trips according to which bug tormented me and how many bites I endured.</p>
        <p>These days, of course, some insects are more than an annoyance, with potentially deadly mosquito-borne illnesses like the West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis a growing concern in the United States, and malaria and yellow fever a continuing problem around the world.

        <p>ANYONE who has traveled in the summer most likely has a tale of a trip marred by visitors who have a tendency to appear just as a picnic dinner is spread out or alfresco evening drinks are served. Usually arriving stealthily by air, these stinging, biting uninvited guests tend to have a favorite host among the crowd. As one of their regular picks, I can catalog an impressive number of trips according to which bug tormented me and how many bites I endured.</p>
        <p>These days, of course, some insects are more than an annoyance, with potentially deadly mosquito-borne illnesses like the West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephalitis a growing concern in the United States, and malaria and yellow fever a continuing problem around the world. Mosquitoes are not the only insects that can ruin a backyard picnic or excursion halfway around the world: ticks, black flies and fleas are among the bugs I have fended off in my travels near and far from home.</p>
        <p>A small bottle of insect repellent now accompanies me to any destination where the temperature is likely to rise above ''warm,'' but I have often wondered if I've chosen the best, or safest, weapon. My repellent contains a 95 percent concentration of N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide, more commonly known as DEET.</p>
        <p>Comparing Repellents</p>
        <p>Using such a high concentration of DEET is ''probably overkill,'' said Dr. Mark Fradin, a Chapel Hill, N.C., dermatologist who co-authored an article in The New England Journal of Medicine last July describing the results of a study comparing 16 insect repellents. Although the study found that products containing DEET offered the best protection against mosquitoes, compared with natural ingredients like citronella and soybean oil, Dr. Fradin said that with DEET concentrations above 50 percent, ''You're not getting a huge increase in efficacy.'' For a camping trip, he said, ''I would probably stick with 35 percent or less.''</p>
        <p>The study, which was conducted in a laboratory (volunteer subjects stuck their arms in cages filled with mosquitoes), found a repellent containing a 24 percent concentration of DEET protected for just over five hours, versus about four hours for a repellent containing a 20 percent concentration of DEET, an hour and a half for a product containing 2 percent soybean oil and less than 20 minutes for various products containing citronella. (Skin-So-Soft Bath Oil, which some consumers claim has a repellent effect on insects, provided less than 10 minutes of protection.)</p>
        <p>Overall, products containing DEET, Dr. Fradin said, ''are effective against more flying and biting insects than any other repellent.''</p>
        <p>That said, many consumers are scared off by the warning labels on DEET-based repellents, which contain alarming statements like, ''Hazard to humans and domestic animals,'' ''Do not inhale,'' ''Causes eye irritation'' and ''Do not keep product on any longer than necessary.''</p>
        <p>''There's no quick and easy answer in terms of the safety issue,'' Dr. Fradin said, but he pointed out that researchers estimate DEET-based products have been applied as many as eight billion times to people in the past 50 years, with fewer than 50 cases of toxic effects reported in the medical literature, some due to improper use of the product. ''There is some pretty obvious safety that is reflected just in those numbers,'' he said, though he added that it is important to follow the directions on a repellent's label.</p>
        <p>Among those recommendations: DEET-based repellents should be applied to exposed skin, not under clothes, washed off after a person returns indoors and applied to the face using one's hands (not sprayed directly). Also, any repellent should be used sparingly, Dr. Fradin said.</p>
        <p>Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has said that repellents containing DEET should not be used on infants younger than 2 months, children above that age group should use products with a lower concentration of DEET when protection is not necessary for a long period; it should be used just once a day; and repellents should not contain concentrations of DEET higher than 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Another downside of DEET is that it can damage synthetics, plastics, furniture, leather, painted surfaces and watch crystals, so you don't want to spray it indiscriminately near certain objects or clothes. Another ingredient, piperidine, which is now available in repellents in Europe, does not have that effect.</p>
        <p>As for why mosquitoes are attracted to one person more than others, Dr. Fradin said mosquitoes are typically drawn to carbon dioxide and lactic acids that everyone produces. ''What makes you more attractive beyond that is going to be something very unique in terms of your chemical output,'' he said. ''It's hard to know why one person is more attractive than another.''</p>
        <p>For trips within the United States, using repellent and wearing pants and a long-sleeved shirt in the evening when mosquitoes feed are generally sufficient protection against risks of mosquito-borne illnesses. Those headed abroad to places where diseases like malaria and yellow fever are a problem require extra precautions.</p>
        <p>Going Abroad</p>
        <p>Travelers going to certain countries or crossing borders in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America may need to get a vaccination against yellow fever; proof of vaccination may be required. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists more information at www.cdc.gov/travel.</p>
        <p>Preventing malaria is a bit more complicated, since there are several strains of the disease; no vaccine against malaria is now available, and resistance to certain antimalarial drugs has developed in many regions of the world. Anyone traveling to certain areas of Central or South America, Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe or the South Pacific should check sources like the C.D.C. to find out whether antimalarial pills are recommended, and then consult a travel medicine specialist to discuss which drug is appropriate. Clinics are listed at www.istm.org.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Phyllis Kozarsky, medical director of the TravelWell Clinic at Emory University in Atlanta and a professor at the Emory University School of Medicine, there are four main antimalarial options available: chloroquine, which has been around the longest but is not effective in certain areas where mosquitoes have developed a resistance to the drug; doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic; mefloquine, marketed as Lariam; and a combination of atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride, marketed as Malarone. ''There are a variety of issues we look at in helping someone determine which is best for them for their trip,'' Dr. Kozarsky said, mentioning cost, how soon the drug has to be started before entering a malarial region (one to two weeks versus one or two days), how often it has to be taken (weekly versus daily) and side effects.</p>
        <p>Travelers taking antimalarial drugs should not forgo other precautions like bed nets, proper clothing and repellents, Dr. Kozarsky said, since no drug is 100 percent effective in preventing malaria. ''Insect repellents and preventing being bitten are really the key.''</p>
