      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder epitomizes new independence of American allies in Europe; says Pres Bush should heed Schroder's pleas for faster cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases; says administration should try to improve Kyoto treaty, not kill it; says it should also address concerns about missile defense plans that could unnecessarily increase tensions with Russia</p>

        <p>Yesterday was a timely moment for President Bush to meet with Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schröder. Only a day earlier, the White House announced its ill-advised rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming, upsetting Germany and other European countries where climate change is a passionate political issue. Mr. Schröder urged Mr. Bush to cooperate with countries that want to work within the treaty at a conference to be held in Bonn later this year.</p>
        <p>Germany and many of its European Union partners have gained a new sense of confidence on the world stage, built on Europe's improving economy and its growing political and commercial integration. Mr. Schröder epitomizes this new independence.</p>

        <p>Yesterday was a timely moment for President Bush to meet with Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schröder. Only a day earlier, the White House announced its ill-advised rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming, upsetting Germany and other European countries where climate change is a passionate political issue. Mr. Schröder urged Mr. Bush to cooperate with countries that want to work within the treaty at a conference to be held in Bonn later this year.</p>
        <p>Germany and many of its European Union partners have gained a new sense of confidence on the world stage, built on Europe's improving economy and its growing political and commercial integration. Mr. Schröder epitomizes this new independence.</p>
        <p>Europe may seem like familiar territory to Bush administration officials, many of whom dealt with the continent during the cold war years when European leaders were more deferential to Washington's wishes than they are now. Administration policy makers must adjust their thinking to Europe's new mood or risk conflicts over the environment, arms control, NATO and trade.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto treaty, which calls for sharp reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide by 2012, is a good example. While the treaty is imperfect, and the Senate has been opposed to ratification, the issue is far too important for Washington simply to walk off in a huff. The Bush administration should try to improve the treaty, not kill it. America is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush should heed Mr. Schröder's pleas for faster emissions cuts.</p>
        <p>Europe is also concerned that the administration's missile defense plans could overturn arms control agreements and unnecessarily increase tensions with Russia. Germany, in particular, wants to prevent a return to a cold war atmosphere in Europe. With Washington's antimissile plans still evolving, it was possible to defer open disagreement this week. But the administration should respond to European concerns by engaging in active diplomacy with Russia, and China, on this issue in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>Europe's new assertiveness can help advance American policy goals, as demonstrated by this week's constructive mission to Macedonia by Europe's top foreign policy official, Javier Solana. But careful diplomatic coordination will be needed to keep trans-Atlantic relations on track.</p>
