      <block class="full_text">
        <p>EVER since November, some cryptic words have greeted hundreds of thousands of harried drivers near the entrance to the Pulaski Skyway here -- not with the usual come-ons for beer or cars or radio stations, but with a message instead about green and dark and thinking or something -- it's hard to catch it all at 60 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the sign reads, ''IT IS GREEN THINKS NATURE EVEN IN THE DARK.''</p>
        <p>The glowing red neon letters that make up the message stand eight feet high and stretch across the windows of the former American Can Company building. They can be seen from planes landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, according to the sign's creator, Mary Ellen Carroll, a Manhattan artist.</p>
        <p>Among those who have puzzled over what this could mean is a blogger who calls himself ''The Slush God'' (real name: John Joseph Adams, an assistant editor at the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in Jersey City), who wrote that he didn't ''understand the phrase or what this is supposed to accomplish, unless its goal is to perplex commuters and possibly cause accidents.'' Confusing drivers and prompting them to run to Google for answers was actually part of the plan of those who installed the sign. Plug any part of the phrase into a search engine, and you will discover links to the Precipice Alliance, a nonprofit group based in Manhattan, whose goal is to raise awareness of global warming. The site explains the project, an installation called ''Indestructible Language,'' and its carbon-neutral energy usage via solar power.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Carroll explains the words on the sign: ''If we know what is scientifically proven -- that the condition exists,'' she said, referring to global warming, ''and as an individual or as a group -- or what have you -- if you choose not to either believe it and to do something about it in some way, then that's the choice of remaining 'in the dark.' ''</p>
        <p>She added, '' 'It' refers to the color green, 'it' refers to the environment, 'it' refers to greenhouse gases, but 'it' also refers to money.''</p>
        <p>It took Ms. Carroll about three months to come up with that phrase and, she said, ''It should be something you should think about.''</p>
        <p>Here, where crumbling highways meet abandoned warehouses and cargo train tracks and contaminated swamps, is a place that the project's backers believed was perfect for a message about the environment.</p>
        <p>''This part of New Jersey is thought of as an industrial wasteland,'' said Donna Wingate, executive director of the Precipice Alliance. But that is changing; the building where the artwork appears is being converted to luxury condominiums, called the Canco Lofts. (A banner hanging over the artwork reads, ''Industrial Strength Living.'')</p>
        <p>It wasn't easy getting the artwork up. There were months of meetings with officials in the State Department of Transportation, who fretted about the effect on drivers. Recalling the struggle, Ms. Wingate said, ''What's more dangerous, a huge billboard of Kate Moss naked -- ''</p>
        <p>'' -- or a piece of artwork?'' interjected Ms. Carroll.</p>
        <p>Eventually, officials relented. The group also found an enthusiastic backer in the mayor here, Jerramiah T. Healy, who met with the members of the group and told them, ''I don't understand art, but I support it.''</p>
        <p>The sign is run with low-wattage transformers and lead-free glass tubing. The electric bill comes to less than $100 a month, according to Ms. Wingate; she would not reveal the cost of the work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carroll and the Alliance hope the message doesn't end when the art is taken down at the end of May. They are searching for a permanent home and have talked to people in St. Louis, Boston and Portland, Me., but nothing has come of those discussions yet.</p>
        <p>From time to time, the message beamed from the warehouse has been less coherent, as some illuminated letters go out. According to Ms. Carroll and Ms. Wingate, someone at the site helped himself to the many power cords that help light the sign, but they say the cords have been replaced.</p>
