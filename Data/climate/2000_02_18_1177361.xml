        <p>The Energy Department and General Electric will announce on Friday a major breakthrough in natural-gas- powered generating plants that will result in production of electricity using 5.3 percent less fuel than the best current technologies.</p>
        <p>While that percentage may seem small, it is enormous by the standards of an industry in which technologies often compete on the basis of fractions of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department is labeling the breakthrough ''the four-minute mile for electric plants.''</p>
        <p>The result, experts say, will be cheaper production of electricity and a significant reduction in gases thought to cause global warming.</p>
        <p>The new plant achieves 60 percent efficiency, a significant improvement over the 32 percent to 40 percent efficiency of typical coal, gas and oil plants in use today. Most of today's generating plants were built in the mid-1900's.</p>
        <p>Michehl R. Gent, president of the North American Electric Reliability Council said nearly all plants now being added run on natural gas, meaning that as overall capacity grows and as old plants are replaced with new ones, average efficiency of the system will rise sharply.</p>
        <p>Henry Linden, director of the energy and power center at the Illinois Institute of Technology and former president of the Gas Research Institute, said the introduction of high-efficiency gas plants ''is revolutionizing the global power business.''</p>
        <p>As for cutting the emission of ''greenhouse gases,'' Mr. Linden said that if the United States were to retire all its coal plants and replace them with 60-percent-efficient natural gas plants, the nation would meet two-thirds of its commitment under the Kyoto accords.</p>
        <p>The generator, which G.E. calls the H System, produces far less smog-causing nitrogen oxides than coal plants and some existing natural gas plants.</p>
        <p>The gain comes from tricks of engineering and metallurgy. The jet engine, for example, runs at temperatures above the melting point of the metal used to capture energy from the burning gases. Earlier efforts used air to cool the metal, but this air cuts efficiency.</p>
        <p>The new G.E. system uses steam instead, circulating it through serpentine channels inside the vanes and blades that direct combustion gases. The steam is then recaptured to make yet more electricity.</p>
        <p>Ordinary turbine blades are made of metal that is formed by millions of tiny crystals; under stress, the blades can break at the boundaries between crystals. The H System blades are giant, single crystals.</p>
        <p>In remarks to be delivered Friday, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson calls the new plant ''nothing less than the future of electric power generation for this country and for most of the world.''</p>
        <p>He adds, ''Pardon me for crowing.''</p>
        <p>The department put $100 million into research and development for the new design; General Electric says it spent another $200 million.</p>
        <p>The system produces a kilowatt-hour of electricity -- an amount of power that will keep 10 100-watt bulbs burning for an hour -- on 5,685 British thermal units, or B.T.U.'s, of gas, compared with 5,990 B.T.U.'s for older gas systems.</p>
        <p>A good coal plant uses nearly 10,000 B.T.U.'s to produce the same amount of electricity.</p>
        <p>The difference may come to only one-  or two-tenths of a cent per kilowatt hour, not enough for a residential customer to feel, but important for some industries. At current natural gas prices, moving from 57 percent efficiency, the current standard, to 60 percent efficiency would save about $20 million over the 20-year life of a 400-megawatt power plant. But beyond the dollar savings, the development also means less carbon dioxide, the main gas thought to aggravate global climate change.</p>
