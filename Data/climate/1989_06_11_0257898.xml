        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William Honan's article on the current state of arts financing  [ ''Arts Dollars: Pinched As Never Before,'' May 28 ]  was a timely reminder that we were once again becoming careless of our nation's soul. It's not the first time we've done this, nor will it be the last. Our biggest problem is simple: the arts, never having been considered vital to the nation's purposes, are not deemed important enough to be included on the national agenda. Until that happens, our soul's inheritance will continue to be piously discussed while politically expendable.</p>
        <p>Despite such problems, I am an optimist. The arts represent the very best in the United States and have never been more intensely needed than they are right now. We are in a spiritual emergency, potentially as devastating as the greenhouse effect, ocean pollution and the wild wasting of natural resources. We are in a war; to win it we must marshall our creative resources with skill and purpose. How do we do this?  First, the artistic communities must have a critical look at what's happening in their particular disciplines. Are we really encouraging the best, or are we allowing the slickest and easiest to pass for quality?</p>
        <p>Second, our demographics are changing; are we ignoring our new neighbors or including them as rich, new esthetic resources?</p>
        <p>Third, as Leonard Garment remarked in his Nancy Hanks Lecture at the National Academy of Sciences last month, ''arts advocates must present the arts and the humanities as powerful tools for understanding the nature of civilization.'' This means arts education, not only to assure literate and knowledgeable audiences for the future but to serve as a beginning to the whole process of educational exploration in the sciences and humanities. Turning children on to the arts gives them a sense of organizing their natural curiosities; the arts open minds.</p>
        <p>Fourth, our artistic assets must play a more important role in the whole field of international relations. We've never had a consistent policy on cultural exchange; in this moment of galvanizing political change we should use our artistic vitality to remind the world we have a vibrant heritage reflecting the best of our civilization. Of course we have financing problems; we've always had them. At this critical time it is all the more important that every dollar raised for the arts goes to support quality, not quantity. We must work to correct tax penalties imposed during the 1986 Tax Reform Act. We must encourage more of corporate America to take advantage of the long-existing 10 percent tax forgiveness for contributions to the arts, education and broad charitable purposes. In other words, we must mount a campaign to make the country more aware of just what priceless resources we have in our writers, painters, sculptors, composers, choreographers, dancers, theaters, concert halls, opera houses and museums.</p>
        <p>Over the last 30 years we have made some progress in recognizing the arts as a force in American life but we've not yet recognized their overwhelming importance to our national existence. We've given them lip service; we must now give them full priority.  SCHUYLER CHAPIN  New York</p>
