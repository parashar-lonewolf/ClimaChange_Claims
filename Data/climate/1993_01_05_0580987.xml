        <p>As Governor of Arkansas, his record on the environment was fair to poor. As a Presidential candidate he let Al Gore do most of the talking on environmental issues. Yet many hope that Bill Clinton will become the "environment President" George Bush promised to be but wasn't. It's more than a hope. It's a challenge -- maybe even bigger than Mr. Clinton imagines.</p>
        <p>No issue inspires more heat and hyperbole. No country spends more money -- $130 billion -- and imposes more regulations to keep itself clean. But money and laws have not achieved consensus. America is swarming with green activists -- and with energetic critics who believe that the cleanliness crusade exacts too great a toll in jobs and economic growth.</p>

        <p>As Governor of Arkansas, his record on the environment was fair to poor. As a Presidential candidate he let Al Gore do most of the talking on environmental issues. Yet many hope that Bill Clinton will become the "environment President" George Bush promised to be but wasn't. It's more than a hope. It's a challenge -- maybe even bigger than Mr. Clinton imagines.</p>
        <p>No issue inspires more heat and hyperbole. No country spends more money -- $130 billion -- and imposes more regulations to keep itself clean. But money and laws have not achieved consensus. America is swarming with green activists -- and with energetic critics who believe that the cleanliness crusade exacts too great a toll in jobs and economic growth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's opportunity is to bridge the gap with sound policies, shrewd management and smart politics. That means ending bureaucratic turf wars, thereby enabling government to fulfill its historic role as custodian of the nation's natural resources. It means setting priorities that reflect real, not imagined, risks. It means sticking to well-articulated goals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did none of these things, staining what began as a noble effort to atone for the eight lost years of Ronald Reagan, whose environmental views oscillated in a narrow band between indifference and hostility. Mr. Reagan hired Ann Burford not to run the Environmental Protection Agency but to gut it. He hired Donald Hodel as Energy Secretary. Mr. Hodel is chiefly remembered for suggesting that the way to deal with ozone depletion was to apply stronger suntan lotion.</p>
        <p>Starting fresh, Mr. Bush named a respected environmentalist, William Reilly, to run the E.P.A. He strengthened the Clean Air Act and committed the U.S. to phasing out ozone-destroying chemicals. He banned oil drilling in several sensitive offshore areas for 10 years.</p>
        <p>In time, however, the twin demons of recession and election-year politics turned him around. The trees and clean air he had once rhapsodized about became sinister obstacles to economic growth. With Dan Quayle as his point man, he invited business to undercut Congressional mandates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush tried to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling and permitted wasteful logging in the national forests. He was probably right not to be bulldozed into signing a costly global warming treaty based on incomplete science. But his cramped attitude toward the international Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero badly damaged his claim to global leadership on environmental issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly disappointed some of his old friends by not quitting. He chose to suffer and negotiate. He defeated John Sununu's efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act, saved Mr. Bush from reversing his pledge to protect the nation's wetlands from developers, dragged the President to Rio. On balance, the country is probably lucky he stayed.</p>
        <p>So now Bill Clinton finds himself in the same nasty political cauldron. So far he has done little to disappoint the environmentalists, who are delighted with his key appointments -- Carol Browner at E.P.A. and Bruce Babbitt at Interior. He also publicly differs with Mr. Bush on most issues. His energy strategy favors conservation and efficiency over production. He says he'll protect forests and wetlands and urge the reauthorization of the controversial Endangered Species Act.</p>
        <p>He's also made it clear, however, that on one crucial issue -- the heavy Federal regulation favored by many environmentalists -- he's keeping his own counsel. He agrees that industry, unregulated, rarely performs acts of spontaneous virtue. He agrees with Mr. Gore that regulation, properly conceived and applied, can force cleaner technologies without threatening profits or jobs.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he concedes that businessmen are easily disheartened by complex regulations. He also seems receptive to the notion that market forces -- tax incentives to encourage energy efficiency, for example, or taxes that reflect hidden environmental costs -- might produce the same environmental bang for fewer bucks.</p>
        <p>All this suggests an open mind. It also suggests that Mr. Clinton has determined that he will never achieve his objectives unless he persuades people that environmental progress can yield social and technological benefits at least equal to the costs.</p>
        <p>But first, of course, Bill Clinton must persuade Bill Clinton that the environment really does matter. This, after all, is a man who courted the Arkansas poultry industry, a world-class polluter of that state's rivers and streams; a man who, by his own admission, winked at pollution to attract industry and jobs to a poor state.</p>
        <p>He now claims to have seen the light. Inspired by Mr. Gore, he asserted bravely during the campaign that trading off the environment for jobs was a "false choice" -- that a cleaner America need not be a poorer America. That's hard to sell to Detroit and the oil companies, harder still to sell to the loggers in Oregon.</p>
        <p>Politically, George Bush's way was the easier path. Mr. Clinton's way is harder but there's brighter promise at the end. If only he can see it.</p>
