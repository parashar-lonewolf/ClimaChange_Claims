        <p>Hong Kong customs agents discovered 26 illegal Chinese migrants today, hidden in a shipping container bound for Long Beach, Calif., after they detected carbon dioxide gas emanating from the container.</p>
        <p>The container, which was scheduled to be shipped on Friday, had been outfitted for a long voyage with food, drinks, blankets, clothes and a simple ventilation system. All 26 occupants, who Hong Kong officials believe are from China's Fujian Province, were healthy.</p>
        <p>The would-be stowaways are part of a huge wave of illegal Chinese migration to the West, particularly the United States, which both the Chinese and the United States governments have loudly condemned, but which has proved difficult to stop. Most of the migrants are from several counties in Fujian Province that have a long tradition of migration and have already sent tens of thousands of people to the West.</p>
        <p>The illegal migrants, who generally end up as low-wage laborers in their new country, pay smugglers $30,000 to $60,000 for the passage. They are often provided with false travel documents as well. Hong Kong is a frequent early transit point on these long, sometimes circuitous journeys.</p>
        <p>The use of hand-held monitors to detect the presence of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of human respiration, is part of Hong Kong's effort to stem the trade.</p>
        <p>The perils of these passages were underscored last May, when British authorities in Dover discovered 58 Chinese, all dead from suffocation, in the back of a truck supposedly carrying tomatoes.</p>
        <p>But experts say that a miserable passage by sea or via the overland route probably represents only the low-end of this profitable trade, reserved for poorer farmers who can not raise enough money for the air route. Far more common for migrants from better-off families, they say, is to first fly to Hong Kong or Bangkok, where the migrants pick up false travel documents -- often a forged passport from a third country or a faked business visa -- which they then use for travel to the United States.</p>
        <p>Some of these people are intercepted by immigration officials at American airports, but others make it successfully into the United States, where they are often taken in by the friends and relatives from Fujian who came before them.</p>
