        <p>To the Editor:</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Reed Irvine, chairman of Accuracy in Media, claims that Congress ignored the results of a $500 million Government research program when it adopted the Clean Air Act acid rain control program in 1990 (letter, May 6). He further claims that the Natural Resources Defense Council ignored these research results. Neither claim is correct.</p>
        <p>During its 10-year deliberations over the acid rain legislation, Congress was briefed repeatedly on the research program. The Natural Resources Defense Council said then that the research results did not contradict the need for Congressional action to combat damage from acid rain. Congress adopted a carefully analyzed program to cut back acid rain, and the facts since then have shown that its judgment was correct: Acid rain has been reduced far more cheaply than predicted by industry, and the damage to our ecosystems is steadily being reduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irvine's charge that organizations like ours profit from ''promoting scares like the Alar-apple hoax'' is disinformation.</p>
        <p>The Alar case was no hoax. The Environmental Protection Agency's special review confirmed that the toxin posed an unacceptably high cancer risk, especially to infants and young children.</p>
