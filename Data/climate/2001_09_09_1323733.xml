        <p>TALK about shark season. Congress came back into session last week and the Democrats were circling, sensing blood in the political waters. The Republicans had an air of panic.</p>
        <p>Only last spring, the Democrats were unable to stop President Bush's $1.35 trillion, ten-year tax cut. But with the economy slowing, the budget surplus shrinking and President Bush in danger of having to break his pledge not to dip into the Social Security surplus, Democrats have returned to Washington crowing, ''I told you so.''</p>
        <p>''This is the Bush budget and the Bush tax cut,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader. And Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York compared the changing fiscal climate to a bad summer movie titled ''Honey, I Shrunk The Surplus.''</p>
        <p>The ''Bush budget, Bush tax cut, Bush economy'' refrain will go hand-in-hand with a concerted Democratic campaign this fall to force Mr. Bush to submit a new budget -- one that reflects the new economic projections and details the politically painful choices he may have to make in response to them.</p>
        <p>How, for example, will he will pay for the military buildup, or expand tax breaks for health insurance, or provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit or increase  education spending if the economy continues to deteriorate?</p>
        <p>Democrats hope that raising these questions will let them seize the initiative in the autumn budget fight that is expected to set the framework for the 2002 battle for control of Congress. Nor do they plan to offer the president their own plan or answers any time soon.</p>
        <p>''It's really best to let him stew,'' said one senior Democratic Senate strategist. ''And it's frankly only fair. Most of us voted against this budget and this tax cut and now we're going to come riding over the hill to save him?''</p>
        <p>To make maximum use of their advantages, however, Democrats will need unity, a consistent message, party discipline and no missteps.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats have a way of stealing defeat from the jaws of victory,'' insists Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ''They don't know when to shut up.''</p>
        <p>And the economy could turn around sooner than most people expect.</p>
        <p>''We're all speculating at this point that it's going to be a long-term downturn,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a Congressional analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute. ''If we're on the cusp of a recovery that begins early next year, Bush will be able to sing the praises of his tax cut and the Democrats will have egg on their face.''</p>
        <p>So as both parties hold their breath and watch the economic indicators, strategists are plotting out all the political scenarios. And there are still a number of ways that Democrats might squander their advantage. Here are a few.</p>
        <p>1. What happened to the party of public investment?</p>
        <p>When President Clinton said ''Save Social Security First'' and railroaded both parties into pledging not to use Social Security taxes for anything other than paying down debt, it was a strategy designed in part to keep Republicans from passing large tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Bush has won his tax cut and the economy is weakening, however, the inviolability of the Social Security trust fund is a brake on spending. And it is the Democrats who want a more robust Medicare prescription drug benefit than Mr. Bush does, the Democrats who are pushing for billions of dollars more for education, the Democrats who are more likely to want money for child care and health care programs.</p>
        <p>On such issues Democrats retain the upper hand. But will they continue to do so if they can't actually get anything done? Even if they take control of Congress in 2002, will they find themselves neutered, without the cash to enact their programs?</p>
        <p>2. Calvin Coolidge Democrats?</p>
        <p>The Democrats' conundrum becomes worse if the country goes into a recession. Some party dissidents are already arguing that an obsession with debt relief and the Social Security trust fund during bad times risks making the Democrats look more like the party of Calvin Coolidge than of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>''I think they are building a box that could be very damaging,'' said Robert L. Borosage, the co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a liberal public policy group. ''If the economy continues to decline,'' he said, ''Democrats should be arguing about unemployment insurance, about special assistance to older workers thrown out of the manufacturing sector, programs for welfare mothers who will be the first ones laid off. Instead what they are arguing is that the president should cut more money out of the budget.''</p>
        <p>3. Where's the beef?</p>
        <p>While they can get away with blaming Mr. Bush for the budget straitjacket for a while, Democrats will eventually have to make their own proposals or else risk looking like mere partisan complainers.</p>
        <p>Congressional Republicans want a cut in the capital gains tax rate, hoping that will stimulate the economy. What are the Democrats offering? No wonder that Mr. Daschle on Friday began speaking of the plight of the unemployed.</p>
        <p>''They're just flapping their gums,'' said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3rd of Virginia, who is in charge of the House Republicans' re-election effort. ''What's their answer? Their answer is to call on Bush to come up with an answer. They have some responsibility too. They control the Senate.''</p>
        <p>But it is far easier to blame Mr. Bush than to unite Democrats around a program of their own. If liberal Democrats push to switch money from the military to domestic programs, the party's southern defense hawks are likely to bolt for fear that Democrats will end up looking like McGovernites.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if Democrats push to roll back some part of Mr. Bush's tax cut, they would need the support of the conservatives and moderates who voted with Mr. Bush in favor of the $1.35 trillion reduction. But not all of them will go along. Senator Zel Miller of Georgia was already scoffing last week at all the talk of a budget crisis and deriding government bureaucrats and spending sprees.</p>
        <p>''We're in a good spot to start out,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. ''But if we fracture and everyone comes out with his own plan, that's our greatest danger.''</p>
        <p>4. Tax and spend Democrats?</p>
        <p>Even the suggestion that the tax cut should be rescinded could open the Democrats up to the charge that they just want to tax and spend. President Clinton erased this vulnerability for his party by advocating a balanced budget and speaking of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction. But during the presidential campaign Mr. Bush effectively lampooned Al Gore as the candidate of big government.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Daschle said there was no point in talking about reducing the tax cut since Mr. Bush would never support the move. And Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, went through all kinds of linguistic gymnastics at a news conference last week.</p>
        <p>He challenged Mr. Bush to submit a new budget, pointing out that Democrats had come up with their own in the spring that called for a smaller tax cut than the president's. Yet he repeatedly dodged questions about whether Democrats wanted to rescind part of the Bush tax cut.</p>
        <p>Asked for the umpteenth time whether he wanted to roll back the tax cut, he told reporters: ''I'll get you a copy of our budget. Read it. It is a good budget. It has the right priorities.''</p>
        <p>By Friday, Mr. Bush was already accusing the Democrats of being big taxers. ''Tax relief is just now making its way in the economy, and there are some, it seems like, who are beginning to say, maybe we ought to raise taxes,'' he said at the White House, vowing he would not ''let anybody pick the pockets of the American taxpayer.''</p>
        <p>Still, at least in Washington right now, everyone thinks it is the Republicans who are in peril, including the Republicans. Witness the Oval Office huddle between Mr. Bush and leaders of his party Friday as unemployment figures surged and Wall Street tumbled.</p>
        <p>Well aware that his father lost an election because he seemed oblivious to bad times, Mr. Bush took time to step out of the Oval Office and proclaim, ''The slowdown is real and it's affecting too many lives and I'm concerned about it.'' His father might have said it differently: ''Message: I care.''</p>
        <p>''Clearly people see the economy in trouble,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. ''And the president is sitting there and he's the guy they look to to lead on these matters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's biggest problem, and the Democrats' biggest advantage, may be Social Security. Polls show that Americans overwhelmingly want surplus Social Security funds to be kept off-limits, and Democrats believe that uncertainty over whether Mr. Bush will leave them alone may eat away at his image, much as his father was hurt when he backed away from his ''no new taxes'' pledge during his own struggle over deficit  reduction.</p>
        <p>MR. BUSH pledged in the campaign and again in his first address to Congress in February that he would preserve the Social Security surplus ''for Social Security and Social Security alone.'' But he has already abandoned a campaign promise on carbon dioxide emissions and changed his position on stem cell research. Might he -- or his party -- risk doing so on Social Security?</p>
        <p>The Democrats will try to exploit such vulnerabilities to take full control of the House and Senate in 2002, and they believe that history and circumstance are on their side. The president's party traditionally loses seats in off years and suffers during economic downturns, and in the Senate, more Republicans than Democrats are likely to retire before the next elections.</p>
        <p>Of course, these scenarios are all hypothetical. This is likely to be a long drawn out budget fight, and its political consequences could surprise everybody.</p>
        <p>''President Bush dug the hole that we're in, but we're in the hole too,'' Mr. Schumer admits.</p>
