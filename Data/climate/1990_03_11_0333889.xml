        <p>LEAD: The beaver, the official mammal of New York, is flourishing so well that it is considered a nuisance in some parts of the state.</p>
        <p>The beaver, the official mammal of New York, is flourishing so well that it is considered a nuisance in some parts of the state.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Department of Environmental Conservation reopened the beaver trapping season in a few areas recently to thin the population.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to balance the costs and benefits of the beaver population,'' said Paul G. Bishop Jr., a senior wildlife biologist in the department.</p>
        <p>The beaver is valued for its fur and for its dams that create wetlands for many birds and animals. But it also chops down trees for food, and its dams in highway culverts can cause flooding.</p>
        <p>The trapping season in New York usually lasts from mid-December to the end of January, except in the Adirondacks, where it continues through March. The extended season will run for a week to three weeks in central, southwestern and eastern New York.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut and New Jersey, the beaver-trapping season ended Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Problems in Populated Areas</p>
        <p>Steven Jackson, a wildlife expert in Connecticut, said beavers had grown in numbers over the years and were a problem in highly populated areas.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, said Brad Holloway, an official in its Bureau of Wildlife Management, the beaver population is relatively stable, but the animals occasionally cause problems by cutting down prize trees or flooding roadways.</p>
        <p>Despite the suburban growth, pollution, acid rain and trappers, the beaver population has doubled in New York in the last 10 years, state statistics show. By aerial surveys, mammal experts estimate there are 70,000 beavers in 14,000 beaver colonies in New York.</p>
        <p>The state's beaver population has fluctuated dramatically. In the 18th and 19th centuries, demand for beaver skins was so heavy - especially for beaver hats in Europe - that the population was nearly wiped out.</p>
        <p>By 1900 the number of beavers in the Adirondack Mountains was down to 15. The state then brought in captured beavers from Ontario and Yellowstone National Park to replenish the species.</p>
        <p>Since then the beaver has found New York congenial. And in 1975 the animal was made the state symbol.</p>
        <p>The state policy is to keep the beaver population at a level that maximizes the good it does for wetlands and minimizes complaints by landowners.</p>
        <p>''We control the population by regulating the trapping season,'' said Gary Parsons, chief of the State Bureau of Wildlife. His agency has divided the state into 19 wildlife management units and has set a season for trapping in each, based on beaver population and impact on human habitation.</p>
        <p>In 1987-88, the state listed 18,660 trappers, who reported taking 21,892 beaver skins. A year's trapping license for a New York resident is $8.50; out-of-staters pay $250.</p>
        <p>Beaver-trapping has declined in recent years because prices for the pelts have fallen, Mr. Bishop said. A large pelt sells for about $35, he said; smaller ones go for as little as $5.</p>
        <p>He said prices declined because the European market for furs has slowed and anti-trapping and anti-fur advocates have stepped up protests.</p>
