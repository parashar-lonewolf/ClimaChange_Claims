        <p>AT Disney's Animal Kingdom, that cricket crawling around in a glass cage is not there for entertainment value: it will soon be dinner for the tarantula sleeping nearby. Crickets are part of the specialized diet for tarantulas, and for birds, snakes and monkeys here. As such, the insects are a tiny part of the highly specialized business of feeding smaller creatures to larger ones.</p>
        <p>Although the revenue is only a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that zoos pay annually to feed their charges, this business is no flyspeck. Its sales are $25 million to $50 million a year.</p>
        <p>In a month, 80,000 custom-grown crickets will be fed to the spiders, birds and reptiles here. So will 160,000 assorted mealworms, night crawlers and wax worms. At zoos from Brookfield, Md., to Phoenix to Fort Worth, animals gobble up 4.4 million crickets and mealworms a year.</p>
        <p>Good customers like Disney and hundreds of zoos and wild-game parks, along with pet stores, bait outlets and specialists who nurse injured birds, are fueling this niche business.</p>
        <p>The industry, though, faces some peculiar problems. Big suppliers are constantly plagued by part-time, backyard entrepreneurs who undercut prices. ''Giant mealworms used to sell for 15 to 20 cents each, and now they are selling 25 for a dollar,'' said Dale Corcoran, a supplier of crickets and worms in Fairfield, Ohio.</p>
        <p>But Clay Ghann, owner of Ghann's Cricket Farm in Augusta, Ga., says he prefers ''to take the high road in the bug market, and our customers are willing to pay more to get the best quality.''</p>
        <p>Millions of crickets are shipped across the country every week, and suppliers must guarantee that they will be alive on arrival. ''It is very important that they are alive,'' said Russ Bassett, who with his brother, John, owns the Bassett Cricket Ranch in Visalia, Calif. ''If they die, it is our responsibility to replace them. Most animals wish to sense movement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bassett ships 100,000 crickets at a time, driving to airports in Los Angeles or San Francisco three times a week. To make sure the bugs are not cooked on the tarmac on summer days, he uses boxes with ventilated screens and cold packs.</p>
        <p>Barbara Toddess, director of nutrition at the Philadelphia Zoo, says it is important that the creatures are in good health. ''If there is a blizzard in Philadelphia, and the crickets are sitting at the airport, they are not going to make it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Particularly important is that the bugs, worms and rodents are not fed anything laden with chemicals. Most suppliers give assurances that their goods are not contaminated.</p>
        <p>Timberline, based in St. Louis, is one of the largest suppliers of crickets, mealworms and fruit wax worms, shipping more than a billion a year. Its 115 employees are constantly dealing with outside insects trying to invade its climate-controlled beds, which cover 110,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>''When you create an environment for insects to reproduce,'' said Todd Goodman, the owner, ''then just about everybody in the neighborhood wants in, but we have methods that prevent those kinds of infestations.'' He would not disclose those methods.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodman and the other larger cricket producers raise them in different sizes. Customers have specific requirements to match the sizes of the mouths of the reptiles and birds that are being fed.</p>
        <p>Because bugs are raised in humid conditions, keeping pests out of their growing boxes is a challenge. ''It is very difficult to keep other insects out of a cricket colony,'' Mr. Ghann said. ''It took us six years, but we are able to create an absolutely pest-free environment.''</p>
        <p>SUPPLIERS of rodents fear protests from animal-rights groups, so they shun publicity. Several companies refused to talk about their work. ''I am concerned about the PETA people sabotaging my operation,'' said one breeder in Texas, who insisted on anonymity, speaking of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</p>
        <p>Debbie Leahy, director for captive and exotic animals at PETA, said: ''We have not looked at the industry that supplies zoos and pet stores. We are more concerned about the exotic animals people buy at pet stores.''</p>
        <p>Many suppliers say demand is growing for ''pinks'' and ''fuzzies,'' terms for baby mice of different ages. These mice sell for as little as 47 cents each.</p>
        <p>Loren Leigh, president of LLL Reptile and Supply in San Diego, buys mice from growers and resells them to zoos and private owners of reptiles. The mice are put to death with carbon dioxide, then frozen and shipped. Zoos and suppliers say it is better to freeze the mice, then thaw them just before they are fed to larger animals.</p>
        <p>''Shipping live animals is very, very tricky, and there are animal welfare issues,'' said Jack Brown, director of the Santa Fe Community College Teaching Zoo, near Gainesville, Fla.</p>
        <p>And with ownership of wild and exotic animals on the rise, suppliers are trying to find new food sources. ''There are 50 to 100 cricket growers, and we are one of the largest, and we have to look at competitive advantages,'' Mr. Bassett said. ''We have been looking at the navel orange worm, which is a soft larvae, but you have to be careful because regulations require you to irradiate them so they cannot reproduce.''</p>
        <p>Zoos are also finding that other animals, like monkeys and foxes, like cricket snacks. That means more hungry mouths to feed.</p>
