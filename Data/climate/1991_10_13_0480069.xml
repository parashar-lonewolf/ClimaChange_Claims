        <p>In a Forum page article on Sept. 29, Donald L. Pevsner proposed raising the 55 mile-an-hour national speed limit on Interstate highways. He argued that the limit, set during the oil crisis of the early 1970's, is retained because it is a source of income for states, insurance companies and makers of radar-detection equipment. He suggested raising the Interstate speed limit to 70 m.p.h. except in congested urban areas and in unsafe terrain.</p>

        <p>In a Forum page article on Sept. 29, Donald L. Pevsner proposed raising the 55 mile-an-hour national speed limit on Interstate highways. He argued that the limit, set during the oil crisis of the early 1970's, is retained because it is a source of income for states, insurance companies and makers of radar-detection equipment. He suggested raising the Interstate speed limit to 70 m.p.h. except in congested urban areas and in unsafe terrain.</p>
        <p>Some of the letters received in response follow.</p>
        <p>What About the Future?</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I quite often drive the Interstates and find very few drivers "poking along" at 55 m.p.h. The reality is that most cars -- and trucks -- are moving along at just about 65 in what turns out to be a quite uniform flow of vehicles. Further, the drivers go by the parked state police at 65 m.p.h., with scarcely a flick of the taillights. It is clear that the police are so frustrated by the mass violation that they have little choice but to concentrate on nabbing the sports cars tooling along at 70, 75 or faster.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pevsner says: "There is no oil shortage in the world today, nor does any responsible official predict one." But any official who says there will be no oil shortage in the future is simply just not responsible. There is a very definite limit on fossil fuels on this planet. It is only a matter of time before it seriously affects, if not our children, surely their children. So when are we going to think of future drivers instead of ourselves?
