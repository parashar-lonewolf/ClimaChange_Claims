        <p>THE voice on Shea Stadium's public-address system had a spooky alien squeakiness.</p>
        <p>''Join us as we play baseball in the year 2021,'' the voice announced. ''Your favorite team, the Mercury Mets, will do intergalactic battle with the Pirates of planet Pittsburgh.''</p>
        <p>Sorry, this was not the next Star Wars movie; this was a one-night futuristic fashion show.</p>
        <p>For the occasion, the Mets wore black Mercury Mets shirts with silver lettering on the front, silver numbers and names (vertically) on the back and black caps with the Mercury symbol.</p>
        <p>All this was part of Major League Baseball's silly surrender to the Century 21 realtors' promotion that the Yankees, thankfully, declined to join along with the Dodgers, the Cubs and four other clubs.</p>
        <p>It was known as ''Turn the Clock Ahead Night'' to 2021, but the Mercury Mets were hoping to turn the clock back to 1988: the last time their New York ancestors finished in first place.</p>
        <p>If the Mercury Mets had won and the Braves had lost in Atlanta, the Mets would have hopped into first place in the National League East by one-half game. But the Mercury Mets lost, 5-1, and the Braves won. So much for those silver-and-black shirts. You could almost hear the 36,337 fans grumbling, ''They never shoulda changed the uniform.''</p>
        <p>Burn them. Better yet, put them on a spaceship to Mercury.</p>
        <p>The silver-and-black shirts, which resembled an Oakland Raiders tear-away jersey that had been torn away, were really a tribute to Mercury, the Roman god of merchandise and merchants. Some were raffled off last night for Easter Seals and the Mets Foundation. Even some Mets' players were wondering if they could retain the shirts.</p>
        <p>''Are we keeping these?'' Brian McRae asked. ''Do they think we're just wearing these and giving them back? Not adding them to our collection?''</p>
        <p>Rickey Henderson, who is playing lately as if he would still be leading off in 2021, watched McRae tuck his shirt into his pants.</p>
        <p>''You got to wear it outside,'' Henderson said. ''The future is, you got to wear it outside. We'll look like Bozo the Clown out there.''</p>
        <p>In their red, gold and black shirts, the Pirates did look like all those circus clowns that keep hopping out of a Volkswagen.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the futuristic fashion, the video screen showed Mets players with green faces or space helmets. Henderson appeared there with long pointed ears and a third eye in the middle of his forehead. But the Mets' manager, Bobby Valentine, thought the silver-and-black shirts showed baseball's ''progressive'' thinking.</p>
        <p>If this was progress, in 2021 baseball will be in more trouble than it was after the 1994 strike that canceled that year's World Series.</p>
        <p>The Mets already led the big leagues in uniforms anyway -- all white, all white with pinstripes, black shirts with white pants at Shea; all gray, black shirts with gray pants on the road. Each with a variety of caps and a mixture of orange, blue and black lettering.</p>
        <p>But as goofy as last night's uniforms appeared, don't be surprised if they're in style in 2021 in the natural evolution of baseball fashion.</p>
        <p>Over the last 100 years, as documented in Marc Okkonen's ''Baseball Uniforms of the 20th Century'' (Sterling, 1991), home whites and road grays with or without pinstripes have been the standard for most teams. But every so often solid colors intruded. As long ago as 1901, the Baltimore Orioles' road uniforms were black with orange trim. The 1963 Kansas City Athletics introduced green-and-gold shirts.</p>
        <p>Baseball's tailors always searched for more comfortable fabrics. Imagine wearing those old baggy wool uniforms in the summer heat of St. Louis, as the Gas House Gang Cardinals did in 1934, or even wool-and-orlon uniforms until the lighter double-knits arrived in the early 70's. In their 1944 night games, the Dodgers wore white satin at home, blue satin on the road. Last night's shirts were polyester.</p>
        <p>The 1976 White Sox wore shorts, but only for that one season; the players didn't like them. That was around the time when stockings virtually vanished as pants drooped longer and longer.</p>
        <p>But in 2021, if it comes to a choice between last night's fashions and global warming, shorts might get another chance.</p>
