        <p>President Bush announced on Monday that he had directed his administration to begin the long process of establishing higher fuel efficiency standards for new cars.</p>
        <p>But officials said that it was unclear if at the end of that process Mr. Bush would take it upon himself to raise the gas mileage of the nation's automobiles, which has not significantly increased in decades. And Mr. Bush, speaking in the Rose Garden on Monday afternoon, said nothing would be put into effect until the regulatory process was completed at the end of 2008, just weeks before the end of his term.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups, which have long called for substantial increases in the government-mandated fuel standards, expressed skepticism that the administration would enact new standards without Congressional action, and dissatisfaction that Mr. Bush had not offered specifics. And Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, called the announcement ''a stall tactic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's announcement came during a period of new headlines about resurgent gasoline prices, as well as international and domestic political pressure to control American emissions of heat-trapping gases from burning petroleum and other fossil fuels. It comes six weeks after the Supreme Court, rebuffing the administration's arguments, ruled in favor of states that were seeking new federal controls on these emissions from automobiles.</p>
        <p>The court found on April 2 that carbon dioxide, the principal heat-trapping gas, is a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and must be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency unless the agency scientifically determines that it does not contribute to climate change or that action is not necessary. A growing scientific consensus holds that carbon dioxide emissions are a serious problem that ought to be addressed urgently.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. administrator, Stephen Johnson, said during a teleconference with reporters on Monday that the administration was not arguing otherwise. ''We accept the Supreme Court's decision,'' Mr. Johnson said, hailing what he said was ''the first regulatory step to craft a proposal to control greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush began the process with an executive order directing the E.P.A., the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to explore regulatory options to enact a proposal he announced in his State of the Union address earlier, which set a goal of reducing the projected growth of oil consumption within 10 years to a level 20 percent lower than current forecasts. Officials have expressed frustration that Congress has not enacted his plan, based on efficiency standards as well as incentives for alternative fuels, which environmentalists have harshly criticized as insufficient.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said on Monday that he still preferred Congressional action to executive action and that his officials would ''work with Congress to pass the 20-in-10 bill.'' He said he had directed his cabinet secretaries to complete the regulatory process by the end of 2008 and to ''evaluate the benefits and costs before they put forth the new regulation.''</p>
        <p>The president has opposed setting across-the-board standards of the kind that Congress imposed decades ago, preferring flexibility to account for vehicle size and safety specifications, said Scott Stanzel, a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, said in a statement that the Senate would move forward with its own proposals, which include raising average passenger car fuel standards to 35 miles per gallon over 10 years from 25 m.p.g.. But, he said of the president, ''if he brings forward proposals that make legal, economic and environmental sense, we will work with him as we legislate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, of the E.P.A., said that if the administration moved forward with the new rules, they would go into effect by the end of 2008.</p>
        <p>Officials said the review would also consider regulatory avenues toward increasing the production of alternative and renewable fuels to 35 billion gallons a year, which would be significantly above the current mandate.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates said that taking many months to propose new rules, receive public comment and issue them in final form was reasonable. But they said Monday's announcement gave them no reason to abandon their doubts about the probable result.</p>
        <p>''This really amounts to saying, 'Trust us, we're doing something,' '' said David Doniger, policy director for the climate center of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which was a party to the Supreme Court case. ''It's a clever effort, maybe a half-clever effort, to slip out of a corner. We haven't been promised any specific reduction in global warming pollution, or any specific increase in the efficiency in cars.''</p>
        <p>He said the president's directive seemed to limit the E.P.A.'s flexibility by requiring that it act with sister agencies, meaning, ''they can only walk as fast as the slowest one of them.''</p>
        <p>Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a public interest group, criticized the president's plan for relying on his ''20-in-10'' proposal as a starting point because of its large reliance on alternative fuels, which ''opens the door for coal-to-liquids based fuel, which has the potential to emit more than twice as much carbon dioxide as gasoline.''</p>
        <p>She called on Congress to set standards legislatively.</p>
        <p>Arguments in Mileage Lawsuit  By The New York Times</p>
        <p>SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 -- Lawyers representing California and 10 other states gave arguments here on Monday in a lawsuit intended to force the government to increase gas mileage requirements for minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed in November, asks the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to force the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to conduct an environmental impact study of fuel efficiency standards announced in April 2006. Those rules, which require automakers to act by 2010, raised fuel efficiency requirements by a little over a mile per gallon.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Jerry Brown of California said the rules failed to take into account how man-made pollution affected the environment, as well as ignored political instability in the Middle East and the development of newer, cleaner fuels.</p>
        <p>''They didn't consider global warming; they didn't consider alternative technologies; therefore they didn't do their job,'' said Mr. Brown, standing on the steps of the courthouse. ''It doesn't make any sense from a science point of view or a homeland security point of view.''</p>
        <p>Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said the department had no comment.</p>
