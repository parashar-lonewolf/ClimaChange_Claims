        <p>Dr. Marye Anne Fox was a science adviser to George W. Bush when he was governor of Texas. So in March, when she was called to Washington for an interview, the rumor mill had her all but installed as the new White House science adviser.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Fox, a chemist, was uninterested, federal officials said. ''There were too many restrictions,'' one recalled. ''They were saying, 'Hey, be in the president's office, but don't do anything.''</p>
        <p>For specialists worried about the fate of science in the Bush administration, the continuing lack of a presidential science adviser symbolizes what they see as a troubling lack of interest in science and research.</p>
        <p>The administration's proposed spending on science for next year has far more decreases than increases, key leadership positions are unfilled and grumbling has reached new heights. Even Republican leaders are criticizing some of the budget cuts as dangerous for the nation's well-being.</p>
        <p>In President Bush's budget proposal for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, research spending, after inflation, is down at Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, Energy, Education, the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Projection Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The main winners are health and defense.</p>
        <p>Critics say some cuts make no sense, given the administration's own priorities and the problems it is confronting. Take the 11 percent reduction for the federal geologists who aid the hunt for fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>''The year of a power-production crisis seems an odd time for a cutback,'' said Donald Kennedy, the editor of the journal Science. The administration also proposes to cut research spending for alternative energy sources and energy conservation.</p>
        <p>To be sure, scientists regularly grumble that the government is not spending enough on research, and many of the administration's sharpest critics would stand to benefit from increased support for research. Also, previous administrations have occasionally left major science posts unfilled in their early months.</p>
        <p>But perhaps because science research budgets enjoyed robust expansion in the Clinton years, scientific leaders are now expressing an unusual sense of dismay. They have also criticized the administration's early actions on climate, the environment, antimissile defense and toxic chemicals, saying good science advice could have averted missteps.</p>
        <p>For their part, administration officials defend their actions, appointments and budgets as sound. The scientists who complain, they say, are often just angling for money or disagreeing about policy.</p>
        <p>''Science is something the administration cares about,'' Richard Russell, staff director of the White House science office, said in an interview. The overall budget is up 6 percent, he said. ''That's significant,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But critics of the administration's research budget, including influential Republicans in Congress, disagree, saying the 6 percent figure ignores inflation and promotes health and defense research at the expense of hundreds of other efforts.</p>
        <p>Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican of New York, who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said recently that the administration's overall science budgets were too low and that some proposed cuts left him ''very disturbed.'' He singled out those planned for the Energy Department (4.5 percent) and the National Science Foundation (1.6 percent), which is the main conduit of government support for civilian basic research in the physical sciences.</p>
        <p>And Dr. Fox, who became chancellor of North Carolina State University in 1998 after working at the University of Texas for two decades, added her own voice to the warnings soon after her White House visit. ''Without a major investment,'' she wrote in The News and Observer of Raleigh, ''we should expect innovation, and with it our competitive edge, to shift overseas.''</p>
        <p>Defenders of the administration say the budget situation has altered in recent years because corporate America is putting so much money into research and development. This year, the private sector is expected to spend $180 billion -- about twice what Washington does.</p>
        <p>The Bush White House hails the shift, as do some of its vigorous supporters. Dr. Edward E. David, President Richard M. Nixon's science adviser and a former head of Exxon research, said the change meant that the president's science office should become a ''window on the private sector,'' not, as it has been, a guiding force behind federal research.</p>
        <p>But many other experts disagree. They say corporations focus largely on near-term goals -- projects that can be expected to turn into moneymakers in relatively short order -- rather than the long-range, blue sky research that has produced some of the most important breakthroughs in physics, medicine, energy and understanding the universe.</p>
        <p>Also, they note, corporations cannot necessarily be relied upon to maintain research budgets in economic downturns.</p>
        <p>Dr. D. Allan Bromley, a Yale physicist, who was White House science adviser for President Bush's father, has all but ignored the industry argument in leading calls for raising the federal research budget.</p>
        <p>''No science, no surplus,'' he wrote in an Op-Ed article for The New York Times on March 9. ''It's that simple.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bromley and Dr. David have clashed on the topic. ''I didn't think that was logical or rational,'' Dr. David said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences, the two men recently joined to lobby the White House when rumors spread that its science office was to be killed or left empty. Dr. Bromley said he had written to both President Bush and his father.</p>
        <p>''We succeeded, I believe,'' he told a symposium this month at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in observation of the 25th anniversary of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. In an interview, he said White House staff members had assured him the office would be maintained.</p>
        <p>Still, as of yet, there is no presidential science adviser, no commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, no head of the National Institutes of Health and no heads of science at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Departments of Energy and Agriculture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell, the science office staff director, said the staffing situation was fairly normal for this stage of a new administration and that the president had moved rapidly on an important post, when in late March he named E. Floyd Kvamme, a businessman with industry experience at Apple Computer and National Semiconductor, to be co-chairman of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. This group aids the science adviser in evaluating issues for the president.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the premier spots,'' Mr. Russell said, adding that the committee of private experts was ''the single best conduit to the president from the nonacademic sector.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Charles M. Vest, the president of M.I.T., told the symposium recently that the administration's budget was ''dangerously lopsided'' toward health and urged more emphasis on nonmedical basic science, engineering research and advanced education.</p>
        <p>''When the most interesting ideas are emerging at the surprising overlaps and intersections between previously unrelated fields,'' Dr. Vest said, ''that unbalanced investment represents a serious strategic error.''</p>
        <p>John E. Porter, who represented Illinois in the House for 21 years and helped win financing increases for biomedical research, told the group that the lack of a presidential science adviser at this point meant that the Bush administration had inadequate planning advice for two budgets, 2002 and 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boehlert, the House Science Committee chairman, said the picture, though bleak, was bound to get better because support for science remained strong in the administration and Congress. Friends of science will improve the proposed budget before it is finally adopted, he said.</p>
        <p>''These numbers are going to be better -- most likely, a little better this year, and a lot better next year,'' he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science recently.</p>
        <p>He said the current figures did not reflect administration hostility toward science but rather a sense of drift, because science played no major role in Mr. Bush's presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>He urged scientists to speak out in order to encourage a renewed commitment and to reverse the downward spiral. Complacency, he added, is ''a recipe for failure.''</p>
