        <p>I had wanted to visit the Meadowlands for years. Every time I had driven on the New Jersey Turnpike I had glimpsed these marshes, wondered about what was dumped there and how the egrets and herons you can see from the highway were managing to thrive.</p>
        <p>A little more than a week ago, having driven past one restoration project with an appealing mix of open bays and winding creeks, I finally decided it was time to visit the Meadowlands. So I took a canoe trip and a short walking tour of one of its parks.</p>
        <p>Walking along a pathway through a marsh at Richard W. DeKorte Park in Lyndhurst, N.J., listening to insects almost as loud as the planes overhead, I saw in the distance the twin towers of the World Trade Center rising above the marsh grass and reeds.</p>
        <p>There is always a thrill to finding bits of the natural world close to Manhattan. The pleasure seems almost illicit. One intrepid traveler, Robert Sullivan, wrote a wonderful book, ''The Meadowlands'' (Scribner, 1998), in which he played the Meriwether Lewis of Secaucus and its environs. And since the twin towers have always loomed so large, suggesting how inescapable the world of getting and spending is, they provided a particular frisson.</p>
        <p>I had escaped the buzz of commerce for the buzz of insects. I was one with the ducks and diamondback terrapins.</p>
        <p>A week later, everything has changed. The towers that offered such a dramatic contrast are gone. As the voices on television and radio tell me, and as I can feel myself, nothing will be quite the same from now on. It is now impossible to recover the sensation of pleasure I had in savoring the contrast of quiet marsh and bustling city. I've thought that canoeing and hiking can ease a soul troubled by too much work and too many boom boxes. But in the wake of carnage, they are small solace.</p>
        <p>What can be said about saltwater cordgrass in the same week that the World Trade Center was destroyed? Not a word, if you put the two together.</p>
        <p>It is still a small wonder, almost a natural miracle in fact, that there are parks in the Meadowlands, that parts of the marsh, at least, are peaceful and pleasant. And sooner or later, perhaps sooner, people will start thinking about where to walk or canoe and will want to go to Laurel Hill Park in Secaucus and rent canoes from the Hackensack Riverkeeper's canoe project, or find a way out to one of the bays to count migrating waterfowl.</p>
        <p>The problem lies in the contrast I was so quick to savor, an invented contrast, really, imposed on a perfectly real marsh.</p>
        <p>Nature itself, the romantic idea of an unspoiled world separate from human beings, is a cultural invention that flourished once people lived in cities and could be far enough away from forests and fens to idealize them.</p>
        <p>The current fashion is for natural disasters. My sense is that the enthusiastic response to ''Into Thin Air'' and ''The Perfect Storm,'' among others, suggests a discomfort with the extent of human power. If human beings are indeed ready and able to destroy the planet, how reassuring to experience, from one's armchair, the wrath of the mountains or the sea.</p>
        <p>This is not all imagination and metaphor, of course. There are indeed PCB's in the Hudson River. Automobiles do indeed spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. For the health of the planet, and ourselves, it makes perfect practical sense to have fewer waste dumps, more fish and plants and healthy wetlands.</p>
        <p>But there are fantasies operating as well. When Bill McKibben wrote ''The End of Nature'' in 1989, he was claiming the death of an idea as much as the real end of limits to the reach of human influence. The news was as uncomfortable as the title, and tales of how Everest or wind and water can still kill are counter-parables of a sort. Nature can't be dead yet. Look at its indifference to human life. Look how it flicks us aside.</p>
        <p>It's a minor corollary to frame the reclamation of a marsh in the shadow of a great city as a natural rebellion. There is no great storm here, just a myriad of small Davids -- hermit crabs and muskrats and dragonflies and fish -- all thumbing their noses, or flicking their antennae, at the urban Goliath.</p>
        <p>Still, you have to feel powerful to be titillated by even a small revolution. In the presence of overwhelming grief, imagining an uprising, however small, tastes sour.</p>
        <p>But if the contrast is a spurious one, an unwarranted trope, then perhaps something can be said about cordgrass. It is, after all, human beings who nearly destroyed and have tried to revive the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>It's the work of the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission and environmentalists that brought about the closing of most of the dumps and the end of the nightmare of the late 1960's, when underground waste fires sent smoke drifting over the marsh reeds.</p>
        <p>People, not nature, covered a hill of waste with recycled plastic and planted it so that I could hunt Monarch butterflies with my camera. People made a path into the marsh that you could roll down in a wheelchair to watch the herons feed.</p>
        <p>The Meadowlands is not a wilderness. It will never be pristine again. And it is not the planet in triumph. But I talked to Dr. Kirk Barrett, head of a cooperative research center run by the Meadowlands Commission and Rutgers University. And he said that while researchers were still trying to learn more about how healthy the marshes are, the anecdotal evidence is that the fish are ''abundant, if not diverse,'' and there seems to be plenty of other wildlife around. That's good, quite unromantic news.</p>
        <p>I don't think I'll be back to Richard W. DeKorte Park soon. I would see what was missing when I walked into the marsh.</p>
        <p>But that was in the eye of the beholder, part of my view and my viewpoint. That was a writer's imposition, like the trick of a telephoto lens, to put the revived Meadowlands right up against the city skyline.</p>
        <p>They don't need to stand against each other. Perhaps what can be said about cordgrass, and egrets, and everything else in the marsh, in the face of overwhelming anguish, is simply: the two are not connected.</p>
        <p>We may not care right now. This weekend may not be the time for canoeing. But it's still good to know the Meadowlands are doing better. We'll want them later on.</p>
