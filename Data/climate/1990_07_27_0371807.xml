        <p>LEAD: Although 24-year-old Adrienne Shelly and 29-year-old Robert Burke are making their screen debuts in Hal Hartley's film ''The Unbelievable Truth,'' both actors seem to have known their characters inside out before even reading the script.</p>
        <p>Although 24-year-old Adrienne Shelly and 29-year-old Robert Burke are making their screen debuts in Hal Hartley's film ''The Unbelievable Truth,'' both actors seem to have known their characters inside out before even reading the script.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Shelly was a teen-ager, she made a deal with her parents. She agreed to go to college and earn a sensible degree in something other than theater so that she would have something to fall back on if her acting career did not work out. But midway through her junior year as a communications major, Ms. Shelly lost patience with student life and asked her parents to let her out of the bargain. She moved to Manhattan, found a small apartment in Chelsea and began working in the theater.</p>
        <p>Like Audry, the character she plays in Mr. Hartley's critically acclaimed film, Ms. Shelly realized that deals can be a hindrance instead of help in achieving goals. Audry is a disaffected, hardhearted high-school senior who arranges elaborate deals with her father to combat the ennui she feels in her sleepy hometown on Long Island. She is convinced that the world is going to end, so she agrees to attend Harvard only if her father donates money to a coalition for nuclear disarmament. When a fast-talking fashion photographer boasts that he can make Audry a wealthy model, her father renegotiates the college deal out of greed. Then Audry falls for Josh (Mr. Burke), a black-garbed stranger with a shadowy past, who is returning home after several years in prison.</p>
        <p>Cynical yet Vulnerable</p>
        <p>''Josh is the only person in the whole film who doesn't let Audry get away with her behavior, and I think that's what attracts her to him,'' Ms. Shelly said in a recent interview at a Manhattan coffee shop. ''The way I see it is that love can put an end to this bureaucracy people go through in their relationships. But it can't blind you to the fact that maybe there are bombs, there are problems and the ozone layer is depleting.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shelly, who like Audry grew up on Long Island, lends her character the brash, overconfident grandeur of a cynical teen-ager yet reveals a stark vulnerability as the film progresses. In a long confrontation scene with Josh, Audry confesses her feelings without knowing she has a giant smear of lipstick across her cheek. ''That's my favorite scene in the movie,'' Ms. Shelly said with a laugh. ''It's very like me to have something like that happen.''</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Shelly has been offered other film work, she said she chose ''The Unbelievable Truth'' as her feature debut partly out of empathy with Audry's sense of displacement. ''I did a lot of acting when I was a child,'' she said. ''I was very shy - the kind of kid who ran into a corner and cried on parents' visiting day.''</p>
        <p>While growing up, she attended several performing-arts camps, then moved into professional stock theater when she was 15. Between her work on ''The Unbelievable Truth'' and a starring role in Mr. Hartley's second film, ''Trust'' (to be released next year), she founded her own theater company, Missing Children, whose premiere production will open next month at the Perry Street Theater in the West Village. ''Theater represents to me this phenomenon in juxtaposition to real life, where there are all these imposed guidelines,'' she said. ''Ever since I was little, it never seemed fair that I had to live by these rules. Why did I have to go to sleep just because it was dark? I never liked those guidelines. In theater you don't have to live by them.''</p>
        <p>Acting and Life</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke shares Ms. Shelly's disrespect for doing things the conventional way. Although he said he has appeared in ''thousands of performances'' throughout high school and college and was regarded as one of the most promising actors in his class at the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., he left acting for several years after graduating from college. His departure was partly motivated by the death of his father, to whom he was very close. ''I was meeting people and they were, like, 'He's so brooding; he's so angry,' '' he said. ''And I was angry. I was sad.'' But Mr. Burke was also disenchanted with the pressures and personal economics of professional acting. ''I just always wanted to take my time with this whole nonsense,'' he said recently. ''I saw other people slamming themselves against a wall. I respect them for their tenacity and resilience, but I'm not in the big rush.''</p>
        <p>He taught in an experimental education program for three and a half years, then took up carpentry. The break from acting helped him, he said. ''It got rid of the acting voice and the acting speech. It gave me a life and life experiences.''</p>
        <p>A first-generation Irish-American who grew up in Manhattan and on Long Island, Mr. Burke had nearly given up on the idea of returning to acting when he received a call from Mr. Hartley about the role of Josh. ''I knew the character would give me the debt, and now he's returning to the only place he knows. He's a character who has been rehabilitated. Josh doesn't blow up. He doesn't have any catharsis. He won't get angry because perhaps he'll skip right to rage.''</p>
        <p>In the film, every move Mr. Burke makes is cautious, restrained, contained by the stigma of being an ex-convict. Even when he doesn't move a muscle, his face is thoughtful, grim. ''The interiority of the character -there is that interiority in me,'' he said. ''It was easy in one respect to play that part after taking years off of acting. It was like a little self-imposed exile. And Josh coming out of prison and everything - I say sometimes that my exile was completely transferable to the charcter.''</p>
        <p>''I'm a lot more cautious now, a lot quieter,'' he said. ''I didn't want Josh to be sentimental. I wanted him to be above that. There is a transcending quality in the acceptance of someone's life.''</p>
