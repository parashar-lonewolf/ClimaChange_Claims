        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is more than two years since Sherwood Rowland, a pioneer in determining the role of chlorofluorocarbons in ozone layer destruction, made the elementary point that ''greenhouse warming and ozone depletion will occur in the same atmosphere and will perturb one another.'' Yet the two are still treated as unrelated to each other, as illustrated in your ''Governments Start Preparing for Global Warming Disasters'' (Science Times, Nov. 14).</p>
        <p>On developing new crops, you note that what can be done depends on the rate of greenhouse warming, but you fail to note that crop destruction can be greatly speeded by ozone depletion. In March 1988, you quoted Thomas Coohill, president of the American Society of Photobiology, on the subject of the Antarctic ozone ''hole'': ''On a global scale the most significant thing is the destruction of plants. If you start tampering with the layer of ozone that quickly, you don't have enough time to evolve protecting mechanisms.''</p>
        <p>Among the steps to ward off global warming, you note that ''the electric power industry is planning to meet the increase in the demand for power for air-conditioners.'' But this would only make matters worse. The new flood of chlorofluorocarbons released would not only speed up the destruction of the ozone layer, but also increase the rate of global warming.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it would be of no help to the masses of people, in this country and throughout the world, who cannot afford air-conditioning. In short, this is a false and elitist vision.  KENNETH NEILL CAMERON  New York, Nov. 14, 1989</p>
