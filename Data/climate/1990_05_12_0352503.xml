        <p>LEAD: The Peabody Coal Company received a $1.25 billion bid yesterday from Amax Inc., the large New York metals and mining company.</p>
        <p>The Peabody Coal Company received a $1.25 billion bid yesterday from Amax Inc., the large New York metals and mining company.</p>
        <p>Amax is now competing with Hanson P.L.C. of Britain for control of Peabody. In March, Newmont Mining agreed to sell its 55 percent stake in Peabody to Hanson for $715 million. Only a month earlier, Hanson bought its 45 percent stake, which had been jointly owned by three companies, Boeing, Bechtel Investments and Eastern Enterprises, for $504 million.</p>
        <p>Hanson responded to the Amax bid by increasing its offer for the 55 percent stake to $725.6 million.</p>
        <p>The offer by Amax includes $718 million for Newmont's 55 percent stake and $532 million for 45 percent of the company that is owned by Hanson of Britain. The bid for the larger stake is proportionately higher because it includes a premium for control of the company.</p>
        <p>A Nice Fit</p>
        <p>Amax, the nation's third-largest coal producer, said its bid was a move to expand its presence in the coal business. ''We felt that Peabody would fit very nicely into our long-range strategy,'' said Mitchell Badler, a spokesman for Amax. ''We are trying to increase our position in low-sulfur coal and broaden our product line.''</p>
        <p>Hanson's agreement with Newmont carried a stipulation that any other party would be allowed to make a competing bid for the entire company.</p>
        <p>''We are now in an auction process,'' said James F. Hill, a spokesman for Newmont. ''Our agreement with Hanson stipulated that there would be an opening for a bid for the entire company. And Hanson agreed that it would sell its 45 percent stake if a higher bid came in. Of course, Hanson always has the right to make a competitive offer.''</p>
        <p>Bids Welcomed</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill said Newmont would also welcome bids from other parties. ''Peabody Coal is now available for anyone who wants to buy the company,'' Mr. Hill said.</p>
        <p>Sir Gordon White, chairman of Hanson's United States affiliate, Hanson Industries, said the Amax offer ''reinforces our confidence in our initial valuation of Peabody.'' Sir Gordon added, ''Although their bid would benefit Hanson by providing a premium for the stake which we already own, we are determined to complete our acquisition of Peabody.''</p>
        <p>It was not immediately clear whether a bidding war would ensue for the giant coal company. Mr. Badler said yesterday that Amax's bid for Peabody ''represents what we thought was a fair value for Peabody'' and he declined to comment on whether there would be a higher bid. Allen Born, Amax's chairman, was attending an annual meeting of the company's gold subsidiary and was unavilable to comment.</p>
        <p>Several analysts said Amax would be likely to increase its bid slightly in the coming week. But they added that Amax would be unlikely to continue bidding. ''I'm not sure who has more staying power in this,'' said Jeffrey F. Miller, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chiacgo. ''Amax has made smaller acquisitions in coal before this and they clearly want to expand their coal business. But I'm not sure how high Amax would be willing to go.''</p>
        <p>Amax last year was outbid by Trelleborg A.B., the Swedish mining company, to win control of Falconbridge Ltd., a major producer of nickel, copper and zinc and Canada's fourth-largest mining concern. Amax's refusal to enter a protracted bidding competition for Falconbridge has led many analysts to speculate that the company might make just one higher bid for Peabody Coal.</p>
        <p>Peabody produces 9 percent of the coal mined in the United States. It produced 87 million tons last year and has reserves of 8.7 billion tons. The company had pretax earnings of $136.5 million last year, down slightly from $138 million in 1988.</p>
        <p>Peabody has been an attractive target because of its reputation in the industry for repositioning itself into a low-sulfur coal producer that would have fewer of the environmental problems associated with medium- and high-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>For the last three years, Newmont has been seeking to reduce $2 billion in debt from a special dividend it paid to shareholders to thwart a takeover attempt by T. Boone Pickens, the investor. Newmont attempted a recapitalization plan for Peabody last year but abandoned it because of what it termed uncertainties resulting from a coal miners' strike and the Bush Administration's proposals to combat acid rain.</p>
