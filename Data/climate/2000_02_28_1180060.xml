        <p>Former Senator Bill Bradley never seems to hit his oratorical stride until about midafternoon. So it was shocking to see him stroll into an ornate hotel lobby packed with supporters at 9:30 a.m. recently and bellow with unusual verve, ''Good morning, Spokane!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley then gave one of the punchiest, most compelling stump speeches of his campaign. Afterward, the crowd enveloped him as he pecked cheeks, signed autographs and grasped every hand until none were left. Eileen Davis was so moved by the event that tears welled in her eyes as she shook his hand. ''Thank you for your charisma,'' she said, using a word not often applied to the staid and stoic insurgent.</p>
        <p>Though he trails badly in most polls, is surrounded by advisers resigned to his defeat and is opposed at every turn by his own party's establishment, Mr. Bradley of New Jersey  is still managing to run a spirited campaign in this state, where he has staked his hopes on a victory in Tuesday's nonbinding primary.</p>
        <p>With a lightness that had been notably missing in recent weeks, Mr. Bradley has been working harder than ever at the small gestures of winning votes: tossing jelly doughnuts to workers on a picket line in Spokane, dishing chili to supporters in downtown Seattle, patiently enduring hours of questions from undecided voters at late-night town meetings. He has even called the reporters who cover his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore, playfully cajoling them to write about him.</p>
        <p>Through it all, Mr. Bradley has shown few signs that he feels defeated, despite Mr. Gore's double-digit lead in most polls. At a moment when other politicians might become frantic or sullen, he has remained quintessentially himself: calm, self-possessed, almost aggressively unruffled.</p>
        <p>''Every candidate creates his own problems,'' said Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who stumped with Mr. Bradley here on Saturday. ''But when it comes to all the problems beyond his control, he's suffering them very well.''</p>
        <p>There certainly have been more than enough problems to get him down, not the least of which has been the continuing ability of the Republican maverick, Senator John McCain, to grab attention from his campaign. Yet Mr. Bradley has more often than not displayed the loose, jokey informality that marked his style months ago, when things seemed less dire.</p>
        <p>Last week, for instance, his staff instructed him to pose alone for photographers on a pier overlooking Puget Sound and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains. Pointing with mock solemnity at the scene, he wryly declared, ''That's water.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, he joked with reporters: ''That would be considered a manufactured moment.'' And when he was introduced to an environmental activist dressed in a salmon suit, he told her, ''Keep on swimming.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Mr. Bradley has even donned clothes to express his more unbuttoned mood, replacing his rumpled blue and gray suits with green or brown V-neck sweaters, open-collar shirts and khaki pants.</p>
        <p>His energy level can fluctuate with the size and enthusiasm of a crowd, and he has had some unexpectedly large ones here. On Friday, more than 1,200 people packed into a ferry terminal in Bellingham to hear him make the kind of upbeat speech that typified his events last fall. He was animated and engaging and the crowd responded, laughing at his well-worn jokes and applauding raucously at the right moments.</p>
        <p>''He seems the most presidential, the most dignified of the candidates,'' Kris Berger, 35, said after the speech.</p>
        <p>The following morning in Spokane, Mr. Bradley gave a stump speech abundantly salted with the kinds of punchy applause lines his speeches have often lacked.</p>
        <p>''What can we do, what must we do, to leave no one behind?'' he asked a hushed room. ''The people of Spokane who are earning under $14,000 a year work too hard, care too much, deserve more, and we're going to get them more.''</p>
        <p>Still, there have been lost moments. On Saturday, he was to give a speech laying out the differences between his health care plan and Mr. Gore's outside a Seattle health clinic. The address was as sharp and clear as any Mr. Bradley has given on the subject. But in the cold drizzle, only about 60 people came out, despite his staff's last-minute efforts to round up people on the street. And a visibly disappointed Mr. Bradley delivered his prepared text in a stiff monotone.</p>
        <p>Later that night, Mr. Bradley gave a rendition of his standard speech on race relations to the Seattle chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. that failed to even mention his hosts. Even some of his supporters in the half-filled banquet hall found his performance listless.</p>
        <p>''I detected that maybe he was a bit tired,'' said Hubert Sims, a 50-year-old banker who said he planned to vote for Mr. Bradley.</p>
        <p>But more often than not, Mr. Bradley has seemed energized by his hunt for votes. At a town meeting at Everett Community College on Friday, he was as patient as a town councilman answering dozens of questions and more than a few complaints, including one from a student who said federal budget cuts had worsened his urinary tract infections.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, he faced a more contentious crowd at Evergreen College, known as a bastion of student radicalism, where he was peppered with questions about trade policy, global warming, American Indian rights and the price of a gallon of milk. (''About $1.68,'' he answered.)</p>
        <p>The students booed when he said he opposed legalizing drugs and hissed when he said he supported sanctions against Iraq. But he took more questions than his staff wanted him to, and won the respect of more than a few in the audience.</p>
        <p>''I thought he was really good,'' said Richard Myers, 20, a junior. ''This is a difficult crowd to handle and he did a good job.'' Still, Mr. Bradley did not quite close the deal with Mr. Myers, who said he might vote for Ralph Nader on the Green Party line.</p>
        <p>Though his days are packed with events, Mr. Bradley still tries to maintain the sort of loping pace that he seems to find more comfortable. This morning, after giving a speech on race relations before more than 500 parishioners at an African Methodist Episcopal church in Seattle, Mr. Bradley remained in his pew to watch a play about slavery, even though he was scheduled to be at another event.</p>
        <p>When an usher came by to ask if he was ready to go, Mr. Bradley simply signaled to her with his hand: Wait.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley, who can lose his temper in private, has managed to keep his cool in public despite the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the campaign.</p>
        <p>In New York early last week, for instance, Mr. Bradley was cut off during live interviews with television stations in Oregon and California. Both times, the lost satellite feeds ruined the interviews.</p>
        <p>''If we lose by 1,000 votes in San Francisco,'' Mr. Bradley began to say after the second lost feed. And an aide finished his sentence, ''I'll take the blame.''</p>
        <p>Calmly, without apparent anger or dismay, Mr. Bradley simply replied, ''That won't help me.''</p>
