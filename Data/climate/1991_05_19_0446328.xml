        <p>It was a madcap opening of the Chesapeake Bay's special season for trophy striped bass, which drew thousands of maniacal anglers to a raucous day of fishing.</p>
        <p>Their flotilla of watercraft appeared to be the nautical equivalent of the Oklahoma Land Rush. Large fishing boats, canoes, schooners, day sailers, rubber dinghies and rowboats all had one thing in common: fishing rods protruding from every quarter.</p>
        <p>"I could see at least a thousand boats from where I was standing on shore," said Jim Coleman of Annapolis, Md., who added, "you could almost have hiked across the bay hopping from boat to boat."</p>
        <p>Some entrants came from as far as Texas to get in on the action, and what really brought smiles to the faces of the fishing lunatics was the fact that the big fish are legal again after a moratorium of six years.</p>
        <p>The Special Spring Striped Bass Trophy Season was engineered by the state of Maryland to salute the resurgence of a fish that had been near extinction, and to reward the patience of countless anglers who came to realize that only a restrictive policy would allow the fish to survive and replenish itself.</p>
        <p>The special trophy season, which extends through May 27, opened May 11 and by 8 A.M. we were in the middle of the bay about six miles west of Tilghman Island. By noon we could see 125 boats within a four-mile radius, their crews eager to hook a big striper.</p>
        <p>The locals, true to the idiosyncratic nature of Chesapeake Bay residents, don't call the fish "striped bass" as the rest of the world does, preferring the name "rockfish." The different name also elevates the fish to a place of honor in the state's pantheon of wildlife that includes the Maryland blue crab and the Baltimore oriole.</p>
        <p>Aboard the Lady Christine, a type of fishing boat called a Chesapeake Bay dead rise, we were using artificial lures, the only ones allowed under the state's rules.</p>
        <p>"Fish on!" yelled Capt. Levin F. Harrison 4th, who is known as Buddy Junior. I hooked a striped bass in 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>As I was reeling in my catch, one of my colleages, Jim Rowland Jr. of Wallingford, Pa., shouted encouragement: "I hope you know you're pulling in tonight's dinner."</p>
        <p>But it was not to be. The fish threw the hook, and things quieted down for a discussion of what had led to the special season. The banning of all fishing for striped bass in 1985 evolved into a hotly contested political issue complete with protest marches around the State Capitol, conflicting lobbying groups and bitter words that have persisted to this day.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the drastic decline in the number of stripers led to restrictions first by Maryland, then by the other members of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in Washington. The actions limited the size of fish that could be kept, set quotas on the numbers of fish taken, limited fishing areas and reduced the length of the fishing season.</p>
        <p>John H. Dunnigan, the commission's executive director, credited Maryland with taking the lead in pushing for restrictions that were, at first, extremely unpopular.</p>
        <p>"In the beginning there was a great deal of opposition, but then people began to realize that the striped bass was not a fishing problem but an environmental issue and the public became very supportive of Maryland's action," Dunnigan said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul Massicot, who as director of the Maryland State Tidewater Commission is one of the overseers of the striped bass survival program there, said overfishing by both commercial and sports fishermen was the major cause of the collapse of the striped bass population.</p>
        <p>"Habitat modification was a complicating factor," he added. This included pollution of the spawning areas of the bay by agricultural chemicals, industrial wastes and automobile exhausts.</p>
        <p>"This was episodic, not constant," he said. "There seemed to be pulses of pollution dropped into the water that depended on weather conditions such as storms, a situation similar to acid rain."</p>
        <p>Massicot said the moratorium and the improvement in water quality that led to the rebounding of stripers, which would continue as long as "people learn that the ways of the past are gone forever and that there will always be a much more controlled level of fishing."</p>
        <p>But, temporarily at least, there was no controlling the emotions of Rob Lawrence of Norwood, Pa., when he hooked a big striper. Only minutes before he had been lamenting six hours of fruitless fishing.</p>
        <p>"Look at the size of that fish!" he yelled when it was within 20 feet of our boat. The fish weighed 40 pounds and measured 46 inches long when we got it into the dock here. The fish was a female known locally as a "cow rock" that had spawned 15 pounds of eggs in the northern reaches of the bay, and was heading back into the Atlantic when caught. It was one of the larger catches of the day; the largest being a 53-pounder hooked by Ralph Young of Arlington, Va.</p>
        <p>I caught a striper later, but at a mere 26 inches and perhaps 18 pounds, the fish was undersize and had to be thrown back. The rules mandate the taking of fish at least 36 inches long.</p>
        <p>But I'm not sure I really mind. According to the chatter on the marine radio I probably hooked the first fish and also caught the last striper of the day.</p>
