        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Second-Best Way to Save Gas'' (editorial, Sept. 20), you grossly oversimplify when you describe the bill of Senator Richard A. Bryan requiring 20 percent improvements in new car fuel economy by 1995, 40 percent by 2001, as a ''potent prescription'' to curb oil imports, the trade deficit, smog and global warming.</p>
        <p>Auto makers support energy conservation and will continue to develop more fuel-efficient automobiles. But oil imports have risen relentlessly under fuel-economy legislation and are now higher than the mid-1970's, although new car-fuel economy has improved more than 100 percent since then to almost 28 miles a gallon. There is no reason to believe that further increases in vehicle fuel economy, by themselves, will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Nor will higher fuel economy standards roll back smog or avert global warming. If the cost of driving declines as fuel economy increases, most motorists are likely to drive more, negating projected benefits for gasoline conservation, air pollution and global warming.</p>
        <p>Models are now available that get more than 40 or 50 miles a gallon and therefore meet or far exceed the fuel economy required by the Bryan bill. But their sales - the only barometer of consumer preference - are less than 3 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>Most of the technologies cited by higher fuel economy advocates -fuel injection, front-wheel drive, overhead camshafts - are widely used in today's fleet. However, the most dramatic improvement has been the shaving of 1,000 pounds from the average vehicle since 1973.</p>
        <p>Fuel savings from such developing technologies as continuously variable transmission, two-cycle engines and advanced composite materials would be incremental.</p>
        <p>The fuel-economy standards proposed by Senator Bryan would require further size reductions - as much as 1,000 pounds more - and place severe restrictions on the availability of larger vehicles. This would limit consumer choice to compact and smaller vehicles. Family sedans and mini-vans, and the full-size vans and pickups relied on by United States farms and businesses, would be hard to find and costly.</p>
        <p>Equally important is the impact of the Bryan bill on auto safety. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner has called the Bryan bill ''irresponsible,'' adding that ''further major downsizing would result in a tragic tradeoff for the American public - an elusive promise of greater fuel economy against a guarantee of increased highway deaths and dis-abling injuries.''</p>
        <p>Improved fuel efficiency makes sense - but not at the expense of highway safety or disregarding the implications.</p>
