        <p>AS cars rush by on busy Ashford Avenue and residents go about their daily business here, time is quietly but persistently taking its toll on a one-square-mile piece of property that holds much of this village's history.</p>
        <p>Many of the marble gravestones in the Little White Church Cemetery have fallen. On others, acid rain and the harshness of many winters have caused inscriptions to fade. Some ornate headstones have cracked and broken over time, and fragments lie piled upon wooden pallets.</p>
        <p>Among the more than 300 residents interred in Dobbs Ferry's only cemetery are 10 Civil War veterans, the most notable of whom is Brig. Gen. James Bowen, the first president of the Erie Railroad and in 1855 president of the first board of the New York City Police Commission.</p>
        <p>"Every spring, on Memorial Day, the local parade pauses and the American Legion places a wreath on the general's grave," said Brian D. Monahan, a member of Dobbs Ferry's Board of Trustees. "And every year it becomes more and more apparent that our cemetery is deteriorating."</p>
        <p>Originally part of the Manor of Philipsburgh, the site was donated to the village in the late 1700's for a free burial ground serving the towns of Dobbs Ferry, Hastings-on-Hudson and Ardsley. The earliest burial is believed to have taken place in 1811, the latest about 1894.</p>
        <p>And although the Little White Church Cemetery was listed in March on the county's Inventory of Historic Places, what will become of the fragile headstones could depend less on the site's historical value than on the harsh realities of current budgetary concerns.</p>
        <p>"Everyone in town believes something must be done," Mr. Monahan said. "But the 'but' is getting the funding. In terms of local budgets, this is just not a good time."</p>
        <p>Caroline Kravath, a Dobbs Ferry resident and an anthropology major at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., said, "The problem is that if you wait until you have the dollars for restoration, by that time the landmark may be destroyed." Intern Spearheads the Project</p>
        <p>Miss Kravath spearheaded the movement to get the cemetery listed as a historic site and has worked with the Dobbs Ferry Historical Society to begin a restoration program.</p>
        <p>"I would often pass by the cemetery and wonder why it's in the state it is," Miss Kravath said. "I couldn't understand it. You can read about history, and maybe a part of you doesn't really believe that people lived here 100 years ago. Being in the cemetery, though, you get lost in another time and place, and it makes it easier to imagine."</p>
        <p>Miss Kravath took a year off from her formal schooling at Hampshire College in 1990 to fulfill an independent-study project requirement by working as an intern for the local historical society.</p>
        <p>"At first, I wanted to rush in and get everything fixed," Miss Kravath recalled. "Then I realized the problems have existed for some time and we can't afford to do everything at once. The restoration will simply have to proceed slowly."</p>
        <p>Or as Mr. Monahan explained: "We'll take it step by step. It's a little like triage."</p>
        <p>One of the first steps was village approval of $1,600 in financing to hire as a consultant Lynette Strangstad, a graveyard-preservation expert from Charleston, S.C. The Cost of Conservation</p>
        <p>In her recently completed 23-page report, following an on-site inspection of the cemetery, Ms. Strangstad estimated the conservation costs at $25,000 to $30,000.</p>
        <p>In the report, Ms. Strangstad described the Little White Church Cemetery as "a modest site" but one "of major historic importance to this Hudson Valley community."</p>
        <p>The consultant, author of "A Graveyard Preservation Primer," said that while the most of the work should be done by stone-conservation professionals, the village could save money by training volunteers who could clean and reset stones.</p>
        <p>This summer, Miss Kravath said, she would be working for the historical society under the county-sponsored Corporate Community Jobs Project. As she was last summer, she will be paid $1,500 by the county for working 20 hours a week over a three-month period. Last year she studied the site and wrote up the application to have the burial ground listed by the county as a historic site. 53 Infant Graves</p>
        <p>This year, Miss Kravath will be training volunteers to help with the restoration and recording more information from the headstones. She is to graduate in June and is completing her senior thesis on infant mortality in the late 1800's in Dobbs Ferry.</p>
        <p>Fifty-three stones standing in the cemetery bear the inscriptions written by parents who lost children younger than 10. The stones of two children from the Schmidt family stand side by side. They read: "Clara, our baby, died April 5, 1867," and "Our Charles Died October 22, 1866." Clara, according to the gravestones, was 9 months old; Charles, 2 years.</p>
        <p>Records from the church and the County Board of Health show most childhood deaths in the 1800's were caused by cholera, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis, typhoid and scarlet fever, Miss Kravath said.</p>
        <p>The graveyard also shows the changes in styles of funerary art and attitudes toward death over the course of the 19th century. "It was a transformation from 18th-century symbols of the hourglass and the scythe to the cherub's face" and symbols of souls flying off to heaven, Miss Kravath explained. Graves in a Park Setting</p>
        <p>"Then there was the weeping willow and the urn, more neo-classical symbols," she said. "Also, with the Victorian Age, people would bury family in the countryside and come out for the day and bring a picnic. Gravesites were meant to be works of art in a parklike setting."</p>
        <p>One gravesite where children are buried has a unusual symbol on the stones, Miss Kravath said. It shows a rose with a broken stem, a symbol of young life cut short, she said.</p>
        <p>Although the Little White Church Cemetery was a free burial ground, there appeared to be no stigma attached to burying family members there, Miss Kravath said. The site was used by factory owners and well-to-do individuals, as well as by poorer immigrant Irish, German and French residents, representative of groups who worked on the Old Croton Aqueduct and the railroad.</p>
        <p>The deteriorating condition of the cemetery has been a concern for some time. In the early 1960's, residents signed a petition asking the village to take over the property, which was associated with the South Presbyterian Church. The village acquired the site in 1962 and has since maintained the grounds. Adding to the Problems</p>
        <p>But some of the village's efforts to keep up the site have further aggravated problems, said Tema Harnik, director of the Dobbs Ferry Historical Society. . Specifically, lawn-mowing equipment has scratched and nicked some of the brittle headstones. In other cases, crude attempts were made to repair broken gravestones with cement, a procedure not currently recommended by preservationists.</p>
        <p>On the advice of Ms. Strangstad, the stones are being numbered, measured and photographed. The fragments have been raised above ground on pallets to protect them from the freezing and thawing of the dirt. Many of the marble stones are "sugaring," or eroding, and methods for retarding the process are under study.</p>
        <p>"My biggest worry," Miss Kravath said, "is that there will be a short-term effort to restore the cemetery and then everyone will forget about it again. Even though the town can't afford to do everything at once, we need to keep our long-term goals in mind and stay with this project."</p>
