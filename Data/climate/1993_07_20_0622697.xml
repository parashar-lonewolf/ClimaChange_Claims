        <p>IN a refrigerated van kept in a parking lot at the University of New Hampshire, just outside Durham, lies an archive that assuredly holds many secrets of the earth's past and future.</p>
        <p>The archive consists of tubes of ice, each a meter in length, stacked row upon row and representing a large part of the earth's climatic history. When the remaining ice arrives from Greenland, it should cover the past 250,000 years.</p>
        <p>Wearing special plastic gloves, Michael C. Morrison, associate director of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2, selected one of the tubes to show to a visitor. In the cold air he slid out from it a shimmering shaft of ice, which he lowered delicately into a box illuminated from below. There it glowed like a long, many-layered gem. 80,000-Year Record</p>
        <p>The ice shaft and its many fellows hold an extraordinary record of the earth's past climate recorded by the annual layers of snow that have fallen over the millennia on the Greenland icecap. Amazingly, said Dr. Paul A. Mayewski, chief scientist of the project, the layers of annual snowfall have been identified for almost 80,000 years.</p>
        <p>Further down in the ice they become so compressed that counting the layering is more difficult. Layers visible in the glowing ice displayed by Mr. Morrison probably mark dust storms carried across Greenland from regions made barren and dusty by the retreating ice in Canada.</p>
        <p>From measurements of the oxygen isotopes in each annual ice band, climatologists can estimate the average global temperature at the time the snow fell. The form of oxygen that is slightly heavier is believed more abundant in snow that fell in warm periods. Likewise ancient air bubbles trapped in the ice record the prevailing amount of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Last week a team of European scientists reported, based on a find from an ice core 20 miles away from the American drill site, that the earth's climate during the last interglacial period was remarkably erratic, with sudden warm or cold periods setting in over a period as short as a decade.  The stability of the climate since the last ice age now seems an extraordinary and so far unexplained anomaly. The story emerging from the ice cores is that in the past, at least, the climate has undergone wide temperature changes during both ice ages and interglacial periods.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mayewski said that the upper 90 percent of the ice records at the American and European sites matched closely. They did not match, however, in the bottom 10 percent, showing that even though the drill sites were at the crest of the ice, there had been some slippage of layers at the bottom. This, he said in a telephone interview, meant uncertainty in dating the bottom layers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison wore gloves to avoid contaminating the sample, whose ice crystals, microscopic dust grains and fragments of volcanic glass hold priceless clues to the past. Return of Deep Cold</p>
        <p>The particular core he had brought out, he explained, was formed from snow that fell on Greenland during 20 or 30 years some 11,700 years ago. This was during a period, known as the Younger Dryas, when, after the ice age seemed over, deep cold suddenly returned and remained for several centuries. The period is of critical interest in understanding the earth's climate since it was the system's last major wobble before commitment to the present warm interglacial period.</p>
        <p>Why such an abrupt change occurred during the Younger Dryas and many times earlier is a tantalizing mystery, raising the possibility of similar changes in the future. The ice samples show that when the world warmed, at the end of that period, snowfall in central Greenland doubled, reaching the level typical of mild periods in a few years.</p>
        <p>The increase in snowfall occurred mostly in a single year, according to a report in Nature last April by Dr. Richard B. Alley of the University of Washington and his fellow participants in the Greenland coring. This was an especially rapid change in what had appeared as a reasonably stable system.</p>
        <p>Ice cores totaling more than 9,000 feet have been extracted from both the American and European drill holes in the crest of the ice sheet, 10,600 feet above sea level. The ice, extracted as cylindrical cores two meters long, is cut first into meter-length pieces and then sliced along its length into sections that are studied and stored at various laboratories, including the vault here at the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space at the University of New Hampshire. More than half of each core is sent to the central archive maintained, on behalf of the National Science Foundation, by the United States Geological Survey in Denver.</p>
        <p>Both the American and European teams have drilled to the bottom of the ice, the American project having obtained a two-foot sample of the underlying rock.</p>
        <p>The European project is supported by the European Science Foundation and its headquarters is at the Geophysical Institute in Copenhagen.</p>
        <p>A major problem presented by the new data is that of explaining how so comprehensive a system as the earth's climate could undergo such rapid fluctuations. There are various theories for such sudden changes, but an explanation for all of them seems unlikely. Probably the most widely discussed theory is flooding of the North Atlantic by sudden releases of water accumulated from melting of the ice.</p>
        <p>As the great ice sheet began melting some 17,000 years ago, the largest accumulation of water was Lake Agassiz, far larger than Lake Superior and covering much of south-central Canada. As long as ice blocked its drainage east, into the St. Lawrence Valley, Lake Agassiz overflowed into the Mississippi.</p>
        <p>But at critical times the ice retreated far enough for the lake to flood eastward, reaching the North Atlantic instead of the Gulf of Mexico. Dr. James Kennett at the University of California in Santa Barbara, said such changes were evident in sediment extracted from the Gulf, as well as in the canyons carved by the sudden eastward outpourings of Lake Agassiz.</p>
        <p>This explanation would not, however, apply to the sudden climate changes that, according to the cores, occurred between the last two ice ages.</p>
        <p>Flooding of the North Atlantic with fresh water, according to Dr. Wallace Broecker of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, could interrupt the circulation that brings the Gulf Stream north. The most extreme cooling during the Younger Dryas occurred near the North Atlantic, but is also seen in the Antarctic ice and even, it is reported, in the sediment of the Santa Barbara Channel off California, making it a global event.</p>
        <p>Another explanation for the sudden temperature changes seen in the Greenland ice cores is large-scale slippages, or "surges," of continental ice into the sea. When some glaciers reach a critical stage, their flow increases many times. It has been proposed that as the bottom of an ice sheet is warmed by heat from the earth's interior, it becomes slushy, allowing the ice to slip. Cores extracted from sediment under the eastern Atlantic have revealed at least five layers of Canadian pebbles, showing that at certain times, many thousands of years apart, North America shed armies of icebergs that almost reached Europe.</p>
        <p>The American drilling reached bottom this month and is still being analyzed. The European drilling was completed last year and, as reported last Thursday in the journal Nature, the full length of the core has been analyzed, showing temperature history for the past 250,000 years.</p>
        <p>Ice from an even earlier period, larded with silt and pebbles, has been extracted, but the Europeans expressed concern that layering near the bottom might have been disturbed by motion of the ice over the bedrock. An airborne Danish radar capable of penetrating the ice had shown the rock under both the European and American sites to be relatively flat. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Dr. Mayewski, some movement of the deepest ice seems to have occurred.</p>
        <p>It is hoped that Russian drilling into the Antarctic ice at Vostok will provide a far longer record, reaching 500,000 years into the past. The ice at Vostok is much thicker and was formed where annual snowfall is minimal. In the drilling, now suspended for the southern winter, ice 160,000 years old has been reached, but thousands of feet remain to be penetrated.</p>
        <p>The ice samples now in hand may be able to answer many mysteries, including disputes about volcanic eruptions. Microscopic fragments of glass from a specific eruption can be identified and can now be dated by counting annual layers in the ice. A long debated question has been the date of the giant volcanic explosion that wiped out the Minoan city of Thera in the Aegean Sea and may have provided the basis for the Atlantis legend described in Plato's dialogues. Dating of Eruption</p>
        <p>That event has now been dated by the European drillers at 1645 B.C., with an error margin of seven years. Ash from the eruption has been found deep in the sediment of the eastern Mediterranean and in the Nile delta, leading to speculation that the event could be the basis for the biblical plagues of Egypt. A month ago, American and French scientists reported finding it at four sites in the Black Sea.</p>
        <p>Its origin in the Thera explosion can be verified by analysis of the chemical and optical properties of the volcanic glass. Dr. Gregory A. Zielinski of the center here, who is analyzing the Greenland cores, said in a telephone interview that because the ice from that period also contained ash from a great Alaskan eruption, he could not be sure of the Thera layer before studying the glass now in hand.</p>
        <p>Among other great volcanic eruptions tentatively identified in the ice cores is one whose glass shards have also been found at the South Pole. The fact that this material spread to both polar regions may indicate that the volcano was near the Equator. Similarity of the shards to those from a recent eruption of El Chichon in Mexico has led Dr. Zielinski and his colleagues to propose that the source may have been that volcano.</p>
