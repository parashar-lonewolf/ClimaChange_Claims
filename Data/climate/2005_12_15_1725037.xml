        <p>Gov. Mitt Romney said Wednesday that he would not seek a second term next year, an announcement widely interpreted to mean that he will run for president in 2008.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Romney, a Republican, appeared to be positioning himself for a presidential run for much of the past year, on Wednesday he would say only, ''I'm keeping my options open.''</p>
        <p>To hear him tell it, Mr. Romney has chosen to give up the first elective office he has ever held simply because there is not enough left for him to accomplish.</p>
        <p>''Most of the things I'd wanted to do and I promised during the campaign, we've done,'' Mr. Romney said at a news conference in the Statehouse.</p>
        <p>He added: ''Frankly, there was very little that had to spill over into a second term that we had any prospects of ever getting done. And I said, you know, there's no reason just to sit in the chair if the things you believe you can accomplish you've done. And let someone else have a turn.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romney, a 58-year-old former businessman who headed the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, has spent recent months in activities that have elevated his national political profile.</p>
        <p>He has traveled frequently, giving speeches in important political states like South Carolina, California, Michigan, Iowa and New Hampshire, and he was just elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romney, who was elected governor of Massachusetts by casting himself as a social moderate, has also been emphasizing socially conservative positions on issues like stem cell research, the death penalty, same-sex marriage and the morning-after birth control pill -- positions more likely to appeal to the Christian conservatives who are influential voters in Republican presidential primaries.</p>
        <p>On abortion, Mr. Romney has reframed his views. During an unsuccessful bid in 1994 for Senator Edward M. Kennedy's seat, Mr. Romney said abortion should be ''safe and legal.'' But last summer, he wrote an opinion article in The Boston Globe saying he did not believe that abortion should be legal.</p>
        <p>And although he became governor with a reputation as a concerned environmentalist, Mr. Romney has, in recent months, moved to the right on such issues as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
        <p>He also changed positions on a regional pact among nine Northeast states to reduce heat-trapping gases that many scientists have linked to global warming, prompting Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, another likely Republican presidential contender, to cancel the announcement of the final agreement that was scheduled for Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romney -- whose father, George Romney, a former governor of Michigan, once made a bid for the White House -- spent much of Wednesday's news conference deflecting questions about his presidential ambitions. He even managed a light dig at a likely rival for the White House, Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>''John McCain said he thinks about being president every day in the shower,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I guess I will turn to the words of 'Star Wars': it's in a galaxy far, far away.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he thinks about in the shower, Mr. Romney, who was joined for the announcement by his cabinet, staff members, his wife, two of his five sons and a daughter-in-law, laughingly demurred.</p>
        <p>He insisted several times that he loved being governor, calling it ''one of the greatest honors of my life.''</p>
        <p>And he mentioned that one of the more ambitious parts of his agenda, a proposal to provide universal health coverage, had yet to be passed by the Legislature and would be a priority for him in the coming year.</p>
        <p>He said his accomplishments included balancing the budget, creating jobs, building schools, lowering taxes and improving education. He said his other goals, like bringing back the death penalty, would never get through the Democratic-controlled legislature.</p>
        <p>Political experts said that while Mr. Romney's decision might make him less effective in Massachusetts, it would not hurt his presidential prospects. Indeed, they said, it would be harder for him to seek the presidency in 2008 if he ran for re-election in 2006 because he would have to tone down his conservative views to win a second term as governor.</p>
        <p>''The fact that he's a lame duck in Massachusetts now and his term will end two years before the presidential election is not at all a problem,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst in Washington. ''I'd regard it as an asset. He's free to travel.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said Mr. Romney's business background and telegenic qualities make him politically appealing, while his changes of position on issues like abortion and his Mormon faith, a religion that some evangelical Christians dismiss, are vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>If he can overcome those liabilities, said Julian E. Zelizer, a history professor at Boston University, ''I think he has a very strong chance.''</p>
        <p>''He is a conservative from a blue state,'' Professor Zelizer said, ''and he offers Republicans territory they are not typically able to capture.''</p>
