        <p>LEAD: The environment, a peripheral political concern for most of the Reagan era, has been pushed to the center of public attention over the last year by a series of highly publicized environmental disasters, culminating in the oil spill in Prince William Sound. The nightly images of oil gobs against stark natural beauty seem sure to herald a newly aggressive phase in environmental politics.</p>
        <p>The environment, a peripheral political concern for most of the Reagan era, has been pushed to the center of public attention over the last year by a series of highly publicized environmental disasters, culminating in the oil spill in Prince William Sound. The nightly images of oil gobs against stark natural beauty seem sure to herald a newly aggressive phase in environmental politics.</p>
        <p>''This may be one of those defining moments that we have heard about,'' said Senator Albert Gore Jr., a Tennessee Democrat who is active on environmental issues. ''A huge spill like this focuses media coverage and political attention, not only on the environment itself, but also on the larger problems for which it is a metaphor: we are spilling chemicals in massive quantities into our ground water, surface water, atmosphere and stratosphere.''</p>
        <p>President Bush himself helped create the new mood by placing so much emphasis on the environment in his 1988 campaign.</p>
        <p>''Bush's rhetoric in the campaign has led to a revolution of rising expectations about what the environmental policy of the Government was going to be,'' said Brooks Yeager, the National Audubon Society's vice president for governmental affairs. ''And he is in for a rough time if he doesn't live up to those expectations.'' Caution Draws Criticism</p>
        <p>For this reason, Mr. Bush's initially cautious reaction to the Alaska spill has drawn fire from environmental groups.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Mr. Bush campaigned in a political environment already charged by public reactions to syringes and other medical wastes washing up on Atlantic beaches last summer. Besides the disasters that were indisputably manmade, there were other, natural calamities that some environmentalists thought might have been made worse by man.</p>
        <p>Droughts parched Western forests and contributed to a rash of fires, notably in Yellowstone National Park.</p>
        <p>A heat wave heightened fears about a global warming trend, or ''greenhouse effect,'' and about damage caused by manmade air pollution to the earth's radiation-shielding ozone layer. Economic Worries Lessen</p>
        <p>But even before the recent spate of disasters, politicians and poll takers detected the increasing importance of environmental issues. They attributed this both to a decline in concern about the economic and foreign policy issues that usually weigh most heavily on the public's mind, and to growing public worries that the Reagan Administration's zeal for deregulation may have led to excessive cutbacks in environmental rules.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reasons, several Democratic candidates used the issue to great effect in the 1986 elections.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Teeter, an adviser to President Bush and a leading Republican analyst of public opinion, said the Alaskan disaster will ''reinforce what's already going on.''</p>
        <p>''We've gone through a period of peace and prosperity for a long time, so concern about economic issues has abated,'' he said, adding that in place of economic issues a new ''domestic agenda'' has pushed its way to the fore, with drug abuse, education and the environment topping the list. Drilling Proposal Shelved</p>
        <p>Robert S. Strauss, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, agreed. Environmental issues, he said, ''have been raised from a second-level priority to a first-level priority.''</p>
        <p>The first political casualty of the oil spill was action on a proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. A bill permitting drilling in the reserve was sailing through the Senate and had been expected to come up for a vote later this month. Now, acknowledged Charles S. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, consideration of the bill will be delayed.</p>
        <p>Supporters of drilling in the reserve, such as Senator Frank H. Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, argued that the Valdez accident should not be linked to the drilling proposal, since the spill had nothing to do with drilling. He said a tanker carrying foreign oil into the Chesapeake Bay could just as easily have gone aground as one carrying Alaskan oil in Prince William Sound.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Murkowski conceded that in the short term such arguments would have little impact against the riveting pictures of oil-soaked shorelines and suffering animals. ''Perception is half the battle, and that's what we're dealing with on this,'' he said. ''While the two issues are not connected, they are in the minds of a lot of people.'' Across Party Lines</p>
        <p>Frank Greer, a Democratic campaign consultant, said the environmental issue has generally been more helpful to Democrats, both because it raises questions about the behavior of large corporations and because environmentalists favor more vigorous forms of government action that Republican politicians generally oppose.</p>
        <p>In addition, environmental issues have often helped Democrats to win support from middle- and upper-middle class voters who, on many other issues, are inclined to back Republicans. For these and other reasons, strategists for President Bush sensed that Republicans were vulnerable on environmental issues in the 1988 campaign. Mr. Bush himself, as head of a commission on deregulation, presided over the weakening of an array of environmental regulations. Backhand Tribute to Watt</p>
        <p>Mr. Greer said the reaction to James Watt, Mr. Reagan's first Secretary of the Interior, laid the groundwork for the current resurgence of environmentalists. ''James Watt did more to organize the environmental movement and activate it than any other American politician,'' Mr. Greer said.</p>
        <p>Thus, one of the biggest surprises of the 1988 Presidential campaign was that the environment became the Republican candidate's issue. Mr. Bush promised to be ''the environmental President,'' and one of his most effective television advertisements blamed his Democratic opponent, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, for the pollution of Boston Harbor. Mr. Bush's early focus on the harbor made it more difficult for the Dukakis campaign to use the environmental issues that might have worked in the Democrat's favor.</p>
        <p>But that was in the campaign. The Valdez disaster offered Mr. Bush a chance to do something to back up his promises. The President moved to show his concern by sending three Administration officials to the scene. 'The Caribou Love It'</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has so far chosen not to go further. A Texan, Mr. Bush has been a strong supporter of the oil industry on most issues, including the Alaska oil pipeline, which he spoke of this way in early 1988: ''The caribou love it. They rub up against it, and they have babies. There are more caribou in Alaska than you can shake a stick at.'' Mr. Bush has rejected the idea of a Federal takeover of the Valdez cleanup and has reiterated his support for drilling in the wildlife refuge.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups, on the other hand, have had no reluctance about using the Valdez spill for their purposes. Roger Craver, a direct mail specialist, said that in the next week, he will be sending 500,000 pieces of mail on the disaster and the Arctic leasing issue to raise money for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Craver said that donations to the environmental groups he works for have increased by about 40 percent since 1986, to some $50 million a year.</p>
        <p>Jim Maddy, the executive director of the League of Conservation Voters, recently sent a letter mentioning the disaster to 1,000 of his larger contributors. Mr. Maddy said the spill was an important event both in itself (''There are oil spills and there are oil spills, and this one's huge''), and as part of the series of incidents that have focused the public's mind on the environment. ''It kept the chain alive,'' he said. ''It kept the string going.''</p>
        <p>But even those who see the environmetal issue as becoming central caution that a sharp economic downturn could return it to the back burner. And Mr. Teeter, who has preached the importance of environmental issues to Republicans for years, argued that the tumbling of one environmental disaster onto another has led to a certain public ambivalence.</p>
        <p>''I think there's still a very strong environmental mood in the country,'' he said. ''But I also think there's a growing sense of recognition that there are certain risks in living in a big complex society that you can't get rid of.'' He said the future of environmental politics may ultimately rest on ''how people view the risks.''</p>
