Fujimori would resign by Tuesday, ending a decade in power in which he battled terrorists, drug traffickers and hyperinflation before succumbing to a series of scandals.

        <p>Peru's President Is Ready To Step Down, Aides Say  Two top officials in Peru announced that President Alberto K. Fujimori would resign by Tuesday, ending a decade in power in which he battled terrorists, drug traffickers and hyperinflation before succumbing to a series of scandals. There was no immediate word from Mr. Fujimori, who is visiting Japan.</p>

        <p>Clintons End Vietnam Visit  President Clinton ended an emotional three-day visit to Vietnam as he began it, pressing America's former foe -- gently but insistently -- to set aside its fears and join the global marketplace of trade and ideas. Mr. Clinton's remarks came four months after the two nations signed a trade agreement that, if carried out, would break down many of the protective walls Vietnam has erected around its economy and society.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, not yet a senator and not quite a former first lady, brought her trademark mixture of feminism and family values to Vietnam, telling an audience made up largely of women that ''anything we do to help women helps children and families and society.'' Mrs. Clinton paid homage to the exalted place women occupy in Vietnamese history as well as their central role in the country's commercial life.</p>

        <p>Nationalist Sentiment in Bosnia  Results from Nov. 11 elections in Bosnia are mixed and moderates lack the clear mandate that international officials had hoped for, promising a future of power sharing and haggling that spell more ineffectual government and continued obstruction from nationalists on unifying the country, analysts said.</p>

        <p>Immigration Debate in Germany  Kosovo Albanians admitted to Germany because of persecution and a war are being expelled at a brisk rate now that the war is over, raising questions about immigration in Germany, the European country with the largest population and the largest number of foreigners.</p>

        <p>Hopeful Step for Kashmir  The Indian government announced that it would unilaterally stop military operations in the troubled region of Kashmir during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins later this month, a move that may be a hopeful step toward ending more than a decade of violence in Kashmir.</p>

        <p>More Power for Yemen Leader  Yemen's Parliament, which is dominated by the General People's Congress of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, agreed to extend the term of president from five to seven years and that of its own members from four to six years. The constitutional amendments also give the president the right to dissolve Parliament and call for general elections.</p>

        <p>Election Fight Continues In Court and Recount Halls  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic candidate for vice president, said Florida election officials should reconsider their rejection of hundreds of military ballots from overseas, even if they might not comply with the law, a retreat from the position the Democrats had taken since Friday.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush contended that Florida law set a clear deadline of last Tuesday for counties to submit all vote tallies except overseas absentee ballots, and they asked the Florida Supreme Court to let the state reject any manual recounts done after that date.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Election workers in two Florida counties resumed the laborious manual recounts that in recent days have been slowed by fatigue, partisan disputes and -- in one county -- another change in the definition of a vote.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Despite sharp differences on many important issues, Democrats and Republicans in Florida more often than not found ways to work together. But in the last 12 days, this carefully cultivated tradition has been sorely tested, residents and political leaders said.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was inevitable that bizarre charges would emerge from the biosphere-like counting room where hundreds of people have been hunched over tables counting votes in Broward County under the glare of the nation. But some accusations are just plain wacky.</p>

        <p>States Try Emission Crackdown  Thirteen states from all regions of the country will try to impose new national controls on pollution from truck and bus engines today when they announce a plan to jointly adopt emission limits that would be stricter than federal rules.</p>

        <p>Medical Privacy Proposal  The Clinton administration, under pressure from the health care industry, is backing away from a proposal to give patients a broad new right to sue and recover damages for the improper disclosure of confidential information, officials said.</p>

        <p>Attacks Shake Community  The shocked community of south Berkeley, Calif., is struggling to understand how a violent sexual assault could have been perpetrated under their noses on a mentally disabled girl, multiple times, by boys who are barely adolescent.</p>

        <p>Family Members of Victims See Trial by Closed Circuit  Relatives of passengers who died in the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 have been converging since May on special viewing rooms set up by the Justice Department and the Scottish courts in Manhattan and Washington. They gather to watch, on closed-circuit television, the trial in the Netherlands of two men accused of the bombing, which killed 270 people. The prosecution is expected to rest its case this week.</p>

        <p>Explicit Drama Breaks Taboo  The new Showtime series, ''Queer as Folk,'' a drama about gay and lesbian life, seeks to rival HBO in the sexual candor of shows like ''Sex and the City,'' the cable hit about single women in New York. The Showtime series, which was previewed in New York and starts on Dec. 3, also shatters an unwritten rule in television against explicit depictions of sexual behavior between men.</p>

        <p>Emotional Loss for Seles  Tears sneaked up on Monica Seles after her loss to Martina Hingis in a riveting match at Madison Square Garden that marked the end of the nearly 30-year run of the Chase Championship tournament in New York. ''I was just very emotional,'' said the usually composed Seles. For the next three years the event will be in Germany, where Seles was stabbed in 1993 and will not play.</p>
