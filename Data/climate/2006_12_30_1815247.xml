        <p>A 41-square-mile shelf of floating ice that jutted into the Arctic Ocean for 3,000 years from Canada's northernmost shore broke away in the summer of 2005, apparently freed by sharply warming temperatures and jostling wind and waves, scientists said. The Ayles ice shelf, as the 100-foot-thick slab was called, drifted out of a fjord along the north coast of Ellesmere Island when the sheath of floating sea ice that pressed against the coast there even in summers was replaced by open waters, the scientists said. Luke Copland of the University of Ottawa's Laboratory for Cryospheric Research said it was premature to attribute the breakaway to human-caused climate change.</p>
