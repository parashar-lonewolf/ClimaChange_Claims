        <p>When people look for nature without adornment, they often end up in Alaska, the American Eden. But five years ago, the Governor of Alaska said something was horribly out of whack in the wilds of the Last Frontier State. There were too many wolves, he felt. Wolves eat moose, the preferred prey of human hunters. To keep more moose alive so they can be shot by predators on two feet, wolves had to be killed, the Governor said.</p>
        <p>''We can't just let nature run wild,'' said Gov. Walter J. Hickel, a Republican, who retired in 1994.</p>

        <p>When people look for nature without adornment, they often end up in Alaska, the American Eden. But five years ago, the Governor of Alaska said something was horribly out of whack in the wilds of the Last Frontier State. There were too many wolves, he felt. Wolves eat moose, the preferred prey of human hunters. To keep more moose alive so they can be shot by predators on two feet, wolves had to be killed, the Governor said.</p>
        <p>''We can't just let nature run wild,'' said Gov. Walter J. Hickel, a Republican, who retired in 1994.</p>
        <p>What is it about nature, which supposedly answers to its own call, that is forever drawing people into debate over how to shape it, worship it or use it? Nature is constantly being invoked in one moral crusade or another, as evidence of the wonders of God, or as a warning about the excesses of humans. It has been hopelessly anthropomorphized. It has wrath, fury. It is art, poetry, perfection and, in bad moods, cancer.</p>
        <p>A perennial question in the open space of the West is whether wild horses should run free or be given up for adoption. Yet wild horses are not wild at all. They are descendants of domesticated Spanish animals brought to the upper Rio Grande Valley more than 400 years ago. So who has nature on their side?</p>
        <p>Glacier National Park in the northern Rockies may soon be without any glaciers. Is it a victim of a globe warmed by industrial society on hyperspeed, or just further natural adaptation?</p>
        <p>Or what about a meticulously sculptured courtyard garden? Does that have anything to do with the natural world, or is it just flora on a short leash? Certainly, the best British gardeners do not consider their hedgerows anything less than natural.</p>
        <p>Even philanderers of late have taken comfort in the new work on the sexual proclivity of animals. The new thinking goes: males need promiscuity to keep the gene pool healthy; females crave alpha-male security (rich guys) for the same reason. The tag line is the same: sorry, honey, it's nature's way.</p>
        <p>These attitudes are so human they seem, well, natural. In his new book, ''Nature: Western Attitudes Since Ancient Times'' (University of California Press), the British author Peter Coates gives an exhaustively detailed account of the ever changing history of nature, mostly tied to the political goals of the times. What is surprising is how little has changed.</p>
        <p>''Every culture projects its values onto nature and holds them up as nature's own authority,'' writes Mr. Coates, a senior lecturer in the Department of Historical Studies at the University of Bristol.</p>
        <p>Modern interpretations of nature, Mr. Coates writes, came from late 18th- and early 19th-century Romantic poets, for whom an orchid was the essence of physical sublimity, but anything touched by man was outside the bounds of esthetic purity.</p>
        <p>In ancient Greece, nature was viewed by leading philosophers as a system and not a physical thing. Human thought, no matter where it strayed, was as natural as a river flowing downhill. But, of course, the Greeks included that most elusive of human attachments -- a soul, or spirit -- in their discussion of what was ''natural.'' Aristotle believed every living thing had a soul, but a human soul was different from that of, say, a bottom fish.</p>
        <p>The Romans continued the debate of Aristotle and others, to a point. But in the process of expanding and feeding their empire, they stripped much of the natural world bare, and their rationalizations followed. The areas around Rome and Athens were once heavily forested, and North Africa such a fecund place that half a million tons of wheat was exported annually, in the first century A.D. ''Think of all the trees consumed by the furnaces in the ubiquitous Roman public bath,'' writes Mr. Coates. The Romans justified this plundering because they were creating, in the words of Cicero, ''a second world within the world of nature.'' They felt duty-bound to fashion such a construct.</p>
        <p>Rome fell, in the view of many modern environmental historians, because it simply expanded to the point of being an unsustainable beast. Others saw a moral failing, another persistent line of thought about nature's role. In this view, Roman leaders became too fat, lazy and promiscuous and lost their place atop the hill. What the Romans bequeathed to Europe was the idea that the countryside, wild and natural, was a balm for the soul. Sprawl was not a good thing. Cities had walls. The rural ''outside'' was sacred because of its material and spiritual utility.</p>
        <p>For European Christians, the great green saint was Francis of Assisi, who communed with birds, snakes and wolves in such a way that he could very likely win a seat on the Sierra Club board of directors today. St. Francis, who died in A.D. 1226, was of the school that materialism corrupts, because it leads to detachment from the natural world.</p>
        <p>But some historians have argued that when young Francis gave up his silk garments to his father, it was not so much a first step on the road to ecological divinity as it was a reaction to the excesses of a corpulent church.</p>
        <p>St. Francis remains a powerful figure, as any visitor to the Umbrian forest where he used to hike can attest. Pope John Paul II, in a 1989 environmental address in which he cautioned against deforestation and global warming, praised St. Francis for keeping ''ever alive a sense of fraternity with all those good and beautiful things which Almighty God has created.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Coates says St. Francis is one of the more striking examples of how figures from the past are made over in a modern image to suit political demands on the environment. Animal rights activists recite the tale of St. Francis releasing a rabbit from a spring trap, while green poets have made him out to be a medieval Wordsworth, says Mr. Coates.</p>
        <p>A century after the death of St. Francis, bubonic plague, or the Black Death, wiped out upward of a third of the population of Europe. The catastrophe has been interpreted by virtually every generation since. It was the revenge of nature for a world gone bad. It was nature culling itself of the weakest elements of society, a Darwinian view. It was an extreme example of what can happen when people pollute their land and rivers without care for consequences.</p>
        <p>Modern plagues have been similarly interpreted. A few years ago, Pat Buchanan, a Republican Presidential candidate in the primary elections, said that AIDS was nature's way of punishing homosexuals. More recently, the television evangelist Pat Robertson said a hurricane might strike a community in Florida that had shown a bit too much tolerance for gay rights.</p>
        <p>In America, nature was long thought to be pristine and inviolate until the arrival of Europeans. The French, who coined the phrase ''noble savage'' to describe indigenous Americans, were particularly fond of this view.</p>
        <p>Some of today's environmentalists see nature's revenge in the gradual warming of the earth and its stormy hissy fits along the way. A hundred years ago, after the Americans had wiped out most of the bounteous bison of the West and removed the native people who had lived on those animals, there came a great die-out of domestic cattle. A long, bitter winter left cowboys without cows and the Indians saying, ''Told you so.'' It was, many people still believe, nature's blow against the attempt to erase much of the native West.</p>
        <p>But what about the Great Plains tribes, who used to start big grass fires to drive bison off a cliff? By some estimates, up to 90 percent of a herd was wasted. It may have been natural or simply crafty and wasteful, no different from Roman excess.</p>
        <p>Americans embraced nature in a burst of nationalism around the middle of the last century. The Grand Canyon was sniffed at by the Spanish in the 16th century; it rated barely a mention. But after John Wesley Powell breached the canyon in a wooden dory in the 1860's, America went wild over its big ditch, as Stephen J. Pyne documents in his new book, ''How the Canyon Became Grand: A Short History,'' (Viking Press).</p>
        <p>Sure, Europe had magnificent cathedrals, and Asia had wonders of ivory and porcelain as well as cities of layered beauty, but what the United States could boast about was nature -- and lots of it. President Jefferson had hailed the new country as ''Nature's nation,'' but it took the creation of the world's first national park, Yellowstone in 1872, to link much of America's identity solidly to the wild.</p>
        <p>Today, nature has become a commercial force; witness the growth of natural medicine and remedies. It is debated in the impeachment hearings, in the question of what is wrong but natural. It is evoked in the open land of the West, as wolves are reintroduced in an effort to restore a lost predator to the wild.</p>
        <p>Lacking a consistent definition, nature may simply be one of those ever ephemeral concepts, like news. Asked to define news, Walter Cronkite said, ''It is what I say it is.'' The same has long been said about nature.</p>
