        <p>WITH global warming, research on safer reactors and the need for more energy all converging, advocates of nuclear power see signs that the industry is overcoming years of public criticism and doubt.</p>
        <p>On May 2, the Tennessee Valley Authority was granted permission by the Government to restart one of three reactors at the Browns Ferry plant in northern Alabama after the longest shutdown for safety reasons in the history of the industry. With the startup scheduled for sometime before the end of the month, Browns Ferry will be the last of five nuclear plants in the United States to open after extended closures.</p>
        <p>An even more significant event occurred on April 10, when the National Academy of Sciences urged the Government to quickly develop and test a new generation of reactors. Unlike coal-fired electric plants, the academy noted, nuclear reactors produce none of the carbon compounds that cause global warming. Designs under consideration in the United States, Japan and Europe would have far less likelihood of melting down in an accident than would conventional reactors, according to engineers.</p>
        <p>Recently, three environmental groups that have opposed nuclear energy -- the National Audubon Society, the World Resources Institute and the Union of Concerned Scientists -- have guardedly recognized the technology's potential and accepted the need for more research.  "Because of the global warming problem these new generation reactors have to be looked into for insurance purposes," said Dr. Jan Beyea, a nuclear physicist with the National Audubon Society in New York.</p>
        <p>In the public mind, the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979, followed seven years later by the catastrophe at Chernobyl, seemed to seal the technology's fate as a long-term source of electricity. In 1989 alone, the Long Island Lighting Company pulled the fuel rods from the brand new Shoreham plant, voters in California shut Rancho Seco, a nuclear plant south of Sacramento, and the owners of the Fort St. Vrain nuclear plant in Colorado closed it after years of dismal operation.</p>
        <p>Though it is far from clear whether the engineering and political trends of the last few months will persuade utilities to start buying reactors again, the industry is optimistic about making a comeback.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy is spending $160 million this year on research to design a new generation of safer, advanced reactors. The country's major manufacturers -- Westinghouse, General Electric, Combustion Engineering and Babcock and Wilcox -- have entered into joint ventures among themselves and with foreign reactor builders to search for new designs. Legislation sponsored by the Bush Administration to make licensing faster is receiving support in Congress.  Weighing Alternatives</p>
        <p>In its National Energy Strategy, made public earlier this year, the Department of Energy estimated that demand for electricity in the year 2010 will rise to 950 billion watts from 700 billion today. Energy conservation could slow the increase but will not eliminate it, the Energy Department said. Other options also present problems. Most of the good hydroelectric sites have already been taken and environmentalists are battling to save the last wild stretches of river from the dam builders. Solar power shows increasing promise, but the Government has been reluctant to provide much financing for research, and the largescale manufacture of photovoltaic panels would produce toxic chemical pollution. Burning and mining coal are an environmental menace.</p>
        <p>The future of nuclear power will not be decided, though, until utility boards of directors are convinced the technology will be accepted by the public. "Neither Wall Street nor Main Street seems very supportive of a renewal of nuclear power," said Dan W. Reicher, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>That is true in financial circles. But there are signs that the public is less fearful than it used to be. When a fire and explosion destroyed the electrical transformer of the Maine Yankee plant late last month, citizens of Wiscasset, where the reactor has operated for 19 years, reacted with a giant yawn. The announcement that T.V.A. was close to starting Browns Ferry was greeted with enthusiasm in Alabama.</p>
        <p>Still, enduring national acceptance will not come until the nuclear industry solves two problems it has battled since the beginning of the 1950's -- making reactors more reliable and disposing of radioactive wastes.</p>
        <p>Billions of dollars spent on new equipment and training since Three Mile Island has resulted in fewer unplanned shutdowns and fewer accidents, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The country's reactors operated at 68 percent of their capacity last year, a higher rate than in any other year, but still not as good as that of some other sources of power.</p>
        <p>The industry is still years away from solving the nuclear waste problem. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars studying a site in Nevada for disposing the most dangerous radioactive wastes, the Department of Energy said last year that its program was a technical failure and that the Government was going to start over.</p>
        <p>The industry's problems, though, are not deterring the Tennessee Valley Authority, a Federal agency based in Knoxville, Tenn. Once rebuked by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and reviled by independent authorities for its inability to operate nuclear reactors safely, the T.V.A. was commended last year by the Government for its operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear power plant in Soddy Daisy, Tenn. Sequoyah, closed from 1985 to 1988 for repairs, was ranked second in the United States and eighth in the world in 1989 for its reliability and the amount of electricity it generated.</p>
        <p>Marvin Runyon, the chairman of the T.V.A., believes nuclear power is just as economical as generating electricity from coal and ultimately safer for the environment. In an interview last week, Mr. Runyon said he plans to restart two more reactors at Browns Ferry, and complete four other reactors at two unfinished nuclear plants in Alabama and Tennessee before the end of the decade. He is even considering buying a new reactor, the first ordered in the United States since 1973.</p>
