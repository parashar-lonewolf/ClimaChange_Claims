        <p>LEAD: SINCE a fire in its administrative quarters last year, the Paterson Museum has been rather subdued - not that it is ever very active.

        <p>SINCE a fire in its administrative quarters last year, the Paterson Museum has been rather subdued - not that it is ever very active. This ''warehouse'' of local history in the Rogers Building, which was once an assembly plant for locomotives, is the centerpiece of the Great Falls Historic District. Yet it seems to be awaiting the arrival of the cultural renaissance that was announced way back in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was never meant to be. Paterson was founded as an industrial city, reportedly the first in the country, and it remains that, notwithstanding the departure of the silk and engineering industries that made it famous. Come 1992, it will be 200 years since the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures decided to erect the first mills (for spinning and weaving cotton) and houses (fewer than a dozen) and harness the power of the falls.</p>
        <p>It was here that Samuel Colt established his first ''gun mill'' (1836), that his cousin, Christopher, started the silk industry (1839) and that John Philip Holland designed and launched, in the Passaic River, his first submarine (1878). Paterson was immortalized in the late 1950's by William Carlos Williams's giant poem of the same name, and the city, with its ramshackle wood houses and telephone poles groaning under swags of wire, has the look of a Ben Shahn painting. Nevertheless, its distant past is the more marketable today.  With a collection of minerals, close to a quarter of a million photographs documenting the city's development, industrial relics and the like, the museum has the makings for educational shows and, on occasion, has used them. But low funds and perhaps low morale, too, have kept it from realizing its potential. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the art exhibitions, including the current ''Cartoons Come to Paterson.''</p>
        <p>The curators imported for the occasion are Jose Delbo and Hy Eisman, authors of, respectively, ''The Transformers'' and ''The Katzenjammer Kids.'' Between them, they have come up with about 70 colleagues, a quarter of them born in New Jersey or living there, and twice that number of works. Some drawings are originals displayed in glass cases, but most are reproductions attached to boards under plastic.</p>
        <p>Visitors had better be well versed in strip cartoons and the comic groups Marvel and DC; beginners, late starters and those who have lost traction in the field need not apply.</p>
        <p>Cartoons have been the entertainment of millions for most of the 20th century, but only in the post-Pop era have they been elevated to the status of art - much to their detriment. The Museum of Cartoon Art, in Rye Brook, N.Y., is a mine of syndicated fun (it was founded by Mort Walker, whose ''Beetle Bailey'' figures in this show). But its atmosphere is that of a ''serious'' museum. Unfortunately, comics don't lend themselves to the system devised for processing high art, nor should they try, if only because the originality that is so prized in the upper strata counts for little in the cartoon world.</p>
        <p>Most people know that ''Peanuts'' is Charles Schulz's baby and ''B.C.'' Johnny Hart's. But ''Batman'' - does he belong to Bob Kane, who invented him, or to the artists who draw him, Mr. Delbo and Tex Blaisdell among them? It is the same with ''Superman,'' who is represented here by Alex Saviuk and Bob Oksner but is the 1930's creation of Siegel and Schuster. ''Concessions'' to draw characters of this stature are awarded by the publishers, along with strict rules for drawing them.</p>
        <p>There are personages like Conan the Barbarian, who started life as the hero of a paperback series, and Mr. Delbo's own Transformers, who were originally robot toys. This information was supplied by Mr. Delbo, not the biographies, which, written mainly by the artists themselves, tend to be irritatingly informative about wives (without whom) and children but facetiously offhand about accomplishments. As already indicated, it is a take-it-or-leave-it show.</p>
        <p>Walt Kelly's ''Pogo'' is present; so is Andy Kubert's ''Brave and Bold.'' Virgil Partch's Surrealist man is bending over to retrieve a gun that a flirtatious woman has dropped instead of a handkerchief. A cartoonist in The New Yorker style, Don Orehek is represented by a drawing of whale watchers sighting their quarry as it spouts medical debris.</p>
        <p>Dennis Corrigan aspires to high art with Surrealist images beautifully drawn in pencil. ''Kitty Litter'' features a car full of joy-riding cats with a tom at the wheel, discarding trash over the side. In ''Three Men Carrying a Grudge,'' the figures are dressed in 18th- , 19th- and 20th-century costumes while in their collective hands is the beetle from, seemingly, Kafka's ''Metamorphosis.''</p>
        <p>There are children's book illustrations by Harry Devlin, notably one of figures skulking by the light of a yellow moon toward an obviously haunted house.There are also political cartoons on the order of Don Evers's, one of which shows Uncle Sam getting his outstretched hand eaten away by acid rain. At the other extreme are frames from a Disney feature and a Howdy Doody image by Milt Neill, together with Charlie McGill's cartoon-poster of the Spinks-Tyson fight.</p>
        <p>Under its acting director, Giacomo de Stefano, the museum is hanging in there. But it plainly needs help from Conan, the Hulk or even Prince Valiant, and a grant from Daddy Warbucks wouldn't come amiss. The show is on view through Jan. 27, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tuesday through Friday and 12:30 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. Saturday and Sunday.</p>
