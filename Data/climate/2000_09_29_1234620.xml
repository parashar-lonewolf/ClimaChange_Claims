        <p>Americans are very sophisticated about the relationship between politics and entertainment. Anybody can tell you that Richard Nixon blazed the trail in 1968 when he appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and muttered the show's catch phrase, ''Sock it to me.'' It was one of the first glimpses of the ''fun'' Nixon the nation would later come to love.</p>
        <p>We know this story because it was an important moment in our collective cultural history and also because it was the answer to the first million-dollar question on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>

        <p>Americans are very sophisticated about the relationship between politics and entertainment. Anybody can tell you that Richard Nixon blazed the trail in 1968 when he appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and muttered the show's catch phrase, ''Sock it to me.'' It was one of the first glimpses of the ''fun'' Nixon the nation would later come to love.</p>
        <p>We know this story because it was an important moment in our collective cultural history and also because it was the answer to the first million-dollar question on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>The Nixon moment was one step in the road toward our current controversy over the amount of time presidential candidates are spending on television, talking about their families and favorite foods. The other night you could flip back and forth between Al Gore on MTV, looking stern at the mere mention of marijuana, and George W. Bush on CNN, hanging out with Larry King. On NBC, I swear I saw Dick Cheney mounting the pommel horse.</p>
        <p>(Has anybody noticed, by the way, that none of the candidates have spent much time cheering on our Olympic athletes? This is particularly disappointing in the case of Mr. Bush, who did such a great job of psyching up the Ryder Cup golf team by reading them a letter from the commander of the Alamo, vowing ''victory or death.'' I think I am speaking for all Americans when I say that if Mr. Bush had taken the trouble to read his Alamo letter to the women's soccer team, they would not have lost to Norway.)</p>
        <p>We digress. Our topic today was whether the candidates are spending too much time hanging around the softer side of the media, where they do not have to answer tough questions. The whole debate is truly touching, since it presumes that when they aren't on Oprah, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are at the mercy of bloodthirsty  journalists who are forcing them to finally come clean about the contradictions in their Medicare plans.</p>
        <p>Actually, the campaigns are so controlled that it's a challenge to get much more than the message of the day, and in the case of Mr. Gore, the press conference of every other month. If the TV hosts think they can pry something surprising out of these guys, more power to them. David Letterman gave it the old college try when he demanded to know what Mr. Gore thought we should do about global warming. (Great news! The problem can be solved by new, job-creating technology.) Ms. Winfrey didn't exactly go for the jugular, but it was still fun to watch the presidential candidates groveling at the feet of a powerful woman. Mr. Gore was in such full pander mode that when asked to name his favorite cereal, he blurted out, ''Oprah.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's least threatening interviewer had to be Regis Philbin, who spent an inordinate amount of time questioning him closely about what the ''W.'' stands for. (''Walker . . . of course, Walker. . . . George Walker Bush. . . . Yeah, yeah.'') Perhaps Mr. Philbin was worried about all the trouble Mr. Bush had earlier in the campaign, when people asked him about world affairs.</p>
        <p>Campaigning as TV entertainment has actually been with us since the 1950's, when people acquired their first sets and immediately stopped showing up at political rallies. Dwight Eisenhower saw what was going on  and hired a media consultant, one of whose coups was to persuade CBS to air a birthday tribute to Mamie Eisenhower in the spring of the 1956 election year, despite the fact that the first lady had actually been born in late November. Adlai Stevenson, meanwhile, resisted all attempts to make him more camera-friendly, and turned down an invitation to appear as the mystery guest on the popular program ''I've Got a Secret.'' This cost Mr. Stevenson both valuable exposure and the opportunity to become immortalized as a 21st-century quiz show question.</p>
        <p>Now the airwaves are full of once and future candidates, and if this race gets any closer, they'll be moving into the prime-time lineup:</p>
        <p>Sunday -- Dueling centrists Bush and Gore attempt to elbow Malcolm out of the Middle.</p>
        <p>Wednesday -- The ''NYPD Blue'' gang gets to escort Mr. Gore to a fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>Friday -- Mr. Bush appears on a special edition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' limited to questions about people's middle names.</p>
