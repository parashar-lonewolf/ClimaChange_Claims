        <p>Despite a couple of jokes about the spotted owl, no one on the affirmative side of tomorrow night's meandering ''Firing Line'' debate -- ''Resolved: The Environmentalists Are Going Too Far Too Fast'' -- comes out flatly against pure air or water or for killing elephants. Led by William F. Buckley Jr., they maintain that their opponents are making mountains out of molehills, or maybe it's the other way around.</p>
        <p>The environmentalist contingent (Mr. Buckley calls them ''eco-freaks'') retort that untrammeled industrial growth is throwing nature off balance with dire consequences for the future of the human race.</p>
        <p>The encounter shifts ground depending on who is leading the charge. Jerry Brown (he's the fellow without a tie or jacket) issues jeremiads against even trammeled growth, except perhaps of trees. He comes out for ''a happy asceticism.''</p>
        <p>Speaking for the corporations mistrusted by the environmentalists, Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, grants that some Government regulation is needed but expresses confidence in his clients to behave responsibly, make money, make jobs and make life pleasanter for all without ravaging the land or polluting the air and the water. His assurances are greeted with some skepticism.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Jasinowski has rarely met a corporation he could not defend, the professional environmentalists -- George M. Woodwell, the director of the Woods Hole Research Center, and Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club -- have never met an ecological cause they could not champion. Mr. Pope uses some of his time for fund-raising pitches: ''At the Sierra Club we don't believe there's such a thing as water that's too pure for our kids to drink, air that's too clean for our parents to breathe.'' Debaters on both sides make obeisance to the American People as if they were running for something.</p>
        <p>Richard L. Schmalensee, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, labors to get the argument off the rhetorical plane and onto ground where trade-offs might be found between the bottom line and higher aspirations. He does not have much success.</p>
        <p>Along the way there are smoggy exchanges about global warming, developing countries, cost-benefit analysis and political pressures. One issue mentioned now and then, some international treaty awaiting approval, remains as murky as an algae-topped lake. It might have been helpful if Michael Kinsley, the entertaining moderator, had now and then taken a moment from cracking wise to explain what was being talked about.</p>
        <p>'Debates/Debates'  'Does Paula Jones Deserve Her Day in Court Now?'  PBS, tomorrow night  (Channel 25, New York, at 8)</p>
        <p>Warren Steibel, the producer of both ''Firing Line'' and ''Debates/ Debates,'' offers an appetizer tomorrow, an argument about whether President Clinton, or any President, should be discommoded by being sued while in office.</p>
        <p>The political right, represented here by Arianna Huffington, has been chiding feminists for not being as caring toward Paula Jones, who says the President came on to her without provocation, as they were toward Anita Hill; the left, represented by Susan Estrich, has been maintaining that the Presidency must be allowed to carry on the nation's business without distraction. Ms. Huffington and Ms. Estrich have allies tomorrow night, but if you have encountered these two opinionizers before -- and they are hard for viewers of television talkies to avoid -- you will know what to expect.</p>
        <p>FIRING LINE SPECIAL DEBATE  Resolved: The Environmentalists Have Gone Too Far Too Fast  PBS, tomorrow night at 9 (Check local listings)</p>
        <p>Produced by Warren Steibel Productions in association with South Carolina ETV and presented by South Carolina ETV; Tinka Tiemann, coordinator; Michael Kinsley, moderator.</p>
        <p>WITH: William F. Buckley Jr., Jerry Brown and Eugene Linden.</p>
