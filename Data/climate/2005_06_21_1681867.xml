        <p>One Big Seagoing Family</p>
        <p>Coelacanths made a big splash when the first one was hauled up in a trawling net off the coast of South Africa nearly 70 years ago. The strange deepwater creature with the large jaw and jointed fins was found to be related to an ancient class of fish that disappeared from the fossil record 60 million years ago.</p>
        <p>Since then, most coelacanths have been found along the east coast of Africa as far north as Kenya, with a concentration around the Comoro Islands, northwest of Madagascar. Scientists have wondered whether these rare fish, scattered across more than 2,500 miles, represent separate populations or perhaps even subspecies.</p>
        <p>A genetic analysis of 47 coelacanths by German researchers shows, however, that the fish are probably all part of a single inbreeding population.</p>
        <p>The study, by scientists at the University of WÃ¼rzburg and the Max-Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology, found almost no genetic variation among the specimens. (By comparison, the researchers found a much greater variation between these coelacanths and the only other known living species, which was discovered in the late 1990's in Indonesia.)</p>
        <p>Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers suggest that this population originated around the Comoros, and that farther-flung areas were inhabited fairly recently. Coelacanths are not great ocean travelers, so the fish probably dispersed slowly along the prevailing ocean currents, which travel southward and northward from the Comoros. The more distant fish either strayed individually (in which case they represent a reproductive dead end) or in groups, forming reproducing subpopulations.</p>
        <p>The Effects of Grazing</p>
        <p>A flock of sheep or a herd of cows quietly grazing in a field is the picture of bucolic charm. But livestock grazing is not innocuous -- for one thing, it can radically alter the makeup of grasses and other vegetation in a meadow or pasture.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, it has been shown to cause population declines in some bird species that make the fields their home. But how that happens has never been clear. One suggestion is that animals trample and otherwise disturb nesting sites; another is that grazing alters the structure of vegetation, making nests more vulnerable to predators and more exposed to the elements. A third theory holds that grazing reduces the availability of food for the birds, so they produce fewer or smaller eggs.</p>
        <p>A study of meadow pipits, a small ground-nesting bird, lends support to this third theory. Researchers from Scotland and Spain measured the size of pipit eggs on eight-acre grazing plots in central Scotland. The plots were fenced off and different numbers of sheep were introduced.</p>
        <p>The study, reported in the journal Biology Letters, found that plots with the most grazing had nests with the smallest eggs. Conversely, plots with little grazing had the biggest eggs. Meadow pipits eat insects, so presumably the changes in vegetation caused by the grazing reduced the availability of certain insects.</p>
        <p>Other studies have shown that the smaller the egg, the less likely it is for a bird to survive to adulthood. So the researchers say their study offers at least a partial explanation for the declines in some bird populations. But the work also uncovered a mystery: plots with no grazing at all also had nests with small eggs. The researchers say more work is needed to determine the full relationship between grazing and egg size.</p>
        <p>A Night for Moongazers</p>
        <p>People who enjoy gazing at the Moon are in for a special treat tomorrow. The Moon will be full that night, which is only a day after the summer solstice.</p>
        <p>As a NASA scientist, Dr. Tony Phillips, points out at nasa.gov, this means that the full Moon will be lower in the sky than it has been any time since 1987. (At the solstice, the Sun is higher in the sky than any time else, and since the full Moon is on the opposite side of the sky, at the solstice it is at its lowest.)</p>
        <p>The lower the full Moon, the bigger it appears to the eye. It's just an illusion, of course, but it should make for some oohs and ahhs. Moonrise in the New York area is about 9:45.</p>
        <p>They Find Light in the Darkness</p>
        <p>On the subject of photosynthesis, you might think there was nothing new under the sun.</p>
        <p>You'd be right, in a way. The newest photosynthesizing organism has nothing to do with sunlight. It's a new bacterial species found at a hydrothermal vent 7,800 feet down in the Pacific.</p>
        <p>The only source of light for the bacteria, discovered by researchers aboard the submersible Alvin about 1,400 miles west of Costa Rica, is geothermal radiation -- infrared and visible light from the hot magma at the vent site. The single-celled organisms, which are anaerobic, apparently use these photons to convert carbon dioxide in the presence of sulfur into organic carbon for use in the cell.</p>
        <p>Dr. J. Thomas Beatty, a microbiologist at the University of British Columbia and the lead author of a paper describing the finding in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, cautioned that without further experiments there was no way of knowing for certain if the bacterium was actually photosynthesizing. ''But it seems likely that geothermal light is harvested and used,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The sample was taken from the mineral-laden plume boiling up from the vent. Dr. Beatty said that rather than living in the hot plume, it was likely that the bacteria grew in much colder conditions on the outside of the ''chimney'' of mineral deposits that form the vent, and were stirred up by the plume. ''This bacterium was being tossed around,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After analyzing the bacteria, the scientists discovered that they used light on the boundary between visible and infrared. Geothermal vents produce most of their radiation in the form of heat. ''The rates at which photons are emitted from these vents are pretty low,'' Dr. Beatty said. ''It's very dim.''</p>
        <p>So if the bacteria are photosynthesizing, it is happening very slowly. The researchers estimated that it would take a bacterium a couple of years to divide and grow into two cells. ''It almost seems not alive,'' Dr. Beatty said.</p>
        <p>The findings may have implications for life on other worlds. Scientists have speculated that on planets far from a star, life would have to be chemotrophic, using chemical rather than solar energy to grow. By showing that an organism can use another form of light, Dr. Beatty said, ''our results indicate that it's possible photosynthesis could form the foundation for an ecosystem'' on such distant worlds.</p>
