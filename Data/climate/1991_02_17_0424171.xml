        <p>Computer models of dead civilizations are notoriously unreliable, but it is now generally accepted that music disappeared sometime in the 21st century, ET (Earth Time). Though the reasons remain uncertain, considerable evidence seems to point to global warming, ultrasonic dental equipment and the prevalence of bee pollen in the atmosphere. A few researchers still hold out for alternative causes like the progressive shrinkage of the taste buds or the emission of intellectual smog from France. What no one disputes is that music, once the most pervasive social force in the world, exists today only in printed form in aural history museums.</p>
        <p>Even during the 20th century, warning signs were plentiful. In earlier periods, sequences of tones had to be imagined by a "composer" and set vibrating in the air by other persons known as "musicians," then absorbed by "audiences" made up of human subjects. By the year 2001, however, it had become possible to eliminate intermediaries. All music was composed by computers, performed by computers and experienced by audiences of computers monitored by a sprinkling of human scientists. A minimal living presence was necessary so that the effect of air vibrations on skeletal structure and brain matter could be studied, for reasons not clear to us.</p>
        <p>There do, however, exist data indicating that music was once considered so potent that it could override all obstacles of education and intellect. It apparently entered the body somewhere below the cerebellum and set the spinal cord in motion by a discharge of electrons, causing heartbeat and blood pressure to rise. A leading philosopher of the 20th century, N. Coward, reported that he was left powerless in the presence of something he identifed as "cheap music." From letters and other personal documents we know that many people not only listened obsessively to music, cheap and otherwise, but were strangely moved by it. The playing of L. V. Beethoven, an acoustical keyboardist of the period, is said to have reduced some of his listeners to tears. It is also recorded that in honor of one W. A. Mosshart shrines were erected where by law his works had to be performed seriatim for months or years on end. This at a time when any distinction was vanishing between what our ancestors called "real" music and random arrangements of sounds.</p>
        <p>Although we know too little about how and why music was made and consumed in olden times, clues do exist. Three major figures stand out in the 20th century: the composer Otis Elevator, his brother Adler and a cousin or uncle (the records are not clear) named Muzak. By means of a process unknown to us, they could, simply by funneling certain sounds into the ear, uplift or depress the listener. These peculiar effects probably took place outside the state of consciousness, though some historians contend that the subject of the experiment, while locked in a compartment, controlled the process digitally.</p>
        <p>This "Elevator" music, as it came to be called, soon pervaded every corner of the earth. Only a few persons, their awareness temporarily raised by some trauma or crisis, felt its presence. It is known that one woman, finding herself in a hospital waiting room where she was forced to listen to treacly sounds by Otis while her husband was being operated on, went berserk and assaulted a health-care provider.</p>
        <p>Originally intended as a calming influence on human emotions, Elevator music developed in radically different directions. Compressed into a pure, uncut tranquilizing substance, it could be administered by a professional music therapist. At the other extreme, it was refined into a product called "heavy metal," whose promulgation was based on the theory that if music could be played loud enough it would cease to exist.</p>
        <p>And indeed it did, though not for this reason alone. We still can only guess what event or events finally sent music, along with the dinosaur and the cormorant, into extinction. It is believed that superloud sounds of all kinds must have contributed to the deterioration of the inner ear and possibly to the shrinkage of the brain to its present economical size. But multiple causation almost certainly played a part: the simultaneous appearance of supersimple music, supercomplex music and other extreme varieties that flourished in the period of final decline.</p>
        <p>Superloud music evolved into a particularly powerful weapon. Instruments known as synthesizers, boom boxes, Walkmen, hi-fi's, CD's and TV's assumed many functions of the cruel devices described in ancient texts: the battle ax, the rack, the guillotine, the trepanning saw, the cat-o'-nine-tails and the Scum missile. A person who lived near a roadway, for instance, was tortured day and night by powerful, vehicle-borne "sound systems" that emitted bloodcurdling screams at regular intervals as well as bone-rattling thuds perplexingly known as "rhythm." No citizen was safe from music: in the home, in the church, mosque or synagogue, in the shopping mall, in the supermarket -- even, if it can be believed, in the ear doctor's office.</p>
        <p>Until recently, history moved in only one direction: forward into the void. Now that our scientists have learned to reverse that process, there might be merit in going back to investigate a phenomenon whose power our primitive ancestors valued highly without in the least understanding. Certainly they did not know how to transmit it into the future.</p>
