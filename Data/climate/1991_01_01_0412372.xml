        <p>THE United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to establish a research station on the drifting ice of the Weddell Sea in their first joint scientific effort in Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Researchers hope the station's 31 workers will obtain new data about the ice-covered sea and the floor beneath it, probably the least known oceanic region on earth.</p>
        <p>The plan is for the Soviet icebreaking research ship Akademik Federov to set up the station in January and February 1992 on a large ice floe in the southwest Weddell Sea. If possible, researchers want to establish it near latitude 73 degrees south, longitude 44 degrees west.</p>
        <p>The station is expected to drift north, parallel to the Antarctic Peninsula, the western boundary of the Weddell Sea, and along the edge of the submerged continental shelf. It is expected to move several miles a day in an irregular path as currents carry the pack ice in a giant clockwise circle.</p>
        <p>After four to six months, once the floe has moved hundreds of miles and is near the open sea, the Akademik Federov, or possibly an American icebreaker now under construction, will evacuate the station.</p>
        <p>Among the station's possible research subjects are global ocean circulation, its response to climate change and the nature of the sea floor. Ice-locked ships and a few icebreaker penetrations have provided tantalizing but fragmentary clues to these questions. Water Rich in Nutrients</p>
        <p>Recent gravity measurements from aircraft and earth satellites have hinted that the edge of the relatively shallow continental shelf is about 60 miles closer to the peninsula than had been supposed, with parts of it only 100 miles from the coast.</p>
        <p>This finding, if confirmed, would have special significance to those seeking to learn the birthplace of the Antarctic bottom water, the frigid water, rich in nutrients and oxygen, that creeps along the bottom of about three-quarters of the world's oceans, welling upward to feed great fisheries like those along the west coast of South America and in the Gulf of Guinea near west Africa. It has been assumed that this flow originates largely in the Weddell Sea, but how, where and when is uncertain.</p>
        <p>The research station is to be established near where Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance began to drift after becoming trapped in the ice in 1915. Over 281 days, subject to the whims of changing winds and currents, it was carried 570 miles north parallel to the Antarctic Peninsula. It was then crushed and went to the bottom, inaugurating an epic of polar survival.</p>
        <p>Shackleton's party set up a camp on the drifting ice. Then, as the floe neared Elephant Island, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, the explorers dragged boats to open water and reached the island. Shackleton and five companions crossed 870 miles of open sea to organize a rescue. Not a man was lost.</p>
        <p>The Soviet-American station is expected to drift along roughly the same route.</p>
        <p>The researchers will try to find a floe at least 10 feet thick and at least a mile long and a half mile wide to accommodate an airstrip and camp. Most of the equipment will be delivered by the Soviet ship, with the lighter gear being flown in by its helicopter. The supplies are to include 16 huts similar to those used for many years at Soviet drifting stations on the Arctic ice, plus additional shelters.</p>
        <p>The station party is to consist of 10 Soviet scientists, 10 American scientists, and 6 Soviet and 5 American supporting personnel. The Soviet party will include two mechanics, two cooks, a doctor and one technician. The American party will include two helicopter pilots, two mechanics and a specialist in radio and flight operations. Helicopters for Scientists</p>
        <p>The United States would furnish heaters, sleds, small tracked vehicles, sleds, food and a microwave oven. An American twin-engined Otter aircraft based at a Chilean airfield on King George Island, near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, is to fly in supplies.</p>
        <p>Two American helicopters at the drifting station are to carry scientists and their instruments to numerous observing sites near the station. They may also fly to and from Palmer Station, on the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula.</p>
        <p>American and Soviet scientists have met many times to work out detailed plans. The next such meeting, in mid-January, is to be in Bremerhaven, Germany. At another, to be held next May in Leningrad, a Soviet scientist accompanying the German research ship Polarstern as it probes the Weddell ice this month is to report on the ship's findings.</p>
        <p>One worry, said Dr. Peter Wilkniss of the National Science Foundation, director of American projects in Antarctica, is that the project could be affected by changes in the Soviet Union. The Soviet program will be under the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Leningrad.</p>
        <p>The drifting ice surrounding the Antarctic has been the nemesis of many expedition ships beside the Endurance. In 1905, five weeks after it became trapped north of the Weddell Sea, the Swedish ship Antarctic was crushed, but its crew fled across the ice. All reached land, but one then perished. In 1912, after being beset in that sea for nine months and drifting 700 miles north, the German ship Deutschland broke loose and escaped.</p>
