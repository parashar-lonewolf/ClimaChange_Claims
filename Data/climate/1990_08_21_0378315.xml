        <p>Dr. Stephen L. Feldman, a professor of energy management and policy at the University of Pennsylvania, died Saturday at the university's hospital. He was 43 years old and lived in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>For 10 years, Dr. Feldman had also been the director of the university's Center for Energy and the Environment and the chairman of its department of city and regional planning.</p>
        <p>He was a native of Newark, and a graduate of Rutgers and Johns Hopkins universities and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He had been a consultant to the World Bank, the United Nations, the Asian Development Bank and the United States Department of Energy.</p>
        <p>Dr. Feldman received awards, research grants and fellowships from the National Science Foundation and the United States's Social Science Research Council. He wrote or co-wrote 70 professional articles and four books on acid rain, pollution, solar energy and water resource management.</p>
        <p>Surviving are his wife, the former Diana Boxer; two daughters, Marin and Brooke, both of Philadelphia, and his mother, Esther, and a sister, Gladys Wakstein, both of Clark, N.J.</p>
