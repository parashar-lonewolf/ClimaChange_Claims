        <p>Though it is in overseas markets that America's alternative energy companies  are thriving, there is at least a small constituency for their products at home.</p>
        <p>The largest windmill yet erected in the United States began generating power  late last month just west of Traverse City, Mich., thanks to the willingness of  scores of local customers to pay a premium on their monthly electric bill.</p>
        <p>Traverse City Light and Power, the locally owned municipal utility, said that the windmill was the first wind power project in the nation built in response to market research that shows many Americans are willing to pay extra for electricity if their sacrifice supports investment in solar, wind or other renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>Market research by utilities suggests that anywhere from 40 percent to 70 percent of their customers may be willing to pay environmental premiums. Indeed, several utilities have pilot programs to put solar panels on the roofs of homeowners willing to share in the costs, and both utilities and car makers are  counting on an environmentalist impulse to increase sales of electric cars, despite their above-market cost.</p>
        <p>But energy analysts have long viewed such expectations as highly suspect, because consumers have been answering hypothetical questions rather than actually digging into their pockets.</p>
        <p>Traverse City's windmill will serve about 3 percent of the utility's customers, generating a modest 600 kilowatts at peak production and avoiding the use of 500 tons of coal. The 145 residential customers and 20 businesses that have signed up for the program will pay an average of 20 percent extra on their monthly bills.</p>
        <p>They have been guaranteed, though, that they will be spared any price increases other customers might face from higher fossil fuel costs or government pollution taxes during the life of their contracts -- 3 years for homeowners and 10 for businesses. Some 80 residents of the town, a tourism and agriculture center, are on a waiting list to replace dropouts.</p>
        <p>"We hope this will convince much bigger utilities than us that green pricing  can work," said Steven Smiley, the project manager.</p>
