        <p>Crashing the Borders  How Basketball Won the World and Lost Its Soul at Home  By Harvey Araton  Illustrated. 207 pages. Free Press. $25.</p>
        <p>This is the kind of book that will keep you up too late -- sometimes proclaiming ''Amen,'' other times arguing out loud with the printed page. Harvey Araton is passionate about his subject, has strong opinions and even when he's wrong -- as he is about Michael Jordan -- you have to respect his thinking.</p>
        <p>In ''Crashing the Borders,'' Mr. Araton, a sports columnist for The New York Times, takes the infamous 2004 brawl between the Indiana Pacers, the Detroit Pistons and some fans at the Palace of Auburn Hills as the starting point for his discussion of the changes in pro basketball over the last 20 years.</p>

        <p>Crashing the Borders  How Basketball Won the World and Lost Its Soul at Home  By Harvey Araton  Illustrated. 207 pages. Free Press. $25.</p>
        <p>This is the kind of book that will keep you up too late -- sometimes proclaiming ''Amen,'' other times arguing out loud with the printed page. Harvey Araton is passionate about his subject, has strong opinions and even when he's wrong -- as he is about Michael Jordan -- you have to respect his thinking.</p>
        <p>In ''Crashing the Borders,'' Mr. Araton, a sports columnist for The New York Times, takes the infamous 2004 brawl between the Indiana Pacers, the Detroit Pistons and some fans at the Palace of Auburn Hills as the starting point for his discussion of the changes in pro basketball over the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>He doesn't like much of what he sees, yet he still loves the game.</p>
        <p>Mr. Araton is like an Old Testament prophet crying in the wilderness. Not everything he writes is gospel, but the heart of his message is pure. The pro game has been on the edge of alienating its fan base for decades. When Jordan returned from his first retirement in 1993, it put a Band-Aid on a patient who really needed open-heart surgery. Mr. Araton makes a valid case that Jordan has enabled the National Basketball Association to avoid facing problems like immature players and marketing campaigns that try to turn kids into stars before they've dribbled the ball once as a pro.</p>
        <p>What we have is so many players embarrassing the game and their teams in so many ways. As Mr. Araton writes of the N.B.A. commissioner: ''Drugs, guns, gambling, misogyny; you name it, and David Stern had been given the opportunity to explain it. After a long run of dizzying growth and critical acclaim, the longtime commissioner seemed to have a permanent place on the All-Defensive Team.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern is the man who spends most of the time on basketball's spiritual tightrope. Like every commissioner in professional sports, he is supposed to be a Solomon-like figure with the ''best interest of the game'' stashed deep in his heart, but he is still paid by the owners. His bottom line is just that -- the bottom line. His goal is to keep selling the game, raising profits, expanding markets. That's why Mr. Stern is probably the biggest fan of the Houston Rockets' Yao Ming, the giant center who suddenly turned millions and millions of Chinese into hoops fans -- and consumers of N.B.A. merchandise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Araton has several superb chapters on the global growth of the N.B.A. and the influence of basketball in poverty-stricken areas of Eastern Europe. He explains why foreign players have superior fundamentals and are becoming stars in what is supposed to be ''our'' game. He also shows why our teams are suddenly being spanked in global competition -- because the international players' heart for the game is now bigger and purer than ours. They aren't polluted by the plague of summer basketball leagues, some bankrolled by shoe companies.</p>
        <p>Here comes my objection to this book: Mr. Araton blames Michael Jordan for the influence of shoe companies, for the selfish culture in the league, and would probably blame him for global warming if only he'd thought about it. While Mr. Araton gives Jordan credit for developing his game and does mention the six N.B.A. titles won by the Chicago Bulls during Jordan's era, he dwells on Jordan's flaws. He's still angry that Jordan got away with shoving Byron Russell before swishing the jumper to beat Utah and win the 1998 championship.</p>
        <p>Harvey, give it up.</p>
        <p>Jordan should be praised for his unrelenting work ethic, for how he altered his game to remain effective as he aged. Mr. Araton nails a sweet shot as he discusses the N.B.A.'s frenzy to find the next Jordan, and how that has led to so many players' being overhyped and underprepared to deal with the pressure. He examines the case of the New Jersey Nets guard Vince Carter, offering some real insights into why Carter will never be Jordan.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Araton talks about the Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James, the Next Jordan who even wears Jordan's No. 23 and has a $100 million contract from Nike. Instead of suggesting that James talk to Jordan for tips, he suggests a conversation with Carter.</p>
        <p>What for? So James can learn how to drag everyone down and force a trade, as Carter did in his final season in Toronto? James has more maturity at 20 than most N.B.A. 30-somethings. He may be a Nike huckster, but he's not just another N.B.A. dunkster. This kid is the real thing, and Mr. Araton doesn't quite know it.</p>
        <p>Understand that the fights you can pick with Mr. Araton about his book are reasons to read it. He makes you think. He makes you mad. He makes you appreciate the research that he did, and he makes you glad that he's willing to go one on one with the big issues of the N.B.A.</p>
