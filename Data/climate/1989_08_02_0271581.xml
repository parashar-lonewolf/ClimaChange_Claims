        <p>LEAD: MIKHAIL BRUNSHTEYN, formerly of the Soviet Union and now of Cedarburg, Wis., was surprised to find himself lecturing famous wine experts on the fine points of Soviet sparkling wine.</p>
        <p>MIKHAIL BRUNSHTEYN, formerly of the Soviet Union and now of Cedarburg, Wis., was surprised to find himself lecturing famous wine experts on the fine points of Soviet sparkling wine.</p>
        <p>In 1978, shortly after he applied for an exit visa, Mr. Brunshteyn (pronounced BROON-shtine) was dismissed as director of a premium winery near Odessa in the Ukraine. Until he was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1988, he worked at a decrepit winery in Odessa.</p>
        <p>''Who could have anticipated,'' he said, ''that 13 months after emigrating I would take part in an international conference and meet with wine masters from around the world and exchange knowledge?''</p>
        <p>The Washington Wine Commission invited Mr. Brunshteyn to participate in the first World Vinifera Conference, which it sponsored July 17-19 in Seattle, after Soviet officials canceled the visa of Oleg S. Melnikov of the Odessa Champagne Winery.</p>
        <p>Simon Siegl, the commission's executive director, had heard about Mr. Brunshteyn from David Mielke, the president of Arbor Crest, a Spokane, Wash., winery that imports wines from Soviet Georgia.</p>
        <p>The meeting, attended by 280 wine makers, grape growers and others in the wine trade from 8 states and 10 countries, was devoted to riesling, a grape of the vinifera species that makes great white wines in West Germany, Alsace and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The 50-year-old Mr. Brunshteyn, appearing on two panels, lectured and fielded questions in fairly fluent English, which he had polished for the first five months he lived in the United States. Before leaving his family and emigrating, he had taught himself to read and write the language. Soon, he plans to Americanize his first name to Michael.</p>
        <p>From 1963 until 1978, Mr. Brunshteyn directed the wine making at a large premium winery called Khadzhibei, 10 miles from Odessa, that made red and white and dry and sweet table wines. ''It was considered one of the best in the quality of wines and the quality of the facilities in our region,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After he applied for an exit visa in late 1978, he said, ''I was fired immediately.'' Mr. Brunshteyn, who is Jewish, attributed his decision to leave largely to ''Government-sponsored anti-Semitism'' and ''corruption and decay'' during Leonid I. Brezhnev's regime.</p>
        <p>Because of his job at Khadzhibei, Mr. Brunshteyn said, ''I had perks,'' including special access to food and clothing stores and a small apartment near the winery, in addition to his family's apartment in Odessa. His salary was 300 rubles a month, about $485 at the official exchange rate.</p>
        <p>After he was dismissed, friends found him a 180-ruble job (about $290) at a decrepit experimental winery that made cheap, sweet sparkling wine by injecting carbon dioxide into a base wine and juice from rkatsiteli, a Soviet grape (pronounced r-kat-cheh-TELL-ee, rolling the r). ''The machinery was old and falling apart,'' he said. ''I fixed and maintained it.'' He said his friends told him: '' 'You have a stigma; you don't have any choice. Don't complain.' '' And for 10 years, he said, ''I didn't.''</p>
        <p>In May 1988, he was told he could leave, and he did the next month. After boarding a jet in Rome bound for New York, he ordered a steak dinner. Did he also order wine, perhaps a Champagne, to celebrate? ''No,'' he said, ''I had a visa.'' Once settled in a one-room apartment in Queens (and later in Brooklyn), he said, ''I went to the big library on 42d Street to look for winery job information in trade journals.''</p>
        <p>He found listings of professional organizations and wrote to, among others, James Trezise, the president of the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, who sent him a packet of information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brunshteyn asked advice from J. William Moffett, the publisher of Vineyard &amp; Winery Management, a trade journal published in Watkins Glen, N.Y. Mr. Moffett composed an advertisement and ran it free of charge. ''I had four or five job offers,'' Mr. Brunshteyn said.</p>
        <p>In March, Mr. Brunshteyn became the wine maker at the Stone Mill Winery in Cedarburg, Wis., 17 miles north of Milwaukee. He is not, however, making the fine wines he did at Khadzhibei from classic European varietals like riesling, aligote, cabernet sauvignon and muscat ottonel, as well as rkatsiteli and lianyka.</p>
        <p>Stone Mill produces 6,000 cases of wines from secondary wine grapes like Niagara, Catawba and vidal blanc, along with cranberry, raspberry, blueberry and strawberry wines. But first, just as he did at the experimental winery in Odessa, Mr. Brunshteyn said, ''I had to make the machinery more usable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brunshteyn said that during his career - he worked at other wineries, one in Leningrad, another in Moldavia and a third 150 miles from Odessa - he tasted Western wines only twice. There was no shortage of Bulgarian, Hungarian, Rumanian and Yugoslav wines in Government stores in Odessa. But fine wines from all over the Soviet Union could not be found there, he said.</p>
        <p>''In Chicago,'' he said, ''maybe you can buy champagne from Woodbury,'' a winery in Dunkirk, N.Y. ''But in Odessa you can buy champagne only from Odessa, and in Kiev, champagne from Kiev.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brunshteyn, who is divorced, will soon be joined by his only child, Milena, 16. His mother died two weeks after he left the Soviet Union, and his father still lives in Odessa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brunshteyn was asked if he would like to work in the Napa Valley or in Sonoma County. ''I just took my job in March,'' he replied. ''People are nice to me. I don't want to make people on whom I'm economically dependent angry.'' But, he was pressed, would he prefer California? ''If somebody made an offer,'' he said, ''I would consider it.''</p>
