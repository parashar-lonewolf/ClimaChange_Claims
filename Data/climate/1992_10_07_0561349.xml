        <p>When Roger G. Kennedy wanted to mark the bicentennial of the Constitution in 1987, the director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History chose to mount an exhibition chronicling one of the most extreme Constitutional violations in American history: the internment of 120,000 Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p>
        <p>Never one to shy away from either controversy or showmanship, the 66-year-old director said today that he was stepping down after 13 years during which he transformed what had been called "the nation's attic" from a stodgy repository of old locomotives and First Ladies' gowns into a politically provocative and frequently flashy panoply of programs about topics like the origins of urban black America and the historical travails of feminism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy recast what had been a more or less conventional series of exhibit halls into a cross between a walk-through classroom and a movie set, designed to educate museum-goers about the nation's history.  America's Significant Past'</p>
        <p>"We laid out a curriculum a decade ago, to restore to all American people their memory of their significant past, and much of that is now in place," he said, announcing his decision to leave the museum to work on historical documentaries for the Discovery Channel.</p>
        <p>Critics have questioned the seriousness of a museum that highlights Judy Garland's ruby slippers from "The Wizard of Oz" or a Theodore Roosevelt-era teddy bear, as well as the politically charged subtext of some exhibits, like "A More Perfect Union," the barbed-wire-laced display about the Japanese-American detention camps. But many museum professionals praise Mr. Kennedy for bridging the gap between academic history and the public.</p>
        <p>While moving away from a celebratory approach, touting the achievements of great men and the wonders of technology, Mr. Kennedy and his 50 curators and 380 other staff members have informed their exhibitions with the often populist perspectives of social history, focusing on the everyday lives of Americans.</p>
        <p>"Because it's the national museum, it has to be all things to all people," said Robert McC. Adams, the Secretary of the Smithsonian. "But, with Roger's enormously wide peripheral vision, he has reached out to all groups with style and intelligence." Lawyer by Training</p>
        <p>A tireless advocate for history museums, documentary films and other forms of "public history," Mr. Kennedy came to the Smithsonian in 1979 with no formal museum background but the resume of a dedicated dilettante. A lawyer by training, he had been an NBC television correspondent, a bank chairman and a vice president of the University of Minnesota and the Ford Foundation.</p>
        <p>Recalling the early days of the museum, Richard Rabinowitz, the director of the American History Workshop, a New York exhibition-planning group, said: "It had been a collection of spectacular oddities, presenting the basic myth of American history as onward and upward. Now, it's become a model for exhibit experimentation, with many different styles of presentation and moods."</p>
        <p>Indeed, the museum, a hulking, 28-year-old marble mausoleum on the Mall designed by McKim, Mead and White, has become a smorgasbord of versions of the American past. While big snatches remain of the stuffy old museum -- exhibit cases of stamps and Victorian goblets -- Mr. Kennedy and his staff have taken considerable pains to mix things up with exhibitions designed to provoke and engage the museum's 5.5 million visitors each year.</p>
        <p>"We've tried to diversify the picture of history that people get," said Spencer Crew, the museum's deputy director who is to become acting director when Mr. Kennedy departs on Dec. 1. "But Roger has also made us think about how to present themes while entertaining people." Renaming of Museum</p>
        <p>A harbinger of the changes came in 1980, when Mr. Kennedy convinced the Smithsonian to rename the institution from the Museum of History and Technology to the National Museum of American History. Soon after came the reinstallation of the tattered flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The Star-Spangled Banner." Saying that "some things should be treated in a reverential manner, with drumbeats and trumpets," Mr. Kennedy had the flag placed at the museum's entrance behind a giant flag that lowers once an hour while a recording plays the national anthem in its original waltz time.</p>
        <p>Typical of the new exhibitions is "Field to Factory: Afro-American Migration, 1915-1940." In it, visitors walk through a hot, dusty tableau of the rural South, where spirituals waft out of a simple wooden chapel, and proceed through a Virginia railroad station with separate doors marked "white" and "colored" to a re-created Philadelphia row house.</p>
        <p>The combination of scholarly iconoclasm and Mr. Kennedy's axiom that "education is entertainment" will continue in three exhibitions now in the works, on the impact of science on this country, rock music and the optimistic ideology of 19th-century America.</p>
        <p>"Science and American Life," which will open next year, will begin with the first postgraduate science laboratories at Johns Hopkins University in the 1870's, and conclude with examinations of contemporary issues like holes in the ozone layer and genetic engineering, said Ed Ezell, the acting chairman of the museum's department of science and technology. Examining American Ideals</p>
        <p>In "Land of Promise," 19th-century American ideals will be examined "through different prisms of six very different groups," freed slaves in South Carolina, dislocated Cherokees, Connecticut factory owners and workers, Cincinnati Jews, middle-class farmers and early Los Angelenos, said Lonnie Bunch, the museum's assistant director for curatorial affairs.</p>
        <p>The museum's attention to the flaws as well as the triumphs of American history has irked few visitors, say museum staff members. But Mr. Kennedy said he received death threats when "A More Perfect Union" opened, and that some members of Congress have unsuccessfully tried to screen exhibit texts before new shows opened. But the federally funded museum has generally steered clear of the political-cultural skirmishes that have engulfed the National Endowment for the Arts, in part because the director "has made the museum not only more inclusive but more attractive," said Representative Sidney R. Yates, the Illinois Democrat whose Interior subcommittee oversees Federal financing of the arts.</p>
        <p>The museum's most serious challenge has come from cuts in Government financing for exhibitions during the 1980's. While Mr. Kennedy has raised about $25 million in private money during his tenure, to supplement the museum's $18-million-a-year in Federal support, many corporations have been wary about sponsoring exhibits with even a whiff of political content.</p>
        <p>This chill affected one seemingly tame project this year, the redesign of the popular First Ladies exhibit from a gallery of inaugural gowns to a more diverse display, about the varieties and difficulties of political partnerships, the role of First Ladies as social advocates and even the status of some as "First Widow." After years of unsuccessful fund-raising efforts, Edie Mayo, the exhibition's curator, had to turn to special in-house funds to open the exhibition this spring.</p>
        <p>With further Smithsonian cutbacks expected and corporate arts philanthropy declining, curators are worried. As Ms. Mayo said, "If you can't get a single American corporation to underwrite something as mainstream as First Ladies at the Smithsonian, how can you get really gutsy issues funded?"</p>
