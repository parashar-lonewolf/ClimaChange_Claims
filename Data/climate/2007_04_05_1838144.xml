        <p>New York State is getting its first fish pathologist. A million dollars is going to jump-start the effort to provide cellphone service along a major highway in the Adirondacks where a Brooklyn man died, unable to get a signal. And the state's dairy farmers will get $30 million to help them recover from a bad year.</p>
        <p>There are eight million stories buried in Gov. Eliot Spitzer's first state budget, which was passed last weekend as the governor squared off with Republicans in the State Senate over education aid to suburban districts and with the health care workers' union and a hospital association over his plans to reduce Medicaid spending.</p>
        <p>The health care battle was especially fierce, with multimillion-dollar ad campaigns on both sides. Mr. Spitzer used half a million dollars of his own money, in addition to campaign funds, on his television ads, an aide said.</p>
        <p>While Senate Republicans have been vociferously claiming victory, the governor toured the state proclaiming that he was the winner of his first budget battle. During a stop in Chili, a suburb of Rochester, on Wednesday, the governor was asked about Senator Joseph L. Bruno's recent comments suggesting that he was the big winner.</p>
        <p>''The only person I know who should be gloating is the taxpayer in the state of New York, because I won on every issue,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''If he's gloating, he misunderstands what happened. Health care reform, education reform, property tax reform, fiscal discipline -- these are the issues I fought for, and these are the issues I won.''</p>
        <p>There were other issues that played out mostly below the radar. Here are just a few of them:</p>
        <p>The fish pathologist -- who is expected to help the state deal with invasive species, and with diseases killing off fish in the Great Lakes -- is one of 109 positions being added to the Department of Environmental Conservation, whose staff was reduced by the Pataki administration. The department is getting more lawyers for its enforcement division, more engineers, chemists and biologists -- and a new office of climate change. That office will have up to a dozen workers overseeing the state's efforts to limit pollution from power plants and cars, and to find other ways for the state to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Environmentalists cheered the additions.</p>
        <p>And the Department of Environmental Conservation finally has a new commissioner. The confirmation of Alexander B. Grannis, a former Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan, was held up by Republicans in the State Senate for months -- so long that his supporters took to brandishing signs that said, ''Free Pete,'' referring to him by his nickname. Over the weekend, as a budget agreement came together, the Senate finally voted to confirm him.</p>
        <p>The budget also includes $1 million that could be used to help the state get cellphone towers along a stretch of Interstate 87 known as the Northway that goes through the Adirondacks. Attempts to extend cellphone service there have fizzled, as environmentalists have won restrictions on what kind of towers can be built, and cellphone companies have expressed concerns about the profitability of providing service there.</p>
        <p>The debate over service was renewed earlier this year when a man froze to death after his car veered off the road and his wife was unable to get a cellphone signal to call 911.</p>
        <p>State Senator Elizabeth Little, a Republican who represents the area, said in a statement: ''The goal is to provide service that is fully funded by a cellphone carrier, not requiring support from the state. But given the existing state policy that restricts the height of cellphone towers in the Adirondacks, a state subsidy may be appropriate.''</p>
        <p>The $30 million for the state's dairy farmers is supposed to help them recover from economic conditions last year, when they found themselves squeezed by price controls that kept milk prices low as feed and fuel costs rose quickly.</p>
        <p>''There was a huge number of farmers who were borrowing money every month to meet their needs,'' said Assemblyman William Magee, a Democrat from the central part of the state, who pushed for the aid along with Senator Cathy Young, a Republican.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, as the final budget bills were passed, Mr. Magee wore his success in winning the farm subsidy around his neck, in the form of a necktie that showed cows drinking beer. ''They're celebrating,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some stories are notable not for what happened, but for what did not happen. Judges across the state are furious that they did not get pay raises they were seeking. Lawmakers said they were unlikely to raise the pay for judges without raising their own pay, and so far there has been no deal for a legislative pay raise. So the judges must wait.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 5, 2007, Saturday  An article on April 5 about details of Gov. Eliot Spitzer's first New York State budget included erroneous information from a Spitzer aide about the position of fish pathologist for the Department of Environmental Conservation. (The error first appeared on Feb. 5 in the Empire Zone column, about Mr. Spitzer's first month in office.) The budget adds one position to those that already exist; the fish pathologist to be hired will not in fact be the state's first.</p>
