        <p>WHEN he's not at work, or sailing in Maine's Penobscot Bay in a Wianno Senior -- a 25-foot-long wooden-hulled sloop -- Jackson W. Robinson tends to the organic vegetables in his garden.</p>
        <p>That is no surprise, given that he is the child of ''green'' parents, Ed and Carolyn Robinson. During World War II, they wrote ''The Have-More Plan,'' a back-to-nature tome that is still in print. (Storey Books, $9.95)</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, 57, is manager of the $50.1 million Green Century Balanced fund, which invests only in companies that he deems to be environmentally friendly. But that is not all. Profits from the fund are passed on to a consortium of advocacy  groups -- mostly public interest research groups -- that own the fund's adviser, Green Century Capital Management, through a partnership. The money is used for litigation, research and educational programs.</p>
        <p>Investors, meanwhile, are rolling in green. The fund returned 42.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through March 24. That compares with 36.8 percent for one of its peer groups, small growth funds, and 13.6 percent for balanced funds,  according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson divides the universe of 10,000 publicly traded United States stocks into three categories --  what he calls ''the greens, the cleans and the dirties.''</p>
        <p>''A green company is part of the environmental solution,'' said Mr. Robinson. ''Clean companies, like those in financial and health care,  don't contribute either to the solution or the problem. Dirty companies have high levels of waste streams, Superfund sites or environmental litigation.''</p>
        <p>He avoids companies associated with fossil fuels, tobacco, weaponry and nuclear power.</p>
        <p>To pick the fund's three dozen or so stocks, he looks for small- to mid-cap growth companies with returns on equity of more than 15 percent and annual earnings growth of at least 20 percent. These companies tend to be market leaders, he said, and tend to have successful new products, services or technology.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson likes to examine a  company's ratio of sales to capital expenditures. The multiple varies by industry, he said, but big ratios flag companies that tend to use capital efficiently.</p>
        <p>He also seeks earnings catalysts like new management or products, heavy spending on research and development or a shift to higher-growth businesses. He is de-emphasizing quantitative measurements like price-to-earnings ratios, he said, ''because we have such major deviations in the market.''</p>
        <p>The fund's prospectus states that the portfolio will generally keep at least 25 percent of its assets in bonds or cash. It now holds 16 fixed-income issues, mostly junk bonds. He favors short-term issues, because interest rates are rising; the average duration of the fund's bonds is just under five years, and they yield 9.5 percent, on average.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson sees value in what he calls the emerging energy group, companies that make and service solar and wind power projects and fuel cells. The group's revenue and profits are growing at 20 to 40 percent a year, he said. He is also bullish on the natural and organic food industry, which is seeing sales and earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent a year, versus 3 to 4 percent for traditional grocery stores.</p>
        <p>ONE favorite is United Natural Foods of Dayville, Conn., a rapidly growing distributor of natural and organic foods. Mr. Robinson bought shares at $10 to $11 in December; the price had tumbled from nearly $30 in February 1999 because of what he called an ill-managed acquisition.</p>
        <p>In early 1999, he said, the manager in charge of the company's successful Western division, Michael S. Funk, became chief executive. Mr. Funk, he said, had already fixed many problems arising from the merger, so Mr. Robinson has confidence in him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson expects shares to trade in the $25-to-$30 range over the next 12 to 18 months; he predicts earnings growth of 16 to 17 percent a year, on average, over three years. The stock now trades at $15, or 13 times his earnings estimate of $1.15 a share for 2001.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is Astropower of Newark, Del., an independent manufacturer of solar modules and panels and photovoltaic cells. The company has cut production costs, Mr. Robinson said, by building modules on an assembly line; it uses silicon discarded by semiconductor makers.</p>
        <p>About 80 percent of the company's sales are overseas. ''Europe is far ahead of the U.S. in terms of alternative energy and wind,'' he said, adding that the company is working on new applications like solar-powered cellular phones and hand-held computers.</p>
        <p>He bought shares at $6 at the initial offering in March 1998. The stock now trades at $32.3125, or 42 times his 2001 earnings estimate of 75 cents a share. He predicts earnings growth of 50 percent, annualized, over three years; his 12-  to 18-month price target for the stock is $50.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson bought shares of Uniroyal Technology of Sarasota, Fla., at $36 in January. The company, spun off from Uniroyal Tire, sold a business that produces high-quality plastics in February and plans to divest its remaining small plastics operations. It makes bright, long-lasting light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.'s, that are replacing incandescent bulbs used in traffic lights because they use less power, Mr. Robinson said. ''Ultimately,'' he added, ''we will see L.E.D. used in buildings, significantly decreasing the demand for electricity.'' The devices can also be used in flat-panel computers and home electronics, he said.</p>
        <p>He expects the company to break even in 2001 and sees earnings of $2 to $3 a share in 2003. The stock trades at $47; his 12-  to 18-month price target is $100.</p>
