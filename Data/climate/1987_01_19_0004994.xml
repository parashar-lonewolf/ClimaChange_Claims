        <p>It's no surprise that the 1987 Council of Economic Advisers' Economic Report of the President will find much to celebrate in the Reagan economy, according to those who have perused its galleys. To be published Jan. 29, the report will celebrate the fall of inflation and interest rates.</p>
        <p>It will make something less of the economy's relatively slow growth and something more of job creation, maintaining that, in four years, more jobs have been created in the United States than in the 10 next largest industrial countries combined.</p>
        <p>But the authors will note that problems remain, in trade, the budget deficit and agriculture, and they have prepared a chapter on each of the subjects emphasizing solutions the President has already offered.</p>
        <p>That theme of restoring the country's ''competitiveness'' permeates the report and the President's letter that introduces it. The report also explores the advance of women into the marketplace, which it finds resoundingly successful.</p>
        <p>In another chapter, it explores matters of risk, responsibility and Government regulation, running from the personal level, such as smoking, to the matter of acid rain. It examines the trade-offs involved in the regulatory changes behind the nation's shift from large cars to seat belts and small cars. ''It says you need to think about these regulations before putting them into play,'' according to one who has read the proofs.</p>
