        <p>THE problem with fossil fuels like coal and oil is that they come out of the ground with unwanted impurities. The least wanted is sulfur, which is corrosive in refineries and power plants and, when the fuels are burned, is emitted as sulfur oxides that are linked to acid rain.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the difference between a desirable "sweet" crude oil and an unwanted "sour" crude is its sulfur content. But, as the sweet grades are consumed, the average amount of sulfur in the crude oil processed in refineries is rising. Meanwhile, environmental rules are limiting the amount of sulfur than can be emitted from automobile tail pipes and smokestacks.</p>

        <p>THE problem with fossil fuels like coal and oil is that they come out of the ground with unwanted impurities. The least wanted is sulfur, which is corrosive in refineries and power plants and, when the fuels are burned, is emitted as sulfur oxides that are linked to acid rain.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the difference between a desirable "sweet" crude oil and an unwanted "sour" crude is its sulfur content. But, as the sweet grades are consumed, the average amount of sulfur in the crude oil processed in refineries is rising. Meanwhile, environmental rules are limiting the amount of sulfur than can be emitted from automobile tail pipes and smokestacks.</p>
        <p>Most pollution control techniques in the past focused on capturing the sulfur oxides after combustion has taken place. But these controls have often been clumsy and expensive.</p>
        <p>A better approach, most agree, would be to get the sulfur out of the fuel before it is burned. This may provide an opportunity for a small Houston-area company and its investors.</p>
        <p>The Energy Biosystems Corporation is developing a method to use genetically engineered microorganisms to pull sulfur out of crude oil without damaging the fuel content of the hydrocarbons. The company had an initial public offering last March at $6 a share and has traded as high as $14 since. It closed yesterday at $11.50, off $1.</p>
        <p>"There's no question that this is speculative," said Hugh Holman, an analyst at Alex Brown &amp; Sons. "But if it works it will change the way the global oil refining business works."</p>
        <p>Biological desulfurization has been rattling around laboratories for decades. The problem is that bugs with a taste for sulfur consume some of the oil as well, lowering the fuel value.</p>
        <p>Energy Biosystems' microorganisms, which were discovered by the Institute of Gas Technology in 1988, do not metabolize the sulfur. Instead, they generate an enzyme that acts as a catalyst to remove sulfur without harming the hydrocarbons.</p>
        <p>The enzyme works at prevailing temperature and pressure, in contrast to the higher temperatures and pressures required for conventional desulfurization. That should make the technology attractive by reducing the cost of the equipment used for sulfur removal.</p>
        <p>The problem is that at this point, the bugs do not generate enough enzymes to have commercial value. The company is trying to use the biotechnology techniques developed over the last two decades to find the genes responsible for enzyme production and genetically tweak the organism to increase output.</p>
        <p>The microorganisms themselves are patented and company officials feel that the genetic engineering to improve enzyme production will be patentable as well, giving it protection against competitors.</p>
        <p>"We are up 400-fold from the organism's native state," said Jeffrey A. Nagle, director of marketing, referring to the amount of enzyme currently produced by the organism. "But we need to operate 100 to 1,000 times more efficiently."</p>
        <p>As the 25 or so biotechnicians at the company work on improving the bugs' performance, its executives have been forging alliances to get the technology to market quickly if the laboratory work is successful. It has alliances with Texaco Inc., the Koch Refining Company, a large, privately owned refiner, Solvay Enzymes Inc., which produces industrial enzymes, and the Petrolite Corporation, a producer of refinery equipment.</p>
        <p>Investors who are attracted by the technology's potential had better be prepared to be patient. Even under optimistic estimates, no earnings are expected before the latter part of the decade. "Investors will have to wait three or four years to see any financial returns," Mr. Holman said. "But if the technology works, it could be big."</p>
