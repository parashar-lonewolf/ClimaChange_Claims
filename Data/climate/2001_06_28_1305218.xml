        <p>Japanese officials paving the way for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's first visit here have warned the Bush team that some of Mr. Koizumi's plans are likely to worsen Japan's economic troubles over the next few years, with potentially major effects on the American economy.</p>
        <p>In briefings at the White House and the Treasury this week, the officials have told Mr. Bush's aides that a likely effect of Mr. Koizumi's promise of rapid deregulation and a long-overdue repair of Japan's crippled banking system could be a temporary decline in the value of the yen.</p>
        <p>That poses a vexing problem for Mr. Bush. Although he has publicly welcomed Mr. Koizumi's embrace of the economic changes that a succession of American presidents, including Mr. Bush's father, have urged, a result in the next few years could be to make Japanese imports like cars and steel less expensive in the United States.</p>
        <p>That could increase competition for American manufacturers who are already dealing with a downturn. Or, as a Bush aide put it recently, ''They are doing the right thing at what turns out to be a very bad moment for us.''</p>
        <p>With a strong dollar -- far stronger than it might be if Japan and Europe were healthy -- American products are more expensive in foreign markets, and imports are comparatively less expensive here. This year, even as American economic prospects have dimmed and interest rates have been slashed, the world has continued to buy the dollar and sell the yen. The yen's value has declined 7.8 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is not too likely to discuss this problem publicly when he meets Mr. Koizumi on Saturday at Camp David in a carefully managed visit that is intended to reaffirm the strength of the United States-Japan military alliance.</p>
        <p>Nor is the White House eager to discuss two major areas of disagreement. One is the administration's determination to extend its plans for missile defense into the Pacific, a move that Japanese officials fear would be a provocation to China. The second area is Mr. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto treaty on global warming. Japanese officials fervently support it, though they say they have no illusions about changing Mr. Bush's mind.</p>
        <p>When Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain visited Camp David soon after Mr. Bush's inauguration, the two leaders held a joint news conference near the mountain retreat. Japan wants nothing less, noting that in 1993 Bill Clinton used a similar news conference with another Japanese reformer.</p>
        <p>But White House officials deflected Japan's desire for a lengthy joint appearance, leaving Mr. Koizumi to speak alone to reporters later in the day.</p>
        <p>The warnings to the administration in recent days have been made through many channels, including by a special emissary, Haruo Shimada, a economics professor from Keio University who went to college with the new prime minister. Mr. Shimada said in an interview that he had warned Mr. Bush's economic aides that Mr. Koizumi's efforts to deregulate the economy and get rid of hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans still on the books of its huge banks would ''mean more job losses and a higher rate of deflation.''</p>
        <p>Deflation is the erosion of prices, an economic oddity in postwar industrialized economies, and it can have effects as ravaging and uncontrollable as inflation. All recent indicators show that Japan is slipping into yet another recession.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's private position on the prospect of a weaker yen has been that it is willing to accept a weaker currency if Japan puts structural changes in place first. But Mr. Bush's aides are concerned that if Mr. Bush encourages Mr. Koizumi's plan too strongly on Saturday, the yen will be sold off in the markets long before it is clear whether the new prime minister can deliver.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1990's, American companies paid little attention to the yen, because with factories running full speed and demand high, the effects of Japanese competition seemed to fade. Congress even paid little attention to trade deficits that were as large, or larger, than those of the 1980's, when they seemed a symbol of Japanese dominance.</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Bush finds himself in a position reminiscent of the one that vexed his father. American companies, hurting at home, are seeking relief from imports. Mr. Bush has responded, starting an action against Japan and other nations that the administration accuses of ''dumping'' steel here at unfairly low prices. With a weak yen, Honda and Toyota, among other Japanese makers, will be in a better position to to undercut</p>
