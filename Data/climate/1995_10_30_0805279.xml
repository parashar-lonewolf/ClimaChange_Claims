        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Restaurants Find Ban on Smoking Popular" (letter, Oct. 19):</p>
        <p>If the restaurateur Michael O'Neal believes that smoking or nonsmoking is "a nonevent," he is sadly mistaken.</p>
        <p>Any number of polls have indicated that most U.S. adults would prefer to leave the smoking/nonsmoking issue up to the marketplace. Those of us who smoke, as well as many of us who do not, are appalled at the anti-smoking hysteria, and have chosen to vote with our feet. We simply do not patronize restaurants that do not accommodate smokers.</p>
        <p>Whether I am in New York or Austin or Washington, D.C. (where, by the way, I see ashtrays everywhere), I and millions of others will not patronize an establishment that practices knee-jerk discrimination resulting from the E.P.A.'s scientifically and statistically questionable study on "secondhand smoke."</p>
        <p>If this country has an air-quality problem it lies in our addiction to fossil fuels. If it has a health problem, it lies in the way we eat and exercise (or, rather, don't exercise).</p>
        <p>According to Everett Koop, M.D., the former Surgeon General, weight-related diseases killed 300,000 Americans in 1994. More than $70 billion a year in unnecessary health-care expenses is the price tag. The American life style, emphasizing rich foods and leisure, is the prime contributor to the epidemic of diabetes in this country, an epidemic that costs the U.S. $85 billion directly and accounts for another $47 billion in disability costs, lost productivity and premature death. Is it time to demonize fat?</p>
        <p>If Mr. O'Neal really desires public spaces to be nonsmoking, he should concentrate on his own, eliminating his grudging allotment of 22 restaurant seats, ban smoking in his bar and leave others to do the same. ANNE FENNELL Austin, Tex., Oct. 26, 1995</p>
