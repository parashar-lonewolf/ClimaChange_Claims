        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In defense of his right to own and operate an S.U.V., Mitchell A. Levin (Letters, Oct. 27) may gull the innocent New Yorker, but he can't fool the foxy Midwesterner. I grew up in Iowa, lived there until the age of 27 and survived very well, thanks, driving two-wheel-drive vehicles through winters still unmoderated by global warming (where he finds a snowdrift to drive through these days, I can't say). Iowa roads were planned on the Jeffersonian ideal -- ruler straight, square-cornered and absurdly easy to drive on -- and the Iowa Department of Transportation is (or was) efficient and well financed. An ex-Southerner (as Levin says he is) may shrink at the prospect of ''a few flakes,'' but a Midwesterner never will.</p>
