        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your June 17 news article reporting criticism of the report by the United Nations scientific panel on climate change gives credence to biased criticisms about the report's integrity.</p>
        <p>Critics suggest that chapter 8 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report was "doctored" just before publication to remove statements that address uncertainties about the extent of human influence on climate change. They also suggest that the alleged modifications to the report were politically motivated. These criticisms are based upon an inaccurate evaluation  of the report and of the process by which the report was finalized.</p>
        <p>Dr. Benjamin D. Santer, lead author of chapter 8, has pointed out that the language in the released report incorporates modifications and revisions of an October 1995 draft based on suggestions made at the Madrid meeting in November 1995. These revisions in no way modify the conclusion. This language was approved unanimously by representatives of the nearly 100 nations attending.</p>
        <p>Anyone reading chapter 8 will find multiple references to variability and uncertainty in these estimates. In spite of these uncertainties, the evidence leads to the conclusion that human activities can, and do, influence climate.</p>
        <p>TIMOTHY COWLES Professor, College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences Oregon State University Corvallis, Ore., June 18, 1996</p>
