        <p>LEAD: The Soviet spacecraft Phobos 2 today entered into orbit around Mars, bringing it closer to landing on the Martian moon Phobos. The mission is the first in the Soviet Union's program to land a man on Mars in the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>The Soviet spacecraft Phobos 2 today entered into orbit around Mars, bringing it closer to landing on the Martian moon Phobos. The mission is the first in the Soviet Union's program to land a man on Mars in the next 25 years.</p>
        <p>The unmanned spacecraft's braking engine fired at 3:55 P.M. Moscow time (7:55 A.M. Eastern time), thrusting the craft into orbit after a trip of more than half a billion miles, the official news agency Tass said.</p>
        <p>''The planet of Mars has acquired one more satellite,'' the Tass report said, adding that the mission ''will bring mankind closer to unravelling mysteries of the planet.''</p>
        <p>Soviet scientists have told American colleagues that they plan to land the craft on Phobos by early April, slightly earlier than the original schedule. Problems Raised Anxiety</p>
        <p>A series of persistent electrical malfunctions on Phobos 2, coming after the loss last September of the mission's sister spacecraft, Phobos 1, has heightened scientists' anxiety over the project.</p>
        <p>If the mission succeeds, Phobos will become the fourth extraterrestrial body - after Earth's moon, Venus and Mars - on which spacecraft have landed. The last missions to Mars were two landings in 1976 by the United States' Viking craft.  The Soviets have been less successful in exploring Mars than has the United States. But since the United States launched the two exploratory spacecraft still operating - Pioneer 12, which orbits Venus, and Voyager 2, which has transmitted information about Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus and is to pass Neptune this August - the Soviets launched several missions to Venus and to Halley's comet.</p>
        <p>Besides studying Phobos, whose orbit keeps it within 3,720 miles of Mars, scientists hope to obtain a temperature map of the Martian surface. By discerning temperature patterns, both daily and seasonally, locating the heat-emitting and the permanently frozen areas, and identifying the mineral and chemical makeup of the planet's soil, scientists expect to get a better idea of what kind of life - if any - exists on mars.</p>
        <p>Previous missions to study Mars have determined that the planet has a very thin atmosphere that is 95 percent carbon dioxide, as well as low temperatures and an absence of photosynthesis and of a magnetic field. This information has reduced scientific expectation that the planet sustains life.</p>
        <p>The exploration of Phobos might also offer clues to the development of the solar system. The small moon, with a diameter of no more than 14 miles, is larger and closer to Mars than Deimos, the planet's other moon, and is believed to be an asteroid trapped by Martian gravity. If that is the case, this mission would be the first to land on such a small space object.</p>
        <p>Phobos 2 was launched from the Baikonur space station in Soviet Central Asia last July 12, five days after the nearly identical Phobos 1 was sent into space. The crafts were part of an ambitious joint mission to study Mars and Phobos, the sun and interplanetary space.</p>
        <p>But a little more than a month after liftoff, Phobos 1 was lost in space after a flight command error disoriented it.</p>
        <p>That failure cost millions of dollars and invaluable research. The payload included experiments designed by 13 different countries, including France and West Germany, or international space agencies. Although some of the experiments were backed up on Phobos 2, scientists had hoped to compare the results of identical experiments on the two craft.</p>
        <p>Phobos 2 has also been plagued by technical problems.</p>
        <p>Tass reported in December, for example, that Soviet scientists experienced repeated trouble with the craft, including small malfunctions in the electrical system and the camera. One American scientist said he understood that there had also been problems in radio transmissions from Phobos 2. Change Tied to Wariness</p>
        <p>American scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who are helping to track the Phobos mission, said Soviet scientists told them the problems had been either corrected or compensated for and should not jeopardize the mission.</p>
        <p>But James Campbell, an engineer at the Pasadena laboratory, said that apparently wary of further malfunctions, the Soviets plan to speed up by two or three weeks the landing of the craft on the Phobos.</p>
        <p>Original plans called for sending the lander module down to Phobos in late April. But the Americans say they have been told the landing has been moved up to between March 30 and April 7.</p>
        <p>But Soviet officials, who since the failure of Phobos 1 have been generally gun shy about announcing the mission schedule in advance, have not announced the change.</p>
