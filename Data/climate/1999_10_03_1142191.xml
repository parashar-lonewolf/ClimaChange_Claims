        <p>World Tourism Organization, based in Madrid, forecasts that China will be top tourist destination in year 2020, France will drop from first place to second in number of arrivals and US will remain third; other statistics given (M)</p>

        <p>IT may not be too soon to start brushing up on Chinese. Why? Because by 2020, China is expected to become the world's top tourist destination with 130 million annual visitors, and 100 million Chinese are expected to visit other lands.</p>
        <p>By comparison, China had a relatively modest 24 million visitors last year, good enough for sixth place, while the 8.4 million Chinese visitors to other lands (''outbound tourists'') ranked ninth. But its 100 million outbound tourists will account for almost a quarter of the 405 million Asian travelers expected by 2020, a staggering increase from the region's 84.4 million outbound travelers in 1995.</p>

        <p>By comparison, China had a relatively modest 24 million visitors last year, good enough for sixth place, while the 8.4 million Chinese visitors to other lands (''outbound tourists'') ranked ninth. But its 100 million outbound tourists will account for almost a quarter of the 405 million Asian travelers expected by 2020, a staggering increase from the region's 84.4 million outbound travelers in 1995.</p>
        <p>These forecasts are from the Madrid-based World Tourism Organization, a worldwide group of 138 countries and territories that gathers tourism statistics and publishes reports. At the International Tourism Asia trade show in Hong Kong last month, the organization also predicted that  by 2020 France will drop from first to second place in arrivals (even though its visitors will increase to 106.1 million by 2020, up from 70 million last year) and the United States will remain third (102.4 million visitors, up from 47.1 million currently). Spain, with 47.7 million visitors last year, will have 73.9 million in 2020, yet still drop a notch to fourth place. Hong Kong, currently 18th with almost 9.7 million visitors, will vault to fifth place with 56.6 million.</p>
        <p>The remaining top 10 positions are expected to be occupied by Britain (currently in fifth place), Italy (currently fourth), Mexico (seventh), the Russian Federation (13th) and the Czech Republic (12th).</p>
        <p>The tourist organization also predicted that the ubiquitous Germans, who have long led in outbound travelers, including 82.9 million last year, will continue to lead the list with almost 153 million in 2020. Japanese travelers, who numbered 16.8 million in 1997, the latest figure available, will soar to 141 million, for second place, while the 123.3 million outbound Americans in 2020 will be more than twice the 52.7 million who traveled in 1997.</p>
        <p>Predictions, of course, are informed guesses at best, but World Tourism Organization forecasts have often been on target or close to it. Two years ago, for example, it forecast that China will be the world's number one destination by the year 2020, and it stuck to that prediction despite the recent economic crisis in East Asia and the Pacific, which draws many of its tourists from the region. At the Hong Kong meeting, the organization said that to prepare for the expected influx, the Chinese Government is investing a lot of money in promoting tourism and relaxing laws governing the tourist industry.</p>
        <p>The tourism organization also predicted almost a year ago that tourism to East Asia and the Pacific would bounce back stronger than ever after 2000, barring any new major incident. And at the Hong Kong conference, Deborah Luhrman, a World Tourism spokeswoman, told delegates that the economy of the region seems to be stabilizing.  Despite the economic battering, East Asia and the Pacific still drew a respectable 87 million tourists last year, according to Francesco Frangialli, the organization's secretary-general. Much of the shortfall in Japanese tourists, he said, was offset by Europeans and North Americans attracted by lower prices and good package deals.</p>
        <p>Signs of a comeback are already apparent in several Asian nations. Tourist arrivals to Hong Kong, for example, increased 11.1 percent for the first seven months of this year, compared with the same months of 1998. Thailand posted an 11 percent increase through June of this year over the first six months of 1998. And Singapore tourism rose 9.5 percent through July, compared with the same seven months of 1998, even though visitors from Japan fell almost 13 percent.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it is important to remember that many predictions about tourism are as fleeting as the lifespan of the mosquito. Two years ago, for example, the World Tourism Organization predicted that ''the tourists of the 21st century will be traveling further afield on their holidays, with the percentage of long-haul travel increasing from 18 percent in 1995 to 24 percent by 2020.'' But 13 months later, in November 1998, the W.T.O.'s Business Council (a group representing the private sector within the larger organization) released a study saying that because the amount of leisure time available for many people is likely to decline, the trend to shorter, more frequent holidays closer to home will accelerate -- a trend that has been pronounced in the United States for almost a decade.</p>
        <p>Add to that the periodic warnings -- the first more than a year ago from the World Congress on Snow and World Tourism, the most recent a report for the Worldwide Fund for Nature in Britain -- that global warming could erode beaches, reduce snowfall over ski areas and otherwise play havoc with tourist areas, and the future is probably as uncertain as ever. But barring widespread economic, political or climatic upheaval, one thing seems certain -- tourism will continue growing at record rates.</p>
        <p>''Our results for 1998 confirm that people do not stop traveling altogether, even during tough times,'' Mr. Frangialli said. Instead, they underscore that tourism ''has become a deeply rooted part of our culture at the end of the 20th century.''</p>
