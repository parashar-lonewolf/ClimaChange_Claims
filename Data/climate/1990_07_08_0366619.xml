        <p>LEAD: AT Krasdale Foods here is a show by the 10 artists who inaugurated the Food Center Sculpture Park last summer.

        <p>AT Krasdale Foods here is a show by the 10 artists who inaugurated the Food Center Sculpture Park last summer. The selection of 44 works - several of them prints and drawings - complements the outdoor display, and a good thing too, for this is scattered like a treasure hunt over the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center's 329 acres.</p>
        <p>Krasdale itself can not be explored without an appointment (call 212 378-1100 Ext. 2106); but at least the art is confined to the offices and corridors on the second floor. The exhibition starts in the lobby with sculpture and drawings by Jeff Brosk. On paper, Mr. Brosk works in acrylic, combining geometrical shapes in dark green and reddish-black with checkerboards in lighter tones of red, blue and green.</p>
        <p>The geometry continues in a relief made of paper lithographed with triangles and curved shapes in bright hues. But in the other sculptures, Mr. Brosk combines rectangles and rhomboids of wood, polished to show off the grain, with irregular slabs of stone whose figured surfaces may or may not come naturally. The pieces - rocks with wings of wood - are suspended against the walls and the effect is quite elegant.</p>
        <p>Walter Jackson contributes to the outdoor show a 13-foot-tall aluminum and wood construction that, in the photograph, looks like an isosceles triangle bisected. Indoors, he has only black acrylic and conte crayon images to speak for him - shaded geometrical shapes that have the look of proposals for Egyptian-style mausoleums.</p>
        <p>Making for a lighter mood in the reception area are the efforts of Tim Watkins and Elizabeth Egbert. Mr. Watkins could be taken for a crafts artist with his predilection for dried grass. He uses it to ''camouflage'' two large bowls - one of them covered with blue paper pulp - that are inverted like coolie hats. He also uses it as a ''corona'' for a disk faced with a mixture of peat moss and straw.</p>
        <p>Contrasting with these is Ms. Egbert's ingenious construction of slender wood beams each with a crest of shapes like tusks. Although the underlying structure is triangular, the overall effect is of a Catherine's Wheel. Whether Ms. Egbert has Celts in her family tree, her preoccupation with maze-like shapes is Celtic and it can be seen again in the color photographs of ''Corinthian Bench.'' An outdoor installation, but not in the park, it suggests a pineapple sliced into vertical sections; the Corinthian part is the volutes that do duty as both bench and supports.</p>
        <p>Proceeding into a nearby conference room, the show takes a more macho turn with Terry Lee Dill's model for a public sculpture. Similar to but more complex than those in the outdoor show, this is a kind of gasometer supported by I beams and girdled by walkways, and it is accompanied by an elevation drawn on graph paper together with an on-site vision of another sculpture involving six globes poised high on a network of metal struts.</p>
        <p>In the corridor, the visitor comes upon the works of Peter Dudek, the best of which is a small squarish panel painted with a herringbone pattern involving blue verticals, black diagonals and an orange background. After these comes a wall filled with Christy Rupp's 10 leaping fish made of painted carboard.</p>
        <p>The first four are in good shape but the rest are either disintegrating or developing mysterious appendages, hence the title ''Acid Rain Brook Trout.''</p>
        <p>Farther down the corridor are six prints by Maren Hassinger, a sculptor known for the trees made of rope wire that she plants in concrete blocks.</p>
        <p>Three of the images are etchings - faintly tinted rectangles flecked by trees; the rest are woodblock prints with chine colle, each of them a checkerboard of six different wood grains.</p>
        <p>All the squares are pocked with rows of white dots and the center one is colored - yellow, green or blue. Art that might soothe anxious executives, it hangs opposite its opposite, extrovert gestures in crimson acrylic by Bob Rivera.</p>
        <p>The figural implications of these grow clearer in Mr. Rivera's steel cutout that hangs in the adjoining conference room. This jaunty piece, called ''Voyager,'' has the head and tail of a bird and a body that is indented with all manner of shapes, some of them pulled forward and most of them colored. And those along the bottom edge are coated with sand.</p>
        <p>Also in this room are sculptures by Bill Barrett - two silver figurines that can be read as three-dimensional hieroglyphs; ''Arch I,'' a small bronze that looks like a crooked R; and, in wax, a proposal for a Lower Manhattan monument to the war in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>This consists of the letters NAM arranged so that they can also be read as MAN. In all of these works, Mr. Barrett uses what amounts to a module, a bone shape with faceted sides and spatulate ends. But in the memorial design, the shapes acquire a character that is simultaneously macabre and humorous, a mixture that might gratify some observers and appall others.</p>
        <p>The show remains through July 27; Krasdale is at 400 Food Center Drive in Hunts Point.</p>
