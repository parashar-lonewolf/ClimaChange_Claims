        <p>THIS COLD HEAVEN</p>
        <p>Seven Seasons in Greenland.</p>
        <p>By Gretel Ehrlich.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 377 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Pantheon Books. $27.50.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1910, the Danish-Inuit explorer Knud Rasmussen made seven major expeditions through Greenland and the polar north. While he mapped and botanized, he also collected the folklore of the native Inuit. Rasmussen traveled by dog sled and entered Eskimo villages quietly. He listened carefully, and he slowly won the confidence of his study subjects.</p>
        <p>Eighty-five years later, the writer and poet Gretel Ehrlich traveled through Greenland with a similar modus operandi. On her first visit, she sought solace: she reports that ever since an accident -- she was struck by lightning -- she's felt euphoric above</p>
        <p>76 degrees north latitude. Immediately smitten by the Inuit and their frozen landscape, she set herself a task: to learn how these people lived, how ice had shaped their minds and their society. ''This Cold Heaven'' chronicles her extended journeys through Greenland over seven seasons.</p>
        <p>The Inuit, who as a people speak the same language in Alaska, across the Northwest Territories and into Greenland, have lived largely the same way for 16,000 years. They crossed the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia as early as 30,000 years ago and wandered slowly east across the continent, reaching Greenland 5,000 years ago. Ehrlich arrived to find the northern Inuit still wearing skins, traveling by dog sled and hunting daily to feed themselves.</p>
        <p>But this cold-adapted subsistence culture was in a period of unsettling transition. In Canada, Inuit were racing snowmobiles across the ice; many Greenlanders felt the temptation. Global warming was melting the icecaps, which made winter hunting unreliable. In the south, hunters had started fishing. Wives worked in town to pay bills. ''That's how life gets its burdens and becomes broken,'' a hunter tells Ehrlich. ''Then, pretty soon, no one remembers how to live the other way.''</p>
        <p>Of Greenland's four seasons -- one dark, one light and two twilight -- Ehrlich came to embrace the winter, when seas freeze into highways of ice, and traveling, hunting and storytelling resume. Darkness does wonderful things for the imagination, and the Inuit live in a world alive with mountain dwarfs, seagoing giants, naked spirits and foxes that mate with women.</p>
        <p>''The landscape itself, with its shifting and melting ice, its mirages, glaciers and drifting icebergs, is less a description of desolation than an ode to the beauty of impermanence,'' Ehrlich writes. Trained as a filmmaker, she's supremely sensitive to nuances of light and makes much of polar opposites: day and night, light and dark, liquid and solid, wakefulness and sleep. The metaphors flow, some beautifully -- The Arctic's continuously shifting planes of light and dark were like knives thrown in a drawer'' -- and some alarmingly: a rock formation resembles ''fluted vaginas cut in half by ice.'' Sometimes, but not often enough, Ehrlich combines her poetic intensity with scientific information on optical cells, hormones, circadian rhythms and the movement of icebergs.</p>
        <p>There's a touch of Joan Didion's neurasthenia in Ehrlich, but her high-maintenance head is balanced by a remarkably low-maintenance body. In the classic explorers' tradition, Ehrlich skips meals and sleep without complaint. She forgoes vegetables and bathing. She arrives in villages with no place to stay. She sleeps in a room where the snow does not melt. She lives for a month in one set of clothing.</p>
        <p>The only drawback to her stoicism is that she doesn't let us know what much of this feels like. On one hunting trip, she sleeps on a ''bare skull of ice with only a skin and a few slats of wood between us and its cold brain.'' It's a nice image, but was she cold?</p>
        <p>Ehrlich alternates chapters on her own perambulations with retellings of Rasmussen's. In broad, concise strokes, she describes the hardships he endured in pursuit of ethnographic data and fresh meat. She presents that era's human sacrifice, cannibalism, child selling, wife swapping and trans-species eroticism as mere concessions to the vagaries of tribal life in a cold climate.</p>
        <p>Rasmussen's hunting parties often faced starvation. They'd slaughter a musk ox, gorge on raw meat, then 10 days later find themselves hungry enough to eat rabbit droppings and lichen. Rasmussen falls through the ice and refuses dry clothing. His men sleep on bare snow. They drift for days on ever-diminishing ice floes.</p>
        <p>Compelled to experience all things Inuit (Arctic bathing, raw seal, squalor, romance on the runners), Ehrlich shoves her fur-trimmed mitts under the lash ropes of dog sleds and glides off into the big darkness. Her companions are polar Leatherstockings, rough-and-ready hunters with meteorological stations and maps -- of glaciers, open water, animal migrations -- in their heads.</p>
        <p>Like Rasmussen, she falls through the ice (the scenes are thrilling), and she experiences acute hunger. But after bringing readers so far, Ehrlich now lets us down. We learn she's eaten nearly nothing for two days. Finally, a seal is shot; some of it is eaten, and the dogs</p>
        <p>are fed. Still, stomachs growl, the group moves on. ''All evening we traveled in the storm. At tea, there was no view, no coastline, no islands ahead, no ceiling, no floor. We ate sandwiches, a candy bar and a few cookies.''</p>
        <p>The reader reels. Did our travelers pass a deli? A magic dwarf who caters? She cries wolf again: after losing her luggage, she describes herself as ''shorn of property,'' but she's soon camping with some ''dehydrated food that I'd brought from America.'' Too often, Ehrlich tells only half the story. While she is living in town, she writes, her house stinks because the frozen toilet ''has not been emptied for days.'' Well, why not? And how? When we learn that a zucchini costs $5, it's like discovering gold. Perhaps fearing that such mundane details would detract from her heroic portrayal, Ehrlich generally steers clear of them.</p>
        <p>The most emotionally affecting of Ehrlich's threads is the story of her attachment to a 6-year-old girl on the tiny island of Illorsuit. Ehrlich and Marie Louisa spend sun-blinded days together, in silence or in a laughing garble of Greenlandic, Danish and English that neither understands. And yet they understand each other perfectly. The girl's mother is an alcoholic, and her father worries about her education. In love with the raven-haired Marie Louisa, Ehrlich offers to take her away -- to rescue her. Bad weather separates them for years; the scenes of leave-taking are heart-rending.</p>
        <p>Marie Louisa's story is emblematic of choices modern Inuit must make: to remain in traditional villages (which lack proper schools) and practice the ancient survival arts, or to greet the modern world armed with an education, the better to avoid the unemployment, alcoholism and violence that infect larger towns.</p>
        <p>Ehrlich passes quickly over these social ills. Like many a seeker, she comes to reject the values of her home and to embrace, uncritically, the Other. As presented here, the Inuit who live in the old ways exist on some higher plane, in communion with the spirits, land, water, animals. In contrast, Ehrlich says she comes from a place ''where greed supplants regeneration, litigation supplants intimacy, and envy supplants aspiration.''</p>
        <p>SHE tries to cross over. Living on Illorsuit, she sleeps when sleep comes, eats when food appears. She tears up her calendar and laughs at the clock on the wall, stuck for 15 years at 12:24. Ehrlich wants readers to believe she succumbed to a dreamy sort of stop-time, but she gives herself away. A boat picks her up after a month. How did she know when it would come? She tells us she waited on the beach until 7 p.m. The fact is meant to reveal that she's transcended impatience, but it raises instead the question: how did she know the hour?</p>
        <p>These are petty complaints, but Ehrlich's habit of withholding wears the reader out. ''This Cold Heaven'' suffers from a lack of information about its author. We don't know where she comes from, in the psychological sense, so it's difficult to get a bead on where she's going, or how her experiences change her. Why is she drawn back to Greenland? What do the Inuit make of this woman traveling solo? What does she make of herself?</p>
        <p>Ehrlich has written a stunning portrait of a people and the landscape that shaped them. Her story has great emotional and physical sweep, and one shares her sense of loss at leaving this peculiarly fascinating place. ''For seven years I used the island as a looking glass: part window, part mirror,'' she writes. It's a pity we can't learn what she saw of herself in that glass.</p>
