        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jack Kemp's denial of the seriousness of global warming is not surprising, but it is disappointing (Op-Ed, Oct. 27). However, what is inexcusable is his bald misrepresentation of the views of the Sierra Club by taking a quote out of context.</p>
        <p>Sierra Club believes that global warming is the most important environmental problem human beings have ever faced. If we fail to act, we risk grave consequences within our  children's lifetimes, including the spread of infectious diseases, more extreme weather patterns and permanent flooding of low-lying coastal areas.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Kemp doesn't believe in global warming, surely he would want us to save money, decrease our reliance on imported oil and create jobs. These are additional benefits of the biggest step to curb global warming: raising automotive mile-per-gallon standards.</p>
        <p>DANIEL BECKER  Director, Global Warming Program  Sierra Club  Washington, Oct. 28, 1997</p>
