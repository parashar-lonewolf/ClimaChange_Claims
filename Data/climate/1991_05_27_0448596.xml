        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There are serious problems with the trap oxidizers to curb diesel bus emissions that were not reflected in your news article on bus pollution ("U.S. Will Cite Manhattan for Soot Level," May 11).</p>
        <p>While the Transit Authority claims that trap oxidizers are the best and most economical technology available to control soot, a recent study by my office found significant problems with the oxidizer technology. The study found that they broke down repeatedly during the test period; had to be redesigned twice, and were found to release emissions linked to acid rain and global warming.</p>
        <p>In addition, maintenance costs were higher than the Transit Authority projected. Because the traps break down more often, the buses equipped with the devices could be out of service for long periods of time. While the T.A. says it is exploring other alternatives to deal with the high soot level in Manhattan, the only action it took was to purchase 400 trap oxidizers.</p>
        <p>Trap oxidizers are a short-term solution for a long-term problem. The Transit Authority should be aggressively pursuing other alternatives to curb bus pollution in New York City, such as buses that run on alternative fuels. Including other types of pollution-control mechanisms in a comprehensive pollution control program would in the long run be more practical and environmentally safe for New York City. ELIZABETH HOLTZMAN Comptroller New York, May 17, 1991</p>
