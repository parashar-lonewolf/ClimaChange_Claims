        <p>A 60-second television spot for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who is seeking re-election as an independent candidate, began appearing on Hartford-area network affiliates on Thursday night and may appear on cable outlets over the weekend.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- ZCreative.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Lieberman, in a suit and tie, sits in a room and speaks directly to viewers: ''This week we had Round 1 of the U.S. Senate race. Now Round 2 begins. I want to thank my supporters and explain to all of you why I've decided to fight on. I'm staying in this race because I want to keep working for the things that matter to you. I've led the Senate on issues like national security, the creation of the 9/11 commission, efforts to stop global warming, protect Social Security and find cures for diseases like cancer and diabetes.</p>
        <p>''And I'm staying because I want to help end the war in Iraq in a way that brings stability to the Mideast and doesn't leave us even more vulnerable. So much needs to be done, but so little is actually getting done in Washington because our politics have become so partisan and polarized. My 30 years of experience has been about bringing people together. I'm Joe Lieberman, and I approved this message because it's time for a new politics of unity and purpose.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat who has won and served three terms, was defeated for his party's nomination on Tuesday by Ned Lamont, a cable television executive who ran on an antiwar message. With his 18 years in the Senate, Mr. Lieberman has experience in government, something Mr. Lamont lacks. Mr. Lamont has accused the senator of not being enough of an absolutist on preserving Social Security in its current form, but Mr. Lieberman has pledged to safeguard the federal program. Mr. Lieberman voted for military action in Iraq and, unlike many Democrats, has opposed setting a fixed deadline to withdraw troops. He has spoken out about finding ways to end the war and to protect Israel, one of his important causes. Democrats and Republicans view him as a political centrist who helps bridge partisan divides.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Lieberman helped himself by going on television with a new ad explaining that he was staying in the race, and why, barely 48 hours after his primary defeat. Soft music plays as Mr. Lieberman speaks directly to voters, all intended to stir warm feelings for a veteran Connecticut politician. It is important for voters to believe that Mr. Lieberman is staying in the race not out of stubbornness or arrogance, but because he is passionate about the challenges facing America, and he makes that point.</p>
        <p>The challenge facing him, meanwhile, is whether he appears as a credible messenger about bipartisanship; a lot of Democrats say political polarization is the Republicans' fault. It is notable that Mr. Lieberman does not identify himself as a Democrat once, or use the word. He is indeed staking his future on a new, and uncertain, form of politics.</p>
