        <p>JOHN F. REED is the kind of librarian who wants you to pore over every one of the 4,700 rare books and folios in the newly renovated LuEsther T. Mertz Library, which just flung open its doors at the New York Botanical Garden.</p>
        <p>The collection includes 775,000 items, from books and botanical prints to seed catalogs and a plant explorer's sneakers. Until now, these keys to the beginnings of agriculture, medicine and garden design have been hidden in dark dusty rooms. Now they are available to anyone who asks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed turned to a thick manuscript, ''Circa Instans,'' Latin for ''In the First Instance.'' Penned in 1190 at the School of Salerno, Italy, the leading medical center of Europe at the time, it lists key plants and ''simples,'' or ingredients for medicines.</p>
        <p>Here, in 60 books dating from 1190 to 1894, are windows on medieval to modern-day medicine, along with paintings and etchings of botanical expeditions and 18th-century garden designs. There are lithographs of species like the American sequoia, which had just been discovered in California in 1850 and became all the rage in England, and the gigantic Amazonian water lily, discovered in South America in 1801 and able to flower in Chatsworth when the English landscape gardener Joseph Paxton built a greenhouse to keep it warm.</p>
        <p>There is an 1849 French etching depicting the harvesting of bark from cinchona trees in Bolivia. ''They were raping the forest in South America until some of the Dutch smuggled seeds out and started growing them in Europe,'' Mr. Reed said. The bark contained quinine, used to treat malaria. He flashed a smile as if to say, these dusty old books are the keys to history.</p>
        <p>These treasures go on view May 2 in an exhibition, ''Plants and Gardens Portrayed,'' which runs through July 31. The exhibition, in a brand-new gallery, will celebrate the opening of the $100 million International Plant Science Center, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects. Situated in a 250-acre paradise in the middle of the Bronx, the center also contains the William and Lynda Steere Herbarium and its nearly seven million specimens: dried roots, stems, leaves and flowers meticulously glued or sewn onto sheets of cotton paper and labeled with their Latin name, date and place of discovery, and the botanist who found them.</p>
        <p>To know about the adventures behind these dried plants is to understand their beauty: some have led to cures for diseases, others provide links showing how species depend upon one another.</p>
        <p>Barbara M. Thiers, a botanist and the director of the herbarium, opened up the little paper envelope that held the famed moss, Ulota darwinii Mitten, collected by Darwin in Tierra del Fuego during the voyage of the Beagle, from 1831 to 1836. Ulota was no bigger than an eyelash. (What if one of us had sneezed?)</p>
        <p>''It's all about connections,'' Ms. Thiers said, suggesting that the greater the public's understanding, the more likely habitats will be preserved. ''Some of them are obvious, like, 'cows eat grass.' Others, we are only beginning to understand.'' Ms. Thiers brought out a dried truffle that grows only around the roots of the Douglas fir in Oregon. That truffle is eaten by flying squirrels, which are eaten by spotted owls. So if that forest goes, so go the owls.</p>
        <p>At the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, young botanists can run through a wild meadow. They can press plant specimens or scoop up pond water and look at it under a microscope.</p>
        <p>''The whole garden is about science,'' said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden, zipping over to the children's garden in a little electric car last week, tie flapping in the wind. He hopped off to pump the bellows of a giant fake leaf, which demonstrates how carbon dioxide, along with chlorophyll and sunlight, makes the carbohydrates plants need to grow (exhaling oxygen for the rest of us).</p>
        <p>As the temperature soared to 95 degrees, I strolled into the conservatory to take a look at some of the tropical plants that have changed the history of the world, from the vanilla bean to the cacao tree. Then I went back into the air-conditioned, humidity-controlled rare books room to look up some of the first uses of arugula. I had always thought it was a salad green invented for yuppies -- until I saw the 16th-century woodcut of Eruca sativa that will be in the exhibition.</p>
        <p>People come here for just about anything that has to do with plants. There was the scholar of Italian literature who was looking for early references to basil. She had read a Boccaccio story about tragic love, which Mr. Reed said went something like this: ''A young lady fell in love with the gardener, so her brothers killed him and buried him in the forest. So she dug up the body, took off his head and planted it in a pot of basil.''</p>
        <p>Go figure. But Boccaccio may have been playing with some ancient belief that basil comforted the lovelorn; it's listed in ''Circa Instans.''</p>
        <p>Gardeners use this collection, too. A volunteer in the children's garden, which features crops from all over the world, was interested in foods from Africa. ''She came in here and did all kinds of research,'' Mr. Reed said. ''That led to growing many of the plants here. And then she went back to Africa to see some of the gardens.''</p>
        <p>So you won't collect dust in this botanical library. It can connect you to the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>To See and to Make</p>
        <p>WHILE the Mertz Library is open to the public, its stacks and herbarium are restricted to scientists -- except on May 11 and 18, when there are tours from 1 to 4 p.m., first come first served; information: (718) 817-8106. Thousands of the herbarium's specimens can be viewed online at www.nybg.org/bsci/cass/. At the Everett Children's Adventure Garden, visitors can make their own herbarium specimens. For information: (718) 817-8181.</p>
