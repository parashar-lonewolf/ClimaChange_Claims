        <p>In 1898, in ''The War of the Worlds,'' H. G. Wells imagined Earth invaded by space ships bearing monstrous conquering Martians. All human defenses prove impotent, but the Martians sicken and die when attacked by Earth's humblest living creatures, microbes.</p>
        <p>This nifty science-fiction insight (Wells was trained as a biologist) is suddenly relevant in the real world. We are invading Mars -- two robots are currently trundling around the planet's surface to look for signs of life -- and planning to bring materials back. Are the tables turned? Could our planet be done in by forms of Martian life? We can hope that any organisms dwelling on Mars will have originated and evolved so differently that they cannot survive, reproduce and threaten living beings here. But we cannot be sure.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the idea that Mars once harbored life no longer seems absurd: Mars used to have briny ponds, perhaps even salty marshes. And though the place now seems dead and barren -- the atmosphere is thin, the surface is bombarded with radiation and it's ferociously dry and cold -- there are several reasons to suppose that life, if it was ever there, could persist to this day.</p>
        <p>The place still has water. On the surface, the stuff mostly exists as ice; if puddles form at all (we have yet to find any), they may do so only fleetingly. Beneath the surface, however, it looks as though there might be aquifers, or even lakes, raising the possibility that Martians might be thriving underground.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the strongest reason to think the planet could be home to something is that over the past 20 years, we've learned that many inhabitants of Earth live in environments as peculiar as those on Mars. Here, some organisms exist inside rocks -- in the chilly wastes of Antarctica, or a mile deep in the ground. Others live in ice sheets, or thrive in the strongest acids. Still others can survive for millions of years imprisoned within salt crystals, springing back into action when water is added and the crystals dissolve. The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is so splendidly nonchalant about radiation that it can live in the water cores of nuclear reactors. If organisms here can pull off such stunts, it seems a good bet that Martians could, too.</p>
        <p>Finding life on Mars obviously would be thrilling. It would, in a small way, ease our loneliness. In addition, it might illuminate that great mystery, the origin of life on Earth. But the possibility of life on Mars also suggests that we should approach the place with caution. If something is living there, then bringing Martian rocks back to Earth -- which NASA hopes to do within the next 10 years or so -- could be a mistake if not undertaken very carefully.</p>
        <p>The history of first-time meetings between organisms is a sobering one. When the Spanish came to the New World, they brought smallpox and measles, which killed 90 percent of the people in Mexico within 50 years. H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, crossed into humans from chimpanzees. In the past 20 years, AIDS has killed more than 20 million people -- and this is a disease that's slow to develop and depends on intimate contact to get around. Nor is it just viruses that are troublesome. When animals and plants arrive in a new place, they can have devastating effects, destroying crops and extinguishing native species.</p>
        <p>Given this, it seems rash even to entertain the notion of bringing Martian rock samples to Earth. So what's the argument in favor? The main one is that we could do a much more exhaustive analysis of the rocks here than robots sent to Mars could do on our behalf. We would therefore be much more likely to find life, or evidence of it. Moreover, some say the exercise can't be that risky because we've already been exposed to Martian soil: roughly 90 pounds of rocks from the planet hit the Earth every year.</p>
        <p>This shouldn't necessarily be taken as a sign that Martians aren't dangerous, though: arriving in a nice comfortable space ship should offer a better chance of survival than a fiery ride through the Earth's atmosphere. Of course, maybe nothing would happen if we did bring rock samples back. The planet may, in fact, be home to no one. Even if it holds life, the organisms might not find Earth to their liking: most of the time when members of a species arrive in a new place, they either die or harmlessly settle in. Besides, no one is suggesting opening a box and releasing Martians in the middle of the rain forest. On the contrary, at the behest of its planetary protection officer -- whose job is to protect Earth from the scum of the universe, and to protect the universe from the scum of the Earth -- NASA is starting to prepare a high-security Martian containment facility.</p>
        <p>But what if something went wrong? There could be an accident on arrival or problems with the containment facility. Another, less careful space agency from another country might manage to bring rocks back to Earth before NASA did. The scale of the disaster could be spectacular. Even if Martians didn't cause human diseases, they might irrevocably destroy earthly ecosystems, which wouldn't be good news for us, either.</p>
        <p>And, in the end, doesn't the experiment seem a little premature? It's impossible to overstate our ignorance of life, even life on Earth. We continue to find microbes living in places that we didn't think could support life, and many of these organisms get their energy in ways we never imagined were possible: in February, the journal Nature reported the discovery of bacteria that seem to live off electrons directly obtained from metallic iron. Our chances of recognizing Martians, whatever they are, will surely be greater when we know more about life here. So for the time being, let's cancel our invitation to the Martians for a terrestrial adventure, and concentrate on exploring our own planet and understanding the amazing diversity of life forms on Earth.</p>
