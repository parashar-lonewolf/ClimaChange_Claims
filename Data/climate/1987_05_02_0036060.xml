Other first round choices were more of a surprise. Why? 12.

Watt made in 1981 that was widely criticized? 13. New optimism about the nation's farm economy has become evident after years of recession. Why? 14. Benjamin Ernest Linder, an American volunteer working on a rural development project in Nicaragua, was apparently the first American civilian to be killed in the fighting in Nicaragua. Who was blamed for his death? 15.
