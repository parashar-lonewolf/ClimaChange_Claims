        <p>State and Federal environmental officials have reached a tentative agreement with a major glass manufacturer that will require the company to significantly reduce pollution at a new plant in central New York and return to the state hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of so-called pollution credits.</p>

        <p>State and Federal environmental officials have reached a tentative agreement with a major glass manufacturer that will require the company to significantly reduce pollution at a new plant in central New York and return to the state hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of so-called pollution credits.</p>
        <p>The settlement removes a major obstacle for the company, Guardian Industries of Auburn Hills, Mich., to open a $120 million, 250-employee glass plant next year in Geneva, about 60 miles west of Syracuse. But the agreement, which was prompted in large part by a lawsuit brought by opponents of the plant, does not resolve a debate over whether the state should be giving away pollution credits to help companies expand or open within its borders.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Pataki administration gave the company 150 pollution credits, worth between $150,000 and $450,000, as an incentive to build the plant in Geneva. Under the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990, manufacturing plants must acquire a certain amount of the credits from other companies before they open. Guardian was having trouble purchasing enough credits on the open market until the state stepped in and provided some of its own.</p>
        <p>The credits are awarded to companies or government agencies that keep their pollution below Federal limits, and they can be sold or traded on the open market. The credits essentially give companies permission to pollute.</p>
        <p>Some environmental groups and Democratic legislators contend that the state should not be giving away its credits, but retiring them permanently to reduce future pollution. Indeed, the Atlantic States Legal Foundation, a nonprofit group, said today that it was suing the state to prevent it from giving away pollution credits as an economic incentive.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement announced today, Guardian will return 125 of the 150 pollution credits to the state, said Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The state can now turn around and give those credits to other companies seeking to expand or open here. The remaining 25 credits will be held by Guardian until the Geneva plant closes, when the credits must be returned to the state. The provision effectively retires the 25 credits for the lifetime of the plant, estimated at 40 years.</p>
        <p>The settlement also calls for Guardian to reduce its emissions of nitrogen oxide, a component of smog and possibly acid rain, by 30 percent of the amount originally authorized by the state. It will set the strictest standard for nitrogen oxide emissions by a glass plant in the country and will become a national benchmark for future emission permits, New York and Federal environmental officials said.</p>
