        <p>With each day that passes the Earth Summit begins to seem more and more like the planet versus the President of the United States. The President touts an initiative on forest protection and the developing nations say we're playing bully boys. The rest of the world agrees on a biodiversity treaty and the President says it's too expensive.</p>
        <p>And so far George Bush has saved his greatest passion for that most critical of environmental issues: Who in blazes leaked a memo designed to embarrass the head of the Environmental Protection Agency?</p>
        <p>So much for deforestation, global warming, the greenhouse effect and the world community. The conference does not look promising. The fact is that it has not looked promising for some time, ever since a central issue of environmental moment was taken off the table.</p>
        <p>The issue was population growth.</p>
        <p>It's difficult to imagine that anyone could take a serious and substantive look at the environment without considering the effect of people. We fell trees for our houses, work in factories that produce effluents, buy products that pile up in landfills, burn fuels that foul the air, produce wastes that taint the oceans.</p>
        <p>The more of us there are, the more these things take place. It's not a simple equation; it is possible for us to learn to use fewer trees, produce less garbage, make less of a mess of things. Those are some of the issues being explored in Brazil.</p>
        <p>But the idea that population growth would not be a linchpin of this summit is preposterous. It was also inevitable. When pre-summit bickering between developed and developing nations began, the Vatican stepped into the breach. And family planning became a no-show. No separation of church and state here. The ban on birth control espoused by the Catholic Church -- but ignored by millions of its own people -- has shaped the summit for those of all faiths.</p>
        <p>For years the United States has been a leader in international family planning, and that leadership made a difference; because of American aid, the numbers of people in developing countries who use birth control has soared.</p>
        <p>But in 1984 we enforced the first gag rule, the one that said we would end aid to any international agency that mentioned abortion, the one that sent a signal about what kind of nation we'd become. And when preparations were under way for Rio, we were so obdurate about maintaining our old life styles that we were in no position to persuade other nations to change their own. Mr. Bush, whose idea of the long view is always November, was not the man to break a deadlock on what George Zeidenstein, the president of the Population Council, described as "overpopulation versus overconsumption."</p>
        <p>We're not simply talking about too many people here, the fact that some estimates have world population doubling in the next century on what already seems to be a "No Vacancy" planet. And we're not talking population control, the forced limitation of family size. Family size should be a matter of informed choice.</p>
        <p>In many nations, it's not -- not informed, and not a choice. In some countries, women sneak off for contraception because their husbands still consider family size a measure of their manhood. In others, contraceptives are just a rumor, a diaphragm a dream, and abortion the primary method of birth control.</p>
        <p>All over the world there are women who want to space and limit their child-bearing, not because of the global environment but because of their own environment -- the contents of their cupboards, the limits of their stamina. Their governments have been either indifferent to those needs or, influenced by religious leaders, hostile to them.</p>
        <p>At the Earth Summit those needs are barely acknowledged, except for a clause that urges countries to adopt "appropriate demographic policies." Yet one doomsday prediction after another says that in the centuries to come untenable levels of population will be staved off only by famine, disease or wars. How can anyone think those preferable to the condom, the intrauterine device or the birth control pill? "There are too many of us," a nurse in a clinic in Africa said last month of the malnourished children of her country. There is no strong voice to speak for her, and so many others like her, at the Earth Summit.  Because of that, we all lose.</p>
