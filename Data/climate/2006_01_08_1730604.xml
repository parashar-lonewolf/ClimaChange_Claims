        <p>Thomas L. Friedman makes a great case for how being green is one of the most patriotic things we can do.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman makes a great case for how being green is one of the most patriotic things we can do. It would be a way of reducing the power of oil-rich states that are generally authoritarian and are kept in power by our ravenous consumption of their oil and thereby spreading democracy around the world.</p>
        <p>I believe that there are even better and more pressing reasons to be green, and that are as patriotic. We are heading to a point in time, some say within the next 10 years, when oil production will reach its peak and begin to decline, bringing along with it unprecedented economic chaos for a world that hasn't yet gone green.</p>
        <p>And what about the elephant in the room -- climate change? The Times barely touches on the truly scary scenario of a planet that may soon reach the tipping point beyond which is catastrophic disruption. Is saving the planet not patriotic enough?</p>
