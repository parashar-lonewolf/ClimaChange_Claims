        <p>Anyone following the United States Senate race in New York this year could be forgiven for concluding that this is one of the epic ideological battles of the 1990's: the right-wing extremist, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, versus the ultraliberal Brooklyn Congressman, Charles E. Schumer.</p>
        <p>On one side is Mr. D'Amato, who, as Mr. Schumer said again yesterday, voted to cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battled environmentalists. On the other is Mr. Schumer, who, as Mr. D'Amato likes to say, voted against crime bills, opposed welfare restrictions and supported a series of tax increases.</p>

        <p>Anyone following the United States Senate race in New York this year could be forgiven for concluding that this is one of the epic ideological battles of the 1990's: the right-wing extremist, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, versus the ultraliberal Brooklyn Congressman, Charles E. Schumer.</p>
        <p>On one side is Mr. D'Amato, who, as Mr. Schumer said again yesterday, voted to cut Medicare, opposed abortion rights and battled environmentalists. On the other is Mr. Schumer, who, as Mr. D'Amato likes to say, voted against crime bills, opposed welfare restrictions and supported a series of tax increases.</p>
        <p>But the truth behind these ideological caricatures is considerably more nuanced, despite the best efforts of Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato to confuse it. These two candidates for Senate are, in fact, political hybrids, masters of the fluid school of politics and ideology that has emerged in American elections in the 1990's and very much in the tradition of such successful politicians as Bill Clinton, Rudolph W. Giuliani and George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Clinton, who campaigned in the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 1992 on a promise to slash welfare, and Mr. Pataki, who ran for governor in 1994 by embracing the environmental movement, Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Schumer have defied just enough of their parties' orthodoxy to resist easy characterization.</p>
        <p>Their legislative histories are certainly littered with votes that permit their opponents to paint them as extreme, like Mr. Schumer's voting in the State Assembly 1970's to weaken drug laws, or Mr. D'Amato's championing of much of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract With America. And Mr. Schumer is surely on the left of the political spectrum, just as Mr. D'Amato is on the right. But like most New Yorkers -- or more specifically, like most people who will vote on Nov. 3 -- the three-term Republican Senator and his Democratic challenger are closer to the center than to either extreme.</p>
        <p>''I do not think they are as different as they say,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who ran for the Democratic nomination to challenge Mr. D'Amato in 1992. ''Chuck has always been right of center in the Democratic Party, and D'Amato has always been, well, whatever works for him on that given day. They are both rewriting as they go.''</p>
        <p>The flood of conflicting vote citations and ideological name-calling that have filled the state's airwaves notwithstanding, these first three weeks of the general election campaign have been less about ideology and more about tactics.</p>
        <p>With a nod to the political reality of the moderate cast of New York's electorate, Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Schumer are each trying to accomplish the same thing, if from different corners of the ring: to cover the tracks of their own political evolution while portraying their opponent as extreme.</p>
        <p>This maneuvering began on the first day of the general election campaign as Mr. D'Amato attacked Mr. Schumer as liberal while the Representative assailed Mr. D'Amato as soft on crime. And it has continued every day since then, testimony to one of the most enduring facts of this contest: Whatever their differences on issues, as political tacticians, Mr. Schumer and Mr. D'Amato have similar reflexes.</p>
        <p>This is nothing new for Mr. D'Amato. He has historically prepared for each election with a march on the political center, and then campaigned by portraying his opponents, notably Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General, in 1992, as liberal vestiges. This formula, combined with a record of tending to the more parochial needs of the state and its voters, largely accounts for his repeated success at winning re-election in what is, by registration, a strongly Democratic state.</p>
        <p>What is different this time is that Mr. D'Amato has encountered in Mr. Schumer a challenger who is trying to do to the Senator what the Senator typically does to his opponent. The Representative has parried each ideological assault by Mr. D'Amato by asserting that it is the Senator who is the ideological extremist, and then by blurring his own ideological evolution with a recitation of what was his own march on the political center as he prepared in Congress for this race.</p>
        <p>It seems unlikely that Mr. Schumer will ever convince voters that he is, for example, tougher on crime than Senator D'Amato, or that Mr. D'Amato is a foot soldier for Mr. Gingrich's Republican revolution. At the very least, by echoing Mr. D'Amato's tactics, Mr. Schumer may succeed in neutralizing a weapon that Mr. D'Amato has used against previous opponents to devastating effect.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato certainly has a basis for saying that Mr. Schumer is to the left of most of the American electorate. Mr. Schumer voted against the 1996 bill that restricted welfare benefits. He opposed the balanced-budget amendment. He has supported a series of tax increases over the years. He voted for Federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiring homosexuals. He has voted against measures that would make it easier to jail juveniles in adult prisons, and against another measure that would have imposed additional penalties for crimes involving the use of guns.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schumer, who has spent many of his years in Congress preparing for the seven weeks of this general election campaign, has also repeatedly voted in favor of a Federal death penalty (though Mr. Schumer earlier in his life opposed the death penalty). He was the sponsor of legislation to provide funds to hire police officers and to ban many forms of assault weapons. He voted to restrict the rights of illegal immigrants in some cases, and in favor of legislation to crack down on food-stamp fraud. He supported the line-item veto. He also voted in favor of a bill that would ban the recognition of marriages between homosexuals.</p>
        <p>Similarly, on many levels, Mr. D'Amato's Republican credentials seem more than secure. Unlike Mr. Schumer, Mr. D'Amato has opposed abortion rights throughout his career, and voted against gun control. He has supported many aspects of Mr. Gingrich's attempts to cut social spending, and his votes on environmental legislation have earned him consistently weak ratings from national environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. D'Amato is no less nimble than Mr. Schumer, and that has become particularly clear in the years leading up to this election. The Senator voted for the Federal legislation that would ban discrimination in hiring against homosexuals; he is poised to win the endorsement of one of the nation's major gay rights groups, the Human Rights Campaign. He became one of the chief advocates in Washington of repealing legislation passed by a Republican Congress (with his support) that curbed benefits to the children of illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he spoke at the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens, led by a former Congressman, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, which is one of the largest black congregations in New York City, where he recounted his efforts to push through a commemorative coin for Jackie Robinson.</p>
        <p>He is planning to testify in Washington tomorrow about ways to curb acid rain. And he has pushed consistently and successfully for spending on breast cancer research and screening.</p>
        <p>As a matter of politics, the efforts by these two candidates suggests how complicated it is becoming to run a statewide race in New York. The shifting ideology of the electorate, combined with the diminishing vote out of New York City in state elections, means that being viewed as a liberal is no longer the electoral lift that it once was. Yet New York remains a long way from being a conservative state.</p>
        <p>In the end, the best evidence of where these two rivals stand could be found in the endorsement by Mr. Schumer last week by District Council 37, the umbrella group of unions representing New York City employees. What was surprising was not that this historically solid Democratic union endorsed Mr. Schumer but that it anguished so much over it all.</p>
        <p>''There are differences between them,'' Norman Adler, the political consultant who works for Republicans and Democrats, said of the two candidates. ''But on the whole, they are less different than you would like to think.''</p>
