        <p>The sun was not yet up yesterday, and members of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign team were confronted with the kind of attack that most infuriates them: one questioning the character of Mrs. Clinton and her husband.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, it came from David Geffen, the Hollywood executive who was once a big supporter of the Clintons but has since turned on them and is now backing Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>What followed was a remarkably caustic exchange between the Clinton and Obama campaigns that highlighted the sensitivity in the Clinton camp to Mr. Obama's rapid rise as a rival and his positioning as a fresh face unburdened by the baggage borne by Mrs. Clinton, the junior senator from New York. The Clinton camp seemed also to be sending a warning to mudslinging critics that they would be dealt with fiercely.</p>
        <p>It began with a column in The New York Times by Maureen Dowd, in which Mr. Geffen said the Clintons lie ''with such ease, it's troubling'' and that the Clinton political operation ''is going to be very unpleasant and unattractive and effective.'' Mr. Geffen called Mr. Clinton a ''reckless guy'' who had not changed in the last six years, and suggested that Mrs. Clinton was too scripted.</p>
        <p>In a statement it fired off at 9:46 a.m., the Clinton campaign called on Mr. Obama to sever his ties to Mr. Geffen and return the portion of the $1.3 million that Mr. Geffen helped raise on Tuesday at a reception in Beverly Hills.</p>
        <p>''While Senator Obama was denouncing slash-and-burn politics yesterday, his campaign's finance chair was viciously and personally attacking Senator Clinton and her husband,'' Howard Wolfson, the Clinton campaign communications director, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, responded with a statement less than an hour and a half later, saying it was ''ironic that the Clintons had no problem with David Geffen'' when he was ''raising them $18 million and sleeping at their invitation in the Lincoln Bedroom.''</p>
        <p>The punch and counterpunch went on all day, transfixing the political world and overshadowing a gathering of all the Democratic candidates except Mr. Obama, the junior Illinois senator, at a union-sponsored forum in Nevada at which Mrs. Clinton faced criticism from some opponents about her Iraq stance.</p>
        <p>The Democrats were not the only ones dealing with intramural warfare. On the Republican side, Vice President Dick Cheney struck back at criticism leveled against him and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld by Senator John McCain of Arizona, underscoring the often tense relationship between the White House and Mr. McCain.</p>
        <p>The presidential campaign has been a relatively polite affair in its early stages, and the day marked an abrupt change of tone that exposed the intensity of the bad feeling bubbling just below the surface in both parties. None of the players showed much inclination to back off.</p>
        <p>In an interview with ABC News in which Mr. Cheney was asked about Mr. McCain's criticism of Mr. Rumsfeld, the vice president responded by bringing up other McCain comments critical of Mr. Cheney's role in managing the war in Iraq, and said Mr. McCain had subsequently said he was sorry.</p>
        <p>''John said some nasty things about me the other day,'' Mr. Cheney added, ''and then the next time he saw me, ran over to me and apologized. Maybe he'll apologize to Rumsfeld.''</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. McCain seemed to go out of his way to re-emphasize his assertion that Mr. Rumsfeld would be remembered as one of the worst defense secretaries in history, and to criticize the Bush administration more generally when he appeared at a news conference in Los Angeles to discuss initiatives to deal with global warming.</p>
        <p>When asked about the administration's environmental record, Mr. McCain said, ''I would assess this administration's record on global warming as terrible.''</p>
        <p>Asked by a reporter about his comments about Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. McCain said, ''The criticism of the conduct of the war I have voiced for more than three years when I saw that this train wreck was taking place.''</p>
        <p>Some minutes later, after the news conference had ended, Mr. McCain, unbidden, said to the reporter, ''Sir, I stand by my comments about Secretary Rumsfeld, by the way.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Geffen affirmed his view of the Clintons, saying he had been quoted accurately and that Mr. Wolfson was wrong in calling him the finance chairman of the Obama campaign (he said he had no formal role in the campaign).</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, asked Wednesday afternoon if Mr. Obama should denounce the Geffen remarks, declined to join in the hand-to-hand combat, but expressed general disapproval with the remarks while also defending her husband, which drew huge cheers from the audience of union members she was addressing.</p>
        <p>''I want to run a very positive campaign, and I sure don't want Democrats or the supporters of Democrats to be engaging in the politics of personal destruction,'' she said at the forum of Democratic presidential candidates in Carson City, Nev. ''I think we should stay focused on what we're going to do for America. And, you know, I believe Bill Clinton was a good president, and I'm very proud of the record of his two terms.''</p>
        <p>When pressed, she said she would leave it up to the Obama campaign to make its decision on Mr. Geffen, then noted that she was ''excited'' to be in Nevada ''with the other candidates who came,'' a comment that only drew attention to Mr. Obama's choice to skip the event.</p>
        <p>The Geffen remarks bubbled up throughout the forum. One candidate, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, said Mr. Obama should denounce Mr. Geffen's remarks. ''If we're going to win, we have to be positive,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''I think these name-callings are not good.''</p>
        <p>As he arrived in Iowa late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Obama was met with questions from reporters about the clash.</p>
        <p>''It's not clear to me why I would be apologizing for someone else's remarks,'' Mr. Obama said. ''My sense is that Mr. Geffen may have differences with the Clintons, but that doesn't really have anything to do with our campaign.''</p>
        <p>When asked whether he was proud of Mr. Geffen's support, the senator declared: ''He hosted an event for me yesterday. Absolutely.''</p>
        <p>Obama advisers described the Geffen remarks as an insignificant blip and said they saw no political danger in letting them stand. While some supporters of Mrs. Clinton said they were worried that the campaign had lost its cool over Mr. Geffen, several Clinton advisers insisted that they were not overreacting.</p>
        <p>One adviser, who is not part of Mrs. Clinton's day-to-day inner circle but speaks to her regularly about politics and fund-raising, said Mr. Geffen's comments might not shock ''political insiders'' in Washington or New York who are used to hearing bad things about the Clintons. But such criticism, especially from a former Clinton supporter like Mr. Geffen, could surprise and concern average voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and in other politically important states where they are starting to form impressions of Mrs. Clinton as a presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Other advisers said the Clinton camp was simply frustrated that Mr. Obama had received glowing media coverage, and was eager to call out his campaign for hypocrisy by contrasting the Geffen remarks with Mr. Obama's pledge to be positive.</p>
        <p>''Obama has gotten under the campaign's skin for weeks now -- especially his free ride in the media --and Hillary's people were just waiting for their first chance to attack his image as Mr. Positive,'' said one Clinton adviser who is not part of the day-to-day political operation.</p>
