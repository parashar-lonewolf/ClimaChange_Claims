      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Within the next six weeks, the Connecticut General Assembly may pass legislation that would open the state's electric generating business to competition.</p>
        <p>Some critical details were missing from the article (''Who Pays for Mistakes in Making Electricity?'' March 21) that should be known by readers.</p>
        <p>Legislation would dramatically restructure an industry that has served Connecticut homes and businesses for more than 100 years. The Connecticut Light and Power Company (C.L. &amp; P.) has had and will continue to have an obligation to provide electricity to Connecticut consumers in its service territory for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>In the turbulent energy markets of the 1970's, C.L. &amp; P. had to be sure it had resources to meet the state's future electricity needs.</p>
        <p>Building new oil and natural gas plants were judged to be out of the question because of rising prices, limited supply and Federal prohibitions against using certain fossil fuels. Coal had too many air quality issues associated with it.</p>
        <p>Construction of nuclear, trash-to-energy and other plants was undertaken as a means to wean Connecticut away from imported fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>Unlike other industries, there was no option for electric utilities that said, ''Don't build anything and risk blackouts.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Public Utility Control, which regulates utilities in the state, agreed those investments by utilities were reasonable and agreed they could be recovered from customers over a period of time.  These costs are currently reflected in customers' monthly electric bills, and under deregulation they will be reflected in a competitive transition assessment.</p>
        <p>They are not new costs. They only reflect the remaining costs of state energy policy of the 1970's and 1980's.</p>
        <p>These investments have been pro-rated over time, some as long as 30 years, which means customers' monthly bills will reflect some of these charges for some time.</p>
        <p>Using securitization, C.L. &amp; P. can refinance those costs approved by the D.P.U.C. at a lower interest rate over a shorter period of time, resulting in substantial savings and reducing the length of time customers would pay this competitive transition assessment.</p>
        <p>The results are similar to when a homeowner refinances his/her mortgage at a lower interest rate. These savings will be passed on to customers in the form of lower electric bills.  The greater the amount we securitize, the greater the savings for customers.</p>
        <p>Your article stated that securitization has never been done in this industry. That's not true. Securitization has been implemented in California, the state in the forefront of deregulating the electric industry, where $6 billion has been securitized.  Rates in that state dropped 10 percent in January, largely because of the benefits of securitization.</p>
        <p>Similarly, securitization has been endorsed by other states that are in the process of restructuring their electric markets.</p>
        <p>C.L. &amp; P. supports competition and lower electric bills. By refinancing the maximum amount of C.L. &amp; P.'s investments, customers will see the maximum amount of savings on their electric bills.</p>
