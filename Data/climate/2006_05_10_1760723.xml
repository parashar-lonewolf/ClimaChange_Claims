        <p>India's greenhouse gas emissions grew by 57 percent over the past decade, while China's increased by a third, according to the World Bank's annual Little Green Data Book. Rich countries still produce most emissions, with the United States contributing a quarter of the world's total. They also consume 11 times more energy per person than poor countries. But emissions from the rapidly growing economies of Asia are likely to continue to rise and contribute to climate change, the bank predicted.</p>
