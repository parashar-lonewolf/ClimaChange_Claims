        <p>IN the belief that environmental policy is often made in scientific ignorance, a broadly based group of scientists, businessmen, environmentalists and politicians has been promoting the establishment of a new Federal institute to guide and finance long-term research on the environment.</p>
        <p>After five years of effort, the institute's backers have secured substantial bipartisan support in Congress. And with the appointment today of a leader with international stature on environmental issues to head the campaign, the backers have high hopes that environmental science will soon no longer be, as they see it, the poor stepchild of the Federal research establishment.</p>
        <p>"It seems this is an idea whose time has come," said Dr. Richard E. Benedick, the new president of the Committee for the National Institute for the Environment, a national, nonprofit organization with more than 5,000 members. Dr. Benedick, a career diplomat who recently retired from the State Department, is perhaps best known as a chief architect of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the international agreement to protect and restore the earth's ozone layer. Some Political Realities</p>
        <p>Dr. Benedick's optimism about creating an institute for the environment may have to be put on hold. Its key backers in the House of Representatives, where legislation to establish the institution has been introduced, say serious consideration will probably be deferred because of Congress's preoccupation with front-burner issues like health care.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has not committed itself on the question, although Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has endorsed it. Carol Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has been trying to strengthen that agency's science base, said that while she is "for more environmental research, absolutely," it would be important to know what research the institute would pursue.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, there seems little doubt that the proposal has won wide support. Its sponsors range from Representative George E. Brown Jr., a liberal California Democrat who heads the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, to Newt Gingrich, the conservative Republican whip from Georgia. There is also support in the Senate, but no legislation has yet been offered there.</p>
        <p>The institute's backers see it as filling a critical but neglected niche in Federal support for science. More than 20 Federal agencies engage in environmental research costing about $5 billion a year, according to a 1993 study by a National Research Council committee. But most of that research serves the agencies' limited agendas and is aimed at short-term regulatory questions.</p>
        <p>As a result, advocates of the new institute say, research is conducted in a piecemeal manner that lacks focus on long-term changes in the environment. A Carnegie Commission study in 1992 characterized much of the existing research as "diffuse, reactive and focused on short-range, end-of-the-pipe solutions."</p>
        <p>The backers contend further that most Federal environmental research fails to tap the expertise of academia, is done by Government employees and is not usually subjected to the peer-review process through which scientific research is customarily validated. As a result, when policymakers ask questions, the answers are fragmentary and their validity is open to question, the advocates say.</p>
        <p>All of this, they add, makes it more likely that environmental policy will be set primarily on political rather than scientific grounds, and even that policy paralysis will result. "The lack of political will to act is due in part to lack of understanding of environmental problems and controversy over the best course of action," the committee says in one of its publications.</p>
        <p>The National Research Council panel found no strong commitment to environmental research at the top levels of government. Environmental matters, it found, have been regarded as less important than those involving the military, health and transportation. There is no comprehensive research effort for the environment as a whole, the panel concluded, nor is there any coordinated national plan for environmental research.</p>
        <p>Other independent studies have found that existing environmental research heavily favors the physical sciences over research on the impact of environmental change on living things, including people. Focus on Specific Issues</p>
        <p>The shortage of Federal support reverberates in academia, where it exerts a depressing effect on ecological research, advocates of the new institute say. In fact, one early spur to the campaign for the institute was the realization that a lack of Federal dollars leads universities to place a lower priority on ecological research.</p>
        <p>Administrators "had simply determined that they could not afford ecologists," Dr. Henry F. Howe, an ecologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who is vice chairman of the committee for the environmental institute, wrote last year in The Environmental Professional, a journal.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Howe, Dr. Benedick and other backers of the institute see it, the institute would address all these shortcomings. Like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health, a new institute would identify gaps in knowledge and set research priorities. It would award research grants competitively and enter into research contracts on particular subjects.</p>
        <p>Unlike the National Science Foundation, which focuses on basic research, the environmental institute's priorities would be directed at specific policy issues like global warming and biological diversity. The overall goal would be to develop basic understanding of all the interlocking physical, biological, technological, economic, social and political causes of environmental problems.</p>
        <p>No existing research organization is equipped to do all this, the institute's advocates say, and they argue that it would not duplicate research already being pursued by other agencies. While there is no guarantee the institute would solve the basic problem, Dr. Benedick said, "enough people have come to a conclusion that it would provide a proper focus of intellectual power on these issues."</p>
        <p>Dr. Benedick cites the scientific effort that led to the Montreal Protocol as an example of the kind of policy research that the new institute would pursue. In that instance, an ad hoc scientific group working for the United Nations studied the causes and remedies of a weakening in the earth's protective ozone shield.</p>
        <p>"We agreed that if these experiments were done in a certain way, we'd all have to buy off on the results," Dr. Benedick said. And so, there was an unusual consensus among policymakers about what should be done. But the ozone case was an exception, Dr. Benedick said, and the hope is that the new institute would make it the rule. Need for Independence</p>
        <p>Other ways to achieve this goal have been proposed, including reorganizing and consolidating existing Federal agencies to sharpen the research focus. But Dr. Benedick and his colleagues believe that the leading environmental research agency must be independent. Otherwise, Dr. Benedick said, it could be swallowed up by the needs and agendas of existing agencies.</p>
        <p>The campaign for the institute is under way at a time when Federal money is scarce, but Dr. Benedick said it would start small with a budget of $50 million to $130 million, which might grow to $500 million or $600 million, mostly for research grants, in five years.</p>
        <p>A bill to establish the institute has gained 66 sponsors in the House. Its chief sponsors are Mr. Brown and Representative James H. Saxton, Republican of New Jersey. Mr. Saxton said he thinks the prospects for passage are "pretty good" because the institute would provide lawmakers with a better foundation on which to build policy, because the solutions to most environmental problems lie in science and because business and the economy would be protected from unnecessary regulation resulting from "overreaching."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Saxton said that because of the heavy press of Congressional business, he was "not as optimistic about action in this session as I was six or eight months ago."</p>
