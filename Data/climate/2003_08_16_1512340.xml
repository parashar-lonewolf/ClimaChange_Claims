        <p>An Eclectic Field of Candidates In a Mad Dash of a Recall Race  The California recall election of 2003 is creaking to life with just 53 days until voters decide whether to kick Gov.

        <p>Ozone Seems to Be Recovering  Government scientists have measured a significant drop in atmospheric levels of methyl bromide, a pesticide that is being phased out of use because it damages the planet's protective ozone layer.
