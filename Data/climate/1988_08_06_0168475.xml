        <p>LEAD: President Reagan has approved continuing negotiations toward American participation in an international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid rain, the White House said today.</p>
        <p>President Reagan has approved continuing negotiations toward American participation in an international treaty to freeze emissions of a precursor to acid rain, the White House said today.</p>
        <p>The Administration had been divided on United Nations-sponsored negotiations in Switzerland toward a treaty that would freeze emissions of nitrogen oxides until 1996.</p>
        <p>In negotiations this spring, the United States sought the right to emit about 20 percent more nitrogen oxides than it does now, seeking credit for earlier unilateral efforts to reduce such emissions.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Reagan heard advisers' arguments for and against participation in the treaty, and B. J. Cooper, a White House spokesman, said today that the President ''has authorized the State Department to continue negotiations aimed at ensuring U.S. participation.''</p>
        <p>The Washington Post, citing unidentified Administration officials, reported in its Saturday editions that Mr. Reagan had agreed to major provisions of the draft treaty proposed in April, including a freeze on nitrogen oxide emissions at 1987 levels for at least seven years.</p>
        <p>Oxides of nitrogen account for about a third of the acidity in rainfall in the eastern United States and Canada. The oxides are formed in the combustion of fossil fuels in industry, utilities and motor vehicles. In the air they may be transformed into nitric acid.</p>
