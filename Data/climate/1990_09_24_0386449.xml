        <p>LEAD: If you liked ''Cagney and Lacey,'' produced by Barney Rosenzweig, you'll have no trouble cottoning to ''The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,'' also produced by Mr. Rosenzweig. There's a new lineup of characters. And the setting is Los Angeles instead of New York City. But this is familiar Rosenzweig territory, the liberal terrain of fighting for the underdog and propounding the correct causes, especially feminism.</p>
        <p>If you liked ''Cagney and Lacey,'' produced by Barney Rosenzweig, you'll have no trouble cottoning to ''The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,'' also produced by Mr. Rosenzweig. There's a new lineup of characters. And the setting is Los Angeles instead of New York City. But this is familiar Rosenzweig territory, the liberal terrain of fighting for the underdog and propounding the correct causes, especially feminism.</p>
        <p>The new series, off to a solid ratings start at 10 P.M. on Mondays on CBS, stars Sharon Gless, formerly Cagney to Tyne Daley's Lacey, in the title role. Played with characteristically tough verve by Ms. Gless, Rosie is newly divorced and has left the luxury and perks of corporate law to become a public defender. Think ''Shannon's Deal.'' Her mother (Georgann Johnson) is appalled.</p>
        <p>''Fifth in your class, and you work for the sanitation department,'' she says, sniffing.</p>
        <p>But Rosie has had it with social pretenses, arguing, ''I'm 43, and all I have are 43 credit cards and a Mercedes.'' She does park the car several blocks from her office because the image doesn't quite jibe with her indigent clients.</p>
        <p>Rosie spends several minutes each week complaining to her psychiatrist about things like the ozone layer and her smoking again (''It eats up the collagen layer around your lips''). Think ''The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.'' At the office, her boss is Ben Meyer (Ron Rifkin), who, in case you didn't know he was Jewish, wears a yarmulke and tends to kvetch periodically and say mazel tov.</p>
        <p>Rosie's new office partner (the former one burned out on cocaine) is Hank Mitchell (Dorian Harewood), who, spotting Rosie's Armani wardrobe, suspects that she may be just slumming in public-defender territory. At home, Rosie enjoys the occasional company of a 25-year-old carpenter named Steve (Doug Wert). The woman may have her problems, but she is hardly wasting away.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Rosie's cases are never comfortingly simple. In the show's first episode, her client is a young woman accused of throwing her newborn baby into a Dumpster.</p>
        <p>Rosie seems to have it all figured out. ''You wanted an abortion but needed your parents' permission and were afraid to ask,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Not so. The woman did ask, she tells Rosie, but a minister convinced her parents that ''it was a sin.'' The woman, abandoned and homeless, had her delivery in an alley and believed the baby was dead.</p>
        <p>Rosie finds evidence that the child was actually alive, but she still fights to save the young woman from a charge of involuntary manslaughter, which could mean 11 years in prison. In court, Rosie makes an impassioned speech about our ''disposable society.'' Tonight, in the second episode, Rosie is assigned to defend a rapist, who, trailing previous convictions, brazenly admits his guilt. Rosie loathes the man, but in the course of her investigation discovers that the police falsified a warrant. She now has information that can get the charges dropped, and she knows that if the man is released, he'll probably rape again. Meanwhile, her boss is wondering if she ever heard of the Cossacks who massacred the Jews in czarist Russia.</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' she says impatiently. ''I saw 'Fiddler on the Roof.' ''</p>
        <p>Clearly intended to appeal to women, especially those who may be less than enthusiastic about watching ''Monday Night Football'' on ABC, Rosie is cleverly put together. When not forcefully holding her own on the job, she can be found giggling and comparing varicose veins with her pregnant sister. She's independent and determined, yet warmly fragile around the edges. Back together again, Ms. Gless and Mr. Rosenzweig are in top form.</p>
        <p>The Trials of Rosie O'Neill</p>
        <p>Written by Barbara Avedon, Joe Cacaci, Dawn Prestwich and Nicole Yorkin; Beth Sullivan, executive writing supervisor; produced by Barney Rosenzweig for Barney Rosenzweig Productions. At 10 tonight on CBS.</p>
