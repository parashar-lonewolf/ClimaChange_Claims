        <p>Whether it is with scorn, anger or resignation, most computer experts and Year 2000 program managers brush off suggestions that they overreacted to the Y2K threat, taken in by computer companies and consultants positioned to profit from fear.</p>
        <p>Still, like the skeptics, many wonder: How did countries that started so late -- and appeared to do so little -- manage to enter 2000 as smoothly as nations like the United States and Britain that got an early jump?</p>
        <p>''That question is plaguing all of us, although some people won't admit it,'' said Maggie Parent, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's representative to Global 2000, an international banking group formed to coordinate and stimulate Year 2000 work. ''We expected there to be some significant blowouts.''</p>
        <p>A World Bank survey published last January said that just 54 of 139 developing countries had Year 2000 programs outlined and only 21 were taking concrete steps to prepare.</p>
        <p>Japan, China, Italy and Venezuela showed up as high-profile question marks in various studies. Paraguay's Year 2000 coordinator said last summer the country would experience so many disruptions its government would have to impose martial law. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova were seen as so risky that the State Department issued  travel advisories and called nonessential personnel home.</p>
        <p>So what accounts for the surprisingly quiet rollover? Computer experts cite several factors. Even they may have underestimated how hard many countries worked in the last few months and how much help came from others that started early. And in many cases, assessments of overseas readiness were based on scarce or vague data.</p>
        <p>But the simplest if most embarrassing explanation is that some public and private analysts who testified before Congress and were widely quoted overestimated the world's dependence on computer technology. Most countries had much less to do to prepare because they are far less computerized than the United States. The computers they do have are much less likely to be tied together in complex systems and are often so old that they run much simpler software, according to Louis Marcoccio, Year 2000 research director for the Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm.</p>
        <p>At a briefing last week on why Pentagon analysts overestimated the risks in many countries, Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said, ''If we had a failing, it may be that we extrapolated to the rest of the world the kind of business practices that we have developed here.''</p>
        <p>Once adjustments are made for technology dependence, some analysts say, the investment of the United States and other pacesetters in Year 2000 preparations was not that far out of line with those that started late. But the figures from many countries are so unreliable that it is hard to be sure. Russia, for example, is estimated to have spent anywhere from $200 million to $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcoccio suspects the lower figures are closest to the truth, but he adds that based on the government's estimate that the United States spent $100 billion, ''If Russia spent $400 million, they spent proportionally more than the United States, because the United States is 300 times more reliant on computers.''</p>
        <p>Such assessments lead down a pathway that only a statistician could love. Use Gartner's estimate that the United States spent $150 billion to $225 billion, and the comparable Russia investment jumps to a minimum of $500 million. Tamper with Gartner's guess that the United States is 300 times as computer-dependent, and figures dance another direction.</p>
        <p>But nearly everyone agrees that the figures for the United States include substantial sums toward preparations abroad by American multinationals. Motorola said its $225 million Year 2000 budget included not just repairs at its overseas factories but, for example, helping its Asian suppliers pinpoint potential flaws.</p>
        <p>The federal government picked up part of the tab for foreign nations, paying for many of them to send representatives to the first United Nations meeting on Year 2000 in late 1998. It distributed hundreds of thousands of CD's in 10 languages providing suggestions for organizing Year 2000 projects. The Defense Department provided $8 million to set up a joint observation post in Colorado as insurance against miscommunication that could lead to missiles' being launched.</p>
        <p>Such aid played a bigger role in helping late starters catch up than most people realize, some experts say. As John A. Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, sees it, hype about the magnitude of the problem misled fewer people than hype about the impossibility of getting it fixed.</p>
        <p>''This was a process that could move faster than the preparedness surveys,'' Mr. Koskinen said, noting that alarming press releases and testimony frequently relied on research that was obsolete within weeks.</p>
        <p>It helped that repair efforts became less expensive toward the end because of the experience gained by those who did the work early, according to Brian Robbins, senior vice president in charge of the Year 2000 project at Chase.</p>
        <p>By 1998, the pacesetters were far enough along for a sense to develop that others were lagging, and fears about the consequences began building. There were extenuating circumstances in some cases, like the economic slump in Asia, and many realized the problems would not be as daunting as in the United States. But with time short, industry groups like Global 2000 and a few countries began trying a variety of tactics to accelerate Year 2000 preparations.</p>
        <p>Still, many of those most familiar with the relative preparedness and spending levels in many countries wonder if it will be possible to figure out why things went so smoothly.</p>
        <p>Information was always hard to get and compare since sources varied so widely in what costs they attributed to Year 2000 work. Many countries have not included labor costs in their Year 2000 figures while the United States and Britain have, but practices have varied widely.</p>
        <p>Now that 2000 has arrived, the pressure to sort out such data is disappearing. Still, questions will not go away. What actually happened might figure in insurance lawsuits because if courts were to decide insurers were liable for the money companies spent to avoid problems, the insurers would undoubtedly cite the success of laggards and low spenders as a sign that budgets for American companies were bloated.</p>
        <p>More broadly though, comparing preparations and the results achieved may shed valuable light on cultural differences in how technology is set up and managed, according to Edward Tenner, author of ''Why Things Bite Back.'' That in turn could help society deal with problems like global warming and the proper use of biotechnology. ''We really need to look at the sociology of computing in detail,'' he said.</p>
