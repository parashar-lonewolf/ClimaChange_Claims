        <p>Fire Island is not eroding as ''the inevitable effect of a rising sea level'' as Orrin Pilkey suggests (''Sand-Castle Mentality on Fire Island,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 18).</p>
        <p>The highest observed rate of sea-level rise is less than a foot a century, and even that estimate is subject to question, as Mr. Pilkey's own book, ''The Corps and the Shore,'' notes.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Fire Island is not eroding as ''the inevitable effect of a rising sea level'' as Orrin Pilkey suggests (''Sand-Castle Mentality on Fire Island,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 18).</p>
        <p>The highest observed rate of sea-level rise is less than a foot a century, and even that estimate is subject to question, as Mr. Pilkey's own book, ''The Corps and the Shore,'' notes.</p>
        <p>The real cause of erosion on Fire Island is blockage of sand by the Westhampton groin field and failure to bypass sand around Moriches Inlet's jetties and deltas.</p>
        <p>Nor does the Army Corps of Engineers want ''to help homeowners by bringing in new sand.'' The proposed project, justified on the protection it will provide to the mainland, is based on a cost-benefit analysis. The recreational value of Fire Island is not even considered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pilkey would plug holes in the island as they occur. But engineers say a hole in western Fire Island, near the lighthouse, would cause its inlet to close and a new inlet would have to be stabilized. This would cost far more than replenishing the beaches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pilkey supports the Corps' Breach Contingency Plan, which was based on a recommendation of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Coastal Erosion Task Force.</p>
        <p>But the task force recognized that if the sand nature intended to move along barrier islands is not there, breaches (and mainland flooding) are inevitable. Thus, the other recommendations of the task force -- modification of the Westhampton groin field, bypassing sand at inlets and replenishment of the island -- equally deserve his support.</p>
        <p>Fire Island's 32 miles of beach are open to the public and are used by millions each year. Add to that economic estimates that the island accounts for $1 billion a year to Long Island's $10 billion tourist industry and it is clear that Mr. Pilkey's theories of coastal retreat are not relevant to New York.</p>
        <p>With the exception of erosion control, New York State has done a good job of preserving its beaches and shores and is improving on public accessibility. Mr. Pilkey's theories would be the ruination of those beaches.</p>

        <p>New York, Aug. 19, 1996</p>
        <p>The writer is president of the Fire Island Association, a property owners' group.</p>
