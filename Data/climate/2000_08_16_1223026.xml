        <p>Battling stormy seas and time, Russian seamen failed twice to hook up a rescue capsule to the nuclear-powered submarine lying broken and powerless on the floor of the Barents Sea with 116 men aboard, officials said early today.</p>
        <p>With little visibility, the attempts, on Tuesday and early this morning, were unable to dock with the submarine. A piloted capsule was lowered at 8 a.m. today for a third attempt. But with high seas and strong underwater currents, and with the submarine lying at an angle at a depth of 350 to 480 feet, the chances for a rescue seemed to grow dimmer.</p>
        <p>''All we know is that there are still people alive and they are signaling S O S,'' said the Russian Navy's commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov.  ''Every day the chances are slimmer.'' The only communication with the submarine, the Kursk, was from inside, from crew members tapping on the hull, Russian officials said. There were reports that the tapping had grown fainter and less frequent.</p>
        <p>During much of Tuesday, rescue efforts were hampered by winds that reached 45 miles an hour and  whipped up waves of 13 feet. Water temperatures near the submarine  hovered at 39 degrees. Visibility under water was extremely low, as little as five feet, the navy said.</p>
        <p>But the winds quieted in the night, enabling another rescue attempt. At least two small bell-shaped rescue capsules, each able to hold 10 to 20 people, were lowered to the scene of the accident.</p>
        <p>The capsules are equipped with video cameras and powerful searchlights and are normally run by three or four people, according to the RIA news agency. The agency said docking with the submarine required a high degree of precision.</p>
        <p>Even if they succeed in docking, the rescuers would probably have to carry out exhausted and injured crewmen. Some reports said that raising the rescue capsule, a simple chamber that hangs from a ship, could take several hours to avoid potentially fatal complications from decompression.</p>
        <p>The Interfax news agency quoted Admiral Kuroyedov as saying that if this plan failed, the navy might try to raise the 14,000-ton submarine with 400-ton inflatable pontoons.</p>
        <p>Western experts were doubtful that this could work, given the depth and the enormous weight of the Kursk and the water that has entered parts of the submarine. The experts also fear it might take too long to attach pontoons to the submarine, given what is thought to be the perilous state of the men inside.</p>
        <p>Though information about what happened remained fragmentary and often contradictory, the Kursk was apparently damaged by an explosion and partly flooded on Saturday during training maneuvers of Russia's Northern Fleet. Some earlier reports said the accident occurred on Sunday, but it now appears that the crew has been in trouble since Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Kursk is one of Russia's newest and most modern submarines, and the navy press office said that several high-ranking naval officers were on board to monitor the exercise along with the regular crew.</p>
        <p>After examining the outside of the submarine, navy officials said the most likely reason for the accident was an explosion, possibly from a torpedo carried in the front of the vessel. Russian officials insisted that there were no nuclear weapons on board and that the submarine's reactors were shut down. Russia has been accused of contaminating the Barents with radiation from discarded nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>Twenty-two Russian vessels were reported in the region struggling to find ways of saving their comrades.</p>
        <p>The officials said that oxygen supplies were likely to last only till Friday and that they had not succeeded in attaching oxygen and fuel lines to the Kursk. They said that the only power on the submarine was a battery, which cannot be recharged underwater, condemning the men to a slow death of asphyxiation if they were not rescued.</p>
        <p>Beyond that there was no information about the plight of the seamen and officers. Submarine experts could only speculate why the crew was not able to release an antenna, or how much of the vessel was flooded, or what exactly went so terribly wrong.</p>
        <p>Senior American officials in Washington said two American submarines had been monitoring the Russian exercise, which began last Thursday and involved a variety of vessels and aircraft, with test firings of missiles. The officials said it was one of the largest exercises held by the Russians in recent years.</p>
        <p>The American submarines detected a large explosion at about 7:30 or 8 on Saturday morning, the officials said, apparently from the Kursk. The source was not clear, but the sound was not that of a collision, they said.  American officials ruled out any collision with an American submarine.</p>
        <p>The officials were skeptical of a rescue, noting that the Kursk was resting at a 60 degree angle, making it unlikely that a rescue craft could successfully dock.</p>
        <p>Although American and other NATO navies offered to help, Russia initially refused the offers, and in any case it was not immediately clear what they could do.</p>
        <p>A group of Russian military officers met at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday night to see if there was anything the Western alliance could provide. A NATO official said the Russians discussed technical details in a telephone conference with naval experts in Northwood, England, where NATO has its naval headquarters for the eastern Atlantic.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate indication whether the discussions led to any concrete action. The British and American navies have various underwater rescue craft, and Norway and Germany have extensive undersea oil exploring experience, but it was not clear whether any Western vessel could link up to the Kursk's hatches.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen sent a letter to the Russian defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, offering ''any assistance you need.'' There was no immediate response.</p>
        <p>Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a spokesman for the United States Navy, said the Navy had informed other countries in the past of the dimensions of escape hatches that would be compatible with American rescue capsules. But he did not know whether the Russians had adopted those standards.</p>
        <p>In any case, Admiral Quigley said the 60-degree list of the Kursk put it ''beyond the design parameters of the United States deep submergence rescue vehicles.''</p>
        <p>Carlisle A. H. Trost, a retired admiral who was formerly chief of naval operations, said that even if the Kursk had a fully charged battery when it went down, the power would probably last only two or three days.</p>
        <p>''The atmosphere must be fouling very rapidly,'' said Admiral Trost, who once commanded a nuclear-powered submarine. And ''lights last only a very limited time.''</p>
        <p>The plight of the trapped seamen dominated Russian news. On one radio call-in show, a former professor demanded to know what could be done to persuade the authorities to seek outside help: ''What signs to we need to draw, to whom must we appeal to get them to accept help?''</p>
        <p>At least six seamen from the southeastern Russian city of Kursk, for which the submarine was named, were on board. One, Dima Staroseltsev, 20, had finished a training course in June and wrote home to say he was happy to be leaving for sea, his mother said by telephone. ''His last letter was so joyful,'' the mother, Valentina Staroseltseva, said. ''He said, mama, there's a great crew on board here, a bunch of guys from Kursk. We're like one big family.''</p>
        <p>The submarine's commander,  Gennadi Lyachin, 45, has served in the Northern Fleet since 1978, according to Russian news reports. The navy refused to give any details about the rest of the crew.</p>
        <p>The crew's plight horrified Russians. ''They are sitting and waiting,'' said Aleksandr Nikitin, an environmental activist who once was an engineer on a nuclear submarine.  ''This accident sketches a pretty accurate picture of the state of the navy.''</p>
        <p>In the absence of concrete information, experts said it was not possible to say how long the men could go on. They could slowly run out of oxygen, succumbing to mental dullness and possibly convulsions before sinking into a coma and dying.</p>
        <p>If there was a buildup of carbon dioxide, the brain would gradually stop functioning, the men would slip into unconciousness and their hearts would weaken and stop. Or, if the electrical system had failed, they could freeze to death. Or they could perish from a lethal buildup of nitrogen, sulfides and toxic gases.</p>
