        <p>One of the nation's fastest-growing cosmetics chains calls itself "dedicated to preserving the earth." Its brochure, printed on recycled paper, says, "Our packaging is earth friendly." And customers are assured that potions like pineapple mango bubble bath are made from natural ingredients and are not tested on animals.</p>
        <p>The pitch seemed familiar -- too familiar, in fact -- to the Body Shop, a British company that has taken Europe by storm by liberally mixing social consciousness with the cosmetics business. The Body Shop sued the supposed copycat, called Bath and Body Works, a division of the Limited Inc., the retailing powerhouse based in Columbus, Ohio. The two companies reached an out-of-court settlement in July.</p>
        <p>While Body Shop executives are pleased with that action, which forced some changes in the Bath and Body Works marketing approach, their worries are far from over. Another formidable American company, Estee Lauder Inc., is poised to go after the same market niche. It is revving up its year-old Origins Natural Resources line, which also uses minimal packaging and natural ingredients and donates part of its sales to charity.</p>
        <p>The Body Shop, under Anita Roddick, its founder and an outspoken advocate of social action by corporations as well as individuals, has made a name for itself by embodying her idea of "profits with principles." It also made $33 million before taxes on sales of $378 million last year, and both figures were up nearly 40 percent from the year before.</p>
        <p>Now, with 620 stores in 39 countries, the Body Shop is seeking to conquer new territory by aggressively expanding in the United States, where it has 66 stores. But given competitors like the Limited and Estee Lauder, some American cosmetics experts question whether it will be able to steamroll through the United States as easily as it has in other nations.</p>
        <p>That success in Europe does not guarantee popularity with Americans is a lesson learned by several other hot British retailers, notably the Sock Shop and the Tie Rack, which have faltered in the United States.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest potential obstacle for the Body Shop is Ms. Roddick's refusal to spend a penny on advertising. The company relies on word-of-mouth promotion and the news media, which are drawn to Ms. Roddick's iconoclastic approach to business and her penchant for tossing off provocative, highly quotable attacks on business and the cosmetics industry.</p>
        <p>Right now, in fact, she is gaining national publicity from a tour in the United States to promote her book, "Body and Soul," from Crown Publishers Inc. "I hate the beauty business," the book begins, because: "It lies. It cheats. It exploits women."</p>
        <p>Much of the Body Shop's approach seems aimed at making customers feel good, rather than look good. Its packaging shuns elaborate cardboard boxes in favor of simple plastic bottles with plain labels. Customers are encouraged to recycle these bottles by bringing them back for refilling. To further set itself apart, the company sells its products in individual Body Shop stores, rather than in department stores or pharmacies. Claiming a Moral Victory</p>
        <p>As it moves out across the United States, the Body Shop is claiming a legal and moral victory over the Limited, of which Ms. Roddick said, "They just got too near our style."</p>
        <p>She said the Limited had agreed to make changes in its stores, including limiting the use of the color green, which is dominant in Body Shops, to avoid confusing customers. Body Shop executives said the Limited had also agreed to give its newest stores a countrified "farmer's market" look, in contrast to the Body Shop's modern styling.</p>
        <p>The Limited would not comment on the lawsuit. But the changes aside, it still plans to have 100 Bath and Body Works by the end of the year, up from 60 now, and would like to have 500 stores by the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Estee Lauder is rapidly expanding the number of outlets dedicated to selling Origins. The products went on sale in August 1990, and there are now 100 Origins stores. Estee Lauder also has plans for 500 by 1995.  Opened First U.S. Store in 1988</p>
        <p>The Body Shop, which opened its first store in the United States in 1988, has also started an ambitious expansion program that calls for 500 stores in three years. It was founded in Britain by Ms. Roddick in 1976.</p>
        <p>While cosmetics with natural ingredients have long been available from small distributors, large companies have only recently become convinced that consumers' interest is more than a passing fad.</p>
        <p>Allen Mottus, a cosmetics industry consultant, calls the trend "a fad that's gone mainstream." Mr. Mottus said the success of the Body Shop was transforming what had been a cottage industry into a major growth segment within the $20 billion cosmetics industry.</p>
        <p>"The Body Shop did sound a wake-up call," said William P. Lauder, general manager of Origins. Mr. Lauder, the 31-year-old grandson of the company's founder, Estee Lauder, freely acknowledged that some aspects of Origins' business plan, like donating a portion of sales to charity, were inspired by the Body Shop.</p>
        <p>British supporters say that Body Shop imitators in the United States pose little threat to the dynamic and innovative Ms. Roddick. "They've already had a poke in the eye for their troubles," William Cullum, a British analyst, said of the Limited. "It is very difficult to stop a train once it's in motion."  Use of Eye-Catching Posters</p>
        <p>To compensate for the lack of advertising, the Body Shop relies on eye-catching posters, displayed in storefronts on busy streets in the United States and Europe. Sometimes the displays alert people to causes like saving rain forests and the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>But unlike urban centers in Britain and Europe, where retailers can hope to lure passers-by off the street, retailing in the United States takes place largely in malls.</p>
        <p>David Edward, the president and chief executive of the Body Shop's United States operations, said he was not too worried about the competition, although he acknowledged that the foes here were bigger and better financed than European competitors.</p>
        <p>The Body Shop only recently began turning a profit in the United States, and it is still setting up its manufacturing and distribution system here. Many of the products are made in England and shipped in bulk to the United States for bottling.</p>
        <p>In addition to influencing the way cosmetics are sold, the Body Shop is affecting where beauty products are sold. It appeals to customers who do not shop in department stores, the traditional stronghold of cosmetics sales. With department stores losing customers to speciality retailers like the Gap, the fall-off of customers has hurt cosmetics companies.</p>
        <p>"If store traffic is down, our business is down," Mr. Lauder said of the cosmetics industry.  'Almost a Way of Life'</p>
        <p>Ms. Roddick said that she was overcoming her distaste for malls but that she was holding firm on her refusal to advertise. And some analysts said the Body Shop's distinctive program of supporting social causes would be enough to lure customers. "The Body Shop offers almost a way of life," said Emma Burdett, an analyst with Hoare Govett, the London brokerage.</p>
        <p>Walter F. Loeb of Loeb Associates, a New York-based retail consulting firm, said the Body Shop policy of advocating social involvement -- for example, by encouraging customers to write letters supporting Amnesty International -- would insure that the retailer maintained a dedicated band of customers.</p>
        <p>"It's a very persuasive appeal," he said of the social agenda. Still, Mr. Loeb predicted that competition from Estee Lauder and the Limited would ultimately take its toll, slowing the Body Shop's rate of growth.</p>
