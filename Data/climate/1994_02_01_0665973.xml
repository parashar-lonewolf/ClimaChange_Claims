        <p>CONSERVATIONISTS widely believe that the more species an ecosystem contains, the more robust and stable it will be. If that is true, they say, the steady reduction of biological diversity now taking place around the world could in time undermine the ecological foundation of human existence.</p>
        <p>A counterargument holds that richness of species is unimportant to ecosystem stability as long as one or two species exist to carry out each of a number of vital functions like photosynthesis, pollination, plant-eating, predation and decomposition of waste. If that is true, the case for preserving biological diversity, the touchstone of conservation in the 1990's, loses one of its major props.</p>
        <p>For a long time there was little or no scientific evidence on the question. But now scientists have produced some, and it supports the view that biological diversity is indeed important to the functioning and stability of ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Tilman of the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and Dr. John A. Downing of the University of Montreal studied the behavior of prairie ecosystems for seven years. They found that the grassland plots with the greatest diversity of plant species lost far less of their vegetative cover as a result of the worst drought in 50 years, and recovered much more quickly, than the plots with the fewest species. The loss of each additional species resulted in a sharper reduction of the ecosystem's resistance to drought, the study suggests.</p>
        <p>The more species an ecosystem has, Dr. Tilman explains, the more likely it is that some will be resistant to drought, disease, insect plague or any other stress that can threaten it. These resistant species spread and take the place of those harmed or killed by the stress. "This is a process that could apply to any ecosystem," he said, which makes it important to preserve biological diversity "because it's nature's insurance policy against catastrophes."</p>
        <p>The evidence runs directly counter to the rival hypothesis, advanced by Prof. John Lawton, a British ecologist, not out of personal conviction but as a devil's-advocate scientific test. As a result of the Tilman-Downing findings and his own experimental work, Professor Lawton appears to be gravitating to the view of those who say species diversity matters. 'A Very Important Finding'</p>
        <p>The work of Dr. Tilman and Dr. Downing, reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature, "shows that a variety of species tends to buffer an ecosystem against extreme events," said Professor Lawton, "and that's a very important finding." On top of that, he said, his own work, carried out in a controlled laboratory setting, is also revealing that species diversity is important: even on an everyday basis, with no catastrophe looming, species-rich ecosystems tend to function more robustly than species-poor ones.</p>
        <p>The emerging evidence is bringing a measure of clarity to a subject largely characterized until now by hazy speculation. Many scientists are convinced that if whole classes of vital organisms -- invertebrates, for example -- were somehow eliminated, the global ecosystem would collapse and most other species would disappear, humans included.</p>
        <p>Many researchers have believed that species losses short of this extreme case could undercut ecosystem functioning, and that if enough ecosystems are affected the functioning of the biosphere at large -- humanity's life-support system -- could be seriously impaired. It is not necessary for species to go extinct globally for an ecosystem to crash, they fear, but only for enough species to disappear within that ecosystem. And while these scientists have been convinced that an ecosystem will collapse if certain keystone species disappear, they have had no clear idea of when an ecosystem begins to disintegrate.</p>
        <p>What they do know is that humans are rapidly eliminating habitats and introducing exotic species that choke out native ones, both of which reduce the diversity of ecosystems.</p>
        <p>The Tilman-Downing findings emerged from a long-term study of the factors affecting species composition, dynamics and diversity in Minnesota grasslands that began in 1982. The drought of 1987-88, the fourth worst since records have been kept in Minnesota, provided a fortuitous test of resistance to and recovery from stress among native plant species growing on the study's 207 plots.</p>
        <p>For each plot, the researchers calculated the rate of change in biomass, or dry weight of plant material above the ground. They found that during the drought, the plots with the most species produced about half their predrought biomass, while those with the fewest species produced only about one-eighth. By 1992 the species-rich plots had recovered their predrought biomass, while those poorest in species still produced significantly less than before. Help for Ecological Restoration</p>
        <p>The researchers found that species-rich plots were more likely to contain some drought-resistant species. These plants stepped up their growth to compensate partly for the decreased growth of other species.</p>
        <p>"We're greatly surprised by the clarity of the response we saw," said Dr. Tilman. "We expected there to be a relationship between biodiversity and stability, but we did not expect the relationship to be as strong or as clear as it turned out to be."</p>
        <p>The findings could have special meaning for the emerging art and practice of ecological restoration. Reviving only a handful of species may not be sufficient to restore an ecosystem's essential functions. "It doesn't say how many you need, but it does say you better put some variety in there if you're going to cope with the normal run of extremes or perturbations," said Dr. Peter Vitousek, an ecologist at Stanford University.</p>
        <p>Is there a threshold above which an increasing number of species no longer makes much difference to ecosystem stability?</p>
        <p>Dr. Tilman and Dr. Downing found that once there were 9 or 10 plant species, there was no longer a significant effect on ecosystem functioning. But since the researchers did not have many more than 10 species in their samplings, they do not know whether this constitutes a threshold. That question, which may have different answers for different ecosystems, is still to be investigated.</p>
        <p>While there is at present "no better data set than ours" addressing the the relationship of biodiversity to ecosystem stability, Dr. Tilman said, he and Dr. Downing are undertaking more rigorous studies aimed at producing a "very definitive answer" to the question. Support for Conservation</p>
        <p>And although "we do not yet know how the stability of other ecosystems depends on biodiversity, these results lend further urgency to pleas for the conservation of biodiversity," the two ecologists wrote in Nature.</p>
        <p>The Tilman-Downing study is "quite sound," said Dr. Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, an authority on biodiversity and an advocate for its conservation. Not least, he said, it helps point the way to understanding a "gray area" that has been "relatively intractable to experimentation or definitive field study and therefore not easily penetrated." The strategy followed by the two researchers was to combine the experimental approach of the laboratory with the real-world authenticity of a natural ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Professor Lawton said the study "carries an important message: that species matter in the ability of ecosystems to recover from extreme events."</p>
        <p>These events, he said, might be naturally occurring or caused by humans, like the climate change that some scientists believe is occurring as a result of emissions of industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. As human activity reduces the number and distribution of species, he said, "we begin to put large areas of the planet into a double whammy: global climate change and fewer species as well."</p>
        <p>Professor Lawton runs experiments in ecosystem behavior at a controlled environmental facility at the British Natural Environment Research Council's Center for Population Biology at Imperial College in Silwood Park, England. "We've created a series of little communities with varying complexity, and can run them through a series of plant variations and speed time up."</p>
        <p>Through this approach, he said, he and his colleagues have found that species matter in ecosystem functioning. For instance, he said, "we showed that the most species-rich ecosystems were the ones most able to absorb carbon dioxide" and that "a whole set of ecosystem processes changed as species changed." He said the findings are now being reviewed for publication.</p>
        <p>Because many people were writing about the relationship of biodiversity to the functioning of ecosystems "without any evidence at all," Professor Lawton said, he proposed the alternative hypothesis that one or two species representing each important ecosystem function are sufficient. Speaking as a scientist, he said he has been "completely neutral about which way the answer comes out; that's how science proceeds, by testing alternative hypotheses."</p>
        <p>But speaking personally, he said he was "delighted by these results" because they "strengthen the argument for conserving species and intact ecosystems."</p>
