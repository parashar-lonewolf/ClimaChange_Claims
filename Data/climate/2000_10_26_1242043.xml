        <p>Ivory Coast Uprising Ousts Ruler After Disputed Vote  Thousands of people poured into the streets of Abidjan in a revolt against the military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, who had declared himself the winner of a disputed presidential election. The whereabouts of Mr. Guei, who seized power in a coup last Christmas Eve, was unclear. The general's main election opponent, Laurent Gbagbo, declared himself president and the army chief said the military backed him. But at least one political party called for a new election.</p>

        <p>President Clinton, who is trying to get Yasir Arafat and Ehud Barak to Washington next week to try to restart the peace process, praised the Israeli prime minister but verged on blaming the Palestinian leader for not reining in violence.</p>

        <p>Gore's Russia Deal Called Legal  A 1995 deal signed by Vice President Al Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, allowing Russia to sell weapons to Iran without the United States imposing economic sanctions, was legal and did not threaten security, State Department officials told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>

        <p>A22-33</p>
        <p>California Is No Longer A Sure Thing for Gore  Hard campaigning by Gov. George W. Bush and the Republican Party has tightened the presidential race in California, which Vice President Al Gore -- and most political analysts -- at one time had solidly in the Democrats' column. And the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, also figures in the erosion of Mr. Gore's once double-digit lead over Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Nader accused Mr. Gore of repeatedly breaking promises to clean up the environment, help the poor and reform the government.</p>
        <p>A32</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, campaigning in his home state, Tennessee, framed his differences with Mr. Bush on education by emphasizing his commitment to public schools and describing Mr. Bush's proposals as ''half-measures'' and his Texas record as ''hollow.''</p>
        <p>A30</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is showing surprising strength in Florida among elderly and independent voters, a New York Times/CBS News poll found.</p>

        <p>Bush Makes Case to Floridians  Gov. George W. Bush made an aggressive appeal to elderly voters in Florida, pitching his Social Security and Medicare plans and accusing Vice President Al Gore of employing scare tactics.</p>
        <p>A31</p>
        <p>Maneuvering on Tax Changes  President Clinton and Congressional Republicans narrowed differences on a tax-cut package that includes relief for small businesses and a rise in the minimum wage, but hurdles to a final deal remained.</p>
        <p>A28</p>
        <p>Germ Terror Defense Faulted  The Henry L. Stimson Center, a nonprofit public policy research group, said that the threat of terrorism involving chemical and germ weapons had been exaggerated and that much of the government's response had been wasteful and ill-conceived.</p>

        <p>Poem's Authorship Challenged  A Vassar English professor says Clement Clarke Moore probably did not write the enduring 19th century Christmas poem ''Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,'' better known as ''The Night Before Christmas.'' Rather, he said, it appears to have been the work of Henry Livingston Jr. of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.</p>

        <p>Mrs. Clinton to Return Money From Muslim Event  Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would return $50,000 in political contributions received at a fund-raiser sponsored by a Muslim organization based in California.

        <p>Study Faults Fossil Fuels  Greenhouse gases mainly from fossil fuels are altering the atmosphere in ways that affect climate, an international scientific panel said, and it is likely that they have ''contributed substantially to the observed warming over the last 50 years.''</p>

        <p>AT&amp;T Breakup Plan  AT&amp;T said it would break itself into four parts, with four publicly traded stocks.
