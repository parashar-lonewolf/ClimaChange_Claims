        <p>LEAD: Miriam Goodman's article on Shoreham (''Shoreham's Rainy Day,'' June 4) is a classic example of anti-nuclear ballyhoo with no substantive alternatives offered.</p>
        <p>Miriam Goodman's article on Shoreham (''Shoreham's Rainy Day,'' June 4) is a classic example of anti-nuclear ballyhoo with no substantive alternatives offered.</p>
        <p>Shoreham is an issue ripe for political picking. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo used it to advance himself politically, and his mishandling of it will certainly come back to haunt him should he seek higher office in the future. The anti-nuclear doomsday prophets (who've managed to thwart the opening of any plant in recent years) are only too glad to pounce on another opportunity on the local news to utter scary sound bites and spread more misinformation about nuclear energy.</p>
        <p>In the midst of all the hysteria, is there ever any dialogue about our alternatives? No. Because nuclear energy is, at present, the only viable energy alternative we have.</p>
        <p>The facts speak for themselves. In its 35-year history, nuclear energy has been our safest form of energy, with no deaths or injuries resulting from its use. Compare that to smoking, whose related effects kill 390,000 people a year in this country.</p>
        <p>The Brookhaven National Laboratory estimates that nationwide, between 50,000 to 125,000 die from sulfates and other contaminants coming downwind from oil- and coal-fired generating plants. Not to mention the damage to the environment from these pollutants to the air, plant life and an increase in the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>The hoopla about solar energy has fizzled; it will not be the golden child we thought it to be any time soon. As for gas as a fuel, yes, it is cleaner, but take note of the hazards of gas leaks: in Russia recently, 800 people lost their lives.</p>
        <p>Anti-nuclear activists are always ready to pull out those tired old arguments to make their case: Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. I submit that Three Mile Island proved the safety of our first nuclear-plant design, which has since been vastly improved. The Times's own Jane Brody made a thorough study of the T.M.I. area and found no increase in cancer or other diseases that could be attributed to the accident.</p>
        <p>As for Chernobyl, there is no legitimate comparison there can be made to American plant design. The Chernobyl design is practically prehistoric, with no containment structure. When Govenor Cuomo compares Shoreham to Chernobyl, he's shooting himself in the foot.</p>
        <p>Scientists and engineers at nearby Brookhaven, for example, have come out in favor of Shoreham's opening. So has the Long Island Association. Several polls conducted by L.I. newspapers indicate a change in the tide of pro-Shoreham. This is because people are realizing that nuclear energy is the clean, safe energy alternative providing the most minimal risk to the environment at present.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goodman states that our energy policy ''must be based on benign and renewable energy sources.'' I couldn't agree with her more. But she offers no alternatives. In the meantime, Long Island is being bombarded with pollutants from its fossil-fuel plants. We may have to endure blackouts and brownouts this summer due to increased needs.</p>
        <p>We have a safe, viable form of energy now. Nuclear energy.  ALAN L. HAUSMAN</p>
