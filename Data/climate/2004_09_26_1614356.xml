        <p>Editorial praises ambitious plan by New York State to require that 24 percent of electricity sold through state's wholesale market come from renewable sources by 2013</p>

        <p>Americans have come to understand that there is a price for depending on fossil fuels as the main source of electrical power. The particulates and other pollution produced by coal-fired -- and, to a lesser extent, gas-fired -- power plants damage air, water and soil and contribute to asthma and other health problems.</p>
        <p>Absent strong leadership from Washington, about one-third of the states have begun working toward a cleaner future through renewable power sources like wind, solar energy and fuel cells. This week, New York gave renewable energy a tremendous boost, announcing an ambitious plan to require that 24 percent of electricity sold through the state's wholesale market come from renewable resources by 2013. This puts New York just behind California in efforts to find clean energy. New York already produces 19 percent of its energy from renewable sources, nearly all from hydropower at Niagara Falls.</p>

        <p>Americans have come to understand that there is a price for depending on fossil fuels as the main source of electrical power. The particulates and other pollution produced by coal-fired -- and, to a lesser extent, gas-fired -- power plants damage air, water and soil and contribute to asthma and other health problems.</p>
        <p>Absent strong leadership from Washington, about one-third of the states have begun working toward a cleaner future through renewable power sources like wind, solar energy and fuel cells. This week, New York gave renewable energy a tremendous boost, announcing an ambitious plan to require that 24 percent of electricity sold through the state's wholesale market come from renewable resources by 2013. This puts New York just behind California in efforts to find clean energy. New York already produces 19 percent of its energy from renewable sources, nearly all from hydropower at Niagara Falls.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki, who set a renewable energy target of 25 percent in his state of the state address last year, got the ball rolling, while the detailed work was done by the state's Public Service Commission, led by William M. Flynn. The commission says it expects that demand for ''green energy'' in retail markets will make up the difference between its plan and the governor's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's leadership is still needed. Some of the state's largest energy users balked at the initiative and are looking for special protections against cost increases. They should have to pay their fair share. Much of the expense of renewable energy is front-loaded -- investing in new wind turbines, for example -- and diminishes over time. The commission's study showed that, over the life of the program, a residential consumer's monthly bill might increase by less than 2 percent.</p>
        <p>That's a small price to pay for the benefits. Right now, 30 of New York's 62 counties fail air quality tests, and energy use continues to climb. By moving to renewable alternatives, mainly wind power, state utilities will produce about 6 percent less of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, and less of the pollutants that produce acid rain, smog and soot. For that, we'll all breathe easier.</p>
