        <p>The leaders of more than 100 countries are now gathering in Rio de Janeiro for an extraordinary Earth Summit, the largest meeting of world leaders ever held. Their agenda includes pages of lofty rhetoric but no important binding commitments.</p>
        <p>It need not have been so vaporous. Short-sighted politics, North and South, whittled down more ambitious goals and substituted rhetorical fudge for concrete commitments. The preparatory process revealed a near-scandalous lack of enlightened international leadership</p>
        <p>But vague declarations that pledge countries to do very little may nevertheless assume great importance. For the first time, the world's governments will jointly declare that the global environment is threatened, that it's everybody's problem and that the solution lies in collective action. For the first time, world leaders will endorse an agenda embodying the notion that economic growth must be integrated with environmental protection. That's a real advance.</p>
        <p>President Bush, a master of international consensus when the issue was Saddam Hussein, this time devoted his efforts to avoiding either commitments or blame. Only at the last moment did he even agree to attend. What a mockery of his promise to be an environmental President.</p>
        <p>The richer industrialized countries of the North have dragged their heels at contributing the financial resources needed to apply clean technology to the developing world. Japan and Europe seem prepared to pledge several billion dollars between them. The U.S. has hinted at much smaller amounts.</p>
        <p>Such miserliness is misguided. All countries have a stake in clean development. It is unjust and unrealistic to put the principal financial burden on developing countries themselves.</p>
        <p>Yet these countries have weakened their own cause by demanding that staggering sums be put at the disposal of a new international bureaucracy and by resisting enforceable commitments to conservation. Too many third-world leaders have treated the conference as a prod to win new aid commitments rather than to protect natural resources.</p>
        <p>Brazil and other tropical countries derailed a proposed treaty on tropical rain forests by insisting that temperate forests, whose problems and global significance are quite different, be included as well. And a broad range of poorer countries, motivated by nationalist and religious motives, blocked agreement on restraining population growth, a key to sustainable development.</p>
        <p>But there need be nothing final about these disappointments. The 11-day conference should not be considered a deadline, but a new opportunity to focus attention and narrow differences.</p>
        <p>Take global warming. There are substantial possibilities for mutually advantageous cooperation. According to William Cline, an economist at the Brookings Institution, industrialized countries would have to spend about $100 a ton to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. But carbon could be removed through reforestation in the third world at a fraction of the cost, probably between $10 and $20 a ton. That opens the possibility of industrialized countries levying carbon taxes and transferring some of the money to the third world to pay for forestry measures.</p>
        <p>On biodiversity, the U.S. refusal to sign a treaty need not halt progress. A contract between Merck &amp; Company, the American pharmaceutical manufacturer, and Costa Rica shows the way. Merck will work with a local institute to study native species of plants and animals, providing money and laboratory equipment. And if any of the species prove commercially exploitable, Merck will pay royalties.</p>
        <p>There are enormous possibilities for other cooperative arrangements that can help both North and South. The Earth Summit sets the stage to work them out.</p>
