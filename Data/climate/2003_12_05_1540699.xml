        <p>A top Kremlin official reaffirmed that President Vladimir V. Putin had decided not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the first climate treaty that would require countries to curb emissions linked to global warming. On Tuesday the official, Andrei N. Illarionov, quoted Mr. Putin as telling a European group, ''In its present form, this protocol cannot be ratified.'' Backing for the treaty is weighted, and with Washington still refusing to ratify it, the pact needs Russian approval to be enacted. On Wednesday, a deputy economics minister denied the Kremlin had decided to back away, but on Thursday, according to news agencies, Mr. Illarionov, Mr. Putin's top economic adviser, said the original statement was precisely what Mr. Putin had said.</p>
