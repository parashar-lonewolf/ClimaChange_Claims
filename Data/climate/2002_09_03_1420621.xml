        <p>In the dead of night on Aug. 14, in a lonely corner of southeast Alaska, a brand-new lake began to self-destruct in spectacular fashion.</p>
        <p>Almost three months before, the mammoth, expanding Hubbard Glacier had advanced across the mouth of Russell Fjord, shoving a pile of icy rock against the entrance, cutting off the fjord's connection with the sea.</p>
        <p>Fed by mountain streams and meltwater from other glaciers, Russell Fjord became Russell Lake, inexorably gaining almost 10 inches a day. But as the glacier continued to push forward, the icy rock -- a moraine, to glaciologists -- was squeezed higher as well, and kept back the lake water.</p>
        <p>Then at 3 a.m. on Aug. 14, after heavy rain had pushed the lake to more than 61 feet above sea level, the water won. The lake began to run over and erode its rocky obstruction.</p>
        <p>By midnight an incredible rush of water, 1.9 million cubic feet a second, was bursting through the growing breach -- a third more volume than the highest recorded flow of the mile-wide Mississippi as it passes Baton Rouge, La.</p>
        <p>But here water was gushing through a needle's-eye opening as little as 600 feet wide, said Dennis Trabant, a glaciologist with the United States Geological Survey, which had installed monitoring equipment. ''It was a monster discharge, a fantastic event,'' Mr. Trabant said.</p>
        <p>The deluge propelled icebergs out of Disenchantment Bay and down through Yakutat Bay to the sea. By the afternoon of Aug. 15, the lake had become a fjord again, back at sea level.</p>
        <p>This was the handiwork of the largest glacier in North America to terminate in the sea, as it grazed past a fjord in a stolid advance that began a century ago.</p>
        <p>But if glacial growth provided the most striking story this summer in Alaska, the more important news was glacial retreat.</p>
        <p>Dr. Keith Echelmeyer, a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and an accomplished bush pilot, has been flying his two-seat Piper PA-12 regularly over glaciers since 1993 and using laser altimetry to plot changes.</p>
        <p>After comparing their data against topographical maps that go back 50 years, he and his colleagues recently published their findings in Science for the first 67 glaciers measured, representing about 20 percent of the area covered by these Alaskan ice rivers and the geographically connected regions of the Canadian Yukon.</p>
        <p>From climate models, as well as years of field work, Dr. Echelmeyer had expected a general thinning of the glaciers that would be consistent with Alaska's summer temperature increase averaging 5 degrees over the past three decades. Instead, the researchers found that since the mid-1990's, Alaskan and Yukon glaciers had been dumping enough water into the ocean to raise sea level by 0.2 millimeters a year.</p>
        <p>Minuscule though that sounds, it is nearly twice the amount released during the same period by the massive Greenland Ice Sheet. Besides, as Dr. Echelmeyer pointed out, to coastal communities, a one-inch sea-level rise can mean a 500-inch incursion across a nearly flat beach.</p>
        <p>''Boy, to find two-  or three-times faster thinning,'' Dr. Echelmeyer said, ''that's a huge amount. The contribution of Alaskan glaciers to sea-level change is important, and big.''</p>
        <p>But why are some Alaskan glaciers growing, while most are shrinking? Much about glacial movement remains mysterious. But in simplest terms, glaciers are a varied lot, each marching to its own geophysical rhythm. Most of Alaska's glaciers, numbering more than 2,000, are valley glaciers, which snake downhill between mountain ridges and are particularly sensitive to climate. ''These glaciers can't thin without climate change,'' Dr. Echelmeyer said.</p>
        <p>Others may produce momentous effects locally while not reflecting much of the world's big picture. The Hubbard and the other dozen or so Alaskan glaciers whose termini calve, dropping icebergs into bodies of water, are in some ways the most apparently contrarian. ''The Hubbard is in a strong advance mode and it's not affected by the current climate trend,'' Mr. Trabant said. ''Why are certain glaciers really out of step with what we know globally is a shrinkage and retreat of glaciers? It's the Calving Glacier Cycle.'' The Hubbard's current course of movement began, in fact, 1,000 years ago, when the snout began not an advance but a retreat from the entrance to Yakutat Harbor, 38 miles to the southwest.</p>
        <p>Glacier ice is unique, far more plastic than ice in freezers, and it is in constant motion, pulled downhill by its own weight. The length of a glacier depends on the balance between the amount of new snow falling high up, which is transformed into new ice, and the amount of ice lost farther down in what is called the ablation area. In that area, the ice is lost to melting, evaporation and, in glaciers like the Hubbard, also to calving. If much more ice is being formed in the accumulation area above than is being lost to ablation, the snout moves forward: the glacier advances.</p>
        <p>''But tidewater glaciers are more complex, because of all this mechanical activity at the snout,'' said Dr. William Harrison, an emeritus professor of physics and an author of the University of Alaska research. ''Climate may provide the trigger, but then what happens doesn't have a lot to do with climate.'' Dr. Harrison said that 50 years was a ''good back-of-the-envelope number'' for the time a valley glacier took to adjust to climate change. Tidewater glaciers can take much longer.</p>
        <p>A century ago, after 900 years of retreat, the Hubbard began to advance. A glacier that is near equilibrium, with its snout basically marching in place, has an ablation zone that is about 40 percent of the total area. But even after a century, the Hubbard's is just a tenth as large. ''It's still so far out of balance,'' Mr. Trabant said, ''that there's no reasonably conceivable change in climate that can keep it from advancing. It just doesn't care.'' And it is not alone. Other calving glaciers in Alaska are also pressing forward. To the west, Meares Glacier, which ends in Unakwik Inlet, is crashing through an old-growth forest, while Harvard Glacier, which empties into College Fjord, is also advancing smartly.</p>
        <p>Back in Yakutat, the townspeople have their own concerns. The Hubbard Glacier last closed Russell Fjord in 1986, which prompted an international effort to save trapped marine animals, including harbor seals and porpoises. The ice dam burst open months later with a catastrophic flood, even larger than the one this August.</p>
        <p>But for Yakutat's residents the real worry, then and now, is that a long-term closing of the fjord could raise the new lake water level so high that it overflows ancient spillways at the back of the fjord, flooding the valuable commercial and sport fishery in the Situk River system. Salmon and steelhead fishing on the Situk are Yakutat's financial mainstay.</p>
        <p>With this latest closing, most residents accept the Hubbard Glacier's relentless advance and the inevitable formation of a long-term Russell Lake. ''They now realize that it's going to happen,'' Mr. Trabant said.</p>
        <p>Many in Yakutat want to bulldoze wider an overflow point that would direct water from the future Russell Lake away from the Situk River system. But this could easily cost many millions, Mr. Trabant said.</p>
        <p>Many biologists, and even some townspeople, are advancing a less expensive solution: to welcome this big, new lake that would be connected through the Situk River to the sea.</p>
        <p>In this proposal, fishing interests would be paid not to fish for the three to five years that wildlife specialists estimate it will take for the Situk River to restore itself. The result could be an even more abundant fishing paradise than Yakutat has today, state fisheries experts say. ''It would be a lot cheaper and it wouldn't be tampering with nature so hard,'' Mr. Trabant said.</p>
        <p>The consequences of tampering with nature are what Dr. Echelmeyer, Dr. Harrison and their colleagues take from their study of Alaska's diminishing glaciers. ''These glaciers in Alaska are changing very fast, and probably at an accelerated rate,'' Dr. Harrison said. ''But 'why' is the real issue. 'Why is it warm?' It's a societal question. But my own opinion is that at a time when we're dumping all this crud into the atmosphere, and changing the surface of the earth, it seems like too big a coincidence to me for us to be innocent -- that just when we're getting industrially active, it's the warmest it's been in the last 5,000 years.''</p>
