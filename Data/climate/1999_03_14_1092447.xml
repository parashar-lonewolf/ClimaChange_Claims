        <p>Government scientists have found that the harmless natural oil that gives peaches their perfume also kills fungus and other pests in the soil and could replace methyl bromide, a widely used pesticide that is toxic to people and also damages the planet's protective ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The peachy compound, called benzaldehyde, is manufactured synthetically. It is already used commercially in perfumes, flavorings, drugs and dyes, as are many other similar oils, like those distilled from lemon and peppermint.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the Agricultural Research Service, along with colleagues in South Africa and Israel, have been screening these natural chemicals for several years to see if they can be substituted for more dangerous man-made compounds. The essence of peach looks like an especially promising candidate, said Charles L. Wilson, a plant pathologist at the agency's Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, W.Va.</p>
        <p>His team developed a laboratory method for testing the extract against some of the most important pests that methyl bromide attacks, and when it proved effective they developed a new approach for applying benzaldehyde onto soil using granules of activated charcoal saturated with the fragrant chemical.</p>
        <p>If field tests prove successful, the scientists hope, it could be a significant breakthrough in ridding the world of methyl bromide. Like other chemicals such as CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, methyl bromide is supposed to be phased out under the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty. The ozone layer is important because it shields the earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays, which cause cancer and other environmental harm.</p>
        <p>But last year, bowing to protests by farmers who said that it was impossible for the United States to end methyl bromide's use as scheduled in 2001, Congress gave the industry until 2005 to do so.</p>
        <p>Even with the delay, its use next year is supposed to be 25 percent less than the amount used in 1990, and methyl bromide use is supposed to decrease rapidly over the next few years.</p>
        <p>That has alarmed many farmers, especially those like California strawberry growers and Florida tomato growers who use the chemical most extensively. Every year, they cover their fields with plastic suits and workers inject the gas under the sheets. Some of it soaks into the soil; some of it escapes into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wilson said in an interview that he doubted that any single compound, like the peach oil, would be a ''magic bullet'' to replace methyl bromide. But he said he was optimistic that combinations of naturally occurring chemicals, along with other changes in farming methods, would provide important benefits.</p>
        <p>''There is such a broad range of these things that are in nature already, and there has not been that much effort yet in trying to fish them out,'' he said. ''The synthetic compounds were so powerful that we stopped looking for natural pesticides.''</p>
        <p>He said that oils of wintergreen and clove might also prove useful.</p>
        <p>Not only does the peach essence kill off pathogens like Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium aphanidermatum, and Sclerotinia minor, the researchers found, but it seems to favor other, beneficial organisms in the soil that then continue to muscle out the unwanted pests.</p>
        <p>Agricultural scientists have been exploring many different substitutes for methyl bromide, but most of them have been synthetic chemicals that, while they do not damage the ozone layer, are not entirely harmless.</p>
        <p>Kert Davies, a researcher at the Environmental Working Group, which lobbies against pesticide use, said that the burgeoning research into natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals had broad implications for agriculture.</p>
        <p>''Replacing methyl bromide is like a moon mission,'' he said. ''We are discovering all these other things. We are discovering the Tang of agriculture -- farmers who never even thought of using methyl bromide are going to get the spinoffs.''</p>
        <p>But he criticized the Agriculture Department for not moving even faster to come up with alternatives, and said some farmers have been reluctant to test alternatives because they find continuing to use methyl bromide simpler, given that Congress is willing to extend its use.</p>
        <p>Thomas Duafala, the chief of research at Trical, a company in Hollister, Calif., that applies methyl bromide and other pesticides on farms, said that it might take years to get regulatory approval for any new pesticide, and he said it was hard to come up with any single substitute as powerful and effective as methyl bromide for treating soils.</p>
        <p>''People have been looking for alternatives to methyl bromide as long as I have been involved with methyl bromide, which is 20 years,'' Mr. Duafala said. ''Will this result in something useful down the road? I don't know, but there are a lot of ideas to be explored, and this is exciting.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, we will be able to come up with several things,'' he said. ''But it will not happen in the immediate future.''</p>
