        <p>President Reagan, who has been accused of dragging his feet on the most serious conflict between Canada and the United States, declared last week that he would seek $2.5 billion over the next five years to combat acid rain.</p>
        <p>The announcement was apparently timed to avoid any unpleasantness when Mr. Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada meet in Ottawa next month. Mr. Mulroney had complained that Mr. Reagan was not living up to an agreement, reached last year, to seek ways to control emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, which are generated mostly by coal-fired furnaces.</p>
        <p>Experts in Canada have estimated that half of all the acid rain in that country originated in the United States, mainly in the industrial Ohio Valley. They have also argued that the failure to limit the emissions, which undergo a chemical change and fall to earth in the form of acidic precipitation, could destroy many lakes and forests in central and eastern Canada in the next 30 years.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists said that $2.5 billion was not enough to curb the pollution, arguing that Mr. Reagan must also require huge reductions in sulfur emissions.</p>
