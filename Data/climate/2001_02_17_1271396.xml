        <p>He helped other students with their homework and waved politely to his neighbors, but there was still something about Jeremy Getman that unsettled more than a few of them.</p>
        <p>For some, it was the way he stared at them, or kept to himself and kicked at rocks while waiting for the school bus. For others, it was that he seemed to play with firecrackers and matches a lot, or that he threw objects into the road to watch cars run over them.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, attention was paid Wednesday morning when Mr. Getman, an 18-year-old senior at Southside High School,  passed a disturbing note to another student. That student gave the note to a teacher, who  alerted school administrators. A police officer was dispatched to find Mr. Getman.</p>
        <p>The officer found him in the school cafeteria, armed with a .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic, the police said. Beside him was a duffel bag crammed with 14 pipe bombs, 3 carbon dioxide cartridge bombs filled with gunpowder, one propane bomb and a sawed-off shotgun with several rounds of pellets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Getman was arrested, all 1,200 students were evacuated and no one was injured. But the specter of an armed attack on a local high school has shaken parents and students in this working-class city of 30,000 near the Pennsylvania border, and evoked the inevitable memories of the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado.</p>
        <p>''It could happen anywhere,'' said John R. Trice, the Chemung County district attorney. ''And the potential was there with the amount of firepower.''</p>
        <p>The authorities would not say whether Mr. Getman had made any threat, though they charged him with 11 counts of criminal possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to use on a person or property. They would not disclose the contents of the handwritten note he passed to a female student, other than to say that it did not threaten that student but aroused suspicion.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Getman's arrest, bomb squads have searched student lockers and restrooms, and even swept the rafters of the auditorium. Though the police say they discovered eight bombs at Mr. Getman's home, no more weapons have been found at the school.</p>
        <p>Still, a sense of unease lingers. About 300 students stayed home on Thursday, and 60 parents met with school officials that night.</p>
        <p>The bomb scare comes less than a year after the State Department of Health confirmed that cancer -- mostly leukemia and lymphoma -- had been diagnosed in 22 Southside students either during or after their time there. State health officials tested the air and ground and declared the school safe, though some residents fear there is a hazard.</p>
        <p>''It's been a tough year,'' said Barbara Ginalski, a nurse who pulled her 18-year-old son, Michael, and 16-year-old daughter, Erica, out of Southside on Thursday. ''The school is safe, but I made sure they were home just so that I could see them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Getman remains in the Chemung County Jail in $500,000 cash bail. His lawyer, Richard W. Rich Jr., the Chemung County public defender, could not be reached today for comment and his office was closed for the Presidents' Day holiday.</p>
        <p>At the modest blue house on Griffin Lane in Webb Mills where Mr. Getman lives with his parents, no one responded to a knock on the door. A woman who later answered the phone said she had no comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Getman's mother, Joan, is a rehabilitation specialist for a local hospital, and his father, Lawrence, works in a glass factory, prosecutors said. Neighbors said the Getmans also have an older daughter who no longer lives there.</p>
        <p>According to prosecutors, Mr. Getman broke into the family safe on Wednesday morning after his parents had left for work. He took his father's Ruger semiautomatic and shotgun, they said, then filled a duffel bag with homemade bombs and headed for school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Getman has no previous criminal record, prosecutors said. Police officials confiscated more bombs, a computer and bomb-making materials at his home, they said, but they would not discuss whether Mr. Getman had accomplices or any help in making the bombs, saying the case was still under investigation.</p>
        <p>At Southside High, which was closed today for the holiday, several students said they had seen Mr. Getman in classes, but had not even learned his name. Slightly built, he was described as polite, helpful and quiet.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't really communicative,'' said Nia Cowan, 16, who practiced with her cheerleading squad at the school gym. ''He just confined himself to his group of friends.''</p>
        <p>Erica Ginalski, who returned to school today for cheerleading practice, said she rode the same school bus as Mr. Getman. She used to see him set off firecrackers in the street and throw objects into the road. ''He seemed like a nice kid, but you knew he was weird, one of those kids you didn't want to be alone with,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Several parents also said they had misgivings about Mr. Getman, even though they struggled to say exactly what bothered them.</p>
        <p>Jill Overdorff, a teacher's aide who lives down the road from Mr. Getman, said he seemed to act as if he could do whatever he wanted. She discouraged her 14-year-old son, Pat, from becoming too friendly with him.</p>
        <p>''I can honestly say I didn't let Pat get real thick with him,'' she said. ''I just had a sense. I don't know if you want to say trouble -- but I just didn't feel comfortable.''</p>
