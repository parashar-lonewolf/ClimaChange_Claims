        <p>His ponds overrun by goose feathers, his parks virtually abandoned because of goose droppings, George W. Devanney was a suburban politician with a problem.</p>
        <p>And to deal with what Mr. Devanney, the manager of Union County, N.J., saw both as a serious nuisance and a potential public health concern, he turned to a drastic solution: Over the past two days, federal animal control workers have herded about 1,000 geese from parks and public areas into fenced pens and shoved them into the backs of specially equipped pickup trucks, where they were asphyxiated with carbon dioxide gas.</p>
        <p>''Nobody likes to do what we're doing,'' Mr. Devanney said in an interview yesterday. ''But we have had little success with anything else that we've tried.''</p>
        <p>Yet in resolving one problem, he may have inadvertently created another. Mr. Devanney has found himself and his North Jersey county thrust into the contentious debate in suburbs across the region about the most effective and most humane way to deal with geese populations that practically everyone agrees are troublesome.</p>
        <p>Even before Mr. Devanney signed off on one of the state's largest kills of Canada geese, communities across New Jersey were increasingly employing so-called lethal animal control measures.</p>
        <p>New Jersey officials said that already this year, homeowners, towns and counties have filed 33 requests to kill geese -- two more than in all of last year.</p>
        <p>And there is little peace for geese elsewhere in the region. Lawmakers in Connecticut passed a measure last month that allows residents to get state permits to do away with the birds. Last year Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York stepped in to quash an effort to kill large numbers of geese on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Animal rights advocates have long said that besides being inhumane, the geese kills are unnecessary. They point to a range of nonlethal techniques -- from chemicals to dogs -- to discourage the birds from settling in heavily used public areas.</p>
        <p>One advocate, Sue Russell, asked a State Superior Court judge this week to issue an injunction that would protect the geese in Union County, while more geese-friendly options were used. The judge refused.</p>
        <p>Although she failed to stop the destruction of birds in Union, she said her campaign to end similar kills in other parts of the state would continue.</p>
        <p>''We're just beginning,'' said Ms. Russell, who works with two animal rights groups, the Center for Animal Protection and the Coalition to Prevent the Destruction of Canada Geese.</p>
        <p>Of the asphyxiation of the geese in Union County, Ms. Russell said, ''I just can't conceive of someone doing that to something as sensitive and intelligent as these geese.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Devanney said that he realized the move would be unpopular with some, but that he felt he had no other choice. ''Clearly, there are people who are animal lovers, and I understand where they're coming from,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Devanney said, the county's two-day effort killed far fewer than the 2,700 geese whose destruction the state had approved. The kill was conducted under a $20,000 contract with the Fish and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>Under state guidelines, communities can obtain permits to kill the geese only after they have shown that they exhausted all other measures to discourage them from populating parks and other public areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Devanney said he reluctantly approved the plan to destroy the geese.</p>
        <p>''We had birds hissing at golfers, we had parents who said, 'My son can't walk without stepping in feces,' '' he said. ''It becomes a public health hazard.''</p>
        <p>Animal rights advocates say the health risks associated with geese droppings are exaggerated.</p>
        <p>''I call this looking for scapegeese,'' said Bob Chorush, a spokesman for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. ''Even though goose poop is unpleasant, it can be cleaned up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chorush said his organization tried to encourage communities to use methods like building goose-proof nets or egg addling, in which goose eggs are shaken or otherwise altered so birds will not hatch.</p>
        <p>He said that another novel approach was something he called an ''avian dissuader laser.''</p>
        <p>''It's basically a laser pointer that you aim at the geese,'' Mr. Chorush said. ''It's like being hit with an electric brand.''</p>
