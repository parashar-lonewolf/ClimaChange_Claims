        <p>For the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, 22, the road from "sulking brooder" to leading man is a short one.</p>

        <p>Jake Gyllenhaal can wrap two feet around his head. No, he is not a yogi, although the 22-year-old actor did study Eastern religion at Columbia University for two years. It's just that the circumference of his noggin is a whopping 24 inches.</p>
        <p>''I can never find hats that fit,'' Gyllenhaal says, removing one that does -- a hybrid baseball-trucker cap by the London label the ''Duffer'' of St. George. ''My head happens to be of an abnormal size.''</p>
        <p>It is not, however, nearly as large as it might be, given his precocious success. Since starring as a 17-year-old rocket enthusiast in the heartwarming 1999 film ''October Sky,'' Gyllenhaal has become the go-to guy for art-house auteurs in search of angst-ridden adolescents. He has mined the emotionally taxing terrain of what he calls ''serious, sulking brooders'' to great acclaim. In the 2001 cult hit ''Donnie Darko,'' Gyllenhaal teamed with his older thespian sibling, Maggie (whose breakthrough came last year in ''Secretary''), portraying a time-traveling high-school student driven to misdeeds by a demonic rabbit. He has also played the boy-toy of an older woman in ''Lovely and Amazing'' and a discount store worker dangerously obsessed with Jennifer Aniston -- and J.D. Salinger -- in ''The Good Girl.'' (Gyllenhaal's production company, Nine Stories, is named for the Salinger collection, his favorite being ''Teddy.'')</p>
        <p>For comic relief, the naturally buoyant Gyllenhaal threw himself into slapstick, playing a love-struck teenager in the dark farce ''Bubble Boy,'' but soon enough he returned to drama, playing a surrogate son to Susan Sarandon and Dustin Hoffman in ''Moonlight Mile.''</p>
        <p>During their first meeting, Hoffman reportedly asked Gyllenhaal, whom critics have suggested could be a young Hoffman, ''Why aren't you more intimidated by me?''</p>
        <p>The reasons: nature and nurture. Gyllenhaal, the son of the screenwriter Naomi Foner and the director Stephen Gyllenhaal, made his film debut as a gap-toothed, spiky-haired tween, playing Billy Crystal's son in the 1991 comedy ''City Slickers.'' Two years later, both he and his sister appeared in ''A Dangerous Woman,'' scripted by their mother and directed by their father.</p>
        <p>The Gyllenhaals grew up in Los Angeles and on ''extravagantly awesome'' Martha's Vineyard with an A-list of liberals. Modesty and general boredom with the subject prevents him from name-dropping, but for the record, they include: his godmother, Jamie Lee Curtis; his first driving instructor, Paul Newman, whom he knew then only as ''the salad dressing guy''; and Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, who invited a young Gyllenhaal to dinner with his now-chum Chelsea Clinton.</p>
        <p>It was Hoffman, however, who may have had the greatest influence, urging the young actor to explore the theater. As a result, Gyllenhaal made his stage debut in the 2002 London production of Kenneth Lonergan's play ''This Is Our Youth'' -- a revolving-cast production that has become ''The Vagina Monologues'' for the postadolescent drama set. The role earned Gyllenhaal an Outstanding Newcomer Award from The Evening Standard.</p>
        <p>Without driving a muscle car, donning superhero tights or defiling a piece of pastry, Gyllenhaal's ascendance has, by any standard, come fast and furious. During one particularly hectic period when he made five films in one year, Gyllenhaal wore a gold band on his finger inscribed with these words: ''Mine the darkness and see by the path you leave behind.''</p>
        <p>He no longer wears that ring, and declares that nonstop journeyman period over. ''I needed time to figure things about myself rather than grow up on movie sets,'' he says. One thing he discovered was his comfort zone; he decided not to pursue a plum role in Bertolucci's ''Dreamers,'' which involved nudity. ''I'm not shy about taking my clothes off, but if I'm going to see pictures of myself naked on the Internet, I would love to feel like there was a reason for it, that it was of service to the story.'' In the past, he admits, he would choose ''characters that were more screwed up than I am to prove something, rather than accepting that I have certain obvious things that I want to show to people.''</p>
        <p>Chief among those things are a quick, improvisational wit and a goofy charm somewhat at odds with his troubled screen persona. The recent addition of a beard, something he is toying with for his coming role in the screen production of the Broadway hit ''Proof,'' does little to diminish -- or age -- his unconventionally handsome mug. With Gyllenhaal, though, the eyes have it; strikingly blue and expressive, they telegraph hurt and delight, mischief and danger.</p>
        <p>Sauntering into the cafe of Ikea (his rendezvous choice) in Burbank, Calif., the 6-footer appears exceedingly Everydude in a Hanes T-shirt and Dolce &amp; Gabbana jeans that hang low in the de rigueur fashion of youth, revealing Calvin Klein drawers. He pretends to be horrified by his entrance.</p>
        <p>''Did I pull the ultimate actor move of being 15 minutes late?'' he asks, eyes twinkling.</p>
        <p>Ten, but who's counting?</p>
        <p>Gyllenhaal orders a plate of Swedish meatballs, which he eats with toothpicks just to appear eccentric. Of Swedish descent himself, the actor admires the socialist approach of the home-furnishings outlet and happily strolls the aisles, talking to strangers.</p>
        <p>''I like Ikea because it feels like the potential of a home,'' says Gyllenhaal, who remains undaunted by the actor's itinerant life. ''I've just been roaming the land. I live in a storage bin and eat at Ikea.''</p>
        <p>When the store sound system begins blaring the 80's pop standard ''Walking on Sunshine,'' Gyllenhaal, who narrowly lost the lead in ''Moulin Rouge'' to Ewan McGregor, amuses fellow shoppers by breaking into song and dance. Spent, he slides into a display filled with red rubber balls. ''I'm floating in a pan of giant cranberries,'' he shouts, giving voice to either an inner child or a very green acting student.</p>
        <p>With a charisma characterized in the pages of youth publications as ''puppy dog adorable'' that could easily have led Gyllenhaal to alpha-teen pinup status, he has always chosen the more difficult, less commercial path. Now, he has also arrived at a professional crossroads, electing to do more theater and fewer films in favor of those that will secure his position as a box office commodity, allowing him the freedom to choose independent projects or work with current favorite directors like Pedro Almodóvar and Alfonso Cuarón.</p>
        <p>Toward that end, Gyllenhaal spent six months in Montreal filming ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' a big-budget doomsday thriller directed by Roland Emmerich (of ''Independence Day'') to be released next spring. ''I play Sam Hall, a feisty guy caught in the middle of his parents' divorce,'' Gyllenhaal says. ''He's a smart kid, but doesn't study, and when caught in dire life-threatening circumstances, he discovers himself to be an unlikely hero. I did all of my own stunts: no look-alikes, no dummies.''</p>
        <p>No dummy himself, Gyllenhaal counts environmentalism among his causes and hopes the story about global warming turns out to be a cautionary tale.</p>
        <p>''It's not like I'm trying to disguise a movie that is basically a big-action film as some sort of political statement,'' he says. ''I do believe that the environment sways and stagnates politics. I mean, if we were using alternative energy, obviously we'd have no interest in Iraq. Hopefully, people will leave the theater and go: 'I'm driving this enormous S.U.V. that guzzles gas, and there are only two people in the car with me every day, and I don't use it for anything else except to kind of look cool. Maybe I should get a hybrid car.''' This is exactly what Gyllenhaal intends to do, when the lease on his current ride -- a BMW station wagon -- is up.</p>
        <p>Speaking of global affairs, his craft and his personal life, Gyllenhaal maintains a serious mien but rises to the bait when called a lefty. ''I'm totally bipartisan!'' he protests with a smile. ''I'm a big fan of the Texas Rangers, and there's something stylish about them belts George Bush wears.''</p>
        <p>He is surprisingly relaxed and good-natured about the attention that his relationship with the actress Kirsten Dunst, 21, has garnered. ''Fame is being able to get into a restaurant,'' he says. ''It doesn't inhibit what I do and the way I feel. Needing attention is a destructive, really unhappy way to live. If you watch the ebb and flow of these things, it's like a few seconds in what I intend to be an incredibly long career.''</p>
        <p>After filming ''Proof,'' Gyllenhaal plans to tackle the classics, playing Romeo in 2004 in a West End production. ''I am chomping at the bit,'' he admits. ''There are periods of time in your life where you can truly and honestly pull certain characters off. Romeo happens to fit right now. I have never performed Shakespeare, but I have an innate feeling that this role and I will get along just fine. I've outgrown quirky -- on to the Romantics.''</p>
