        <p>When my boyfriend asked me to attend his brother's wedding in 1997, I was a bit nervous: I would be meeting not only Andrew's immediate family but his rather sizable extended family, as well.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally (or not, my therapist said), I caught a nasty cold a week before the wedding. The day of the big event, the congestion still filled my head, hammering down on my sinuses. I was popping Sudafed like so many red M&amp;Ms, and alternating it with Afrin, a nasal spray. I wanted desperately to be symptom-free.</p>
        <p>As the best man, Andrew had been struggling over the toast he was to give, much as he had struggled over his relationship with his brother. Weeks before, he had said, ''The last thing I want is to write that toast the night before the wedding.'' Now, it was the morning of.</p>
        <p>As I lay in bed in the hotel in Pennsylvania, groggy with congestion, his writer's block finally lifted. He had ideas. I was blowing my nose.</p>
        <p>It was noon, four hours before the pre-wedding photo session. I dozed off for a bit. Then suddenly, I sat straight up in bed.</p>
        <p>I felt fear. I looked around the room, but I felt myself being pulled away backward, up through a tunnel, with Andrew seeming to move farther and farther away.</p>
        <p>I said, ''Something's wrong,'' but Andrew was on a roll. He barely looked up.</p>
        <p>I said: ''I'm drifting away. I'm dying.''</p>
        <p>Andrew put down his pen and came over. He took my pulse, looked in my eyes. I looked dazed, he said, but he couldn't find anything wrong with me.</p>
        <p>I begged him to call an ambulance. A wave of heat washed over me, from my toes to my head. I felt like I would lose consciousness any second. He finally acquiesced.</p>
        <p>The paramedics burst through the hotel door with their medical kits. They asked me if I was taking drugs (not the cold-relief kind). I opened my cosmetic case and handed over my armament of decongestants.</p>
        <p>They checked my heart and vital signs and moved me to the gurney. Guests peeked out of their hotel doors to watch the woman being wheeled away. They later learned she was the groom's brother's new girlfriend. I was too afraid to be embarrassed.</p>
        <p>The waves of heat persisted in the ambulance. Normally uneasy with needles, I eagerly offered my arm for them to take blood. At the hospital, my gurney was parked in a hallway of the emergency department for more than an hour. I grasped the sleeve of anyone who walked by, asking: ''Are you a doctor? Where's the doctor?''</p>
        <p>Andrew had grabbed his tuxedo (and his speech) and had driven to the hospital. When he made his way back to the emergency room, he told me the doctor had said I'd be fine. Andrew said he was very sorry but he had to go. He introduced me to his cousin, Todd, his proxy. ''Nice to meet you,'' I said from my gurney.</p>
        <p>When the doctor finally arrived, the symptoms had subsided. He said my heart was fine, everything was normal, and I was free to go.</p>
        <p>''Well, what was it?'' I asked, shocked to hear that nothing was wrong. He said that I had carbon dioxide in my blood -- a symptom of a panic attack.</p>
        <p>I did not consider myself an anxious or fearful person. I was an adventurer, a risk taker, and I had always thought of myself as laid back (in retrospect, down-to-earth is probably more accurate).</p>
        <p>My therapist tried to pin the attack on my anxiety over the wedding, but the diagnosis didn't fit. I kept going back to a fleeting thought I had when I awoke that afternoon, which was that my cold had crossed the blood-brain barrier and was infecting my brain. It was fleeting, but frightening.</p>
        <p>I tend to get nervous about health matters, a vestigial fear from my mother's illness and death when I was a child. Perhaps that combined with the Afrin -- which can cause nervousness and other nervous system effects -- lowered some threshold.</p>
        <p>''As a rational being, you try to figure out what it was that set this off,'' my friend Joe Belanoff, a psychiatrist who at the time was a professor at Stanford, told me later.</p>
        <p>A classic example, he said, is for someone to say, '' 'It happened when I was driving across the bridge, therefore it must be the bridge.' Everyone does it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some scientists believe that panic attacks are set off by too much carbon dioxide in the blood, sometimes as a result of hypoventilating.</p>
        <p>''All of us, if we get enough CO2 into our system, will have a panic attack,'' Dr. Belanoff said. ''But our thresholds are set at different levels.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I would bet in your circumstance it was totally related to the fact that you were congested, and literally with your nose in the pillow, not breathing well. And you got your CO2 up to the point that you had this attack.''</p>
        <p>There are other theories, though.</p>
        <p>After a panic attack, it's common to have more attacks, like aftershocks, for several months. I had a number of close calls, and they were all health-related (I was attached to my theory). Once when I opened a hot oven, a blast of heat hit my eyes, and I thought they had been burned. Another time, I was choking. Both times, I tried to breathe deeply to relax. The panic attacks never materialized. Breathing, it turns out, actually lowers CO2.</p>
        <p>Because the breathing worked, I would not need cognitive-behavioral therapy or anti-anxiety drugs, two common treatments.</p>
        <p>But a panic attack is now part of my medical history. In every medical situation, be it giving birth or having a root canal, I have warned my physician that I've had a panic attack, and I go straight to deep breathing.</p>
        <p>That afternoon, after I was released from the hospital, I had time to shower, slip into my little black dress, and make it to the wedding. Andrew's toast won a heartfelt hug from his brother. I felt self-conscious.</p>
        <p>When someone from his family asked me what happened, I said that I had had a bad drug reaction. I didn't want to be viewed as an anxious person.</p>
        <p>Later on, Andrew and I laughed at how my experience would go down in family lore. We've been married six years, and I am asked to retell the story on occasion, though I've only recently begun to take a breath and admit what it really was.</p>
