        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your bullish case for nuclear power (''Revive the Atom,'' editorial, Dec. 8) ignores two important components: nuclear proliferation and competition.</p>
        <p>Weapons-grade plutonium is an inevitable byproduct of reactor operation, typically generating enough for 20 nuclear bombs each year in a large reactor. If conventional energy projections come to pass, in the next 50 years the world will be circulating 5 million to 10 million pounds of plutonium annually to and from reactors. This is enough for 500,000 nuclear bombs - 10 times the world arsenal of nuclear bombs.</p>
        <p>To make reactors proliferation-resistant would require reducing the annual discharge of weapons-grade plutonium by 80 percent to 90 percent. Incredibly, there is virtually no serious discussion among reactor vendors, nor in your editorial, to develop such diversion-resistant designs. From this vantage point, the Department of Energy's decision to pay $150 million for new reactor designs, without diversion-resistant criteria, is squandering the taxpayers' dollars.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Department of Energy could have saved $100 million by financing a demonstration of aircraft-derived gas turbines. These highly efficient, durable and easily repaired turbines were developed by General Electric and Pratt-Whitney, as part of a $5 billion Air Force research and development program. Detailed testimony to Congress has shown that it would take roughly $50 million to commercialize this technology, using gasified biomass as the fuel source. The estimated capital costs are two-thirds less than those for nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>The United States holds the world lead on this extremely promising technology. In the United States, for example, advanced gas turbines could largely displace all the coal burned by utilities by using a combination of logging wastes and tree crops grown on some of the 120 million acres of classified erodible farmlands. Comparably large uses have been identified in developing countries, where biomass fuels are combusted in horrendously inefficient boilers.</p>
        <p>Sweden is planning to use its forest industry wastes to fuel this technology, which the Swedes estimate can back out as much as 80 percent of their nuclear reactors. Sweden is phasing out over the next 15 years all of its reactors, which provide more than 40 percent of the nation's electricity.</p>
        <p>Sustainably harvested biomass fuels would also help reduce greenhouse gases and acid rain pollutants. This win-win strategy is good for the environment and for enhancing America's competitive edge. Let's not lose the opportunity, once again, to our foreign competitors.</p>
        <p>Finally, your editorial is misleading in implying that the Federal Government has abandoned nuclear technology. Quite the contrary, the nuclear fission program for fiscal year 1990 exceeds $700 million, compared with less than $200 million for energy-efficiency research and development and $100 million for research and development on all solar and renewable technologies. Moreover, the Federal nuclear accident insurance subsidy (the Price-Anderson Act) has been extended for 15 years, and the Senate has voted to forgive the nuclear industry's $10 billion debt for past Federal uranium enrichment services. This is hardly an equitable playing field for solar and efficiency options. CLAUDINE SCHNEIDER  Member of Congress, 2d Dist., R.I.  Washington, Dec. 11, 1989</p>
