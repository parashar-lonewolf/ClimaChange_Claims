        <p>New York State has taken the lead in making commercial and residential buildings more efficient and more in harmony with the environment by adopting a ''green building credit'' against state income taxes.</p>
        <p>The credit, which was included in the state budget signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki on May 15, is intended to encourage building owners and developers to use advanced technologies like fuel cells and photovoltaic panels to generate electricity and to use materials that improve air quality inside buildings.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge deal,'' said Robert F. Fox Jr., a partner in Fox &amp; Fowle Architects, which specializes in environmentally sensitive design. ''Basically, the state is offering to pay developers for the excess costs of doing green buildings.''</p>
        <p>Green buildings are generally defined as those that use energy more efficiently than those with conventional designs and that provide workers with well-lighted spaces furnished with an abundance of clean air. One of the objectives of designing a green building is to avoid using carpets, paints or other interior materials that can release harmful chemicals after being installed.</p>
        <p>The credit is limited to a total of $25 million for all projects over five years. It was advocated by an unusual alliance, including the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents owners, developers and brokers, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, a major environmental advocacy group. Similar bills are in the works in Maryland and California, but New York's law appears to be the first, according to the council.</p>
        <p>''This collaborative effort is a prototype for other states and eventually the federal government to follow,'' said Deborah B. Beck, the executive vice president of the Real Estate Board.</p>
        <p>The legislation provides a credit of 5 percent of the capitalized cost of a project -- up to $3.75 per square foot for interior work and $7.50 per square foot for exterior work -- to builders who meet energy goals and use nontoxic materials in construction. To qualify, a building must meet requirements for energy use, indoor air quality, waste disposal and water use.</p>
        <p>There is also a credit equivalent to 10 percent of the cost of new air-conditioning equipment that uses refrigerants that do not harm the ozone layer. There are additional credits for tenants who build their interior space to conform with the goals.</p>
        <p>Builders using fuel cells and photovoltaic panels, which produce electricity without the pollution associated with conventional power sources, are eligible for special additional credits. Both technologies also have the potential to produce power more cheaply than conventional methods, but they tend to be more costly because they are less developed.</p>
        <p>''The point of the legislation is to jump-start industries,'' Ms. Beck said. ''We want to go from custom installations to mass production. We want to bring more people into the marketplace and make it more competitive.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cells produce electricity by consuming natural gas in a catalytic process that does not burn the fuel. The only emissions are carbon dioxide and water, in contrast to the mixture of chemicals flowing from the stacks of plants burning fossil fuels. The technology is evolving rapidly, Mr. Fox said. ''In five years, fuel cells will be able to provide power at one-third the current cost,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity with no emissions at all. Although individually they do not produce much power, they can replace conventional materials in the skin of a building, and when wired together they can produce usable amounts of power without any expenditure for fuel.</p>
        <p>Douglas Durst, whose Conde Nast building at the corner of 42nd Street and Broadway incorporates both fuel cells and photovoltaic panels, welcomed the legislation, but had some reservations. Because there is a yearly limit on the total tax credits that can be claimed, he said, there should be a way of preventing one big project from absorbing most of one year's allotment.</p>
        <p>Participants in the discussions about the legislation said the five-year limit of $25 million was inserted to demonstrate fiscal prudence. But they said the cap might be raised or the time period extended if the program is successful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Durst also said a mechanism needs to be developed ''to help smaller builders who do not know to apply these technologies.''</p>
        <p>He said his company, the Durst Organization, would continue to incorporate green technologies in future projects despite a delay in financial benefits other developers find unacceptable. ''We are a family business that is building for the next generation, so we don't mind long paybacks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Investments in advanced technology in the Conde Nast building at 4 Times Square allow the company to operate it more economically than  conventional structures, Mr. Durst said.</p>
        <p>William Rudin, whose Rudin Management Company is building a headquarters for Reuters at Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street, said the building incorporated technologies included in the legislation.</p>
        <p>He said that the wiring in the building can use power from fuel cells and photovoltaic panels and that space has been allocated to install the cells.</p>
        <p>The Reuters building also includes filters to improve indoor air quality and glass that resists ultraviolet rays, reducing the amount of power needed for cooling.</p>
        <p>Daniel R. Tishman, the president of Tishman Construction, which managed the construction of both buildings, was part of a group of businessmen and environmentalists who helped draft the tax credit. ''Since it costs a bit more up front,'' he said, ''we wanted to design an incentive -- like an investment tax credit -- to encourage developers and landlords to do what's right for the environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, who was the architect for both buildings, said the tax credits would pay 30 percent of the cost of buying fuel cells, less federal or state grants. And, he said, they would pay for 100 percent of the cost of the solar power panels, minus the cost of building materials that would have been used otherwise.</p>
