        <p>LEAD: As Eastern Europe struggles toward democracy, it must also grapple with a ravaged environment. Corrosive soot has fouled water and soil, and in blackened industrial cities the air is laced with heavy metals and chemicals.

        <p>As Eastern Europe struggles toward democracy, it must also grapple with a ravaged environment. Corrosive soot has fouled water and soil, and in blackened industrial cities the air is laced with heavy metals and chemicals. In a world ruled by production targets, there was no pressure to clean up.</p>
        <p>In the bleakness of early spring, the drawn faces and grubby homes take on the grays and browns of the landscape. Acrid smoke from rows of chimneys darkens the streets. The lignite and brown coal that is used to fuel the homes and industrial plants of much of Eastern Europe is cheap and abundant. It is also high in sulfur and ash and intensely dirty.</p>
        <p>For years, the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe denied that the coal was a health hazard. Or that steel and chemical works, operating with few or no emission controls, could endanger the environment and human life.</p>
        <p>But the governments knew. The military, watching strategic areas along the borders, noted that the forests were dying, and foresters warned that rain, laden with sulfur, was sapping the life from trees. Physicians and biologists called attention to toxic metals collecting in human tissue and blood; to the many babies born early or with deformities; to the high incidence of asthma, bronchitis, eye and skin ailments and heart disease.</p>
        <p>For a long time, to question official production targets and methods was to question the Communist system and its commitment to heavy industry. Plant managers were judged by their ability to meet production quotas, without regard to cost, harm or waste.</p>
        <p>As alarm about the choking air and the frightening rate of illnesses grew, the party bosses at first attempted to suppress the protests, deeming ecological concerns a ploy of the West to weaken socialism. Yet with the end of Communist rule in much of Eastern Europe, the enormity of this environmental disaster has finally been recognized.</p>
        <p>Sewage, factory discharge and poorly stored toxic waste have contaminated soil and ground water in many regions. But the main trail of industrial devastation follows Central Europe's coal and steel belt, stretching from the south of East Germany, across northern Czechoslovakia to southern Poland. More than 15 million people live in this area. Here, close to 40 percent of the forests have been damaged by acid rain. And West Germany estimates that pollution in East Germany alone causes $18 billion worth of damage each year.</p>
        <p>The pollution in Poland is widely acknowledged to be the worst. A persistent stinging smog - created by steel mills, power stations and chemical plants - hovers over the towns of Silesia, where men in their 30's and 40's are dying of cancer, heart disease and emphysema. Near Cracow, a sanitarium in a salt mine 650 feet below the polluted surface is a refuge for those with respiratory problems.</p>
        <p>The new governments of Eastern Europe have created environmental departments, and they acknowledge that cleaning up will mean closing many outdated plants and tearing down neighborhoods steeped in lead and zinc dust. Environmentalists demand the rehabilitation of rivers sluggish with toxic waste and of land so acidic it can sustain no crops.</p>
        <p>Some experts say an ecological Marshall Plan is needed. Western Europe, threatened by the toxic brew and dust flowing and blowing to its own doorstep, is offering aid. West Germany has approved about $500 million to clean up East Germany, and Sweden has pledged $45 million to help stem pollution in Poland.</p>
        <p>Yet it will take more than money to bring life back to these sullen industrial towns, where even young people sound defeated and drink heavily. Some leave and others hope the political changes will bring a psychic lift.</p>
        <p>''I don't know the way,'' says a Polish teen-ager in Katowice, ''but we have to get over the I-don't-care disease.''</p>
