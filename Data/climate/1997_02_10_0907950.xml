        <p>WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LIBERTARIAN  A Personal Interpretation  By Charles Murray  178 pages. Broadway Books/Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group $20.</p>
        <p>It's a minority position that Charles Murray advances in his pamphleteering new book, ''What It Means to Be a Libertarian: A Personal Interpretation.'' What it means for him is a political philosophy similar to classical liberalism of the Adam Smith variety and distinct from contemporary libertarianism, which, as he explains, presents ''a logic of individual liberty that is purer and more uncompromising than the one you will find here.''</p>
        <p>But since ''in the United States the unmodified term liberal now refers to the politics of an expansive Government and the welfare state,'' he chooses to call himself a libertarian with a lower-case l.</p>
        <p>What his philosophy means for his readers would entail the end of expansive government and the welfare state. No more regulation of commerce. No more ''transfers of payment'' like Social Security, Medicare and food stamps. No more regulation of work places. Just a government that restrains people from injuring one another, enforces contracts and upholds what Mr. Murray defines in a strictly limited sense as the public good. A very minority position indeed, although hardly a surprise from the author of ''Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980'' and (with Richard J. Herrnstein) ''The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life.''</p>
        <p>But apparently he is not part of a minority in his concern for the failings of big government. As he writes near the end of his credo: ''When Lyndon Johnson took office, about 75 percent of Americans said that they trusted the Federal Government. Now about 75 percent respond to the same polling question by saying that they do not trust the Federal Government.'' He doesn't believe this to be merely cyclical. ''Political cycles and political fashions have nothing to do with it,'' he concludes. ''American government isn't what it used to be.''</p>
        <p>His solutions, as he outlines them here, have a logical appeal if not an ideological one. Some he defends by exposing them to what he calls ''the trendline test.'' He challenges his readers to ''plot the proportion of Americans below the official poverty line from World War II (scholars have worked out the figures back that far) to the present, then superimpose on that graph the amount of money that government has spent trying to help the poor.''</p>
        <p>Do the same thing with the relevant figures that reflect progress in education, health care, safety, income or ''deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled'' on the nation's highways. In every case, he insists, the greatest improvement occurred before the Government got involved with some program. For example, ''the good effects of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were bumps on top of a much larger, more powerful and healthier trend that was occurring in civil society and would have continued if the Government had done nothing.'')</p>
        <p>In other cases he defends his cutbacks by asking readers to perform a thought experiment. Imagine that businesses had the option of being either regulated or unregulated. Would any prefer to be the latter? Would those that did necessarily give inferior service? One of his illustrative conclusions is that ''airline executives dread crashes more intensely than any Government bureaucrat.'' Those with their livelihoods at stake tend to perform better than those serving a theoretical good. For that reason, if you freed health care from regulation, costs would go down instead of through the ceiling.</p>
        <p>In still other cases, he appeals to a set of remote ideals. Freedom goes hand in hand with responsibility, he argues. End welfare, and people on their own would find ways to help the poor. A lost sense of community would be restored and revitalized.</p>
        <p>Not all of Mr. Murray's reasoning is airtight. His insistence that threats to the environment are best dealt with locally seems to leave unresolved the problems that occur remotely, like acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer. In abolishing commercial regulation, he ignores the tendency of businesses to form monopolies. Instead he argues trivially that ''we listen to dire warnings about the power of multinational corporations on C-Span, but our interaction with these entities really consists of their politely begging us to buy their cars and televisions and computers, which are offered with more functions, higher quality, and more competitive prices than ever before.''</p>
        <p>To many it will come as a relief that since, as he sees it, only a total adoption of his program would work (''partial solutions are often worse than the status quo''), therefore ''nothing resembling the state I outlined has any chance of being enacted.'' Get rid of Social Security and Medicare? ''The electorate is terrified by the prospect of reductions in the rate of growth of Social Security and Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, his criticism of the way bureaucratic government tends to make life more difficult for its citizens is trenchant and to the point. And he persuasively points to two groups who ''live lives that are de facto free.''</p>
        <p>The first is the affluent baby boomers, who, in a movement referred to ''the secession of the successful,'' have bought their way out of the system by creating communities, schools and police forces parallel to those run by the Government. The second consists of the ''people in their 20's and 30's who are part of the ongoing computer/telecommunications revolution'' and who ''are becoming accustomed to an extraordinary degree of autonomy in their daily lives.'' With the further growth of these two groups radical changes in government may be possible in the future.</p>
        <p>In any event, Mr. Murray poses a pointed and stimulating challenge to the generations that have taken the good of the New Deal and welfare state for granted. His conclusions may be shocking, but the reasoning that takes him there is often surprisingly hard to resist.</p>
