        <p>TO me, summertime and lobsters go together. There's nothing better than enjoying a nice lobster meal on a summer evening in New England -- especially when you've caught the lobster yourself.</p>
        <p>I'm not a lobsterman; I'm a lawyer whose passion is catching and eating lobster. And since 1956, I've indulged that passion by providing fresh lobsters from the eastern end of Long Island Sound for my family and friends every summer.</p>
        <p>But not this year. It's just not worth the effort or the $60 for a personal-use license. No, this summer I'll have to get my lobster from Scotts off Howard Street here in New London, which sells mostly Maine lobsters.</p>
        <p>In past years I'd gather about four or five lobsters a week, ranging in size from one-and-a-quarter pounds to one-and-a-half pounds each. In recent years, my catch has been significantly less. Why?</p>
        <p>According to environmental scientists, the Sound's lobster population is just the latest victim of global warming. Evidently the water temperature in the Sound is now one or two degrees warmer than it was in past years. This warmer temperature removes life-sustaining oxygen from the seabed, making lobsters in the Sound more vulnerable to parasites and bacteria. According to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, the lobster population here is 85 percent lower than it was in the 1990's and before.</p>
        <p>But it's not just global warming. Some experts think the fishermen are to blame too -- catching lobsters less than one-and-a-quarter pounds, which are still young and need time to grow and reproduce, or those weighing more than four pounds, which because of their fecundity are essential to the survival of the species. (Only Maine has a law that prohibits the buying and selling of lobsters weighing more than four or five pounds. For the record, I never trapped any lobster over four pounds, and I threw back lobsters that were too short according to Connecticut law.)</p>
        <p>And professional lobstermen I know blame pesticides for the decrease. They say that the widespread spraying of the pesticide malathion in 1999 on Long Island to combat West Nile virus destroyed much of the lobster population. A lawsuit filed on behalf of Long Island Sound's commercial lobster fisherman against Cheminova, the manufacturer of a pesticide called Fyfanon, whose active ingredient is malathion, was settled in April. Cheminova agreed to pay the lobstermen $12.5 million but admitted no responsibility for the lobsters' fate. But lobstermen all over the region have taken this settlement as proof of their claim that runoff from the spraying destroyed their livelihood.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, all I know is that I just don't catch the number of lobsters I used to, and this summer I'm hanging up my pots.</p>
        <p>It's a shame, because the Sound provided lobsters in abundance for the early Indian population, the European settlers and every wave of immigrant groups that followed. Catching them provided a living for eastern Connecticut commercial lobstermen and a delightful catch and dinner for those like me with a personal-use license.</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago, I bought a 10-foot Brockway rowboat and several wooden lobster pots. Each summer beginning in late May when the water was just beginning to get warm enough for swimming, I would dive in at low tide to test the water temperature before I dared venture out in the boat. I would then drop my pots and begin another season catching lobsters. Every fourth day or so, I would row out between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. -- there's nothing more beautiful than rowing through the calm waters of the Sound just after sunrise -- and haul the pots by pulling the buoy over the stern. When I opened the pots there were always a few keepers.</p>
        <p>Oh, there have been times when I thought that pursuing this hobby of mine wasn't such a great idea: once I slipped as I pulled in a pot. The pot fell back into the sea along with my glasses. But when I again pulled the pot into the boat, I found my glasses inside and took this as a sign not to quit.</p>
        <p>In my younger years, rowing out to check the lobster pots helped me cope with a hard working day. And since retirement, catching lobsters in the summer has added an additional enjoyment to each summer, especially when my grandchildren are visiting and join me on the boat. I let my grandchildren venture out with me one at a time as each turned 7. Those memories of time spent on the water alone with each grandchild is something I will cherish forever -- and I hope they will, too.</p>
        <p>But it is all gone now. This year, my lobster pots will stay stored under the porch. I'll probably take the rowboat out every now and then, but it won't be the same. Sure, it makes me sad, but I feel even worse for those commercial fishermen who made a living catching lobsters.</p>
        <p>As I near my 80th year, I can look back on a lifetime of lobster memories that enriched my life. But global warming and human ignorance have destroyed a tradition for my grandchildren and perhaps their children too.</p>
