        <p>IT SUITS an intellect that careens in a hundred directions, this painting in the conference room at the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation. It's a trompe l'oeil that shows two shelves of books from the late 20th century. The man who chose them for the painter is Scott McVay, the foundation's executive director, who from time to time whirls around to point to the works that animated the passions he is spinning out.</p>
        <p>There's ''Biophilia'' by Edward O. Wilson (''probably the lead advocate for the biological integrity of the planet,'' Mr. McVay says) and ''Against Our Will'' by Susan Brownmiller (''more important than de Beauvoir''). There's ''The Death and Life of American Cities'' by Jane Jacobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVay points to ''Sea Change'' by the marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who grew up in Gibbstown, and ''Building a Sustainable Society'' by Lester R. Brown, head of the Worldwatch Institute, who was a South Jersey tomato farmer as a young man.</p>
        <p>The books were Mr. McVay's way of trying to capture and honor some of the more arresting ideas he has encountered, since ideas are the Dodge Foundation's main business. ''We seine for talent,'' Mr. McVay said, in ''an immensely humbling experience'' of selecting inspirations to be financed.</p>
        <p>A Career of Fine Dining At a Fast-Food Pace</p>
        <p>Mr. McVay, 64, is retiring at the end of the year, after 22 years of directing the foundation, established by the bequest of Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge, who lived in Madison. In trying to describe his line of work, Mr. McVay quotes a colleague who said, ''Working at the Dodge Foundation is like having a good meal put before you and being told you have three minutes.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. McVay, it has been 22 years of intensely exploring shorebird migration, urban gardening, poetry and film making, renewable energy technology, the education of educators, the protective coloration of katydids, the topography of New Jersey and the condition of the earth, among other things.</p>
        <p>As he runs through these subjects, he is wrapping a hand around a coffee mug that announces, ''I brake for miracles.'' Miracles is a word he uses often, as is treasures.</p>
        <p>He uses them often in describing New Jersey, where he has lived, minus a few years in the intelligence service in Germany and scientific work in Florida and Alaska, since he reported to Princeton University as a freshman in 1951. Two-thirds of the foundation's grant money is awarded in New Jersey, and Mr. McVay unquestionably enjoys a sense of place.</p>
        <p>''Everything worthwhile reveals itself slowly,'' he says. ''Even though I've lived here a long time, it was only in taking this job that I've been able to understand what's going on here.''</p>
        <p>At this point Mr. McVay is referring to the work of the teachers and school principals the foundation works with, but he is no less certain of the state's more natural wonders.</p>
        <p>''You may consider this hyperbole,'' he says, ''but we have two natural history features that would rival the Grand Canyon. But they're really subtle, very, very subtle, and they have to do with bird migrations.''</p>
        <p>Those two phenomena, he says, are the hundreds of thousands of hawks channeled on their flight path over Cape May each fall and the shorebirds gorging themselves on the crab eggs on the Delaware Bay beaches in the spring.</p>
        <p>There's more. The Pinelands is a place of ''immense biological significance,'' he says, and the highlands -- ''again, we sometimes fail to treasure what's near at hand.'' Mr. McVay knows the Hutchison Forest west of New Brunswick, the only primary forest in the state, the home of 500 species of fungus and the source of ''probably a hundred doctoral dissertations.''</p>
        <p>And speaking of the state's natural data, these practically tumble out: 160,000 to 180,000 hawks of 16 species flying over Cape May, 17 trillion gallons of water in the Pinelands. He says New Jersey has a coastline that, if you include the bay side of the barrier islands, is 500 yards longer than California's.</p>
        <p>An Expertise in Whales Has Roots in Melville</p>
        <p>Mr. McVay's life as a naturalist began, in a way, with reading Melville at Princeton, where he was an English major. The professor, Lawrence Thompson, urged a close reading of ''Moby-Dick,'' which Mr. McVay undertook. He did the same several years later with ''Man and Dolphin'' by John Lilly; ''the basic thesis,'' he says, ''was that the bottlenose dolphin, among 85 members of the whale tribe, has a very highly evolved and elegant brain.''</p>
        <p>In 1963, he pursued this thesis in a research project in Florida, where he worked with a bottlenose dolphin named Elvar. He followed with a raft of articles on whales, published in journals like Scientific American and Science. He discovered and recorded the song of the humpback whale, which ''became kind of the anthem for whale conservation and also for conservation writ large, this being the time of Earth Day and so on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McVay is well known as a whale expert, but he describes this interest as avocational. He was back at Princeton and then at the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation in New York while his study continued, with time out to lead two expeditions to the Arctic to study the bowhead and beluga whales.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVay is describing a wondrous photograph in which the researchers captured some sleeping belugas -- ''they were in a roseate pattern, in what I think is kind of a harem arrangement'' -- when he pauses.</p>
        <p>''But I wanted to focus on New Jersey,'' he says. ''The miracles are right here at hand. You don't have to go to the Arctic.''</p>
        <p>These local miracles, he says, include the Newark Museum -- ''you walk into it and you already feel better about everything'' -- and the community gardens in Newark and Trenton. He extols their guiding spirits, too: Mary Sue Sweeney Price and Elaine Puzo at the Newark Museum, Marleny Franco of the Greater Newark Conservancy, Martin Johnson of the Isles program in Trenton.</p>
        <p>They are Dodge Foundation discoveries, among the 200 or so organizations that receive grants each year after Mr. McVay, four program officers and the foundation's trustees review 2,000 proposals. The foundation gives grants in five areas: pre-collegiate education, the arts, animal welfare, local projects (Morris County) and public issues, primarily environmental. The foundation, started with assets of $60 million in 1975, now has more than $305 million. It has given out $160 million and expects to disburse more than $17 million this year.</p>
        <p>''A foundation is really a sacred trust,'' Mr. McVay says as a preface to explaining its current main mission: education. ''The thing we're looking at in every single one of these grants,'' he says, ''is what kind of impact this is likely to have on the learning of children.''</p>
        <p>In the process of winnowing, it is the second stage, the visits and interviews with what Mr. McVay calls ''fully obsessed people,'' that he savors. He used to prepare long lists of questions, he says, but found that the act of listening put him on more interesting tracks.</p>
        <p>''We really make every effort to understand and to hear as closely as we can,'' he says. ''Every meeting I have, one or two miracles occur, and I've come to expect it because the people we work with are so committed to what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>These talks, he says, have also produced many of the foundation's dozen or so initiatives, in which it takes an organizing and sponsoring role. Probably the best known is the biennial Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival at Waterloo Village in Stanhope. The largest poetry festival in the United States, it has drawn talents from Joyce Carol Oates and Octavio Paz to high school contest winners.</p>
        <p>Poetry assumes a high place in Mr. McVay's enthusiasms; when he retires, he says, he wants to work on a book of his own. In the foundation office's entry hall, he pauses at a display of slivers of poetry from the Waterloo festival and peers at two lines by the Rutgers professor Miguel Algarin, a founder of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in Manhattan: ''When I see what you see/The distance between us disappears.'' His finger grazing the words, he reads them aloud slowly, as if it's the first time he has seen them. But of course it isn't.</p>
