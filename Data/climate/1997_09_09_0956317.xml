        <p>Fishing Frustrations Escalate  Suits have been filed by state and provincial governments in Canada and the United States, seeking redress from the other country in a dispute over salmon fishing. Fisherman and officials from the province of British Columbia filed suit in Seattle, accusing the United States of violating a 1985 treaty by overfishing salmon in the Pacific. The state of Alaska has filed suit in Canada for losses incurred when Canadian fishermen blockaded a ferry in July.</p>

        <p>Mexican Rebels Start on March  Hundreds of Zapatista guerrillas and their supporters began a five-day march from their stronghold in the southern state of Chiapas to Mexico City. The masked rebel leader, known as Subcommander Marcos, saluted some 300 unarmed supporters as they left, but did not accompany them. Organizers said the march was intended to draw support for Indian rights and the withdrawal of the army from indigenous regions.</p>

        <p>Forest Fire Near Inca Treasure  A large forest fire was threatening the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru's southern Andes. The flames were reported as close as 1,000 feet from the archeological site, and over 400 firefighters battled to keep them from spreading by soaking the surrounding vegetation, parched by an unusually dry season. Train service and tourist access to Peru's most popular destination was halted.</p>

        <p>Separatist Move in Comoros  Residents have begun fleeing Moroni, the capital of the Comoros, fearing violence and a coup after the island of Anjouan proclaimed its independence, witnesses said. Last week some 300 government soldiers sent to put down a separatist uprising on Anjouan were severely defeated. Some 40 Comoran soldiers were reported to have been killed and almost 100 taken prisoner.</p>

        <p>Oil Exploration Approved In Protected Federal Area  The Clinton Administration approved exploratory oil drilling on Federal land in the red rock country of Utah where President Clinton last year established a vast national monument to protect the rich wilderness from development. The Bureau of Land Management, part of the Interior Department, approved the drilling over objections of other Federal environmental agencies, reflecting its own assessment that the immediate environmental harm would be negligible and the view of the Interior Secretary that a fight now is unwarranted because the odds of striking oil are relatively slight.</p>

        <p>Indians Seek Welfare Control  Indian reservations are, for the first time, being given the right to run their own welfare programs through a little-noticed provision in the year-old Federal welfare law. But for many tribes this newly won freedom, which Indian organizations say may be the Government's strongest recognition yet of Indian reservations' claims to sovereignty, is beyond their financial grasp.</p>

        <p>Battle Looms on Testing  President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich staked out opposing positions on national educational testing as Congress planned for crucial votes perhaps as early as Tuesday on the program that Mr. Clinton has made a centerpiece of his second-term education agenda.</p>

        <p>Drugs Common in Schools  Many teen-agers find illegal drugs more common at school than in their neighborhood, according to a new national survey that concludes that drugs are a barrier to better education. Forty-one percent of the high school students surveyed said they had seen drugs sold at their school, while 25 percent reported seeing them sold in their neighborhood. But only 36 percent of the students said they would report another student who peddled illegal drugs.</p>

        <p>Lawyers Ask to Withdraw  The two main lawyers advising Paula Jones on her sexual harassment suit against President Clinton asked a Federal judge to allow them to withdraw from the case. The two said they wanted to resign because of ''fundamental differences'' on how to proceed with the lawsuit.</p>

        <p>Strike Slows Bay Area Traffic  Traffic around the San Francisco Bay area crept along for hours at a time as a two-day railway strike left thousands of commuters  struggling to get to work and back. On Sunday morning, workers for Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, went on strike, shutting down the commuter rail system, which carries 270,000 riders a day on weekdays.</p>

        <p>Tobacco Statement Delayed  President Clinton will not offer an opinion on the proposed tobacco accord until next week at the earliest and possibly later, aides said, further diminishing chances that it will be acted upon this year.</p>

        <p>Automated Kiosks Provide Angst-Free Government  A change in the way New Yorkers deal with their city's notorious bureaucracy has been quietly spreading across the five boroughs, in government buildings and libraries, grocery stores and check-cashing outlets. Thirty-seven ATM-like machines, installed last year under a city experiment, allow New Yorkers to pay tickets and property taxes with a credit or bank card, check building inspection records, print application forms for permits, licenses and civil service jobs, and answer a host of questions necessary to ease one's way through the system. All that with no lines and little angst.</p>

        <p>Democrats Close Campaigns  With a flurry of rallies, broadcast advertisements and street and subway stumping, three of the Democratic mayoral candidates brought their campaigns to a close, encountering relatively small crowds and often uninformed -- or just uninterested -- voters as they struggled to draw attention to today's primary.</p>

        <p>Mass Held for Mother Teresa  John Cardinal O'Connor led a memorial Mass for Mother Teresa at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Mother Teresa's order, the Missionaries of Charity, operated six houses in the city, including an AIDS hospice in Greenwich Village and a homeless shelter in the Bronx.</p>

        <p>Tracking Global Warming  With the nations of the world counting down to a Dec. 10 deadline for negotiating cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that many scientists say are altering the earth's climate, a fundamental question continues to pervade the debate: Just how urgent is the problem of climate change? Mainstream scientists say that many signs of a changing climate are already evident.</p>

        <p>Interest in Herbal Remedy  The ancient remedy of St. John's wort has suddenly vaulted to international celebrity. A barrage of new clinical studies report that true to the folklore, St. John's wort provides measurable relief to people with mild and moderate depression without the side effects of drugs like Prozac. Pharmacologists caution that there are still important gaps in knowledge about the herb.</p>
