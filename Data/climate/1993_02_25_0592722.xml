        <p>Two teams of astronomers have turned up evidence that a star as bright as the full moon exploded into view 340,000 years ago and that its dazzling radiation could have disrupted earth's protective ozone layer and sunburned our Stone Age ancestors.</p>
        <p>Studying a very faint pulsating star believed to be a remnant of this stellar explosion, Italian and American astronomers have concluded that the supernova occurred relatively near the solar system. Besides blasting the earth with light and high-energy radiation, the explosion is believed to have created a huge bubble of hot, thin gas, the edge of which is near the solar system.</p>
        <p>The supernova is believed to have left a faint remnant star named Geminga, one of the brightest celestial sources of gamma-ray radiation.</p>
        <p>The explosion that gave birth to Geminga, the two new studies show, may have been close enough to the earth to destroy up to 20 percent of the earth's high-altitude ozone layer, which shields the surface from dangerous ultraviolet radiation emitted both by the sun and the supernova. The supernova apparently occurred less than 195 light-years from the earth -- not so near as to cause any mass extinctions, but close enough that the resulting sunburn might have impaired the health of human beings and other creatures, said Dr. Neil Gehrels, the author of one report. Solar ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer and cataracts in human beings and damage marine organisms. Research by Two Teams</p>
        <p>The articles describing the latest Geminga research are in today's issue of the British journal Nature. One is by Dr. Giovanni F. Bignami and his colleagues at the Istituto di Fisica Cosmica del CNR of Milan and the Universita di Cassino, Italy; the other is by Dr. Gehrels and Dr. Wan Chen of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
        <p>The Italian team analyzed telescopic images of the supernova remnant that were recorded by separate astronomical observatories in 1984, 1987 and 1992. The group determined that the remnant is moving slowly across the sky, and from the star's apparent speed, some 60 miles a second, and its course, the group was able to calculate its possible point of origin.</p>
        <p>The American scientists calculated that the supernova explosion that formed the pulsar was also the possible cause of the huge gas bubble near the solar system.</p>
        <p>For nearly two decades Geminga was a mystery. This peculiar object, a point in the sky that was found to emit intense gamma-ray radiation but was not known to emit light or radio waves, was discovered in 1972. Dr. Bignami gave it a name that has a double meaning: Geminga refers to the object's position in the constellation Gemini, and it also means "does not exist" in the Milanese dialect, an allusion to the apparent absence of a material object at the spot from which gamma rays were found to be streaming. Mystery Is Solved</p>
        <p>But last year the mystery of Geminga was solved when a group led by Dr. Jules P. Halpern of Columbia University's Astrophysics Laboratory showed that Geminga was actually a very faint neutron star. This tiny star is probably the remnant of a Type 2 supernova explosion, a titanic blast that occurs when a star roughly eight times as massive as our sun uses up its fusion fuel, collapses and then blows up.</p>
        <p>This supernova remnant star, formally designated 1E0630+178, was discovered in 1975 by the Einstein Observatory X-ray satellite, but its association with the mysterious Geminga was not then known. In 1991, Dr. Halpern's group, using data from the Rosat X-ray satellite, found that the star was emitting X-ray pulses at a rate of one every 0.237 seconds, about four a second. Since 1E0630+178 is a pulsar lying at the same position as the Geminga gamma-ray emitter, Dr. Halpern's group concluded that Geminga and 1E0630+178 are one and the same.</p>
        <p>The data reported today led the NASA group to infer that the supernova that created Geminga would have exploded in the right place to spawn the peculiar bubble in the interstellar gas that has been detected near the solar system. This bubble, one of several that have been identified in our galaxy, is shaped something like a peanut.  At the Edge of a Void</p>
        <p>Such bubbles are detected by telescopic instruments that measure gas temperature and density in terms of brightness at various wavelengths of radiation. The "local bubble," as it is called, is believed to be 320 to 490 light-years long. The hot gas inside it is believed to be only about one-hundredth as dense as the normal interstellar gas of the galaxy. Astronomers believe the solar system is at the edge of this peanut-shaped void.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gehrel's group based its estimate of the birth date of Geminga on the pulsar's rotation rate. Typical pulsars begin their lives spinning very rapidly, but slow down at a fairly standard rate. Calculated from its current rotation rate of about four turns a second, Geminga is about 340,000 years old, an age that presumably corresponds to the supernova explosion in which it was created.</p>
        <p>Calculating the Geminga supernova's distance from the earth from the present position of the 1E0630+178 pulsar is much more difficult, Dr. Gehrels said in an interview, but a distance somewhere between 195 and 326 light-years would fit the data. This would have been close enough to the solar system that radiation from the supernova could have destroyed up to 20 percent of the earth's ozone layer. Rare Phenomenon</p>
        <p>Nearby supernovas are extremely rare. In 1987, the first supernova visible to the naked eye in four centuries appeared as a moderately bright star over the southern hemisphere. That supernova, SN1987A, occurred in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy that lies some 170,000 light-years from the earth, or at least 1,000 times farther away than the Geminga supernova. Within several weeks of its sudden appearance, SN1987A faded from naked-eye view, and all supernovas of this type are believed to fade out at about the same rate.</p>
        <p>Pulsars, which normally are detected by their pulsating radio signals, are believed to be created by supernova explosions. Typically, a supernova star blows off most of its mass in the form of a rapidly expanding cloud of gas, leaving behind a small, super-dense remnant star whose matter is so compressed that its atoms are crushed, leaving an entire star consisting of a kind of soup of neutrons.</p>
        <p>The supernova explosion in which a pulsar is born sets the neutron star to spinning at high speed, and such a star often emits beams of radiation, radio beams or other types of radiation, which sweep around like lighthouse beacons.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gehrels said some evidence suggested that gamma and X-ray beams from pulsars might be somewhat wider that radio beams and would therefore be more likely than radio beams to strike the earth. But since gamma rays and X-rays cannot penetrate the earth's atmosphere they must be observed by satellites.</p>
        <p>"I think we can expect to find many more pulsar supernova remnants using X-ray and gamma-ray satellite instruments," Dr. Gehrels said.</p>
