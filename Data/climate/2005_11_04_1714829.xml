        <p>From Mazda's car that promises to use hydrogen to run a rotary engine to a General Motors sports utility vehicle powered by fuel cells, carmakers are competing at the Tokyo Motor Show to send car buyers a message: They have learned the lessons of the Prius.</p>
        <p>But while Toyota has clearly hit a car industry nerve with the Prius, its gasoline-electric hybrid, Toyota's influence goes only so far. As one automaker after another made clear at the auto show, which runs through Nov. 6, Toyota is not setting a universal standard for new technologies. It may be setting the pace, but mostly what it has shown is that high gasoline prices have made buyers more open-minded to alternatives.</p>

        <p>From Mazda's car that promises to use hydrogen to run a rotary engine to a General Motors sports utility vehicle powered by fuel cells, carmakers are competing at the Tokyo Motor Show to send car buyers a message: They have learned the lessons of the Prius.</p>
        <p>But while Toyota has clearly hit a car industry nerve with the Prius, its gasoline-electric hybrid, Toyota's influence goes only so far. As one automaker after another made clear at the auto show, which runs through Nov. 6, Toyota is not setting a universal standard for new technologies. It may be setting the pace, but mostly what it has shown is that high gasoline prices have made buyers more open-minded to alternatives.</p>
        <p>''There is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution,'' Richard Parry-Jones, Ford's chief technical officer, said when asked if an industry standard would emerge for hybrids. ''We are in for a fairly confusing decade.''</p>
        <p>Here at the show, Toyota itself displayed its Fine-X, a fuel cell concept vehicle powered by an electric battery and a low-pollution hydrogen cell.</p>
        <p>At the Mazda stand, models in miniskirts draped themselves over the Premacy, a minivan with a rotary engine fueled by hydrogen that is supposed to go on sale in the United States as early as 2008.</p>
        <p>In another hall, executives from General Motors, still the world's largest carmaker, posed for photographers in front of the Sequel, a sport utility vehicle that represents a technological leap over hybrids.</p>
        <p>''We believe we can design and validate a competitive fuel cell propulsion system by 2010,'' Lawrence D. Burns, G.M.'s vice president for research and development, said before showing reporters the prototype. In an interview, he sniped at hybrids, citing their expensive prices and the limits to their efficiency. ''Hybrids could be another niche, low-volume technology that is nice to have,'' he said. ''But is that going to make an impact if you are not penetrating the 64 million new cars and trucks?''</p>
        <p>The main target for hybrids is the United States, a market that accounts for the bulk of worldwide profits for Toyota and Honda.</p>
        <p>The two companies are locked in a serious race on hybrids, with Toyota playing the hare and Honda contending that the tortoise will ultimately win the race. Honda expects to sell about 50,000 hybrids in the United States in 2005; Toyota is aiming to sell 100,000 Prius cars alone. Toyota is also selling smaller numbers of hybrids in a couple of sport utility vehicle models.</p>
        <p>''We have sort of a submarine program, we are not getting the limelight,'' said David Iida, a spokesman for Honda's American subsidiary. ''But in the long run, it will be very interesting to see who comes out ahead.''</p>
        <p>Toyota hopes that the runaway sales success of the Prius will allow it to push hybrids into large volume production. In 2006, Toyota plans to increase worldwide Prius production to 400,000, from 300,000 in 2005.</p>
        <p>By the end of the decade, Toyota expects to be selling one million hybrids worldwide. By ramping up production of hybrids, Toyota aims to cut costs for batteries, electric motors and other parts. In turn, Toyota and Honda say they hope to reduce the cost of a hybrid car to that of a standard gasoline-powered car in the same time period.</p>
        <p>''To make it really work, the cost has to be cut in half,'' said John W. Mendel, a senior vice president at Honda's American subsidiary. ''The cost of the batteries is very high. We fortunately control the cost of the C.P.U., the electric motor.''</p>
        <p>Toyota and Honda, meanwhile, want to persuade buyers to pay a premium for hybrid technology. In April, Toyota began selling the Lexus RX 400h, a hybrid version of its luxury sport utility vehicle, in the United States; Toyota Highlanders are also available with hybrid engines. Next spring, Toyota plans to start selling its Lexus GS 450h, a luxury hybrid sedan, in the United States.</p>
        <p>''Toyota is looking to do with hybrids what Volvo did with safety, trying to get people to pay more for hybrids,'' Christopher Richter, an auto research analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets, said after touring the motor show. ''It is very similar to the debate a couple years back, whether you want to have air bags or not. American automakers were fighting it tooth and nail. Volvo got people to pay for it.''</p>
        <p>Some American drivers are already paying several thousand dollars more for the cachet of driving a car powered by what is seen as a technology of the future.</p>
        <p>''Judging by the vanity plates in California -- 'Saving More,' 'Low Mileage' -- hybrid is a badge of honor that people want to wear,'' said Mr. Mendel, who was visiting from Los Angeles. ''Hydrogen is the path to the future. But, on the way to hydrogen, hybrid is an alternative.''</p>
        <p>California's strict air quality rules are reaching across the Pacific to spur many of the technological innovations here. In November, Mazda's first hybrid powertrain will be installed in its Tribute sport utility vehicle; it is to go into use at 25 American fire departments, largely in California. Sales to the general public are expected in 2008.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Nissan Motor, Japan's second-largest car company after Toyota, resisted investing heavily in hybrid technology, preferring to research low-pollution and high-efficiency engines powered by diesel, the fuel that powers about half the new cars sold in Europe.</p>
        <p>But at this show, Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn -- who denounced hybrids in the summer as uneconomical -- carefully refrained from making another frontal attack. Nissan, bowing to the public interest in saving fuel through hybrids, is to release a version for its Altima in 2006.</p>
        <p>''We don't know where the markets are going,'' Mr. Ghosn told reporters. Carmakers have to ''prepare the technology and jump when consumers start to think one way or another.''</p>
        <p>Hyundai, another skeptic, also plans to offer its first hybrid, a new version of its Accent subcompact, which will go on sale in South Korea in 2006 and in the United States by 2008.</p>
        <p>''We are doing a slow pedal on hybrids, because there is skepticism as to whether this is the way,'' said Oles Roman Gadacz, a spokesman for Hyundai, South Korea's largest carmaker. ''There are existing top-shelf, very price-competitive technologies that can squeeze another 20 percent out of fuel consumption. We are convinced that diesel has greater potential than the hybrid.''</p>
        <p>Ford, while protectively licensing some Toyota patents, is investing heavily in creating and controlling its own hybrid technology. Under the advertising slogan ''Innovation is our mission,'' Ford has set a goal of producing 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010. Even earlier, it plans to build 250,000 vehicles in 2006 that can run on ethanol.</p>
        <p>''In the case of hybrid technology, there are large numbers of foreign patents,'' Mr. Parry-Jones of Ford said here. ''But contrary to what has been in the media, Ford is relying largely on American homegrown hybrid technology.''</p>
        <p>Citing competitive reasons, car company executives declined to say how much they were spending on developing hybrids. Toyota, the industry leader, is believed to have spent hundreds of millions of dollars. General Motors, seeking to share high development costs, has formed a research alliance with DaimlerChrysler and BMW.</p>
        <p>''Toyota is at this moment skimming off all the altruistic people who are doing it for the birds and the bees and for energy independence,'' Bob Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman, told reporters in Detroit in September.</p>
        <p>That kind of fierce competition will be the hallmark of the brewing battle over alternate engine systems.</p>
        <p>''The consumer has not chosen the preferred alternate technology,'' said Simon Sproule, a Nissan spokesman. ''We are developing all the technologies: hybrid, fuel cell, diesel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendel of Honda said: ''The long ball could be a diesel-electric hybrid, a natural gas-electric hybrid, it could be bio-fuel. But by 2010, a fairly significant percentage of vehicles will have engine technologies operating on fuels other than gasoline.''</p>
        <p>No matter the path, analysts say, the surging auto demand from fast-developing countries like China, India and Brazil is forcing carmakers to look seriously beyond gasoline and diesel fuel, which are increasingly expensive and are big producers of the gases that contribute to global warming.</p>
        <p>Goldman Sachs has forecast that the number of cars in China could rise from 12 million in 2004 to 500 million by 2050; in India, the number of cars could increase even faster, from 5 million to 600 million.</p>
        <p>''China, in automotive terms,'' Lyric Hughes Hale, publisher of the China Online news service, said here, ''means the death of the internal combustion engine.''</p>
