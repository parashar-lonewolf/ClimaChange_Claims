        <p>LEAD: IN predicting the future, much of what is proclaimed as science must ultimately be taken as a matter of faith.

        <p>IN predicting the future, much of what is proclaimed as science must ultimately be taken as a matter of faith. A problem that continues to confront the Bush Administration is how fervently it should believe in the dangers of the greenhouse effect - and how high a price the country should pay to forestall them.</p>
        <p>Last week, British scientists reported that 1989 was the fifth-warmest year in the nearly 100 years that reliable records have been kept. Coming after a decade of record-breaking years - including 1988, the hottest recorded - the report will be taken by some as more evidence that an accumulation of carbon dioxide and other byproducts of civilization is making the earth steadily warmer, harkening disruptive changes in weather and calamities like melting polar ice caps.</p>
        <p>But proving a link between the recent warming and atmospheric pollution has been impossible. In the long term, meteorological models are no better than econometric ones. While no one disputes that carbon dioxide buildup causes global warming, the questions of how much and when are as uncertain as 1999's interest rates.</p>
        <p>Last week, when President Bush addressed a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body formed to study the problem, he disappointed environmentalists with his cautious stance. Though he renewed his call for some kind of international action, he avoided specifics and made it clear that economic interests would have to be taken as seriously as environmental ones. What is needed, he said, is an ''international bargain, a convergence between global environmental policy and global economic policy, where both perspectives benefit and neither is compromised.''</p>
        <p>According to computer simulations, the greenhouse effect could raise the earth's temperature by several degrees during the next century. But complex systems like weather defy science's attempts to simulate them. With the skein of causes and effects so hard to untangle, the question of what to do about global warming comes down to politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech last week was edited by John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. Last Sunday on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Mr. Sununu said he was trying to counter ''a little tendency by some of the faceless bureaucrats on the environmental side to try and create a policy in this country that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas.''</p>
        <p>Not all the bureaucrats are faceless by choice. William K. Reilly, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, wanted the United States to take a strong stand at a meeting on global warming last fall in the Netherlands. But he was reined in by Mr. Sununu and others. Ultimately, the United States, joined by Japan and the Soviet Union, quashed a proposal by Western European countries that would cut carbon dioxide emissions 20 percent by 2005. The wording that was finally substituted called for reductions ''as soon as possible.''</p>
        <p>Political Tradeoffs</p>
        <p>The political side of the problem promises to become even more pronounced in August when the group that met last week in Washington issues a final report, which is expected to form the basis for international negotiations. The biggest emitters of carbon dioxide - the United States is the worst offender -also have the most to lose economically from stricter pollution controls. Costs would also be high for third world countries, whose leaders continue to argue that they should be compensated for the costs of developing along cleaner paths than their richer predecessors had to follow.</p>
        <p>Figuring out how to balance all these countervailing forces could be as difficult a task as sorting out the maddeningly complex interactions in the climatic models.</p>
