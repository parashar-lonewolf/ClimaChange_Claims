        <p>LEAD: ONE of the most popular means of treating warts is to burn the growths with a laser beam, but scientists have documented a little-known hazard in this seemingly safe and simple treatment.</p>
        <p>ONE of the most popular means of treating warts is to burn the growths with a laser beam, but scientists have documented a little-known hazard in this seemingly safe and simple treatment.</p>
        <p>The vapor emitted as the wart tissue is destroyed is likely to contain material from the papilloma viruses that cause warts. Results of a new study show that the virus material may be infectious.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is that the smoke is dangerous,'' said Dr. Jerome M. Garden of Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, lead author of the study of the smoke produced in laser surgery.</p>
        <p>There are many varieties of papilloma virus. Some cause warts. Others are strongly suspected of causing cancers, particularly of the sexual organs. Because of the growing evidence linking them to cancer, there has been increasing interest in this family of viruses in recent years.</p>
        <p>The popularity of laser surgery has ''increased dramatically over the last several years,'' the scientists said, and patients may be treated by specialists of many kinds, including dermatologists, gynecologists, otolaryngologists, podiatrists, general practitioners, surgeons and urologists. Extent of Problem Unclear</p>
        <p>Dermatologists and experts on papilloma virus say there have been many anecdotal reports of warts appearing on the faces of surgeons who used lasers frequently in treating warts. It is unclear now whether the new report indicates a major problem or a relatively restricted one. But the report warns, ''It would be prudent for all practitioners who use the laser in treating patients with viral infections or conditions associated with viruses to practice extreme care and safety.''</p>
        <p>While the most obvious potential risk is that of transmitting warts infection to the medical personnel treating a patient, there may also be some risk of spreading the infection to other sites in the patient.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Dr. Garden and his colleagues suggest there may be an even more serious hazard to medical personnel. They said it was conceivable that other viral infections, such as hepatitis or AIDS, might be spread by the vapors from laser surgery. This would be a factor with patients undergoing wart removal who might already be infected with hepatitis or AIDS, and who often might not realize they are infected.</p>
        <p>No one knows whether hepatitis or AIDS infections could be spread this way. The hepatitis and AIDS viruses are considered far less likely than papilloma viruses to invade through the skin. But the researchers at Northwestern said, ''It would be prudent to assume that the plume of smoke may be infectious.''</p>
        <p>It is common to use a suction tube to draw off smoke from the surgery and pass it through a filter, but Dr. Garden said there was variation in the care with which this was used. Other studies have shown that half of the vapor may escape if the intake is as much as a half inch from where the laser hits the tissue.</p>
        <p>The scientists tested vapor emitted during laser surgery in animal tissues infected with papilloma viruses and in seven patients treated for warts. In the vapor from both the animal and human tissues, the researchers found intact DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of papilloma virus. The DNA is the virus's core, giving the particle the ability to cause infection and to produce changes, such as warts.</p>
        <p>''The medical implications of recovering intact viral DNA in laser vapor requires serious consideration, especially in regard to risks for the patient and clinical personnel,'' said the research report in the Feb. 26 issue of Journal of the American Medical Association. Authors with Dr. Garden were Dr. M. Kerry O'Bannion, Dr. Lori S. Sheinitz, Dr. Kevin S. Pinski, Dr. Abnoeal D. Bakus, Dr. M. E. Reichmann and Dr. John P. Sundberg. A Question of Infectivity</p>
        <p>''The question of the potential infectivity of the recovered material remains unresolved,'' the authors said. The method of study made it impossible to tell whether the DNA was in whole virus particles or was free of the virus's outer coat. They noted, however, that other scientists have demonstrated that free DNA from papilloma virus can be infectious.</p>
        <p>The potential risk of spreading other virus infections through laser surgery is even more problematical. Papilloma virus is thought to be particularly hardy and the skin is its natural target. But Dr. Garden noted that patients infected with hepatitis viruses or those that cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome are likely to have the viruses in their blood, and therefore virus material might get into a laser smoke plume.</p>
        <p>The research found intact DNA in the vapor from the warts of two of the seven patients. Similar tests were done on papilloma-infected cells from cows, and the vapors regularly yielded intact papilloma virus DNA. The team used a conventional carbon dioxide laser, a type widely used in medical practice.</p>
