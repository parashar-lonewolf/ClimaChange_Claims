        <p>THE EASY WAY OUT</p>
        <p>By Stephen McCauley. 298 pp. New York:  Simon &amp; Schuster. $20.</p>
        <p>I HAVE a theory: Stephen McCauley is really the secret love child of Edith Wharton and Woody Allen. How else to explain "The Easy Way Out," Mr. McCauley's superb second novel? As told by Patrick O'Neil, a mildly neurotic kvetcher obsessed with global warming and glow-in-the-dark religious artifacts, this tale of bet hedging, loss cutting and white lying among the Massachusetts middle class is funny, magnanimous and devastatingly accurate.</p>
        <p>"The Easy Way Out" begins with Patrick and his longtime lover, Arthur, contemplating the purchase of a house. For Patrick, this is on a par with matrimony. Arthur is a saintly immigration lawyer with a bald pate and a passion for Gilbert and Sullivan. Although Patrick loves him, their relationship, as Patrick sees it, has "developed into the kind of benign domestic dependency that takes love for granted and accepts as inevitable a certain level of boredom, discontent and suppressed rage." Worse, their love life reminds him of "two bald tires, spinning and spinning and spinning on a patch of ice."</p>
        <p>Settling down with someone like the sensible, solvent and disease-free Arthur is to the 1990's what buying junk bonds was to the 1980's -- a smart move. But Patrick balks. And he sublimates, hurling himself into the Shakespearian romantic troubles of his younger brother, Tony, who is "exactly the kind of loud, right-wing bully I feel obliged to take a stand against on principle but from whom I secretly crave approval." Tony is engaged to the fetching and dull Loreen, but has lost his heart to the less gorgeous yet infinitely more interesting Vivian.</p>
        <p>Patrick spends an inordinate amount of time ladling out to Tony just the advice he should be taking himself: follow your heart. The problem, of course, is that in order to do this you have to mow down mercilessly a number of generally good people. You have to dump the generous Arthur, the long-suffering Loreen. Most people can't, won't and don't. Instead, they rationalize their mistakes and settle for less. They take the easy way out, as have Patrick's parents, the endlessly squabbling but still connected-at-the-hip Jim and Rita, co-owners and operators of a failing men's clothing store.</p>
        <p>Just as Patrick flogs Tony to break off his engagement with Loreen, Patrick's best friend, Sharon Driscoll, badgers him to break it off with Arthur. Few writers of either sex can write about women with the same kind of shrewd empathy and insight that seem to come naturally to Mr. McCauley. Like Nina Borowski, the pregnant psychologist in Mr. McCauley's first novel, "The Object of My Affection," Sharon is headstrong, opinionated and troubled in love, but would prefer going it alone. At least most of the time.</p>
        <p>For the eccentric and sarcastic Sharon, who wears sandals even in subfreezing weather and doesn't believe in locking her doors, "The real key to success in life is to ask people questions about their lives until you're blue in the face. Start with 'How are you?' and keep going until they pass out with amazement at how fascinating they are." Her toughness conceals a loneliness that she freely admits, but that she's hesitant about remedying.</p>
        <p>Sharon and Patrick work together at an agency called Only Connect Travel, which caters to "the Cambridge intellectual crowd: Harvard professors, hippies who'd become civil rights lawyers and therapists, and New Age birdbrains of all sorts." Sharon specializes in subverting corporate America by pulling strings to get her clients the cheapest rates possible, and Patrick does little more than return his personal phone calls. The antics at Only Connect are a bit sitcommish compared to the grace and wit of the rest of the novel. A running joke has Patrick routinely appearing hours late for work and tossing all his phone messages in the wastebasket. The boss never even talks to him about his behavior, much less fires him. More realistic and sophisticated is the client typecasting the travel agents indulge in. (The most common variety is the Warm and Cheap, the vacationer who doesn't care where he goes as long as it's hot and inexpensive.)</p>
        <p>This knack for detail, and the way it's applied to the self-delusion of an engaging cast of characters, is what makes "The Easy Way Out" so satisfying. It's enormously difficult to write a successful novel about the decent souls of the middle class, people who are both too rich and not rich enough to do anything either very dastardly or very heroic. The hugely talented Stephen McCauley has made it look easy.</p>
