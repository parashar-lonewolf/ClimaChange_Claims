        <p>IN autumn, the eyes of most people turn to the woods, where the blazing scarlet of red maple leaves mixes with the golden yellows of beech and the purples of oak. At this time of year, people see only beauty, but professional foresters, like Stephen H. Broderick of the University of Connecticut's Cooperative Extension Service, see some of the problems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Broderick, who graduated from the University of Massachusetts with a bachelor's degree in forestry in 1974, and earned a master's degree in forest management from Virginia Technical College in 1979, answered questions about the state's forests in an interview in his office in the town of Brooklyn.. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Why are forests important to Connecticut beyond their aesthetic value?</p>
        <p>A. First of all, they are important to our quality of life. We have an unusual situation in Connecticut in that we're one of the most heavily forested states and at the same time one of the most heavily populated. The mosaic of forest and farm in urban areas makes Connecticut unique, and there's some good, hard evidence to say that the rural setting has attracted industry to Connecticut because it provides a good living environment for employees.</p>
        <p>We also live in a part of the world where almost all our terrestrial species of wildlife is native to the forest, so it's important as habitat. The forests do contribute to our rural economies, because our forest products add several hundred million dollars a year to our economy. The home fuel use in Connecticut alone displaces more than $100 million worth of oil a year and of course is a domestic, renewal energy source.</p>
        <p>We're finding more and more solid benefits that go along with urban forest management. Our recreation industry in Connecticut, estimated to be worth as much as $20 billion, is heavily dependent on forests. And an increasingly important concern in Connecticut today is our supply of clean water, and forests and forested wetlands act as the first major buffer for our water supply. Wetlands absorb the runoff, storing it and filtering it.</p>
        <p>Q. Diseases and insects are harming many of the state's trees. Are the trees suceptible because they are under more environmental stress?</p>
        <p>A. There's a couple things going on, actually. Look historically at the literature and you see regular periods of decline for various species. To a certain extent it's a cyclical climactic thing triggered by things such as drought, which we've had for a couple of summers. The other problem is we're in an unprecedented era of mixing up our biota. The hemlock wooly adelgid is an introduced insect. The red pine is an introduced tree species that is now suffering from an introduced insect, the red pine scale.</p>
        <p>We've got a lot of trees planted where the Good Lord never intended them to be, and we've got a lot of insects and diseases that have been brought here from all over the world, introduced to hosts that have no resistance because they've developed over the eons in their absence. It does sometimes get frustrating for a forester, because you're reduced to making the best of a bad situation.</p>
        <p>Q. Do any of those problems threaten To eliminate an entire species?</p>
        <p>A. The red pine we expect will be gradually eliminated from Connecticut over the next decade. There seems to be no resistance to the scale, so it seems to be simply a matter of how much time it takes to find the rest of the stands. The wooly adelgid - it's been suggested elimination is a possibility for the hemlock. But the adelgid has only been around since 1985, and drought and gypsy moths might be combining with the adelgid to cause mortality in some cases, but we're concerned about the adelgid because it's spreading very, very rapidly and it's clear before too many more years it will be throughout the state.</p>
        <p>Q. What happens when a species is killed off?</p>
        <p>A. Something else will move in to take its place. We saw that happen with the American chestnut shortly after the turn of the century. It was one of our dominant hardwood species in Connecticut and the chestnut blight wiped it out, but oaks and hickories and other hardwood species moved in and filled that void. The hemlock is a troublesome species because it likes lowlands, moist soils, steep slopes along the edges of streams that are easily eroded. It's hard to envision much, other than the mountain laurel, that can take its place. But something will move in. And we hope it won't come to that.</p>
        <p>Q. Is acid rain affecting Connecticut forests?</p>
        <p>A. There's no question in higher elevations where the soil is already acidic, particularly northern New England, that it's having measureable effects. For most of our forests, so far as I know, there's been no measureable impact, but there's no question that eventually it's got to have some effect.</p>
        <p>Q. Why has forest management become so important in recent years?</p>
        <p>A. From a historical perspective we're at a critical point in time for our forests. Over the last 300 years it's been a cycle of abuse and neglect. We cut our forests clean up until the early 1800's when there was only about 20 percent of the state forested, and the rest was farm and pasture. Then those farms were abandoned, and were allowed to grow. We had a tremendous period of cutting in the first two decades of this century after the chestnut blight, because of demand for charcoal, et cetera. The whole state was clear cut and burned by 1920.</p>
        <p>Then, until the early 1970's, there was no demand for our timber and our forests were neglected and allowed to grow. Our forest matured, and at the same time, demand skyrocketed for those products. What we do now in terms of forest planning, open space planning, as well as doing things to make sure the forest industry remains vital, could have important ramifications for the next 100 years in this state.</p>
        <p>Q. What exactly is forest management?</p>
        <p>A. Forest management is the art and science of making a forest as productive as it can be. The protection of water quality, the enhancement of wildlife populations, the production of any number of products such as fuel, timber, maple sugar, witch hazel - the list is almost endless.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you accomplish that?</p>
        <p>A. If you're a grocer you inventory your stock periodically to see what you've sold, what condition your stock is in, what new stock has some in. A forest manager starts with a forest inventory to determine what condition the growing stock is in. You get a picture of what's on the grounds, what soil conditions there are, what trees are present. Then you divide the tract into forest stands, and develop a plan for each stand to meet the owner's objectives.</p>
        <p>Q. What percentage of Connecticut's forests are properly managed?</p>
        <p>A. A pretty small percentage of Connecticut's forests are actively managed, and since 90 percent of our forests are privately owned, that means most woodland is not managed. The state forests are well managed by the Connecticut Bureau of Forests, and the certified tree farm program, which is one measure you can use to determine how much forest is actively managed, includes 500 farms, about 10 percent of the privately owned acreage.</p>
        <p>The reasons the remainder is managed not are manifold. A lot of landowners are under the misconception that the best thing you can do for wildlife is nothing, to simply leave a forest alone. But there's a lot of poor habitat out there. It's very rare that the best thing you can do for wildlife is nothing. And one of the jobs of the extension service is to educate people about their options.</p>
        <p>Q. How long does it take to see results from forest management?</p>
        <p>A. It's a long term proposition. If you're talking timber stand improvement, where you're thinning out poor trees to favor the growth of good ones, you're talking decades to see the benefits. For wildlife management the time is shorter, but still, from the time we do a patch cut in the forest until the time that brush has grown up to where it's optimum habitat for grouse or woodcock or rabbit, can be eight or 10 years.</p>
        <p>Q. How productive are Connecticut's forests now, and how productive could they be with proper management?</p>
        <p>A. We take about 70 million board feet of timber a year from Connecticut's forests, and our last good estimate of fuelwood was about 660,000 cords a year. That's significant, but there's no question it could be significantly increased. In terms of fuelwood, it could easily doubled of even tripled with proper management for a good long period of time. The timber demand has been very high for a number of years so I'm not sure how much more saw timber production could be increased. The problem is most of the time the financial incentive is to take the best and leave the rest, what foresters call a high-grade job because all the best stuff is removed. That has long term serious ramifications for productivity because the worst is left behind. You should remove the diseased and crooked trees, and leave the best to be the parents for the next generation of trees.</p>
        <p>Q. What is urban forestry?</p>
        <p>A. Urban forestry is a blending of traditional forestry and arborticulture. It's the managing of street and shade and park trees in an urban setting to mitigate air and noise pollution, for visual aesthetics and so forth. There's a lot of documentation now that you can reduce air pollution and the ambient air temperature, thereby lowering energy demands, and that people's mental health is improved with good vegetation management in urban areas. We did a survey of about 60 communities in Connecticut and found what we suspected - that there's very little going on in terms of shade and street tree management, so those trees are in very poor shape as a result.</p>
