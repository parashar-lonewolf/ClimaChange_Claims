        <p>Automobile companies seem to be making progress in tamping down Democratic proposals for tougher fuel economy requirements, an issue that pits powerful Democrats from Michigan against some national leaders of their own party.</p>
        <p>The chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler had lunch with Senate Democrats on Wednesday, less than a week before the Democratic leaders hope to bring a sprawling energy bill to the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>The executives argued that the bill's proposal to increase mileage requirements for cars and light trucks would be impossible to meet and would gravely damage the automobile industry.</p>
        <p>It would increase the average mileage requirement for passenger cars to 35 miles a gallon by 2020, up from 27.5 miles a gallon now, and would apply to light trucks and sport utility vehicles as well.</p>
        <p>But leading House and Senate Democrats from Michigan are pushing a softer approach, and they have a good chance of getting some of what they want.</p>
        <p>Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, both of Michigan, are drafting a bill that would raise mileage requirements but would be more lenient for light trucks and would give car companies the possibility of an escape hatch by demonstrating that the rules would be too costly to meet.</p>
        <p>The Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, hinted at the lunch on Wednesday that he was willing to look for a compromise.</p>
        <p>Noting that the industry and the United Automobile Workers union were at least willing to support some increase in mileage requirements, Mr. Reid said he was ready to listen.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen all the details yet,'' he told reporters, ''but I hope that we can work together to make substantial progress.''</p>
        <p>Environmental and consumer groups warned Wednesday that Democrats were in danger of diluting the requirements until they had little meaning.</p>
        <p>''The question is no longer whether Congress will act on fuel economy, but whether what it passes will mean anything,'' said Kevin Curtis, vice president of the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, is on a collision course with Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell and Representative Rick Boucher, Democrat of Virginia, have drafted a bill that calls for raising the fuel efficiency requirement for passenger cars to an average of 36 miles a gallon and for light trucks to 30 miles a gallon by 2022.</p>
        <p>But the bill includes escape hatches from the rules if car companies can demonstrate that the requirements would be too difficult to meet.</p>
        <p>And in a potentially bigger clash with Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Dingell and Mr. Boucher have also proposed revoking the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to let California and other states impose emission requirements that are tougher than the federal regulations.</p>
        <p>The California Legislature has passed stringent new requirements to reduce automobile emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and state officials are demanding that the E.P.A. grant it a waiver from federal rules.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi warned that she opposed any provision that jeopardized California's rules, which many other states have expressed interest in copying.</p>
        <p>''Any proposal that affects California's landmark efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or eliminate the E.P.A.'s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions will not have my support,'' the speaker said in a written statement.</p>
        <p>In a break with the past, automobile manufacturers have agreed that some increase in fuel economy requirements is appropriate. But they vigorously oppose the Senate bill, complaining that its requirements are too rigid and not economically feasible.</p>
        <p>Rick Wagoner, chairman and chief executive of General Motors, said the requirements were ''a stretch'' and ''don't look achievable.''</p>
        <p>Car companies conducted a 10-state radio and newspaper advertising campaign while lawmakers were back in their districts during the long Memorial Day weekend, and they are expected to step up pressure in the days ahead.</p>
        <p>David Friedman, research director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, warned that Democrats were in danger of abandoning any firm requirement for greater fuel economy.</p>
        <p>''There is no binding language in the Boucher bill,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Consumers don't need slippery language. They don't need promises. They need guaranteed fuel economy standards.''</p>
        <p>Requirements for gasoline efficiency in passenger cars have not been raised since 1983. The Bush administration has imposed small increases in mileage requirements for light trucks -- to 24 miles a gallon on average for trucks by 2011, up from 22.4 miles a gallon now.</p>
