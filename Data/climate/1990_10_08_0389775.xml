        <p>LEAD: Experts say many changes will be needed to revive the withering nuclear industry and that the number of changes necessary is growing.</p>
        <p>Experts say many changes will be needed to revive the withering nuclear industry and that the number of changes necessary is growing.</p>
        <p>Pressing problems with acid rain, climate change and energy imports have created an impetus to build new reactors, these experts say, but all the reactors ordered after 1973 have been canceled and the infrastructure needed to support the industry is shrinking.</p>
        <p>The problems of the industry were addressed by about 100 government, industry and academic experts here for a conference organized by the nuclear engineering department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>''The condition of the industry is continuing to worsen, and more and more things pop up as crucial items,'' said Michael W. Golay, the conference chairman and a professor of nuclear engineering at M.I.T.</p>
        <p>Regaining Trust</p>
        <p>The biggest of the required changes, several experts said, is to regain public trust.</p>
        <p>''Nuclear power has a much higher barrier to cross'' than power from fossil fuels, said Lawrence M. Lidsky, a professor of nuclear engineering at M.I.T. He added that ''public irrationality'' was part of the reason.</p>
        <p>''If I ask myself as a member of the public whether I'd rather be killed by a tornado or a nuclear accident, I'd pick the tornado any time,'' he said, even though he would be just as dead either way.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lidsky suggested regaining public confidence through a demonstration that could prove a reactor could weather an accident - in effect, the nuclear equivalent of an automobile crash test. In such a test, he suggested, all the cooling water of a reactor would be drained, the shutdown rods would be deliberately removed and a ''malicious operator'' allowed to run the control room.</p>
        <p>A Different Tone</p>
        <p>Others said that even if such a test worked, it probably would not be sufficient to win over opponents.</p>
        <p>The discussion of trust among the participants at the two-day conference, known as the First M.I.T. International Conference on the Next Generation of Nuclear Power Technology, differed in tone from many earlier debates about reviving the technology. Those debates have concentrated on changes in the law and in reactor hardware.</p>
        <p>''Elements of the nuclear industry may prefer not to say out loud that there is a problem with trust,'' Professor Golay said in an interview. ''From their point of view, there is no benefit to saying the public doesn't trust them.''</p>
        <p>Participants quoted data from various surveys on what fraction of the population found nuclear power acceptable or desirable. Many asserted that the number of opponents was well under 50 percent, but that if the minority was passionate enough, it could exercise a veto.</p>
        <p>A 'Skeptical Elite'</p>
        <p>Alvin M. Weinberg, a physicist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee and a senior figure in the nuclear world, said the main opposition is not from the public at large, which cannot evaluate detailed technical matters, but from a ''skeptical elite'' that the public follows.</p>
        <p>Thus far, reactor manufacturers and other advocates have generally not addressed the issue of trust directly. Rather, since the mid-80's they have focused on three changes they said would allow new plants to be built: a simplified licensing system; an improved, standardized design, and a solution to the waste disposal problem.</p>
        <p>Some experts here pointed out that the competition that a new generation of nuclear reactors would face is getting tougher. Equipment for burning natural gas and coal, for example, is advancing rapidly, with new models producing far more power with less fuel, and more cleanly.</p>
        <p>And many utilities and state regulators look skeptically at building any kind of generating station, believing that $1 billion spent on more efficient light bulbs and electric motors would save more electricity than a $1 billion generating station could produce, no matter what the fuel.</p>
        <p>A Shrinking Industry</p>
        <p>The nuclear industry is shrinking, with only a handful of plants still under construction and fewer parts suppliers willing to go to the expense and trouble of producing reactor components.</p>
        <p>The reactor manufacturers' answer to the problem of public skepticism has been to develop reactors described as ''passively safe'' or ''inherently safe,'' with safety relying in large part on water flowing down hill or heat dissipating through natural convection. They have argued that current reactors are so safe that accidents that damage the nuclear cores, releasing radiation, are likely to occur only once in several hundred thousand years of operation. Their new designs, the builders say, would produce accidents even less frequently.</p>
        <p>A Unique View</p>
        <p>But Paul Slovic, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and a specialist on risk perception, said that the public does not believe these efforts to communicate the level of risk, and views nuclear power as uniquely dangerous.</p>
        <p>''If you've got trust, you don't need fancy risk communications,'' Professor Slovic said. ''And if you don't have trust, no communication is going to do it for you.''</p>
        <p>Jan Beyea, a physicist with the National Audubon Society, added that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was not helping the industry by deciding not to raise the safety standards for the next generation of reactors.</p>
        <p>''To have standards out there identical to existing reactors, which are disfavored, is not going to get you anywhere,'' he said.</p>
