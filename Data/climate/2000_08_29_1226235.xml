        <p>Correction of August 19 and 20 articles on sighting of open water at North Pole</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A front-page article on Aug. 19 and a brief report on Aug. 20 in The Week in Review about the sighting of open water at the North Pole misstated the normal conditions of the sea ice there. A clear spot has probably opened at the pole before, scientists say, because about 10 percent of the Arctic Ocean is clear of ice in a typical summer.</p>
        <p>The reports also referred incompletely to the link between the open water and global warming. The lack of ice at the pole is not necessarily related to global warming. New studies of the polar icepack and its recent changes are reported today in Science Times on Page F3.</p>
