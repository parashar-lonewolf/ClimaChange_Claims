        <p>LEAD: Legislators from 42 countries called today for a ''global Marshall plan'' under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment.</p>
        <p>Legislators from 42 countries called today for a ''global Marshall plan'' under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment.</p>
        <p>The three-day conference, presided over by Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, ended here today. It did not specify how much such an effort might cost, but urged the richer countries to help finance environmentally benign growth in the third world.</p>
        <p>Delegates agreed to immediately begin steps to reduce the air pollution that many scientists believe triggers the process of global warming.</p>
        <p>The legislators who took part are not empowered to set policy for their Governments. Many of them said they would bring the proposals adopted by the meeting to their Parliaments and seek legislation.</p>
        <p>Some Specific Proposals</p>
        <p>These were among the specific proposals for legislative action:</p>
        <p>* Setting a worldwide target of reducing by half over the next 20 years the emission of industrial gases that are building up in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>* Establishing national goals of achieving economic growth in ways that can be sustained without long-term damage to the world and national environments. The conference called for the creation of a ''green common market'' and proposed ''a bank for sustainable development'' to help finance growth in the third world without harming the environment.</p>
        <p>* Instituting a world strategy that links population growth with poverty and environmental degradation, and seeks to stabilize global population, now just over 5 billion, at 10 billion people.</p>
        <p>* Creating an ''international convention for the protection of all the world's forests,'' in both temperate and tropical regions.</p>
