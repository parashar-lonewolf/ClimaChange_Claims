        <p>LEAD: ''VARIETY ANKLES GREAT WHITE WAY.''</p>
        <p>''VARIETY ANKLES GREAT WHITE WAY.''</p>
        <p>That's the headline editors said they'd like to see across page 1 of the weekly bible of show biz, which left Broadway yesterday after 68 socko years to move to posher precincts on Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>The newspaper that transmogrified American slang has operated since 1919 from a dilapidated storefront off Times Square, chronicling bimbos and chantoosies, thesps and moguls, warblers and hoofers, as well as legit shows and pix ranging from bomb to boffo.</p>
        <p>Packed with inside information on theater, film, television, radio, concerts, home video, records and nightclubs, Variety is ''must'' reading for people in the entertainment industry; it remains the only trade paper to report box-office grosses weekly for a vast number of the nation's movie houses.</p>
        <p>Now it is installed in a spiffier venue. Shockingly Airy Premises</p>
        <p>Following the family-owned paper's sale last summer to an English conglomerate, Variety's historic move also reflects the changes on Times Square, where ''every time the whistle blows'' at the blasting site next door, ''you can see the staff tense up'' said the publisher, Syd Silverman. Reporters and editors, secretaries, accountants and ad takers seemed in shock as they wandered about the airy new premises in a gleaming glass and steel skyscraper at 32d Street and Park Avenue South.</p>
        <p>''Shock! honey,'' confirmed Norma Nannini, secretary and indispensable factotum to decades of editors. ''Coma! From the film of the same name. Does your office look as good as this?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman cited two reasons for moving. ''One, living next to World War II didn't help,'' he said. ''Two, there was no room to expand. It was really not an efficient place to work. In view of the July merger, we felt this was the time to make the move.''</p>
        <p>Variety's old digs look like a set out of ''The Front Page,'' and the staff and many of its ink-stained alumni will return there on Friday to swap memories at a farewell party. The host will be Mr. Silverman, whose grandfather, Sime Silverman, founded Variety in 1905 and in 1919 bought the five-story building on West 46th Street in the theater district's heart. Typewriters Still Used</p>
        <p>Among the staff's souvenirs (and still their primary tools), lugged to the new office on the East Side, were the reporters' 30-year old typewriters. Decades of pounding have worn the letters off some of the keys, but there are only three personal computers in Variety's news hub. This is the equivalent of Ice Age ax heads in a craft whose practitioners now write and edit on video terminals.</p>
        <p>Yet the nostalgia is there. Reporters lovingly described the long, dark, narrow (16 feet wide), windowless newsroom, with raised ''poop decks'' at either end, as a ''rathole.'' Indeed, mice were wont to leap with disconcerting regularity onto the desks. The staff remembered how, on the hottest days, they sweltered while an antedeluvian ''air refrigerator'' at the back wearily pushed carbon dioxide around.</p>
        <p>Les Brown, 18 years with Variety and now editor of Channels, an entertainment-industry magazine, recalled the heroic, daylong poker games that went on while the editors were at the plant putting the paper together. Tieless attire, food-stained shirts and 5 o'clock shadow were de rigueur. The work was hard, the hours long, the pay low.</p>
        <p>''It's still a very hard environment,'' Mr. Brown said. ''There was a lot of drinking in the old days, and a lot of smoking. But it had a certain charm, that place. I always thought that the neighborhood and the building we worked in contributed to the grittiness of Variety's style.'' Egg Talk</p>
        <p>That style, full of zing and zest, changed the American language forever. Variety's headlines produced amusement and envy in the trade. In 1929, as the stock market crashed, the newspaper proclaimed ''Wall Street Lays an Egg.'' In 1962, when it plunged again, Variety's headline was ''Wall Street, Son of Egg.'' And last month, when the stock market collapsed in its worst day yet, the front page said, ''Wall Street Lays an Egg: The Sequel.''</p>
        <p>Years ago, as small towns and rural audiences rejected ''corny'' country movies, Variety's editors came up with one of the most famous headlines ever: ''Stix Nix Hick Pix.''</p>
        <p>Variety either invented or popularized such words as baloney, chick, moppet, payola, scram, sitcom. A martial-arts film is a ''chopsocky.'' Home video for children is ''kidvid'' or ''kideo.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman, who will continue as publisher and executive editor, was interviewed in his West Side step-up office platform with its big shop window overlooking the street. He has shared the dinky space with Frank Meyer, the managing editor, who was busy penciling stacks of copy.</p>
        <p>Together, they came up with ''Variety Ankles Great White Way'' to describe their departure from show biz's environs. ''Are there gripes about leaving?'' Mr. Silverman said. ''Sure. We asked the staff to merge and move in three months. That's a lot of pressure.'' In July, Variety was bought by the Cahners Publishing Company, a unit of a London-based conglomerate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverman hardly fits the scruffy environment of the old offices. Princeton, class of '54, he is tall and rosy with health, immaculately turned out and an inveterate tie-wearer. Three of his four children work at the weekly Variety in New York or at Daily Variety in Hollywood.</p>
        <p>It was obvious from his tone that Mr. Silverman regretted leaving. He gazed out a dust-clotted window at a vast hole. Bulldozers were gouging it deeper on the site of the old Loews State Theater, and beyond the hole loomed the gigantic hulk of the Marriott Marquis Hotel - both signs of the future of Times Square. ''I'm sorry to go,'' the publisher said with a sigh. ''But the neighborhood is just too crazy now.''</p>
