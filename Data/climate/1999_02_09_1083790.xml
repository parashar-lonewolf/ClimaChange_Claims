        <p>Getting the Lead Out</p>
        <p>For years, leaded gasoline was an environmental bad boy, blamed for high atmospheric lead levels in urban areas. The introduction of no-lead at the pump in the 1970's and its eventual universal use were thought to be responsible for declines in levels of the metal in the atmosphere and in the blood of urban residents.</p>
        <p>But a new study shows the knock on leaded gasoline might not have been wholly deserved. The work, by scientists from Columbia University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, suggests that, in the New York area at least, the burning of garbage, not gasoline, spewed most of the lead into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The researchers examined core samples from the bottom of Central Park Lake and ended up with a record of heavy-metal pollutants beginning in the 1860's that showed lead levels reaching their peak from the late 1930's to the early 60's. This was before the heyday of leaded gasoline, and corresponded with a rise in incinerator construction and use in the New York area. The peak use of leaded gasoline in the late 60's and early 70's added only a relatively small fraction to the lead deposits.</p>
        <p>The researchers, whose study appears in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, noted that the use of waste incinerators declined in the New York area as environmental laws were passed in the mid-1960's.</p>
        <p>Spying on the Solar Wind</p>
        <p>The origin of the solar wind is no mystery. But not much has been known about precisely how the wind -- the high-speed stream of electrically charged gas that can interfere with electronic instruments on and above Earth -- emanates from the Sun. It has long been thought to originate from open magnetic fields, called coronal holes.</p>
        <p>New observations using instruments aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, which sits a million miles out from Earth with an unobstructed view of the Sun, have helped flesh out the picture.</p>
        <p>The observations, reported in the journal Science by a team of researchers from five countries, show that the wind flows outward through these coronal holes, along magnetic field lines surrounding cells in the chromosphere, the part of the Sun's atmosphere just below the corona. In this way the Sun is a little like a pasta machine that makes ziti by extruding dough around a circular die. The magnetic field lines in the chromosphere delineate many such ''dies,'' with the ''dough,'' the solar wind, emanating from around them.</p>
        <p>Fossil Dates Land Bridge</p>
        <p>Forget about that bridge to the 21st century. Of greater interest to scientists is a land bridge that existed millions of years ago, when Eurasia and North America were joined across what is now the Bering Strait, allowing terrestrial animals and plants on the continents to mix, while marine organisms were segregated between the Arctic-North Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.</p>
        <p>The date the bridge first disappeared -- through tectonic shifts or rising sea levels -- is important because the situation suddenly was reversed. A fossil found in southern Alaska has put the date of the first opening as at least 4.8 million years ago, and perhaps as much as 7.3 million years ago, which is up to 4 million years earlier than previously thought.</p>
        <p>The fossil, described by American and Russian scientists in a recent issue of Nature, is of a type of mollusk, called Astarte, that had been known to exist only in the Arctic and North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The researchers noted that the mollusk appeared in the Pacific much earlier than Pacific mollusks show up in the Arctic and North Atlantic. They speculate that the flow through the opened strait may at first have been predominantly southward, from the Arctic-Atlantic to the Pacific. Then about a million years later, when the isthmus of Panama closed, the flow reversed to bring Pacific organisms to the Atlantic.</p>
