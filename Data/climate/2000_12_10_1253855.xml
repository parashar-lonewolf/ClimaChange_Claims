        <p>The collapse of the climate talks in the Netherlands last month isn't likely to impede the development of easy-on-the-environment cars in this country. California is still requiring that 10 percent of the cars sold there be emission free by 2003, and Massachusetts and New York are adopting similar laws. All the big automakers are promising to sell so-called fuel-cell cars by 2004, but should we have to wait even that long? After all, fuel-cell technology -- which harnesses the energy released when hydrogen is combined with oxygen from the air (water instead of carbon dioxide is the byproduct) -- has been around for more than 150 years. Last month, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler showed off prototype cars powered by environment-friendly hydrogen. We could use those now: Americans are responsible for the release of more than two tons of vehicle-produced greenhouse gases a year per person. Bringing cleaner cars to the marketplace, however, has been fraught with obstacles.</p>
        <p>THE CELL  Department of Energy studies indicate fuel cells today would cost $141 per kilowatt. (A kilowatt will boil a quart of cool water in six minutes; a 75-kilowatt car engine is roughly the equal of a 100-horsepower engine.) But the car industry believes fuel-cell engines won't compete with conventional ones until they cost less than $50 a kilowatt; Directed Technologies, a consulting company, expects that fuel-cell systems will eventually cost $37 a kilowatt. Paul Lancaster, vice president for finance for the Canadian fuel-cell maker Ballard Power Systems, says his company could compete economically with conventional engines at that price if it sold enough fuel cells yearly to power the equivalent of 300,000 cars.</p>

        <p>THE CELL  Department of Energy studies indicate fuel cells today would cost $141 per kilowatt. (A kilowatt will boil a quart of cool water in six minutes; a 75-kilowatt car engine is roughly the equal of a 100-horsepower engine.) But the car industry believes fuel-cell engines won't compete with conventional ones until they cost less than $50 a kilowatt; Directed Technologies, a consulting company, expects that fuel-cell systems will eventually cost $37 a kilowatt. Paul Lancaster, vice president for finance for the Canadian fuel-cell maker Ballard Power Systems, says his company could compete economically with conventional engines at that price if it sold enough fuel cells yearly to power the equivalent of 300,000 cars.</p>
        <p>THE FUEL  Ford says it can mass-produce hydrogen cars once 10,000 natural-gas-reforming pumps -- at $250,000 to $1.5 million each -- are installed at filling stations around the country. (The National Renewable Energy Laboratory is testing ways to extract hydrogen from algae, but natural gas is more viable for now.) Gasoline can be converted to hydrogen fuel inside individual cars, but this means costly additions to the fuel-cell system (and carbon emissions). An Energy Department study has concluded that producing hydrogen for fuel-cell use today would cost the equivalent of $1.92 per gallon.</p>
        <p>THE CHICKEN (CELL) AND THE EGG (FUEL)  Which must come first? Inspiration may, in fact, come from an extravehicular source. International Fuel Cells says around 35 fuel-cell systems a year are sold to power buildings (200 total so far); those generating electricity for the Conde Nast building in Times Square and the First National Bank of Omaha's data center are the most visible. According to Jae Edmonds, an economist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, ''piping around hydrogen becomes much more plausible'' as more big buildings deploy the technology. Another way to speed up the merger of fuel cells and cars: make the cars use less fuel. Amory Lovins, a physicist and designer, founded Hypercar Inc. to build light cars from carbon fiber, which he says would yield fuel efficiency many times greater than that of steel cars; Zoltek, one of two big American suppliers, aims to sell carbon fiber for $5 per pound next year, which could make it competitive with steel. Many admire Lovins's ingenuity, if not his business instincts: picture the lawyers after the first accident.</p>
