        <p>I had a little daydream as I watched the latest television reports from the war in the Persian Gulf. As plumes of black smoke rose from the blasted refineries in Kuwait and Iraq, and Saddam Hussein promised to blow up still more, I found myself briefly imagining what would happen if</p>
        <p>all</p>
        <p>the oil beneath the desert sands of that troubled region were set ablaze by this war.</p>
        <p>Just imagine the startled looks on the faces of all the generals and politicians and economic pundits as they looked around after the last flickering flames had died down and the last clouds of smoke dissipated.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, they would see the swamps of Iraq and the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula in a different light. All around would be an inhospitable landscape unsuited for the production of anything except dates and camel dung. Everyone would just pack up and go home.</p>
        <p>Even Saddam Hussein.</p>
        <p>After all, why did he invade Kuwait to begin with? He was fighting with the Emir over the vast pool of oil that straddles their common border, 10,000 feet underground.</p>
        <p>Once all the oil burned, things would get interesting on the home front as well. With the world deprived most of its known reserves, oil prices would jump, let's say, fivefold. Suddenly, President Bush wouldn't have to worry about crafting an energy policy because the country would have one instantly, born of necessity. Who would need Government incentives to conserve oil with crude going for $125 a barrel and gasoline hitting $7 a gallon at the pump?</p>
        <p>The millions of commuters who take their cars to the office every morning might finally have to opt for mass transit. Maybe then they'd be willing to put some of the money they spend on parking and gas into improving those woeful trains and subways.</p>
        <p>Car manufacturers might even be forced to start putting those unsightly gas mileage figures back in their sleek magazine ads again. And the Japanese -- who have recently put all their efforts into outdoing the Americans at building high-performance, eight-cylinder, gas-guzzling luxury sedans -- might have to lead Detroit back to small cars again.</p>
        <p>Maybe the worldwide population explosion of automobiles would be slowed. It had better slow down. There are 500 million cars on earth. In 35 years, that number is expected to quadruple. Two billion cars. More oil wars.</p>
        <p>Maybe American businesses would finally learn to use fossil fuels efficiently. After all, the Europeans and Japanese already get twice as much industrial production out of a gallon of oil as we do.</p>
        <p>Maybe Americans would finally replace some of their leaky windows. More energy escapes through the poorly insulated windows of American homes each year than flows through the Alaska pipeline.</p>
        <p>Maybe more people would screw in those new compact fluorescent bulbs that throw the same amount of light as standard incandescent bulbs but consume a fourth as much energy and last 10 times as long.</p>
        <p>Maybe solar power would no longer be scoffed at as a pipe dream. With the price of plastics -- which are made from oil -- skyrocketing, maybe Americans would finally put an end to the throw-away age.</p>
        <p>It was a nice dream while it lasted. But the days wore on, the casualties mounted and the ground war began. There were plenty of fires in the Middle East, yes. And the smoke posed a grave environmental threat. But most of the oil still lay safe, beneath the sand.</p>
        <p>There it will stay, patiently waiting for the day when peace returns. After the last of the fallen soldiers and civilians are buried, the Saudis and Kuwaitis -- and the Iraqis -- will return to the battered oilfields, uncap the wells and let it flow.</p>
        <p>And we in America, Japan, Europe and the third world will write them a check, breathe a sigh of relief, and slake our relentless thirst.</p>
