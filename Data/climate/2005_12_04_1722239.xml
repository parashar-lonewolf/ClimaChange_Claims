        <p>YEAR-END parties and holiday meals bring to the table old sparkling wines saved for important occasions and newly minted still wines.</p>
        <p>Sparkling wine, especially when labeled Recently Disgorged, is a specialty at Lenz, in Peconic.</p>
        <p>To make sparkling wine, vintners take a base wine that has completed its alcoholic fermentation; add a sugar-and-yeast dosage, which in a second fermentation produces carbon dioxide bubbles and additional alcohol; then cap the bottles. The longer sparklers interact with dead yeast cells, the deeper they become. Recently Disgorged means that this sediment (called lees) has been removed before periodic releases.</p>
        <p>As for a nouveau, Macari, in Mattituck, has again issued a delectable Early Wine. Only grinches won't love Early Wine, which always scores among my favorite Long Island chardonnays. In the 2005 edition, the grapes were picked Sept. 22; the wine was bottled Nov. 2.</p>
        <p>Lenz's sparkler is named Cuvée (meaning ''blend'' in French). Beginning in 1990, part of the production in favored vintages has been set aside and then released periodically as Recently Disgorged.</p>
        <p>As Lenz nears the end of its 1991 Recently Disgorged Cuvée inventory, an owner, Peter Carroll, is ready to offer his small quantity of 1993 (one bottle to a customer) and, soon afterward, his 1994.</p>
        <p>The 1993 and 1994 (both tasted Nov. 25) are pale brass in color; piquantly dry; awash in vivid yeast-and-honey, nut and baked-apple bouquets and flavors; and deliver lingering aftertastes.</p>
        <p>Eric Fry, the winemaker, used 70 percent pinot noir and 30 percent chardonnay grapes in each. Though both are medium weight, the 1994 seems a trifle lighter. Both can match turkey and game dishes.</p>
        <p>Wines aged for a decade or longer tie up capital all that time; that goes toward explaining why Lenz's 1991, 1993 and 1994 Recently Disgorged bottles cost $50.</p>
        <p>Macari's off-dry 2005 Early Wine ($13), like its 2004 and 2003 versions, is a party in a bottle. The swirl of citrus flavors -- especially grapefruit and orange zest -- is especially intense when the wine is only slightly chilled. Like Beaujolais nouveau, a red, it is conducive to joie de vivre.</p>
        <p>As usual, Macari has Helmut Gangl, a consulting winemaker who flies in from Austria, to thank for this exuberant white. Early Wine, alternately crisp and a bit sweet, resembles the first whites that Austrian vintners start selling, within weeks of their harvests, in heurigen (wine taverns dotting the Vienna Woods).</p>
        <p>The slight fizz that Mr. Gangl imparts gives Early Wine aperitif power but doesn't prevent it from accompanying chicken, turkey, veal and pork dishes.</p>
        <p>Like other nouveaus, Early Wine is intended for immediate drinking. Arbitrarily, I give the entire category a Jan. 2 cutoff date. A swig or two on Jan. 1, after the previous night's sparkling wine, starts off the new year right. It won't quite put summer in your step, but it can add spring.</p>
