        <p>WHEN George W. Bush stepped up to his inaugural podium a year ago today, his view of the world still mystified America, its allies and its enemies. He had made clear what he didn't like -- using American troops for peacekeeping in the Balkans, the Kyoto treaty on global warming, an arms control treaty with Russia that prevented missile defenses. But apart from his conviction that America should lead and the rest of the world should follow, it was hard to tell just where he thought the United States fit into the world.</p>
        <p>A year into Mr. Bush's presidency, the world looks very different -- and so do his skills, though not necessarily his attitudes. His national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, describes Mr. Bush's America as ''a hub around which the president can coalesce others to get things done.''</p>
        <p>The surprise for a lot of people was that Mr. Bush, a year out of Texas, demonstrated his father's touch for dealing with foreign leaders when he needed them in a crisis, persuading them that in joining America they were also defending themselves. Inside the White House, the biggest fear about Mr. Bush's second year is that there could be more acts of terror on American soil. But once terrorism is contained and the task ahead is how to manage a peaceful world, the biggest test may lie in how well Mr. Bush uses America's position at the hub to  extend its influence. That was the problem that plagued Woodrow Wilson and Mr. Bush's father, and turned Harry Truman into a favorite of presidential historians.</p>
        <p>And that takes a different set of skills, chief among them an empathy for the national interests of allies, partners and defeated enemies. For if they wander away from the building of peace, it's as if the war was never won.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, what made President Bush so effective in the weeks after Sept. 11 was exactly the characteristic that lent itself to  parody in the months before -- his proclivity to describe the world in black-and-white terms.</p>
        <p>For a world accustomed to the muted tones of the Clinton administration, in which Iraq and North Korea became ''states of concern'' and almost every other country was an ''emerging market,'' Mr. Bush's phrases seemed simplistic.</p>
        <p>But his blunt vocabulary ''enabled him to say, 'These guys are bad, we're going to go get them,' and then to turn it over to the military to do exactly that,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a political scientist. ''He was able to set a clear, achievable goal, and that's not what we associate with American foreign policy in the Clinton era, or even before.''</p>
        <p>The approach proved startlingly effective at gaining international support, partly because Mr. Bush's call for a war against terrorism with a ''global reach'' gave Russia a new lease on its battle with the Chechens, the Philippines a new impetus to take on rebels in its southern islands, Israel a new way to define the Palestinians, and China an excuse to chase after Muslim separatists.</p>
        <p>For a while, many speculated that the war would also tame Mr. Bush's instinct to go it alone, that over time it would make him better attuned to the resentments bred by America's size and its economic reach.</p>
        <p>But in December he called his crucial partner in the battle against terrorism, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and told him that he was walking away from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Visitors to the Oval Office say they think Mr. Bush's success in Afghanistan has only reinforced his determination to go his own way -- with allies if they want to join the ride, alone if they don't.</p>
        <p>''I sense he is trying harder to understand how the rest of the world views America,'' the prime minister of Greece, Costas Simitis, said after a recent visit with Mr. Bush. But in the next breath he said Mr. Bush had cautioned him that American troops wouldn't stay in the Balkans forever, and Mr. Simitis warned of the ''dangerous symbolism'' if America seemed unwilling to keep the uneasy peace it had helped win.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Rice argues that Mr. Bush was no ''unilateralist'' last Jan. 20, and no more of one today. ''I think all of this about multilateralism versus unilateralism really stemmed from the rejection of a few bad treaties, that were lowest-common-denominator treaties, in which the United States should not have been involved because they were not going to solve the problems that they purported to solve,'' she said. She ticked off the Kyoto treaty on global warming, the establishment of an international criminal court and the biological weapons protocol.</p>
        <p>Other, more brittle elements of Mr. Bush's worldview of last Jan. 20 have given way. Mr. Bush insists that no American forces will be keeping the peace in Afghanistan, but as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell seemed to hint on a brief stopover in Kabul last week, it may not be that simple. Mr. Bush is being forced to consider a bigger American role, lest he repeat one of his father's mistakes: allowing a power vacuum in a lawless Afghanistan, which eventually made it ripe for terrorists.</p>
        <p>As Sept. 11 recedes, another aspect of Mr. Bush's outlook seems likely to take center stage: his ''tough love'' approach to countries that cannot manage their own economic affairs, and his willingness to let nonstrategic allies sink.</p>
        <p>When Argentina headed toward collapse, he expressed sympathy but argued that America could not help until Argentina's leaders got on the path to fiscal discipline and banned all talk of reversing American-style reforms.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Bush's view, American power is for keeping the peace and ending the scourge of terrorism, but not for micro-managing the affairs of other countries in a global economy. Those who play by American rules get to play in America's league. Those who don't get sent to the minors.</p>
        <p>So far, it's worked. But it's doubtful that if 2002 is marked by more economic collapses that threaten global financial stability -- and thus America's own delicate financial health -- Mr. Bush will be able to afford such a hands-off approach. It's one thing to let Argentina sink or swim. It's another if Japan's recession and deflation produce a deeper crisis and the president seems aloof from the details.</p>
        <p>''If Japan goes the way of Argentina, no one will be able to say, 'Too bad, but good luck,' '' one senior State Department official who sits in on the administration's strategy sessions said. ''Sept. 11 reminded us that our military can do amazing things, and that we can still build alliances in a crisis. But that's different from global management.''</p>
