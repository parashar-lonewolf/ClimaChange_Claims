        <p>The Bush administration is considering changes to fuel economy regulations that would encourage manufacturers to offer more large cars, station wagons and smaller sport utility vehicles that are built more like cars.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the changes is that such vehicles are safer than both small cars and sport utility vehicles and pickups, and that if more people drove them, fewer people would die in crashes. Producing more such vehicles and fewer very small or very large vehicles would reduce the increasing disparity among American vehicles, both in weight and how high they ride.</p>
        <p>Because they ride so high, sport utility vehicles and pickups pose more dangers to drivers of small cars than large cars do. They are also more dangerous for their own occupants because of their increased rollover risk.</p>
        <p>But the idea is opposed by environmentalists and has already drawn a sharply worded protest from the United Automobile Workers union. Both are concerned, for different reasons, that the Big Three will stop making small cars because they lose money making them and will no longer be compelled to.</p>
        <p>For the last several months, representatives of the Department of Energy, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and several other federal agencies have been exploring changes to the way fuel economy is regulated.</p>
        <p>Under the current system, in effect since the 1970's, automakers must meet one average for their fleets of cars (currently 27.5 miles per gallon) and a much lower average (20.7 miles per gallon) for their light trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans.</p>
        <p>To reach those averages, automakers generally build small vehicles with higher fuel economy to offset large, less fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>
        <p>The change being considered by the Bush administration will not be described for a month or two, in an initial proposal for fuel economy in the 2008 model year and beyond. But the type of system being considered could eliminate the distinction between cars and light trucks and instead base fuel economy requirements on the weight or size of vehicles.</p>
        <p>So automakers would no longer have to build small cars to help reach the average required of all cars. As for the largest sport utilities and pickups, the fuel economy standard could in theory be raised enough to force the automakers to make such vehicles smaller. As a result, fewer vehicles on the road would be either very big or very small.</p>
        <p>''Large passenger cars and minivans are the safest way to move around large numbers of people,'' said Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the Bush administration's top auto safety regulator, at a conference in January. ''And yet,'' he added, referring to the current system of corporate average fuel economy standards, known as CAFE, ''we have CAFE-ed large cars out of existence.''</p>
        <p>''We need a quantum leap in fuel economy without sacrificing safety,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Such a system could ''enhance fuel efficiency while protecting safety,'' said John D. Graham, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, who is chairman of the interagency committee. Fuel economy regulations, and their effect on vehicle weight and safety, have been a focus of research for Dr. Graham for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists fear Detroit will scrap the most fuel-efficient models and the Bush administration will not require significant improvements in fuel economy. The U.A.W. fears for the workers who make such vehicles and says tens of thousands of jobs are at stake.</p>
        <p>''This could lead to the elimination of small-car production by the Big Three automakers in the United States, with the resulting loss of thousands of good-paying jobs,'' said Alan Reuther, the union's legislative director, in a letter this month to Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, the ranking members of the Senate Commerce Committee.</p>
        <p>Gary Skulnik, a Sierra Club lobbyist on global warming and energy issues, said ''the Big Three would have no incentive to make smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.''</p>
        <p>''The way the system is currently structured,'' he said, ''they have to sell some of these Ford Focuses, or cars like that, to balance out all the gas guzzlers they are selling.''</p>
        <p>Automakers are generally upbeat, though cautious, about the idea. Several said in interviews today that they wanted to wait until the administration lays out details.</p>
        <p>''It's a more realistic approach and doesn't force the sale of small vehicles that are not that popular,'' said Mike Morrissey, a spokesman for General Motors.</p>
        <p>''We see a full range of passenger cars as important to our long-term strategy,'' he added, ''but it will allow us to have a more market-reflective strategy.''</p>
        <p>Jim Olson, a spokesman for Toyota, said, ''The devil's in the details.''</p>
        <p>''Weight-based is something we've looked at in the past and we have thought it makes some sense. But, and I emphasize this, any CAFE scheme depends on how you structure it.''</p>
        <p>The plan could be structured like one laid out in a 2001 National Academy of Sciences report. In that system, all vehicles under two tons would be put into weight classes; vehicles heavier than that would be subject to a single average, be they cars or trucks. The theoretical effect would be to pressure manufacturers to make their heaviest vehicles lighter and their lightest vehicles heavier.</p>
        <p>''We think a weight-based system makes a lot of sense, depending on the criteria and the formula used,'' said R. David Pittle, a senior vice president at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports. ''It's a thinking man's scheme to improve fuel economy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some people are concerned that such a system, depending on how it was structured, could encourage automakers to make some vehicles unnecessarily heavier to fit in less-fuel-efficient categories. If downsizing cars has been an issue, the automotive fleet at large has been bulging in size, contributing to plummeting gas mileage over the last two decades and imbalances that endanger car occupants in collisions with sport utilities.</p>
        <p>Edward B. Cohen, Honda's top Washington lobbyist, said that such a system should be based on sizes -- subcompact or compact -- and not weight. A new study sponsored by Honda says decreasing the cumulative weight of the nation's automobiles would improve safety. ''We're certainly open to examining the issue,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''but we feel that it would be selling the potential of the attribute system short if weight was the only attribute considered.''</p>
