        <p>A Salamander Trove</p>

        <p>A Salamander Trove</p>
        <p>The year 151 million B.C. (give or take a couple of hundred thousand) was a bad one for salamanders. Specifically, it was a bad year for salamanders at a lake in northern China. There they were, frolicking in their own little Late Jurassic park, when a volcano erupted, burying them in hot ash.</p>
        <p>But that catastrophic event created a trove of salamander fossils unlike any ever seen. More than 500 specimens, some with rare impressions of soft tissues, have been uncovered.</p>
        <p>They are the earliest salamanders ever found, and because they cover all growth stages and include detailed anatomical features, they offer scientists clues about salamander evolution.</p>
        <p>The fossils show that salamanders probably originated in Asia and spread to Europe and North America, scientists from the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Chicago reported in the journal Nature. They base this in part on bone structures the fossils share with some of the most primitive of modern salamanders, which are found almost exclusively in Asia.</p>
        <p>Amphibians in Trouble</p>
        <p>Recent times have not been kind to amphibians either, although in a less cataclysmic way. Experts have become concerned about declines of amphibians in many parts of the world. The exact causes are unclear, although disease and increased exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun have been implicated.</p>
        <p>Among the amphibians in trouble is the western toad, found from the Rockies to the Pacific. Its eggs, which are laid in shallow lakes and ponds, can suffer a high mortality rate due to a fungal infection. Previous studies had provided evidence that the eggs were made more susceptible to infection because of the stress caused by higher ultraviolet exposure -- a result, the studies suggested, of ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>But in a new study in Nature, researchers from Penn State and Oregon State have now tied the decline of the western toad to that old nemesis, global warming.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who studied toad eggs in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest, made an elegant series of connections. First, they found that the eggs did indeed become more susceptible to infection due to increased exposure to ultraviolet light.</p>
        <p>But the increased exposure, they found, was not linked to the ozone layer, but to the fact that the eggs were in water that had become shallower -- with less water above them, more ultraviolet light gets through. The researchers linked the shallower water to changes in precipitation patterns. And those changes were linked to the warming of the Pacific and changes in patterns of El Ni√±os and associated events.</p>
        <p>The researchers say the work has implications for other amphibians that breed in upland lakes and shows the interaction of global climate processes with local ecological changes.</p>
        <p>Albatrosses in the Air</p>
        <p>Females and males are different. Additional proof of this is hardly needed, but here's some anyway: male and female wandering albatrosses are aerodynamically different, and as a result tend to hunt for food in different areas.</p>
        <p>That's the conclusion of a study of albatross body structure and feeding patterns by biologists at the University of California at Santa Cruz and published in the journal Functional Ecology.</p>
        <p>The scientists found that male albatrosses have higher ''wing loading'' (more weight for a given amount of wing area) and thus require higher winds to stay aloft for long periods (wandering albatrosses usually ride the wind, without flapping). So males tend to forage in extreme Southern latitudes, among the windiest places anywhere. Females, on the other hand, tend to forage in calmer, more tropical latitudes.</p>
        <p>Fledglings, the researchers found, have even lower wing loading and forage even farther north. They suggest that this gives the young birds a chance to hone their flying skills before they need more wind to stay aloft.</p>
