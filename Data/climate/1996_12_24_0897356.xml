        <p>DIVING offshore south of here recently, Craig Quirolo was shocked to find much of the coral a sickly white, smothered by a mysterious, creeping disease that was choking the life from reefs more than 5,000 years old.</p>
        <p>''They're sick and they're dying,'' said Mr. Quirolo, who founded the Reef Relief conservation group. ''When the coral reefs go, the fisheries go, and there goes our food chain.''</p>
        <p>The newly discovered affliction, named white pox by marine biologists, comes after several other ailments have consumed coral ecosystems around the world, a situation most often linked to pollution and other intrusions by people.</p>
        <p>But the white pox is so new that scientists do not yet know what causes it, let alone how to stop it. If it spreads unchecked, the scientists fear, the entire shallow-water marine ecosystem of the Florida Keys could be thrown off balance.</p>
        <p>Coral colonies, composed of innumerable tiny polyps living in a symbiotic relationship with brilliantly colored algae called zooxanthellae, are under assault, experts say, not only from pollutants like agricultural runoff, oil slicks and trash, but also from dropped anchors, probing divers and global warming.</p>
        <p>Dr. James Porter, a marine ecologist at the University of Georgia who has been studying corals off South Florida for more than two decades, said that in some areas near Key West, the white pox had killed 50 percent to 80 percent of the elkhorn coral, or Acropora palmata, the dominant coral form in the area.</p>
        <p>The two reefs most affected are Eastern Dry Rocks and Rock Key Reef, five to seven miles south of Key West, part of a wide swath of reefs that attract many divers, snorkelers and fishing enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>After being alerted by Mr. Quirolo, Dr. Porter came here and collected samples of the diseased tissue.</p>
        <p>''I knew immediately when I got in the water that there had been a tremendous loss of coral since my last visit one year ago,'' Dr. Porter said from his office in Athens, Ga. ''Much of the coral had died, and there was diseased coral all over the reef.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Porter sent the samples to Deborah Santavy, a marine microbial ecologist at the United States Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Gulf Breeze, Fla., who confirmed that the coral polyps were dead or dying but could not say whether the cause was a bacterium, a fungus, a virus or something else.</p>
        <p>White pox appears as blotches all over the coral, from base to tip. In its advanced stages, the living tissue of the coral becomes flimsy and falls away from the coral skeleton.</p>
        <p>''Over all, a diseased Acropora field has a distinctly beaten-up appearance, as if a toxic substance had been splattered onto an otherwise healthy stand,'' Dr. Porter wrote in a letter to Dr. Santavy that accompanied the diseased specimens. ''The size of the discolored areas range from a few centimeters in diameter to large patches some 20 centimeters in diameter,'' or almost 8 inches.</p>
        <p>White pox shares some of the characteristics of the ''white band'' disease that decimated coral reefs off St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>White pox looks somewhat like an attack by the coral-eating snail, or Coralliophyla, a natural predator of elkhorn coral. But the diseased reefs harbor no such snails, which do their damage more tidily -- in neat rows and circles -- than the random destruction of the white pox.</p>
        <p>''This is new to science, and it's scary,'' Dr. Porter said. ''No one has seen it before anywhere, as far as I'm aware. We're still dealing with the 'What is it?' question and have not yet gotten to the 'Why is it there?' question.''</p>
        <p>Two other kinds of coral diseases have been discovered off Key West in the last two years, Dr. Porter said. One, known as yellow blotch, or yellow band, is also present in the San Blas Islands off Panama. The other, white plague type 2, has been reported in the Bahamas.</p>
