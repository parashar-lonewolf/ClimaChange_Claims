        <p>LEAD: As the new year begins, a solution to the Shoreham impasse seems likely to emerge from secret discussions among the Long Island Lighting Company and representatives of Governor Cuomo and Suffolk County. Before the parties sat down to negotiate under prodding from Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein, the Long Island Weekly asked several people for suggestions on ending the Shoreham problem.</p>
        <p>As the new year begins, a solution to the Shoreham impasse seems likely to emerge from secret discussions among the Long Island Lighting Company and representatives of Governor Cuomo and Suffolk County. Before the parties sat down to negotiate under prodding from Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein, the Long Island Weekly asked several people for suggestions on ending the Shoreham problem. Their replies were compiled by Diane Ketcham, Ellen Mitchell and John Rather.  Maurice Barbash  Chairman, Citizens to Replace Lilco.</p>
        <p>From the point of view of safety and ratepayer savings, both of these objectives would be best met by a Lilco reorganization and a subsequent takeover by the Long Island Power Authority.</p>
        <p>As for safety, the best way to assure that Shoreham does not open is for the Long Island Power Authority to take over Lilco lock, stock and barrel, Shoreham and all.</p>
        <p>Then the power authority will own all of Lilco, and the Shoreham plant would be under the authority's ownership. And the authority is prohibited by law from operating a nuclear facility.</p>
        <p>The Governor's settlement with Lilco leaves gaping loopholes, and Shoreham, under his settlement, could be mothballed and later reactivated, and we want to prevent against that.</p>
        <p>Regarding ratepayer savings, our experts tell us that, if Lilco were in reorganization, its equity naturally would be reduced and reflected in ratepayer savings.</p>
        <p>Also, they say, there would be further savings when the power authority took over.</p>
        <p>It could take advantage of the tax-free financing and the forgiveness of Federal taxes that public power authorities enjoy.  I. William Bianchi Jr.  New York State Assemblyman from Bellport; fought Governor Cuomo on Shoreham settlement, was defeated in last November's election.</p>
        <p>The Governor could have the support of the Legislature if he would cooperate with us and get a better deal negotiated with the company.</p>
        <p>If Judge Weinstein makes that larger class-action ruling, we're all starting from scratch. If we do start new negotiations, this time it should be the Legislature with the Governor, rather than just the Governor.</p>
        <p>We're very fortunate we have Ralph J. Marino as the Senate leader. He's as knowledgeable about Shoreham as the Governor.  Nora Bredes  Director, Long Island Power Authority; coordinator, Shoreham Opponents Coalition.</p>
        <p>Shoreham is a multilayered problem, sometimes symbolized by one phrase: Stop Shoreham.</p>
        <p>Wrapped within that one phrase are layers of safety, environmental, economic, political and social questions. The questions cannot all be answered by one piece of legislation, one settlement or any one action.</p>
        <p>The first problem that must be dealt with is the dangerous and perhaps deadly nuclear-power plant. A way must be found to prevent the plant from being licensed or, if licensed, to prevent it from being operated. That goal should be the primary focus of citizens' and politicians' energies.</p>
        <p>Once the plant ceases to be a threat and we can breathe deeply and see clearly, the larger problem that led to Shoreham must be addressed. Our ultimate goal is for both economic and social justice, and the replacement of Lilco with public power.  Leon Campo  Member, Lilco Board; Long Island Power Authority NM trustee; chairman, People's Action Coalition (anti-Shoreham group).</p>
        <p>I've been in the thick of this for 10 years. I know all the players and I think I know all that's going on. I think there's a simple solution.</p>
        <p>I don't subscribe to this global settlement where the RICO  [ Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ]  Act gets settled and the State Legislature gets converted at midnight. RICO changes the whole political landscape. It offers an opportunity that didn't exist before.</p>
        <p>You have to separate the two issues. Rate mitigation is separate from closing Shoreham. Rate mitigation should not come from Albany.</p>
        <p>Our Albany legislators are now out of the picture. Rate mitigation should flow from the RICO Act, and that's a separate process that only commences in the beginning in February.</p>
        <p>We have to stop Shoreham now or it will run and our rates will double. The Governor and Lilco need to change one word in their settlement. Instead of making use of the New York Power Authority mandatory for building new plants, add the word ''if.'' If Lilco chooses to use the power authority to build power plants, then legislation will be required in Albany.</p>
        <p>The settlement then is effective in all aspects. The rates in it can be improved through rate mitigation as it flows from the RICO Act. It gets the Legislature off the hook and it can be done instantly.  Peter F. Cohalan  Justice of the State Supreme Court and former Suffolk County Executive. He resigned the latter post after changing his stance on the Shoreham plant.</p>
        <p>''As a sitting judge, it would not be appropriate for him to comment.'' Statement by Daniel J. Murphy, chief law secretary to Justice Cohalan.  Marge Harrison  Chairwoman, Long Island Citizens in Action; former co-chairwoman, Long Island Progessive Coalition; member, Marburger Commission on Shoreham (1983-84).</p>
        <p>Lilco should cease all efforts and expenditures aimed toward operating Shoreham. Unfortunately, we can't bank on Lilco acting wisely on its own. But Lilco has only been able to continue with Shoreham because the Public Service Commission has been very generous to Lilco with our money.</p>
        <p>The key is the extra $400 million the commission has allowed Lilco to collect through rates each year for Shoreham. That's about 25 percent of our bills. No law has forced the commission to grant these subsidies.</p>
        <p>So I would say to the P.S.C., ''Stop the Shoreham surcharges and Lilco will begin to see its way toward wisdom on Shoreham.''</p>
        <p>It would certainly be a dramatic act, a dramatic reversal for them to say, after 10 years of giving these subsidies, ''Now we're not going to do it anymore.''</p>
        <p>But there is a new commission with a new chair and, they don't have to be beholden to past practices.</p>
        <p>These subsidies are clearly counterproductive. The Public Service Commission has to realize that it is allowing this drama to continue, and now it must be brought to an end.  Frank Jones  Town of Islip Supervisor.</p>
        <p>I've coined a new phrase. You know the old expression, ''It ain't over till the fat lady sings.'' Well, in the case of Shoreham, it's ''It ain't over even after the fat lady sings.''</p>
        <p>I have guessed four different times already when this would be resolved. Clearly, the safety issue, where everybody wanted Shoreham closed quickly, translated itself into a pocketbook issue when they started talking about the rate increases.</p>
        <p>So now I don't know. If the focus goes back on safety, maybe, as we get closer to Shoreham really being opened, people will say that we can't afford to open it. But at this point, they're saying that we can't afford not to open it.</p>
        <p>Somebody should have recognized that the focus was going to shift because everyone knew that the solution would cost money.</p>
        <p>I really don't know. Clearly, Judge Weinstein has become a key player. If he allows or doesn't allow a class-action suit, that will be a major thing either way. I can't judge.</p>
        <p>And now the Suffolk Legislature is back into it, and how will that play? Will it support a massive rate increase to keep Shoreham closed, if it comes to that? It will have to choose sides.</p>
        <p>You know, we brought the garbage barge home and burned it. Shoreham is more than a never-ending saga. It's something beyond that.</p>
        <p>If they burn Shoreham, I'll accept the ash in the dump. I accepted the ash for the barge; I'll do the same for Shoreham.  John V. N. Klein  Former Sussex County Executive, he is now a practicing lawyer in Mineola.</p>
        <p>The first thing I say is that I love reading about it, but that's all.</p>
        <p>I don't know what's left to be done at this point. All else but opening the plant seems to have failed to resolve this monumental problem, including the so-called settlement agreement.</p>
        <p>All that's left is for Governor Cuomo to come forward with some source of financing to soften the impact on the ratepayers. The only thing that could be done to salvage that deal would be for the Governor to sweeten the deal for the ratepayers, coming up with some money from outside.</p>
        <p>But the Governor's got one of the worst fiscal pictures looking at him, so that's a pretty heavy number.</p>
        <p>The other possible course of action is to let things fall where they may, which is to let Shoreham open sooner or later.</p>
        <p>And I think this RICO Act suit has added almost a terminal sense of frustration. Anyone can speculate on what Judge Weinstein will do. It adds a complication that makes solutions almost impossible.</p>
        <p>I left office in December of '79. At that juncture, it was clear that Shoreham was behind schedule and well over cost. Everybody, including my successor, Peter F. Cohalan, said the thing should go forward and open. My perception then was it would be open at full power by the mid-80's.</p>
        <p>I think what's happened with Shoreham is probably one of the greatest governmental and private fiascoes in the history of modern man. We're choosing between opening a nuclear plant by shoving it down the throats of probably 70 percent of the constituency or kicking away a $5.5 billion investment.  Charles Komanoff  Komanoff Energy Associates; economic consultant and ''student of nuclear power industry's economics for the last 15 years.''</p>
        <p>I'm not sure that I see a way for it to be resolved quickly. I see it dragging on, unless Lilco would be willing to renegotiate on the basis of a delay in the restoration of its preferred- and common-stock dividends, if Lilco were willing to make rate concessions to soften the impact of settlement.  James L. Larocca  President, Long Island Association.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature was absolutely correct in declining to approve the settlement plan. The plan did not fairly distribute the burden among the parties, and ratepayers were asked to pick up a disproportionate share of the tab.</p>
        <p>Where does this leave us? The effort to settle issues must begin anew, but include a wider representation of interests than last year's negotiations. Specifically, the Legislature should be directly involved and the business community, which would be deeply affected, should also be directly involved.</p>
        <p>Consumers, through their elected representatives, must be given the sense that their concerns are being included. A key component of winning business support would be an agreement to mothball rather than utterly destroy the plant. Needs, attitudes, technology and economics may change over time.  Irving Like  Long Island Power Authority director and a lawyer long involved in the Shoreham case.</p>
        <p>The best solution to the problem is for Lilco to be restructured either through bankruptcy or through what we call a pre-Chapter 11 negotiation.</p>
        <p>Restructuring of the company would hopefully result in a reduction in its debt, in the claims of its creditors and bondholders and in a reduction or even the elimination of its stockholders as a part of a plan of reorganization. That plan would then be followed by a power authority takeover.</p>
        <p>The end result of this process, the bankruptcy followed by a power authority takeover, would be to reduce the company's rate base and the amount of rates it has to collect from its electric ratepayers.</p>
        <p>It also would gain the advantages of public power, which are that the company would be tax exempt as a public power entity. It would not have to pay stockholder dividends, and it would be able to borrow at lower costs because it could sell tax-free securities.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the statute that created the power authority would mandate the closing of the Shoreham plant.  John H. Marburger  President, State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>I would prefer not to speculate on the issue. It's essentially an unsolvable problem at this point, the problem being how to eliminate negative economic consequences to Long Island. And the damage is already done.</p>
        <p>The plant is there, the money has been borrowed and it needs to be paid back. I believe that ultimately the people of Long Island are going to have to pay for the plant.</p>
        <p>I don't believe that any arrangement is possible that will reverse the trend toward still higher rates.</p>
        <p>The question of whether there is an adequate supply of electricity is almost secondary, compared with the impact of those enormously high rates.</p>
        <p>My personal position on the power facility is that it would be appropriate to operate it and generate electricity with it, but that to me is a lesser issue than the issue of the very high rates we will have to pay for electricity.  Peter Maniscalco  A resident of Stony Brook and coordinator of the Stop Shoreham Campaign. He is an author and truck driver.</p>
        <p>Shoreham has to die. That's the highest priority. It's important for the United States and the world to see that average citizens can come together in opposing a nuclear plant and actually end its existence. The nuclear industry really doesn't want that message to get out.</p>
        <p>The major thing regarding Shoreham has always been courage, and I think the first group to not show courage has been the State Legislature. The Governor had courage, but the Legislature did not.</p>
        <p>Now, I think, they'll see a shift because of the RICO Act suit. The county will become a major actor, and I now think the possibility exists that the county and Lilco will come to some sort of settlement, with the Governor supporting it.</p>
        <p>I would hope there could be some way that a bill would be passed by the Public Service Commission that would place a moratorium on Lilco's pursuit of the Shoreham license. Then the dust could settle and give a chance for everyone to understand Lilco finances and make a decision.</p>
        <p>I'm shocked that the deal fell apart; then again, I'm not really shocked. I keep myself away from the emotional side of this thing. I've seen too many people eaten up by the issue because they go at it with such tremendous intensity.  Paul Townsend  Editor, Long Island Business News, a weekly publication headquartered in Ronkonkoma.</p>
        <p>There is only one rational way to settle Shoreham: Open it! A growing number of publications and business, labor, science and government leaders say that the Shoreham plant is as safe as the 109 nuclear-power plants already operating in the United States.</p>
        <p>It is nonpolluting, as compared to fossil fuels; most economical, since it is already built, and independent of foreign oil.</p>
        <p>Shoreham is ready to provide affordable, adequate energy, thereby eliminating our great risk of blackouts.</p>
        <p>Long Island has been victimized by falsehoods and misrepresentations of anti-nuclear zealots and opportunistic politicians. This booming island has problems with congested roads, high taxes, mounting garbage and medical waste on our beaches.</p>
        <p>But our biggest problem is antigrowth Nimbys  [ Not in My Backyard ]  and antibusiness public officials.  Tom Twomey  Founder of Citizens to Settle Shoreham and a lawyer from East Hampton.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Lighting Company should agree to close Shoreham and forgo its tax certiori claims and Suffolk County should agree to settle all RICO Act claims in return for a certain amount of rate relief for Lilco's customers.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature should agree to enact rate-relief measures totaling $800 million, which would strengthen the Long Island Power Authority and provide cheaper public power to the Island. The Governor should agree to all these rate-relief measures and have the state abide by the terms of the state-Lilco settlement.</p>
        <p>Lastly, Judge Weinstein should perform a miracle in supervising the settlement of all claims by all parties, producing peace on the Long Island and closing Shoreham once and for all.  Stephen Villano  Former vice president, Long Island Power Authority.</p>
        <p>If the best minds of Long Island don't get together to resolve this issue, the worst minds in Washington will wangle a way to wrest control of the plant from either Lilco, the power authority, Suffolk County or New York State.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government has already established its rationale for taking the decisions on Shoreham's future out of our hands: the declaration of a national technological emergency, as provided in a Presidential order of Nov. 18.</p>
        <p>With the shutdown of all three Federal Energy Department reactors that produce tritium, an element necessary for making nuclear weapons, the same Energy Department responsible for catastrophic safety failures at the weapons facilities is readying plans to convert civilian nuclear-power plants like Shoreham or Seabrook into tritium-producing plants.</p>
        <p>Such a scenario would give Long Islanders the worst of all possible worlds: all risk, no benefit. Our health and safety would be gravely threatened by Shoreham being controlled and managed by the Federal Energy Department.</p>
        <p>Pro-Shoreham advocates would not get the commercial nuclear power they so badly want, since the plant would be used for military purposes. And we'd all get billed twice: once for the prudent cost of Shoreham and again in our Federal tax bills for money used to support the Federal Energy Department's tritium experiments on Long Island's North Shore.  David J. Willmott  Publisher of the Suffolk Life weekly newspapers; Shoreham opponent since 1969.</p>
        <p>The proper course would be to allow the Long Island Lighting Company to go into bankruptcy. Under Chapter 11, it can be forced in, or go in voluntarily.</p>
        <p>Then the management of the company would be replaced by the Long Island Power Authority. The authority would close Shoreham and the electric company could be acquired quite reasonably.  Lewis J. Yevoli  One of four Democratic Assemblyman from Long Island who blocked the Shoreham settlement deal.</p>
        <p>There are so many ultimate scenarios that most of what happens will be contingent on Judge Weinstein's decision. There's no question that the RICO Act has opened a Pandora's box.</p>
        <p>I feel that Judge Weinstein will confirm the conviction. Even on appeal, I don't think it will be overturned.</p>
        <p>Then you get the second half, which will be if he certifies the ratepayers' lawsuit. Then Lilco will have to go for a voluntary bankruptcy because it's a foregone conclusion that they'll lose it.</p>
        <p>That $1.8 billion is just an arbitrary figure. If the figure is even near a billion, Lilco wouldn't be able to survive anything but a voluntary bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Then again, Judge Weinstein could choose, as he did in Agent Orange, to call in both parties and tell them both to come up with a reasonable figure. Whatever money figure is eventually decided on, the RICO suit will determine Lilco's next move.</p>
        <p>And that brings us to where we are now, which is nowhere. Everything is open-ended. It's really a mess.</p>
        <p>It's ironic. One of the things we kept pursuing, but to which no one would listen, was debt reorganization and voluntary bankruptcy. It's the best way for Lilco, and it's the best deal the ratepayers can get.</p>
        <p>The big advantage to Lilco of a Shoreham closure is that it gives Lilco that $2.5 billion tax writeoff. And that's why I never believed that it wanted to open the plant.</p>
        <p>I don't think closing Shoreham can be a blanket indictment of all nuclear-power plants throughout the country, but it will serve as an example that, when you plan these things, you'd better make sure you've covered all your bases in terms of evacuation, community sentiment and such.</p>
