        <p>LEAD: An international team will investigate the mysterious ozone hole over the Antarctic to see whether man-made chemicals, nature or both are destroying the gas vital to life on earth, space agency scientists announced Tuesday.</p>
        <p>An international team will investigate the mysterious ozone hole over the Antarctic to see whether man-made chemicals, nature or both are destroying the gas vital to life on earth, space agency scientists announced Tuesday.</p>
        <p>A specially equipped ER-2 plane, capable of flying to the edge of space, and a modified DC-8 airliner taking off from the southern tip of Chile will be part of the $10 million effort from Aug. 17 to Sept. 29.</p>
        <p>''I believe this is probably the most singularly important earth science project in a decade,'' Robert Watson, program scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said at the agency's Ames Research Center.</p>
        <p>Ozone, a form of oxygen produced at the upper reaches of the atmosphere by a photochemical reaction with the sun's ultraviolet radiation, is essential to life because it limits the amount of ultraviolet rays penetrating to the earth's surface. An increase in ultraviolet radiation will cause skin cancers and other health problems and damage some plant and animal life.</p>
        <p>For years, scientists have worried that man-made chemicals, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, might gradually deplete the ozone layer. Recently, they have been puzzled by the discovery of a mysterious seasonal ''hole'' in the ozone over the Antarctic.</p>
        <p>The timing of the flights coincides with the onset of the hole, or thinning of Antarctic ozone, which begins at the end of winter in the southern hemisphere and lasts through spring.</p>
        <p>NASA, which will provide most of the money, will be joined in the effort by at least three other Federal science agencies; the Chemical Manufacturers Association; scientists from Harvard University, the University of Denver, and the University of Washington, and the governments of Argentina, Chile, France, New Zealand and Britain.</p>
        <p>The ER-2, a modified version of the U-2 spy plane, and a specially equipped and modified DC-8 airliner will make at least 10 passes each through the ozone hole, flying from Punta Arenas, Chile, across the South Pole to New Zealand.</p>
        <p>The ER-2 will fly in the region of maximum ozone depletion, up to 65,000 feet, and carry instruments to gather information on winds, pressure and temperatures. Other instruments will take samples of chemicals. The DC-8 will fly up to 40,000 feet and carry instruments to measure ozone and other chemicals. Other data will be recorded by ground and satellite equipment.</p>
        <p>The key questions the probe will address are whether chlorofluorocarbons, such as those emitted by chemicals in refrigerators, air conditioners and aerosol sprays, are causing the ozone depletion, and whether the hole will spread.</p>
        <p>An international meeting of policy makers in Montreal in September will look at data to set guidelines for the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which have a lifetime of about 100 years.</p>
