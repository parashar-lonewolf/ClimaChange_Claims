        <p>If Osama bin Laden is hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, as American officials suspect, he has plenty to choose from. The country's varied landscape and geology make it ideal for caves.</p>
        <p>The area that is now Afghanistan started to take shape hundreds of  millions of years ago, when gigantic rocks, propelled by the immense geological forces that continuously rearrange the earth's landforms, slammed into the landmass that is now Asia. Much of the rest of today's Afghanistan was still under water, yet to be formed.</p>
        <p>Rocks deep inside the earth, heated to thousands of degrees and crushed under tremendous pressures, flow like taffy. Just like the air masses in thunderstorms, the warmer rocks rise and the cooler ones sink, setting up Ferris wheel-shaped circulations of magma that drag along the crust above them.</p>
        <p>Over time, these forces broke off several pieces off the southern supercontinent of Gondwanaland -- the ancient conglomeration of South America and Africa -- and carried them north toward Asia.</p>
        <p>''All that stuff got rafted in and stitched together in Afghanistan,'' said Dr. John F. Shroder, a professor of geology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who is an expert on Afghanistan's complex geology.</p>
        <p>The limestones of Afghanistan's natural caves were once part of a shallow tropical ocean known as the Tethys. Organisms in the sea -- corals, clams, plankton -- were compressed into limestone. ''All those limestones were produced in an oceanic environment somewhere south of present-day Afghanistan,'' Dr. Shroder said.</p>
        <p>In a last mighty collision of tectonic plates 45 million years ago, India, sliding north from Antarctica, jammed into Asia. The ocean floor in front of India slid beneath the Eurasian plate.</p>
        <p>''India is the last piece that rafted in and pushed up the Himalayas,'' Dr. Shroder said.</p>
        <p>Minerals from the ocean floor, melted by the heat of the interior, then flowed back up near the surface, forming rich deposits of copper and iron (minerals that could someday finance an economic boom in Afghanistan). The limestone along the coasts of Asia and India buckled upward, like two cars in a head-on collision.</p>
        <p>Water then ate away at the limestone to form the caves. Though arid today, Afghanistan was once warm and wet. Carbon dioxide from decaying plants dissolves into water to form carbonic acid, and in water-saturated underground areas, the acid hollowed out the limestone to form the caves, some several miles long.</p>
        <p>Afghanistan's fighters find shelter in the natural caves. They also make their own, often in the mountains of crystalline rock made of minerals like quartz and feldspar, the pieces of Afghanistan that were carried in by plate tectonics. Dr. Shroder says those rocks are twice as hard as limestone.</p>
        <p>''This kind of rock is extremely resistant,'' Dr. Shroder said. ''It's a good place to build bunkers, and bin Laden knows that.'' Dr. Shroder said he believed that Mr. bin Laden's video in October was taken in a region with crystalline rocks like those south of Jalalabad.</p>
