        <p>In finding a correlation between the price of rye and property crime in the 1800s, current economists are rediscovering relationships well known at the time (Freakonomics, Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt, Nov. 5). In his book, ''Laboring Classes and Dangerous Classes,'' a social history of Paris in the same epoch, Louis Chevalier noted that ''the price of bread was of utmost importance; its curve followed the curve of all ills that Paris was heir to,'' and the Paris prefect of police wrote in 1827 that ''it is imperative that the price of bread does not go higher than 3 sous to the pound.'' Of course, he did this analysis without the benefit of a single regression equation.</p>
