        <p>LEAD:</p>
        <p>Cost of Cab Ride Up 30 Percent In Chicago</p>
      </block>
      <block class="full_text">
        <p>LEAD:</p>
        <p>Cost of Cab Ride Up 30 Percent In Chicago</p>
        <p>Cost of Cab Ride Up 30 Percent In Chicago</p>
        <p>Chicago, which used to be one of the least expensive cities in the country for taxi riders, has joined the mainstream. The reason: after nearly a decade of no change in fares, the City Council recently approved a series of increases averaging 30 percent. The increases, which took effect in March, will affect travelers' costs in deciding which Chicago airport to use.</p>
        <p>Travelers will pay more no matter how long or short their trip in a cab. Under the new fare structure, they are paying a base rate - the so-called flag pull or drop - of $1.20, up from $1. And they are paying $1.20 to travel a mile, up from 90 cents.</p>
        <p>A three-mile trip from the residential Near North Side to the Loop costs $4.60, up from $3.60. A five-mile trip - say, from the Near North Side to the McCormick Place convention center - now costs $7, up from $5.40.</p>
        <p>Because it has always been much more expensive to ride to O'Hare Airport from downtown than to Midway Airport, the 30 percent fare translates into a greater increase in the cost of a trip to O'Hare. Whereas there used to be a $6 difference between the cost of traveling to the two airports ($18 vs. $12), there can now be an $8 difference, depending on traffic ($24 vs. $16). Moreover, now that the cost of a cab to O'Hare, including tip, exceeds $25, many business travelers will for the first time be required to keep receipts in order to be reimbursed by their employers. Many companies do not require employees to produce receipts for expenses under $25.</p>
        <p>The one comforting piece of news is that Chicago taxis are still relatively inexpensive. Of 13 cities surveyed by Chicago officials, Chicago ranked eighth in terms of cab costs after the new fares went into effect. Leading the list was Los Angeles, where a three-mile trip costs $6.30. The cost of such a ride in Chicago is now $4.60. The cheapest cabs found in the survey were in Denver, where a three-mile ride is $4.05.</p>
        <p>Watching Yen While in Japan</p>
        <p>One way to cut costs in Japan, according to Japanese tourist officials, is to look for restaurants in department stores, office buildings or near public transportation where inexpensive prices are posted. The best buys are often at noontime when the daily special (teishoku) costs about 700 yen, or $4.50 (based on 158 yen to $1) and includes rice, miso soup, salad, meat or fish entree and dessert.</p>
        <p>Eating out is among topics in a free color brochure, Economical Travel in Japan, available from the Japan National Tourist Organization (630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10111). It says that kaiten sushi restaurants serve sushi at low cost by saving on labor costs. The sushi chef places slices of raw fish and rice on a conveyor belt for customers to pick up. Don't tip in Japan, the booklet adds: it's not the custom. Other advice for saving money: buy a rail pass for unlimited rail travel; study tour-operator packages for group and independent bargains and consider staying in inns (ryokan), family-run guesthouses (minshuku) or pensions.</p>
        <p>The average cost of a night at a ryokan, without meals, is $25 a person; at a minshuku, the rate, with two meals, is generally about $32.</p>
        <p>The 14-page brochure includes maps, tips for taking a bath and sketches, including one showing Japanese bedding, which is laid directly on a soft matted floor.</p>
        <p>The booklet also recommends taking the limousine bus from Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo for about $17. A taxi would cost around $125.</p>
        <p>Rome Protects Marcus Aurelius</p>
        <p>After nine years of exile in Rome's Central Institute of Restoration, the statue of Marcus Aurelius, symbol of the Eternal City's ancient civilization, has made a triumphant comeback to public domain on Capitoline Hill.</p>
        <p>The 1,800-year-old gilded equestrian masterpiece has not returned, however, to its original pedestal at the center of the Piazza del Campidoglio, which Michelangelo designed in the 16th century. It now stands in the adjacent Capitoline Museum, sheltered from smog and acid rain.</p>
        <p>While experts continue to debate whether to replace the twice lifesize bronze statue of the emperor-philosopher with a copy, the original pedestal stands empty at the center of the square, a symbol itself, not of past glory but of the threat of traffic pollution.</p>
        <p>The Capitoline Museum in the Palazzo Nuovo on the Piazza del Campidoglio is open every day but Monday from 9 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. and, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 5 to 8 P.M. It is also open on Saturday from 5 to 11 P.M. from April to September. The entry fee of about $3.60 covers a visit to the museum's collection of ancient Roman sculptures.</p>
        <p>Hawaii Plans 3 Boat Races</p>
        <p>HONOLULU</p>
        <p>Three interisland races mark the kayak, outrigger canoe and sailing canoe racing season in Hawaii this year. Men and women paddlers, including international Olympic champions, compete across the Kaiwi Channel, one of the world's most treacherous.</p>
        <p>The 32-mile Kayak Challenge takes place May 20. This 14th annual single-person kayak-surf ski race starts from the beach at Papohaku Roadstead in front of the Kaluakoi Resort on Molokai Island at 10 A.M. and finishes shortly after noon at the Koko Marina ocean promenade in Hawaii Kai on Oahu. Free parking is available at the adjacent shopping center.</p>
        <p>The 75-mile Maui-to-Oahu Ho'omana'o Challenge on May 27 is a six-man outrigger sailing canoe race. It begins at Whaler's Village, Kaanapali, on Maui at 6:30 A.M. and finishes in front of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel area of Waikiki Beach, Oahu, between 1 and 3 P.M. It is a test of strength; no midwater crew changes are allowed. Ho'omana'o means ''cause to remember.'' The race, first held last year, revives the tradition of ancient Hawaiian outrigger sailing canoes.</p>
        <p>The 40.8-mile Molokai Hoe, the classic of interisland open ocean paddling, will be Oct. 7. The 40th annual six-man outrigger canoe event, from Molokai to Oahu, begins at 6 A.M. with the rigging of the outriggers at Hale O Lono, a barge harbor reached by dirt road seven miles east of Molokai's west end. In-the-water start is at 7:30 A.M. There will be entertainment at the finish line at approximately 12:30 P.M., at Fort DeRussy Beach, Waikiki.</p>
        <p>The Na Wahine O Ke Kai, the women's version of the Molokai Hoe, takes place on Sept. 30, starting from Hale O Lono on Molokai at 7:30 A.M. and finishing at Duke Kahanamoku Beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel in Waikiki at about 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>MOANA TREGASKIS</p>
        <p>Delays on I-75</p>
        <p>Travelers arriving at Greater Cincinnati International Airport in Boone County, Ky., can expect some delays getting into town this summer due to road construction. Work along the Cincinnati stretch of Interstate 75 is scheduled to continue through October.</p>
        <p>An alternative route to the airport, either I-471 or I-275, is advisable. For updated traffic conditions call: 513-852-5000.</p>
