        <p>Meeting Sought With Kostunica  Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright would like to meet the new leader of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica, who fulfilled one of her long-held ambitions: sweeping Yugoslavia's strongman, Slobodan Milosevic, from power. But it is not clear that he wants to meet her. Aides said Dr. Albright's top priority at the annual session of foreign ministers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe this weekend was to greet Mr. Kostunica, but he had not replied to entreaties to set up a meeting.</p>

        <p>Compensation for King and Kin  The European Court of Human Rights ruled that former King Constantine of Greece and members of his family are entitled to compensation for palaces and estates seized when he was dethroned three decades ago. The court cited a portion of Europe's human rights convention that guarantees property rights.</p>

        <p>Florida Ruling on Recount Is Serious Setback for Gore  A unanimous Florida Supreme Court refused to compel Miami-Dade County to resume its manual recount of nearly 700,000 paper ballots. The ruling was a serious setback to Vice President Al Gore, whose aides promptly announced that on Monday he planned to formally contest the certified results of the Florida election. With Mr. Gore struggling to overtake Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the ruling cut him off from a potentially rich source of Democratic votes in South Florida.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Officials in the Gore campaign and in the Democratic Party say they are increasingly doubtful that Mr. Gore will come up with the votes necessary in Florida to overcome Mr. Bush's slim advantage, but some campaign officials insisted that they would not back down because they still believed more voters had intended to back Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's hopes settled on Broward County, Fla., where election officials began to hand count 1,800 ballots with dimpled chads or other unclear signs of the voters' intent.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Absentee ballots cast by thousands of Floridians were tossed out because officials rejected the signatures or found other flaws. It now appears that many of these people were legitimate voters whose bad handwriting doomed their chances of participating.</p>
        <p>A39</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign told the United States Supreme Court that the appeals filed on behalf of Mr. Bush were ''a bald attempt to federalize a state law dispute'' over how Florida election officials should determine the will of the state's voters.</p>

        <p>Death Row Case Sabotaged  Russell Tucker's lawyer, appointed by a North Carolina court to represent him after he was sentenced to death, sabotaged the case by deliberately missing a deadline for filing an appeal. ''I decided that Mr. Tucker deserved to die, and I would not do anything to prevent his execution,'' the lawyer, David B. Smith of Greensboro, N.C., said in asking for an extension of the deadline and to be taken off the case.</p>

        <p>Police Tactic Raises Concerns  An attempt by the police to use a sales receipt for books to identify the owner of a methamphetamine laboratory in a trailer home near Denver has raised concerns among booksellers, publishers and privacy groups, who are watching the case closely for its implications on the constitutional guarantees of free speech and privacy.</p>

        <p>Wind Drops, Balloons Fly In Thanksgiving Parade  Winds relented around daybreak to allow 14 giant helium balloons to fly in the 74th annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, to the relief of 1,700 balloon handlers and millions of parade watchers. But, for safety reasons, a Macy's spokesman said, the balloons were kept tethered 10 to 15 feet above the street, about half their usual height. Winds had been 12 to 16 miles an hour overnight, but dropped to 5 to 10 miles an hour before the parade. Many spectators said they were happy that the balloons were flying lower because it made them appear bigger.</p>

        <p>Glimmer of Hope for Treaty  Heading into the final 24 hours of talks on the fine print in a global warming treaty, disputes festered between blocs of countries large and small, rich and poor, over what rules, tools and penalties should be used to curb greenhouse gases. But some lobbyists from environmental groups said they saw progress, in the form of a summary of key sticking points distributed late Thursday night. It contained language that they said could protect the atmosphere and satisfy the interests of dozens of countries.</p>

        <p>Jets Owner Talks of Move  Woody Johnson, the new owner of the New York Jets, voiced his strongest preference yet for the construction of a domed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan to house the team after its lease at Giants Stadium in New Jersey runs out in 2008. When asked by reporters if he preferred moving to Manhattan, he said, ''I think that's a fair statement.'' He added, ''The West Side would be a pretty good site because it has multiple uses.''</p>
