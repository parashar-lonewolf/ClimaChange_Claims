        <p>Re ''North Korea Says It Is Withdrawing From Arms Treaty'' (front page, Jan. 10):</p>
        <p>By removing itself from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and breaking the terms it agreed to in the 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration, North Korea is simply doing what the United States has been doing for the last eight years. The United States did not finish building the light-water nuclear reactors it agreed to give North Korea in the 1994 accord, so it is hardly surprising that North Korea decided to abandon its end of the agreement.</p>

        <p>That North Korea should remove itself from the arms treaty is more disturbing, but the United States has recently removed itself from two treaties it found inconvenient, the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the Kyoto Protocol. The Bush administration should move quickly to defuse the situation by reaching a new agreement with North Korea, but in the future should make sure that no dictator can point his finger at us and say that he's just playing follow the leader.</p>
