        <p>ANTIQUES EXHIBIT</p>
        <p>Fifty-two exhibitors who are members of the Antiques Dealers of America will participate in the vetted antiques show at the Westchester County Center in White Plains from noon to 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday and from noon to 5 P.M. next Sunday.</p>
        <p>This will be the fifth annual show from which proceeds will benefit the preservation projects of Historic Hudson Valley, which maintains the county's landmark sites at Sunnyside, Philipsburg Manor, Van Cortlandt Manor, Union Church of Pocantico Hills and Montgomery Place.</p>
        <p>The word vetted means that each piece in the show was examined by a committee of experts, then labeled with its age, origin and condition before being exhibited.</p>
        <p>The Antiques Dealers Association of America was founded in 1984 as a nonprofit organization dedicated to integrity and ethical conduct in the antiques business. Only member dealers will be exhibiting next weekend, and most of the items will be 18th- and 19th-century American furniture and accessories.</p>
        <p>At 3 P.M. Friday, Thomas G. Schwenke, a noted dealer in Manhattan and Danbury, will discuss "An Introduction to Federal Furniture," an area in which he specializes. Brock Jobe, curator of collections for the Preservation of New England Antiquities in Boston, will discuss "A Comparison of 18th-Century Furniture of Boston, Portsmouth and Newport" at 3 P.M. Saturday. Both talks are free with the price of admission.</p>
        <p>A curatorial walk-through of the show conducted by Joseph T. Butler will take place at 10 A.M. Saturday by reservation at $35 a person. Mr. Butler, a lecturer, author and authority on European and American decorative arts, has been with Historic Hudson Valley for 30 years, re-creating the interiors of its historic homes. He is senior director of the organization.</p>
        <p>Daily admission is $8. For reservations and information, call 631-8200. ENVIRONMENTAL ART</p>
        <p>An exhibition opening today at the Somerstown Gallery has the work of 40 artists who are concerned about the destruction of the environment. Titled "Environmental Watch," the show features written statements by each artist as well as his painting, sculpture, photograph, construction, weaving or ceramic.</p>
        <p>Peter Wood of Mount Kisco, for example, works with boxes. "My artwork is usually encased in boxes," he said. "People also live in boxes. Our skin is a box; our days and nights are boxes, and our delicate environment is a box."</p>
        <p>Lee Funderberg's paintings of birds and fish are focused on her belief that "birds and fish are our early-warning signal; as they go, so go the rest of us."</p>
        <p>Tanya Kukucka does woodcuts in black and white with only an accent of color, like yellow to represent radiation. Her concerns center on acid rain, landfills and the unnecessary killing of animals.</p>
        <p>A reception will be held from 2 to 4 P.M. today at the gallery, on Route 100 in Somers. Regular hours are Tuesday through Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M. The show will remain on view through Sept. 2. Call 277-3461 for more information. 'LITTLE TOOT'</p>
        <p>An art exhibit of a more cheerful nature opens Friday and runs through Aug. 11 in Westport. Some 99 watercolors, charcoal sketches and illustrations from the "Little Toot" books, all by Hardie Gramatky, may be seen at the Westport Arts Center, 17 Morningside Drive South.</p>
        <p>The adventures of the New York City tugboat have delighted millions of children since they were first published by Putnam Publishing Group in Manhattan in 1939.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gramatky lived in Westport for 40 years until his death in 1979. His daughter Linda and his wife, Dorothea, artists in their own right, finished the last Little Toot book, called "Little Toot and the Loch Ness Monster," working from notes, sketches and a rough manuscript that he left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gramatky's facility with cartooning was developed at the Walt Disney studios in California during the Depression.</p>
        <p>Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday, noon to 4:30 P.M. A reception will be held from 6 to 8 P.M. Friday. Call 203-226-1806 for more information. TALES AND TOURS</p>
        <p>"Tall Tales, Short Tales," a program of live storytelling from around the world, will be offered from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. today at Sunnyside, Washington Irving's Tarrytown home.</p>
        <p>Visitors will sit outdoors under shade trees overlooking the Hudson River while a stream of stories and puppetry flows. Marianne McShane will retell folk tales of Ireland; African and African-American stories will be told by Joyce Gilliam Brown, and the old Dutch legends of the Hudson Valley that Washington Irving made immortal in his books will be told by Jonathan Kruk. Among other cultures to be explored through stories are those of the Caribbean, told in Spanish and English, and of the Iroquois and Aztec.</p>
        <p>A Punch and Judy show and a shadow puppet show, tours of Irving's house led by costumed guides, and picnicking on the grounds complete the day's agenda.</p>
        <p>Admission is $6 for adults, $5 for the elderly, $3 for children and free for children under 6 years of age. Sunnyside is just off Route 9, one mile south of the Tappan Zee Bridge on West Sunnyside Lane. Call 631-8200 for more information. JOY OF PAINTING</p>
        <p>Michael Teator, a Manhattan art instructor and member of the staff of "The Joy of Painting" on public television stations, will conduct a nature painting class from 1 to 4 P.M. today at Lenoir Preserve on Dudley Street, off North Broadway in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>While the television show features a wet-on-wet technique in which Mr. Teator is an expert, he is also a traditional painter. His focus will be on the basics of nature painting, using scenes at the preserve as subjects.</p>
        <p>Each student will finish a painting in the three hours. The fee is $25 and includes all materials. Call 968-5851 for reservations or more information. 'WEST SIDE STORY'</p>
        <p>A production of "West Side Story" with a cast of 28 and an 18-piece orchestra will have five performances at the Yorktown Performing Arts Theater. The curtain goes up at 3 P.M. today and at 8 P.M. Friday, Saturday, July 26 and 27.</p>
        <p>Presented by the Yorktown Theater Company, it is one of five musicals staged annually for the last seven years at the theater by the same resident company, with a core of about 15 actors, dancers and singers from Manhattan and Westchester.</p>
        <p>Kevin Kearins is the permanent director. Sarah Downs has the role of Maria and Philip Peterson plays Tony. Sets, costumes, choreography and staging are based on the original Broadway production.</p>
        <p>The theater is in the annex of a former elementary school that has been restored as a community center at 1974 Commerce Street. It seats 573 and is air-conditioned. Tickets are $18 and $15 for adults, $13 for children and the elderly. Call 962-0601 for reservations.</p>
