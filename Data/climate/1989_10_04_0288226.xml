        <p>LEAD: Poll after poll has shown that Americans want cleaner air and will pay for it. Year after year, a Congress paralyzed by sloth and industry pressure has refused to grant that wish.

        <p>Poll after poll has shown that Americans want cleaner air and will pay for it. Year after year, a Congress paralyzed by sloth and industry pressure has refused to grant that wish. On Monday, however, a House subcommittee agreed to stringent new controls on automobile pollution. That agreement doesn't end the legislative struggle. But given the subcommittee's history of strife, it's a giant step forward - and a fine example of political maturity for the rest of Congress.</p>
        <p>A compromise on automobile emissions was crucial to the success of the rest of President Bush's proposal to overhaul the antiquated Clean Air Act of 1970. The Bush plan, a major departure from years of White House indifference, addresses three big problems: acid rain, airborne toxic chemicals and ozone, the main component of the urban smog now choking more than 85 American cities. Nearly half the nation's ozone is caused by emissions from automobiles and trucks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush called for a 40 percent reduction in these emissions. Henry Waxman, the subcommittee chairman and a courageous voice for cleaner air for more than a decade, thought the Bush proposal too soft; John Dingell, long a spokesman for the automobile industry, thought it too harsh.</p>
        <p>In the end the two Democrats agreed on language that would require emission reductions of up to 60 percent beginning in the model year 1994 - a standard that California has already decided to adopt by 1993. Eventually the bill would also require automobile pollution equipment to last for 100,000 miles instead of 50,000 as now required - a provision hotly opposed by the automobile industry because the loftier standards would increase the threat of expensive recalls.</p>
        <p>The compromise is much closer to Mr. Waxman's position than Mr. Bush's or Mr. Dingell's. But all three deserve credit: Mr. Bush for getting the ball rolling; Mr. Waxman for his perseverance and for agreeing to settle for less than absolute perfection; Mr. Dingell for at last listening to the voices of public impatience that even the auto industry seems to be hearing. Not the least of those voices was the decision by New York and seven other Northeastern states this summer to adopt the California standards unless Congress moved first.</p>
        <p>There are many more hurdles. The subcommittee has yet to agree on acid rain, toxic chemicals and alternative fuels. And the battle has barely begun in the Senate. But the fact that two longtime adversaries like Mr. Dingell and Mr. Waxman were able to shake hands should suggest to the rest of Congress which way the wind is blowing.</p>
