        <p>THE word ''environmentalist'' does not roll easily out of Roger Ullman's mouth. He enunciates each syllable. It is a pleasant if unfamiliar way to define himself. When he says it, even for the second or third time, he sounds a little like a young contestant in a spelling bee.</p>
        <p>''I am still trying to get used to it,'' he acknowledges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman, 42, with a degree from the Harvard Business School and a career spent in international investment banking, including many years as a banker in the developing world, left his job as a managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch last year.</p>
        <p>He began work, at a much reduced salary, for the recently created New York chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs, also known as E2, a small nationwide environmental group made up of about 400 business executives. The group, begun about three years ago in Silicon Valley by Bob Epstein, who co-founded the database company Sybase Inc. and two other start-ups, is part of a growing movement by executives who combine a love of finance and business with environmental concerns. And, with skills and connections that many environmentalists may lack, they are producing results.</p>
        <p>''My credo is that economic progress and environmental progress are desirable, possible and not mutually exclusive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This environmental movement works on the other side of the barricades. Its members, like Mr. Ullman, enjoy the world of finance and deals along with the perks of power and privilege. But they also believe that the refusal of many in government to confront the nation's looming environmental crisis -- Mr. Ullman fires off a series of alarming statistics about rising water levels and air pollutants -- will soon wreak havoc with the lives of many Americans.</p>
        <p>They have helped push through tougher auto emission standards in California. The New York chapter of E2, with about 50 members, is supporting a similar bill in New York State, and has begun lobbying lawmakers in Albany to reduce carbon monoxide emissions.</p>
        <p>The group wants environmental groups to begin to think in business terms, including founding companies that promote environmental activism.</p>
        <p>''We have high dues, which go to the Natural Resources Defense Council,'' Mr. Ullman said, speaking of the environmental organization based in New York that is collaborating with E2. ''Members must donate at least $1,000 a year. We educate people at a very high level. The typical E2 member is steeped in the business world. He likes the business world. He has achieved success, and he believes in the environment.''</p>
        <p>But the group's biggest asset is not money, but influence. Members, who often have the clout to get legislators and political leaders on the phone, are asked to devote 10 minutes a month to sending letters or making calls in support of new legislation. The group also organizes lunches, teleconferences and ''eco salons,'' or seminars to learn about environmental issues. They have guest speakers. Members of the New York chapter will have lunch today with Carol Browner, who was chief of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, at the private Century Club in Manhattan. They usually get about 40 people.</p>
        <p>''E2 gives a voice to people like that,'' he said. ''It is also an opportunity for networking, and what business person does not like a networking opportunity? We will make you an effective environmental advocate in 10 minutes a month or less.''</p>
        <p>The language of business is especially important, Mr. Ullman argues, during the Bush administration, which seems to put a premium on business methods and an M.B.A. style of governing. And the group believes that it has tapped into an appreciation of the importance of philanthropy among many entrepreneurs.</p>
        <p>''There are millions in corporate America who want to leave something good for their children,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman, a reserved man who can seem almost shy, grew up in California, where, he says, he spent much of his childhood in the outdoors. He is the son of immigrants. His father, an engineer, is Czech. His mother is Swiss. He lives in Greenwich Village with his wife, Renata Schiavo, and their 4-year-old daughter. He also works for the Rain Forest Alliance, which also uses capital to support environmental causes. And at the slower pace of his current work, ''I have gotten to know the playgrounds in Lower Manhattan very well.''</p>
        <p>HE is careful not to go after large companies other environmentalists excoriate, and he picks his words carefully when describing the role of huge corporations in environmental disasters, especially in the developing world. He used the word ''mistake,'' for example, to describe the gas leak at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, that caused thousands of deaths. It is not a topic he wants to go into.</p>
        <p>''We focus on the environment in this country,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ullman, like many in the group, including its founder, has the financial freedom to pursue activism. ''I work within the system, where I can have the most impact,'' he said. ''I work with companies and individuals that run companies. And I get to be with like-minded people.''</p>
