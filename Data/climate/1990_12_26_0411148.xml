        <p>A decade after Congress granted the first tax incentives for drillers to gather natural gas from coal deposits, a small group of energy companies finds itself in a booming, subsidized and profitable business.</p>
        <p>By some estimates, more than 500 billion cubic feet of natural gas recovered from coal deposits -- known as coalbed methane -- will flow into pipelines in 1990. That means coalbed methane will amount to 3 percent of the natural gas that analysts expect will be consumed across the continental United States this year. Five years ago, coalbed methane contributed only 10 billion cubic feet.</p>
        <p>Further increases in production are widely expected. Many analysts say discoveries announced in the last five years are enough to meet all of the nation's natural gas consumption for more than four years. And analysts say rising production of coalbed methane should keep natural gas prices from rising substantially for several years.</p>
        <p>Improvements in the drilling technique have played an important role in developing coalbed methane as a reliable and clean energy source. The new technique loosens the coal deposit freeing the methane in such a way that it flows more easily around the well bore.</p>
        <p>But most analysts say these advances would not have been made without the financial aid from Congress.</p>
        <p>"This is one of those examples of where a Government tax-incentive program worked extremely well," said John H. Wood, head of the proved reserves program for the United States Energy Information Administration. "Production is growing very rapidly."</p>
        <p>Methane, like coal, is formed from decaying plant matter that has been tightly packed under extreme pressures for millions of years.  Global Warming</p>
        <p>Energy companies have known since the 1920's that coal layers contain methane, often in large concentrations. Indeed, exploding concentrations of underground methane have killed thousands of miners. The Federal Bureau of Mines estimates that 300 billion cubic feet of methane escapes from underground coal mines each year, contributing to global warming.</p>
        <p>Until the more productive method was developed in recent years, high costs discouraged energy companies from trying to capture methane from the coalbeds.</p>
        <p>Amoco Inc. drilled the first successful methane-recovery well in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado in 1977.</p>
        <p>Amoco used essentially the same drilling technology in its coalbed wells through most of the 1980's as it did in its oil and gas wells. Drill bits carved a well to the lowest depth of the coal seam. A pipe was lowered to the bottom of the well and concrete was forced out the bottom of the pipe until it rose up to the surface between the pipe and wall of the well. This formed an outer casing or shell to protect the pipe and prevent mud, gases and coal from seeping into groundwater supplies.</p>
        <p>Small bullets were then shot through the steel pipe and concrete that lay within the coal seam to create holes through which the methane could flow into the well. Next, a mixture of sand and water was pumped under heavy pressure from the surface into the well to further loosen the coal and get the methane flowing more rapidly into the well. Stress-Cavity Technique</p>
        <p>Since 1988, most drillers have used a newly developed method, called the stress-cavity technique, that dramatically accelerates the methane flow rate by exposing more coal to the well bore. The steel and concrete shaft stop short of the coalbed and do not go through it as is the case with the older method. Water and natural gas are pumped alternately from the surface directly onto the coal, carving a huge hole as chunks of coal are flushed back to the surface through the narrow drill pipe. Afterward, a liner pipe is placed at the base of the well to prevent more coal from being sucked in as methane is released from the coalbed. The methane flows through holes drilled in the liner pipe.</p>
        <p>The Devon Energy Corporation, based in Oklahoma City, said it drilled 10 wells this year using the stress-cavity technique near the sites of wells drilled with the older method. J. Michael Lacey, vice president of operations and exploration at Devon, said the payoff was production of 92.8 million cubic feet a day for the new wells compared with five million cubic feet a day at the older ones.</p>
        <p>Drilling costs for both types of methane wells, which average $400,000 a well in the San Juan Basin, are only a part of total development expenses. Additional wells must be drilled, often to depths of 8,000 feet or more, to flush salt-heavy water produced from the coalbed back underground.</p>
        <p>Sources of drinking water no deeper than 400 feet have been badly polluted by water pumped from coalbeds and released at the surface. Local officials filed environmental lawsuits in Alabama this year over water handling procedures at several drilling sites in the Black Warrior basin, delaying drilling programs there. For this reason, ARCO, for one, halted its drilling program at 25 wells instead of completing the 100 wells it had planned.</p>
        <p>Field stations are required to separate the water and methane that flow from the coal layer, as well as remove carbon dioxide from the methane. Pipeline companies limit carbon dioxide to 1 percent of a total natural-gas shipment because the molecule corrodes pipe. Before treatment, carbon dioxide levels in coalbed methane are as high as 15 percent. Pipelines for gathering the methane and connecting to lines operated by pipeline companies are another big expense.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, the drilling advances as well as the $3 billion invested in coalbed methane wells and related equipment would not have occurred without the special tax credit Congress approved in the 1980 Fuel Use Act. The credit amounts to a reduction in taxes on income from sales of coalbed methane. Congress recently estimated that the credit is worth $600 million for the years 1991 and 1992 combined.</p>
        <p>Producers said the credit gave them the financial cushion to experiment and develop the technology for mining the coal gas. The credit was set to expire at the end of this year, but a two-year extension for all coalbed methane wells was included in the latest budget.</p>
        <p>Before that extension, most analysts and producers anticipated a sharp decline in drilling in 1991 for coalbed methane. A resurgence is now expected in 1992.</p>
        <p>"A lot of small companies now realize they have another two years" to organize and finance drilling programs, said G. Warfield Hobbs, a former Texaco geologist who specializes in the economics and financing of coalbed methane production. "It's going to grow exponentially."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs, managing partner of Ammonite Resources in New Canaan, Conn., estimated that 2,400 wells have been drilled for coalbed methane this year, or more than one-third of all natural gas wells drilled in the United States, at a cost of more than $1 billion. He said the amount of methane production should reach a trillion cubic feet a year, or double this year's rate, within a few years.</p>
        <p>John E. Olsen, a natural gas analyst with the First Boston Corporation in Houston, said the effect of the tax credit for producers was that the break-even price of coalbed methane was 25 cents a thousand cubic feet, well below the approximately $2 a thousand cubic feet that buyers are paying at this time of year. (Coalbed methane sells for slightly less than other forms of natural gas.) And for the year, Mr. Olsen said, the tax incentive amounted to an after-tax benefit of $1.26 for every thousand cubic feet.</p>
        <p>Among the major energy companies, Amoco, ARCO and Conoco had the most output from the two largest areas of coalbed methane production. All three were active in the San Juan Basin, and ARCO and Amoco had smaller drilling programs in the Black Warrior Basin.</p>
        <p>Meridian Oil, a Houston-based unit of Burlington Resources, was one of the largest drillers in New Mexico. Smaller independents such as Devon Energy, Taurus Exploration, McKenzie Methane and Energen also were active in coalbed methane this year.</p>
        <p>Many natural gas producers drilling in locations far removed from promising coalbed methane sites opposed the tax-credit extension. They blamed the subsidy for depressing market prices as more coalbed methane was produced, and fear the situation will worsen. Supporters of the subsidy countered that they shoulder the risk of huge losses if their coalbed projects yield little methane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hobbs said rising coalbed methane output, as well as new natural gas supplies coming on-line in the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and in the Mobile Bay field off Alabama, should keep natural gas prices from rising substantially for several years. Cutting Prices</p>
        <p>Domestic producers have already lured some California customers away from Canadian producers by cutting prices on shipments that include large amounts of coalbed methane, Mr. Hobbs said. Canadian producers delivered 1.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to American customers last year, and many are concerned they will lose market share in California to marketers of coalbed methane from the San Juan Basin.</p>
        <p>The American Gas Association, a trade group in Washington, estimates probable reserves of coalbed methane at 90 trillion cubic feet. The trade group estimates total probable reserves of all forms of natural gas in the United States at 796 trillion cubic feet. The United States consumed 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas last year.</p>
        <p>"Most people agree that this is a large resource," said Dr. Wood of the Energy Information Administration. "It's a matter of whether it's economical to get it out of the ground. That in large part is dependent right now on the tax credit."  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
