        <p>LEAD: The gas turbine, which has been called the ''neglected stepsister'' of electricity-generating equipment, is becoming the utility industry's main hope for the next decade.</p>
        <p>The gas turbine, which has been called the ''neglected stepsister'' of electricity-generating equipment, is becoming the utility industry's main hope for the next decade.</p>
        <p>Because of improvements in design and materials, gas turbines, which have traditionally gulped premium fuel in large amounts, are now among the most efficient of electricity-generating technologies. The latest models produce more energy per unit of fuel than typical utility boilers. And just around the corner, experts say, are improvements that will let them overcome a voracious appetite for costly natural gas and light fuel oil to run instead on cheaper, lower-quality fuels like coal, agricultural waste and even sewage sludge, with very small emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>
        <p>And if the fuel is wood from forests that are replanted, the technology does not contribute to the accumulation of ''greenhouse'' gases that are thought to cause global warming, because the new trees will absorb the amount of carbon dioxide released in the burning of the trees that came before them. If agricultural waste or sludge is used, electricity can be obtained from wastes that would have produced carbon dioxide anyway as they decay.</p>
        <p>But gas turbines are being snapped up by electric companies mostly for another reason. Electricity demand is growing by fits and starts, making it risky to build the huge generating stations that were common in the 1960's and 70's. Gas turbines can be installed on relatively short notice in sizes that are the electric company's version of the single-serving convenience pack. ''The nature of the technology lends itself very well to the current situation of the industry,'' said Robert C. Porter, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, which is backing research on making fuel for gas turbines.</p>
        <p>'What Everyone's Doing'</p>
        <p>Liz Hannon, president of the Utility Data Institute, a Washington information company, said, ''This is what everyone's doing to cut lead time.'' Her company calculates that of the 40,000 megawatts of electric capacity scheduled to come into service in this decade, 27 percent will be from gas turbines or combination gas and steam turbines, up sharply from earlier years.</p>
        <p>General Electric, Asea Brown Boveri and Kraftwerk are the major producers of large gas turbines.</p>
        <p>A turbine is essentially the opposite of a propeller, using its blades to capture the energy of passing steam or gases to spin a shaft, which turns a generator and makes electricity. Most gas turbines are fueled with natural gas, but many run on fuel oil when gas is in peak demand, and can operate on anything that provides a clean gas.</p>
        <p>Gas turbines are not the norm; most utility turbines run on steam, which is made by burning natural gas, oil or coal in a boiler, or by splitting uranium in a nuclear reactor.</p>
        <p>Steam-turbine plants have a thermal efficiency of about 33 percent; that is, they capture and convert to electricity about one-third of the energy value in their fuel. Older gas turbines have a thermal efficiency of only about 25 percent. That means that a quantity of gas that would produce four kilowatt-hours when run through a boiler to drive a steam-turbine plant will give only three in a gas-turbine plant. Cheap to build but expensive to run, the gas-turbine plants have been used mostly as ''peaking'' plants to meet demand on the hottest or coldest days of the year when steam-turbine plants cannot.</p>
        <p>Raising Efficiency</p>
        <p>But the Pentagon and the airlines have been steadily pushing gas-turbine technology, building jet engines that run at higher temperatures and pressures and thus at higher efficiency. As those engines are adapted for use in generating electricity, engineers have achieved efficiencies of 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Some turbines adapted from aircraft reach such levels through the gas turbine itself. Some larger industrial turbines do this in a ''combined cycle'' mode, using the exhaust gases from the turbine to boil water into steam, which is then used in a steam turbine. So the fuel that gave four kilowatt-hours in a conventional steam-turbine plant now gives five in the gas-turbine or gas-steam plant.</p>
        <p>Another variation is to boil water with the exhaust gases and inject some of the steam back into the gas turbine, so it is running on a combination of gases and steam. The largest of these steam-injection gas turbines, derived from the jet engine used in the Boeing 747, the DC-10 Series 30 and the Airbus 300, runs at 40 percent efficiency when operated at peak power, 51 megawatts, said Robert H. Williams, a senior research scientist at Princeton University's Center for Energy and Environmental Studies.</p>
        <p>Cost Reduced Sharply</p>
        <p>That is one-twentieth the size of a large nuclear plant, and roughly one-tenth the capital cost per kilowatt of capacity. The steam-injected turbine costs about $30 million, or $600 per kilowatt; nuclear plants like Seabrook and Shoreham cost more than $5,000 per kilowatt.</p>
        <p>The next step, Mr. Williams said, is a steam-injected turbine with a specially cooled compressor, which could allow operation at yet higher temperatures. A model with 47 percent thermal efficiency could be commercialized in three to five years, he said, and may indeed be developed because combustion under those circumstances produces very little nitrogen oxide, a major pollutant.</p>
        <p>Some utility executives are wary, however, after the experience of the 70's and 80's, in which fuel oil varied widely in price and was sometimes unavailable, and natural gas use was curtailed because of fears that supplies were dwindling. Utilities do not like investing in long-lived plants that run on a fuel that may be unavailable in a few years. Coal, while it presents environmental problems, is likely to stay cheap and plentiful.</p>
        <p>Ubiquitous Combustible Gases</p>
        <p>But engineers know that almost any hydrocarbon material, if properly treated, will give off combustible gases that can be used in a turbine. From 1984 to 1989, Mr. Porter's department subsidized operation of a coal gasification plant in Daggett, Calif. Coal there was mixed with steam at high temperature, producing carbon monoxide and hydrogen.</p>
        <p>The plant converted 1,000 tons of coal a day and produced 120 megawatts of electricity, at a price that its owner, Texaco Inc., says is competitive with other clean-coal technologies. But Texaco would like to reopen the plant, using a mixture of coal, which is cheap, and sewage sludge, which is better than free; municipalities will pay to have it hauled away.</p>
        <p>The bane of coal is sulfur, a main cause of acid rain, and removing it from boiler smoke in conventional plants is expensive. But removing the sulfur, in the form of hydrogen sulfide, before the gas was burned proved much easier, in part because the volume of gas was smaller.</p>
        <p>The coal gasification process has a 95 to 99 percent reduction in sulfur compared with a plant with no scrubbers; a moderate increase in kilowatt-hours produced per ton of coal, and a capital cost of $1,100 to $1,300 per kilowatt.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy thinks it is roughly comparable to a conventional coal plant with scrubbers, and will gain broad acceptance if rising natural gas prices jump or increased environmental regulation makes it advisable. Even now, however, expectation of the technology is making owners of gas turbines believe their plants have a life beyond natural gas and oil.</p>
        <p>But coal is not the ultimate fuel. Mr. Williams said that for the long term the turbines should run on gasified wood or agricultural wastes. With turbines of relatively modest size, he said, fuel requirements could be met within a relatively small area, cutting transportation costs of bulky fuel. And in the third world, where electric demand is increasing, the technology would use native fuel.</p>
