        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Shoreham Syndrome'' (editorial, May 13) makes an excellent economic argument in castigating Gov. Mario Cuomo and other New York politicians for their shortsighted folly in proposing to cut, in your words, ''a preposterous deal'' that involves shutting down the ready-to-run Shoreham nuclear-power plant on Long Island.</p>
        <p>But your argument doesn't go far enough. The world faces not only a sharp rise in oil prices one of these days, but also a whole phalanx of potentially far more serious environmental disasters. Of greatest concern perhaps are the serious effects of acid rain and the even more damaging long-term prospect that sharp increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide will raise the earth's temperature significantly. Both these effects -and, to a lesser degree, the depletion of upper-atmospheric ozone - are the direct consequence of burning carbon-based fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.</p>
        <p>What can we do? It is not yet economically possible to stop using carbon-based fuels; they are the foundation of our modern world. But we must begin the long-term transition from such fuels to energy sources that do not deposit carbon compounds or oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Today there is only one such large-scale source: nuclear-fission power, along with minimal contributions from ''renewable'' sources, such as hydroelectricity (which is limited by natural geographical features) and solar energy.</p>
        <p>Clearly, we need to increase our efforts to develop new non-hydrocarbon-fuel sources, such as nuclear fusion, which has yet to demonstrate its feasibility, and photovoltaic (solar-cell) power, which has yet to prove its economic viability for large-scale use. But it is indeed sheer folly, as you say, to destroy what remains of public and financial-market confidence in nuclear-fission power - our only large-scale hedge against environmental disaster.</p>
        <p>Nuclear power does carry its own set of environmental concerns, as does virtually every technology in today's densely populated world. But the long-term effects of those concerns pale before the prospect that the home of humanity might someday become a roiling 900-degree carbon dioxide inferno like our sister planet Venus.  Jerry GREY  Washington, May 16, 1988</p>
