        <p>LEAD: IT'S tough to be a monument in New York City.</p>
        <p>IT'S tough to be a monument in New York City.</p>
        <p>Acid rain and toxic fumes from motor vehicles and factories gnaw at bronze and pepper sleek marble into a spongy-looking mass. Vandals with paint cans move in on the remains.</p>
        <p>In March 1987 the Municipal Art Society, in cooperation with the city's Art Commission and Parks and Recreation Department, suggested that the most needy monuments be put up for public adoption.</p>
        <p>Twenty were chosen, and private donors were invited to repair and maintain them. Within eight months, 13 monuments had been adopted.</p>
        <p>Since then three more have been adopted, and volunteers are caring for two others that were not part of the original 20, reports Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern.</p>
        <p>That leaves four orphans: the Heinrich Heine Fountain in the Bronx; the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Hillside, Queens; the William Jenkins Worth Monument in Manhattan, and the Clarence T. Barrett Memorial on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>It will take big hearts and big pocketbooks to adopt the Heine and Worth monuments - $275,000 and $150,000, respectively, just for refurbishing. The estimate for the Queens monument is $17,000, and for the one on Staten Island, $5,850.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the city's adoption program, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco, have started similar efforts, says Paul Gunther, director of development for the art society.</p>
