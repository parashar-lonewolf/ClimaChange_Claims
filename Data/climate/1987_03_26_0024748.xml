        <p>LEAD: A review by outside experts has led scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to back away from their recent prediction that 300 more lakes in the Northeast could become acidified in the next 50 years. The agency cited the great uncertainty surrounding the estimates.</p>
        <p>A review by outside experts has led scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to back away from their recent prediction that 300 more lakes in the Northeast could become acidified in the next 50 years. The agency cited the great uncertainty surrounding the estimates.</p>
        <p>Courtney Riordan, director of the E.P.A.'s acid rain research, said today that the review last week at the agency's laboratory in Corvallis, Ore., led to a consensus that acid rain would not acidify a total of ''more than a few hundred'' lakes in the Northeast. He said zero could not be excluded. The agency estimates that 326 lakes in the area are already acidic.</p>
        <p>Lakes vary in their ability to sustain aquatic life as they become acidic, but at the point they become acidified all fish life would be gone from the lake.</p>
        <p>The prediction of damage to 300 lakes, made in an unreleased staff paper described by officials two weeks ago, had been seen as backing those groups that believe action is needed to reduce the air pollution that causes acid rain. The Reagan Administration has argued that not enough is known to embark on a control program.</p>
        <p>Two problems explored in the Oregon review make the prediction invalid, Mr. Riordan said. The first is the wide uncertainty in current lake chemistry and information about the deposits of acidic materials. The second is inadequate understanding of the current chemical measurements.</p>
