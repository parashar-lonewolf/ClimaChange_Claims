        <p>LEAD: E.O. Wilson doesn't make a lot of headway hiking through the Panamanian rain forest. Invertebrates distract him. He stops to poke. A wasp is acting strangely - he must see why. A bee clamps its mandibles onto his hand - no problem. He'll just observe it for a while. He snaps off epiphytes - plants that grow in the lower forest canopy - looking for nesting ants.</p>
        <p>E.O. Wilson doesn't make a lot of headway hiking through the Panamanian rain forest. Invertebrates distract him. He stops to poke. A wasp is acting strangely - he must see why. A bee clamps its mandibles onto his hand - no problem. He'll just observe it for a while. He snaps off epiphytes - plants that grow in the lower forest canopy - looking for nesting ants. With a chisel he chips off some bark and discovers an embiopteran web spinner. ''That's not too common,'' he says, impressed.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes into his hike, Wilson - the steely-haired, 61-year-old Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard, curator in entomology of its Museum of Comparative Zoology, controversial father of sociobiology, the world's leading authority on ants - sits down in the mud. He leans casually against a tree, oblivious to the possibility of disturbing a dread Paraponera clavata, a giant ant with a giant sting, and dumps a vacuum aspirator full of dirt and tiny Adelomyrmex ants onto his lap. After a 15-minute search he takes out a pair of tweezers and deposits a worker ant in a tiny vial of alcohol. He pockets the specimen and stands up, but he's not yet ready to turn for home.</p>
        <p>''I want to set foot on the Wheeler trail,'' says Wilson, referring to the path named for his academic predecessor, the entomologist William Morton Wheeler. Wilson is acutely conscious of his place in the evolution of his department, and ordinarily is reverent of the men who shaped him, but his success with the Adelomyrmex and the prospect of more riches ahead have leavened his usual sobriety. ''I don't see what the big deal is,'' he continues. ''The guy wasn't that good. Well, it helps to be dead.'' He brushes off his pants and laughs at his little joke, perhaps wondering if they'll name a path after him.</p>
        <p>Wilson has come to Barro Colorado Island, a tropical rain forest in the middle of Panama's Gatun Lake, to collect Pheidole, the largest ant genus in the world. He and his students at Harvard are in the process of ''describing,'' or documenting the physical characteristics of, some 300 new Pheidole species.</p>
        <p>The Barro Colorado Nature Monument on Barro Colorado Island is the most-studied tropical rain forest of its size. The Panamanian government established it as a nature reserve in 1923, and the Smithsonian has operated it as a research station since 1946. A walk through the forest shows the large, green hand of Biology omnipresent. Nets stand under giant trees to collect leaf litter; gauze covers fruits and flowers for pollination studies; metal tags mark each tree in a 123-acre plot. A sign in a lab announces a $10 reward for anyone who can produce the corpse of a howler monkey (the population has been recently stricken by disease).</p>
        <p>The island is the kind of place where youthful, chigger-bitten researchers in earnest conversation will suddenly snatch at the air, their interest caught by a passing moth, bee or Hemiptera, an insect order whose members are properly known as ''bugs.''. In the mess hall, a plant physiologist nudges a beetle into a vial. ''Oooh, where'd you get that?'' a bat researcher asks. ''On the cake,'' he answers, and they both smile. ''My beetle friend in Peru is going to love it.''</p>
        <p>The profusion of animal and vegetable life on the island makes a convenient text for Wilson, who will wind up his trip to Panama by preaching the gospel of biological diversity to an audience of his peers at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City. This venture into public speaking marks a new phase in Wilson's career. One of the first and most prominent scientists to document the ''biodiversity crisis'' - the global decline in habitat that leads to the extinction of plant and animal species - he now brings his message to anyone who will listen. The role of planetary defender has been thrust upon him, but he performs it with passion. As Wilson sees it, the Earth's time is running out. He is, he says, like an art curator watching the Louvre burn down.</p>
        <p>No matter the shape or direction of Wilson's career, his muse has always been the ant. ''The ants gave me everything,'' he has written, ''and to them I will always return, like a shaman reconsecrating the tribal totem.'' He brings ant colonies to his home in Lexington, Mass.; he still studies them in his backyard. Ants dominate his office, in the annex to Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. In large plastic tubs on slate counters, hundreds of thousands of Pheidole from Costa Rica, Barro Colorado Island and Peru nest in test tubes and forage for dead crickets. On the walls hang classical black-and-white photographs of Harvard's famed entomologists.</p>
        <p>Down the hall in the laboratories of the museum, home to a million ant specimens, Wilson throws open the doors to a ceiling-high steel cabinet and announces, not unlike a salesman in Better Suits, ''The Pheidole Collection.'' Inside are stacks of drawers holding rows of straight pins, each supporting two or three different castes of ants glued to cardboard triangles. From a plastic tub near his desk, Wilson extracts a living leafcutter queen the size of a bumble bee. (''That's a beautiful ant,'' he says.) He had high hopes for one battle-ax of a matriarch, who, if she reached the record-breaking age of 18 years (about double the average), he and his students planned to honor with a bottle of champagne. Alas, she succumbed two years ago, five years shy.</p>
        <p>Forty years of devotion to the ant reached their culmination in March, when Wilson published ''The Ants,'' the most complete work ever written on the subject - a profusely, sometimes frighteningly illustrated, 732-page volume dedicated to the world's most underrated species. Wilson and his co-author, Bert Holldobler, the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard, intended the book as a guide and inspiration to future myrmecologists - ant scientists. Accordingly, ''The Ants'' contains keys to 11 ant subfamilies and 292 currently recognized genera, plus every ant fact known to man. But the book's clarity of style and literary tone helped it onto the front page of The Los Angeles Times Book Review; it got Wilson on ''Good Morning America,'' the ''Today'' show and National Public Radio's ''Morning Edition.''</p>
        <p>For Wilson and Holldobler, ants are ''the little creatures who run the world.'' Ants, they write, ''represent the culmination of insect evolution, in the same sense that human beings represent the summit of vertebrate evolution.'' Ants have been evolving 100 million years longer than humans, and it shows. Because all the ants in a colony are closely related - they have the same queen as a mother - they tend to act in the interest of the whole. Ants are altruistic: with chemical signals secreted from sacs, they share information (where to find food or the enemy, which ants to feed). Some ants store food in giant, expanding stomachs to be regurgitated to others in times of need. Self-sacrificing ants explode in the face of an enemy, covering it with poison from a long gland that also summons recruits to battle, usually the oldest soldiers (younger ants are left behind to care for families).</p>
        <p>Ants cooperate. Ants of the genus Atta bring leaf segments to the nest, where smaller ants masticate them, then set the pulp down; on this spongy bed, even smaller ants cultivate a fungus that feeds the colony. (A typical colony of two million workers collects more vegetation each day than the average cow.) Weaver ants bend leaves into nests, making living chains of their bodies to pull and hold leaf edges together until they can be glued with the secreted silk of larvae, which are held gently in the mandibles of the workers like glue guns. Some ants care for the young of other species, such as aphids or mealybugs, in their own nests, then herd or carry the mature insects from one feeding site to another; in return they take the nourishing droplets of sugary fluid passed as excrement through their wards' bodies.</p>
        <p>Ants may have brains the size of pinpoints, but they've evolved an ability to communicate and carry out complex tasks, mostly by dividing the labor among various castes (foragers, soldiers, groomers, fungus gardeners, and so on). Wilson calls ant colonies superorganisms, larger than the sum of their parts, because evolution has worked on colonies as if they were single organisms, ''made up not of individual animals but of genetically similar cells.'' Indeed, colonies can in some ways be compared to the human body: ants that specialize in carrying food or messages play the part of circulatory or nervous systems.</p>
        <p>Ants cooperate so well because otherwise nothing would get done. The older a colony, the more specialized the roles of the various castes, and the more interdependent the social relationships between individuals. At the colony's founding stage, a queen lays trophic, nonviable eggs for nourishment and eggs that will grow into nonreproducing workers, devoted to nest enlargement, food gathering and brood care (licking, feeding, and relocating the larvae). As the workers increase in number, more-specialized castes are added.</p>
        <p>Once the colony becomes established, the queen's attention turns entirely to reproduction. She produces small-brained males - their only function is to have sex, once, and die - and winged females capable of reproducing, known as virgin queens. As a rule, males and young queens depart the nest in a ''nuptial flight,'' leaving in sex-segregated waves (the better to avoid incest) to mate with ants from other colonies. Once inseminated, a queen snaps off her wings, burrows a nest in the ground, and converts her now useless flight muscles into tissues needed to make eggs.</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way, ants have also developed behavior familiar to anyone who works in a large, hierarchic organization. They spend a good deal of their time looking busy but not in fact doing much of anything. Despite their legendary reputation for hard work, they are known to loaf. Some species even sleep, curled up in the fetal position.</p>
        <p>Apart from the pure pleasure of dining out on ant arcana, why should we care? Wilson and Holldobler point out that ants create soil and keep it fertile - good for plants, good for vertebrates. Together with termites, they make up a third of the animal biomass - the total weight of animal life - of the Amazon rain forest. Closer to home, ants disperse the seeds of nearly a third of New York's herbaceous plant species. If the 8,800 ant species and their several million invertebrate relatives were to suddenly disappear, the physical structure of the forest would degrade. Most of the fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal populations would crash to extinction for lack of food. ''The earth would rot,'' Wilson writes. ''As dead vegetation piled up and dried out, narrowing and closing the channels of the nutrient cycles, other complex forms of vegetation would die off, and with them the last remnants of the vertebrates.''</p>
        <p>In the rain forest, however, the gloom and doom of species extinction is far from Wilson's mind. The jungle is hot, steamy, green and crawling with life, and the erudite professor - late of tweed jacket and sober tie, now resplendent in a stained Pierre Cardin short-sleeve shirt and khaki pants - is in his element. ''Paradise regained,'' he exclaimed mildly when he first stepped off the boat onto the island's leafy shores. But if there is any place earthly that fits the phrase, that place probably lies close to childhood.</p>
        <p>Edward Osborne Wilson grew up in rural, subtropical Alabama, the only child of a government accountant. His parents divorced when he was 6. Like most children, Wilson went through a bug phase, but he never grew out of his, never moved on to the larger creatures most naturalists drift toward. To use his own lingo, Wilson was preadapted for ant work. Poor hearing in the upper registers excluded birds from his study. When he was 7, he accidently jerked a fish fin into his right eye; the accident limited his ability to focus at distances but gave him exceptionally acute close-up vision in his left eye.</p>
        <p>Work required his father to move frequently, and Wilson attended 16 schools in 11 years. He had few friends, but he could amuse himself. ''Mainly what I liked was to put on rubber boots and wander the fields, following streams down through swamps,'' he says. ''I was a devoted naturalist at the age of 9. I knew this was what I wanted to be, and I can't explain that exactly.'' A bit out of the social mainstream - he struggled to make the football team's third string at a time when the game and the Baptist Church were Alabama's twin verities - Wilson always knew he was different: ''For one thing, well, I'll just say it, I was brighter.''</p>
        <p>As a boy, Wilson imagined his love of insects might some day win him a job with the Department of Agriculture, and he'd get to drive around the countryside in a green pickup truck and talk to farmers about crop pests. Instead, Wilson took his bachelor's in biology at the University of Alabama in 1949, then a master's there the following year. At the suggestion of a friend at Harvard, he wrote full-length studies of dacetine and fire ants that so impressed the Cambridge entomologists that they ushered him up to Harvard, where he earned his Ph.D. at the age of 26.</p>
        <p>''Anyone closely associated with Wilson, even from the beginning of grad school, knew he was a hot scientist,'' says Thomas Eisner, a professor of biology at Cornell University, and a friend of 39 years. ''The breadth of his knowledge - from behavioral ecology to paleontology to evolution - and the way he applied it to new areas, was overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>Wilson was also bold: he recognized early on that the dominant theories of ant behavior didn't go far enough. Many entomologists had suspected that ants were governed by chemical scents, such as nest odors, but it took Wilson to identify the source of those substances and their chemical nature. In 1959, he removed a venom gland from a fire ant, then crushed and smeared it across a glass plate. He was astonished to see worker ants pick up the chemical signal from within the nest and pour out to follow the artificial trail. Pheremone, the chemical from the sac, ''is not just a guidepost, but the entire message,'' he wrote. It told the ants where the food was, what its quality was, when to get it, how many ants should go and how fast. Wilson went on to find that ants secrete chemicals from between 10 and 20 different glands.</p>
        <p>During his next 20 years at Harvard, Wilson's fascination with the tangled processes of evolutionary biology led him around the world. He studied ants, published scores of monographs, and developed the taxon cycle - the pattern in which species adapt and multiply as they spread throughout a habitat and extend their ranges to distant parts of the world. With the late Robert D. MacArthur, of Princeton, he explored population biology from genetics to the dynamics of growth and competition. In 1967 they came up with the theory of island biogeography, a mathematical formula increasingly used by park planners and conservationists to estimate the rate at which species decline as habitat disappears. In 1971 Wilson brought together the vast and diffuse scholarship on social insects - wasps, bees, termites, and ants - in his book ''The Insect Societies,'' all the while edging closer to a synthesis of theories on animal behavior that would result in his seminal book on sociobiology.</p>
        <p>Wilson's 11 books reflect a wide-ranging intellect. They deal with subjects from the mathematics of population biology to the evolutionary reasons behind man's affinity for the natural world. (Book No. 12, ''Success and Dominance in Ecosystems,'' to be published this fall, will address biodiversity.) This year he added to his dozens of scientific awards and honors the Crafoord Prize, the ecologists' equivalent of a Nobel. ''Wilson has built a backyard venture of watching bugs into a rather impressive world view,'' says Howard Boyer, Wilson's editor at Harvard University Press.</p>
        <p>A shy man, secretive about his personal life, Wilson reluctantly assumes the spotlight. Most of his colleagues know little or nothing of him outside of work. Only after working for him 20 years did Wilson's secretary meet his wife. Wilson has no hobbies and few close friends. At the end of the day, he comes home and draws Pheidole. To use a botanist's word, the man appears hypertrophied, excessively developed in one area to the detriment of others. About what it takes to be good at his job, Wilson says: ''A capacity to absorb yourself in a group of organisms or an environment, to forget about daily life, and be away from people.'' Says Boyer: ''If I ran into him at a movie, I'd be very surprised.''</p>
        <p>Yet the biodiversity crisis has given Wilson a new public prominence. His phone rings constantly (he answers it himself): the press wants stats on rain forest destruction; a colleague wants advice on grants; a biologist congratulates him from overseas. In May he met with Prince Philip of Britain.</p>
        <p>''I don't play the eco-hero role very well,'' Wilson says of his position in the current clamor. ''I don't particularly like to be in crowds or lead groups. And I had quite enough attention from the press back in the 70's, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Wilson's brush with notoriety came in 1975, when he published ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis.'' Through 26 closely reasoned chapters he demonstrated the biological basis of social behavior in animals: how such things as dominance roles, methods of communication and control of population density evolved. So far, so good. In chapter 27, however, Wilson extended his theory to human beings - and demonized himself into history. Wilson suggested that sexual divisions of labor may be an adaptive trait, and that genetically determined traits and worldly success may have a ''loose correlation.'' Genetic imperatives, he said, not cultural upbringing, shape certain aspects of human nature.</p>
        <p>Wilson's timing was off. Marxist influence at Harvard was at its peak: when some academics, many of them associated with a group called Science for the People, read Wilson's text they smelled sexism, racism, determinism. Several students picketed his class and spread leaflets about the campus. In an angry letter to The New York Review of Books, a dozen professors, doctors and students (including Wilson's colleagues Richard C. Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould) condemned ''Sociobiology'' as providing ''a genetic justification of the status quo and of existing privileges for certain groups according to class, race or sex.'' Wilson had no evidence for the existence of genes for behavior, the group said; he based his assertions on sexually biased ethnographic data; he selectively cited supporting evidence and ignored contradictory evidence.</p>
        <p>The uproar climaxed at a 1978 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. A group of hecklers took the stage just before Wilson was to speak, and one of them read a five-minute speech denouncing him - while the subject paid most courteous attention. When the speaker concluded, ''We think you're all wet,'' another heckler picked up a carafe of ice water and emptied it onto Wilson's head.</p>
        <p>The media pounced. Scientists from the ivory tower mixing it up! High jinks! Emotions! But Wilson refused to play. He dried his head, canceled a couple of speaking engagements (the controversy was distressing his wife and daughter) and got back to work. In his next book, ''On Human Nature'' (which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979), he carefully argued that the danger of oppression lay not in soiobiological theory, but in uninformed views of man's evolution - in particular, the kind of genetic pseudo-science that led to restrictive immigration laws in this country and to the eugenic policies of Nazi Germany.</p>
        <p>Though Wilson today calls the controversy ''one of the most intense and divisive disputes in the recent history of ideas,'' he diminishes the episode's effect on his life. ''It was a small group of very angry, voluble opponents,'' he says, quietly. ''It was not evenly matched, not the battle the media made it out to be. Most scientists and sociologists were on my side.''</p>
        <p>Although Wilson's work in sociobiology won him a National Medal of Science in 1977, other academics are cautious about extrapolating his findings to human beings: to some, chapter 27 remains as controversial as ever. ''It may be taught and discussed,'' says Marcus W. Feldman, editor of The American Naturalist and a biology professor at Stanford University, ''but it's not necessarily agreed with. . . . The book has had the biggest impact on the way animal behavior is studied. Gould maintains his original position. ''There's been no more study since then, no data to prove Wilson's thesis - it's not subject to testing. How can it be?''</p>
        <p>For Wilson, the controversy is history. ''My role was to introduce evolutionary biology in human development; now the ball is rolling and it's not my field. The social insects are my true love.''</p>
        <p>The sun emerges after Barro Colorado Island's daily downpour and Wilson sets out through the steaming jungle. He says he's interested in mammals this afternoon, but after spotting a few coati-mundi and several agoutis, the call of the ants is too hard to ignore. Wilson climbs a 40-meter tower to get a close look at the forest canopy. Arboreal ants, which never touch the forest floor, are now being studied for the first time as new rope-climbing techniques, cranes and chemical fogging devices bring the canopy frontier within reach. Atop the tower, Wilson marvels nonstop at the forest's abundance. ''Get a load of that!'' he says, as a giant blue morpho, a butterfly, flops by, its wings gently stirring the sodden air. ''Isn't that outstanding?'' he asks, rapt. He eagerly shares his passion, explaining, unbidden, the territorial dogfighting of certain treetop butterflies, and the desires of stingless bees (they may be covering your face, but all they want is salt).</p>
        <p>''Why are there so many ants in the canopy?'' he asks, somewhat rhetorically, giving John E. Tobin, one of his doctoral students, an opportunity to test his myrmecology chops. Ants are generally considered predators, Tobin explains, and predators, higher on the food chain, should be much less abundant than the herbivores they feed on. But in Peru, for example, ants constitute 70 percent of the canopy's insects. Wilson and Tobin, among others, are trying to find out why.</p>
        <p>At dinner, post-docs and research fellows, botanists and bat, bee, bird and frog specialists share the day's adventures. But as the Atlas beers begin to flow, the true concern of these, our best and brightest bug jocks, comes to the fore. If their days are devoted to unraveling nature's secrets, evenings are spent sniping at molecular and cell biologists. They get so much money, and so much publicity, the conversation goes. They have such expensive machines. They hang around in troops, says Wilson, like langur monkeys. Plus, says one former student, they're no fun: ''I think only 16 percent of biochemists have a sense of humor.'' Wilson can't resist this kind of thing. ''I think it's 12 percent,'' he counters dryly.</p>
        <p>The issue truly rankles. While the Government has committed $60 billion to Big Science projects in the coming decade - to the Hubble Telescope, the gene-mapping project and the superconducting supercollider - a National Science Board task force on which Wilson served proposed a budget of only $30 million for the study of the biodiversity crisis - its economic and social causes, consequences and remedies. No wonder the assembled company fantasize about a blockbuster adventure movie starring eco-heroes, a movie that might capture the public's imagination and elevate field biologists to their proper Olympian heights. Indiana Jones in search of cancer-curing bromeliad plants, pursued by columns of Eciton burchelli - army ants - would do.</p>
        <p>More beer, some recidivism in the group, and only Wilson and two former students remain to toast the social insects and the mighty myrmecologist. ''Ant people are broader than other field biologists because ants figure in so many things,'' Wilson says. ''People talk about how plush theories of biochemistry and astronomy are. But we have a blue-collar contempt of swells, the effete, the overfunded.'' Wilson is only half kidding, but he's fully amused with himself. His shoulders hunch forward in a tiny, unconscious hug. ''Field biologists are a good deal more congenial. They have a great deal more 'gee whiz' - call it wonder. But isn't that what it's all about?''</p>
        <p>Wilson and Holldobler dedicated ''The Ants'' to the next generation of myrmecologists. But the book is more than a vade mecum; it's a response to the lack of detailed information about the thousands of species in crisis today, threatened by diminishing habitat. ''The Chinese have a saying: the beginning of wisdom is getting things by their right name,'' says Wilson. ''The point I've been making in my little crusade is that if you don't know what organisms are, you can't really figure out what's going on. Each species has these intricate life cycles; they fit together in ways that are largely unexplored and will be until we figure out the biodiversity. Biodiversity is the key to it.''</p>
        <p>Whether it's desert plants threatened by motorcycle races or the red squirrels of Arizona's Mount Graham threatened by the proposed construction of an observatory, biodiversity matters because plants and animals contain genetic material. A large gene pool provides the flexibility that natural systems need to reproduce and adapt over evolutionary time. For those who prefer to see this in human terms, Wilson points out that biodiversity is the reason man has pharmaceuticals, foods, fibers, sources of oil and ways to regenerate soil. ''To let one species go because you want to clear another mile of road,'' Wilson says heatedly, ''seems to me obscene.''</p>
        <p>With 40 to 50 million acres of tropical rain forest disappearing each year, Wilson estimates we are now losing as many as 100,000 species a year. When loggers cleared a mountaintop in Ecuador, 38 plant species exclusive to that site disappeared, forever. In most cases, there is no way of knowing what is being lost. Scientists have formally identified 1.4 million species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, but recent studies indicate there may be as many as 30 million kinds of insects alone.</p>
        <p>Wilson is nearly evangelical in spreading the word of impending catastrophe and proposing solutions. He's good at it, too. Asked what he thinks Wilson will be remembered for, Thomas E. Lovejoy, assistant secretary of internal affairs at the Smithsonian Institution and former vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, says: ''A few years ago I would have said sociobiology, but what he's doing today is critical. Wilson is one of the real leaders in evolutionary and behavioral biology. He's a wonderful spokesperson because information that's unattainable and mysterious he makes crystal clear. He really gets to people.''</p>
        <p>Wilson, like most of today's activist scientists, now focuses on economics as a prime incentive for preserving biodiversity. The greatest hope for biodiversity today, as expressed last year in a report to the National Science Foundation by 11 noted scientists, lies in giving third-world countries, which contain most of the world's tropical forests, an economic incentive to preserve their natural environments. For example, they could be encouraged to develop economies based on new forest products that would not require vast clearing of land. At least 50,000 plant species have edible parts, but man relies heavily on only about 20 of these. One plant with vast commercial potential, the winged bean of New Guinea, has been called a one-species supermarket: its roots, seeds, leaves, stems and flowers are all edible.</p>
        <p>Besides bringing economic prosperity to developing countries, Wilson argues, an intact forest system would help mitigate the greenhouse effect. Trees that aren't burned to clear land for unsustainable agriculture would convert carbon dioxide to oxygen; moreover, trees saved would reduce present levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>As for what Americans can do to save the rain forest, Wilson is typically, perhaps naively, optimistic. He believes in the political system; that with proper encouragement, elected officials will do the right thing. ''Support candidates with global environmental platforms,'' he says. He also suggests contributing money to conservation groups that target threatened habitats around the world, like Conservation International or the World Wildlife Fund, on whose board Wilson sits.</p>
        <p>In his lectures and his books, Wilson strongly encourages young biologists to consider working in systematics, the classification of biological organisms and the evaluation of their evolutionary history. How can we value these species, Wilson argues, if we can't even recognize them? To combat human overpopulation, a major reason for environmental degradation, he champions birth control, and he implores someone, anyone, to either ''convert or silence'' Carl Sagan. ''He wants to go to Mars,'' Wilson told the Smithsonian audience in Panama City. ''We haven't even landed on this planet yet. Let's put the money into research here.''</p>
        <p>The framework for preservation and recovery is already in place. Wilson and his colleagues at Harvard recently began developing a curriculum to combine biology with studies in economics, government and sociology. Harvard's new biodiversity studies program will address, says Wilson, with typical precision, ''the study of the total diversity of life: the flora and fauna of the world, where they came from, how they are maintained, and how they can be managed, preserved and put to use for human benefit.''</p>
        <p>Wilson dreams about retiring to a place like Barro Colorado and ''basking in stimuli,'' but he's got too much to do. ''We're in a make-or-break decade,'' he says. ''Now is the time when you can probably have the most influence per hour spent. If you're a scientist, you've got the ear of the media, the ear of Congressmen.''</p>
        <p>So Wilson carries on, consulting for and lecturing to disparate groups of policy makers and educators, developing his curriculum for a hybrid biological systematist-politician-economist who likes to put on rubber boots and wander the fields and streams. The vision of a teeming forest, rich in diversity and stable in its complexity, drives Wilson by day and haunts him by night.</p>
        <p>On the morning before he leaves Barro Colorado Island, Wilson tells a small gathering of his recurring nightmare: ''I'm on some fabulous tropical island like New Caledonia, and my plane's about to leave. Suddenly, I realize I haven't collected any ants. So I get back in the car and I'm driving, driving. I know there's a great forest on the northern side of the island, but I can't seem to find it. It's getting later. So IJU start looking for some trees, but all I can find are subdivisions. The land has all been developed. I can't find a single ant.''</p>
