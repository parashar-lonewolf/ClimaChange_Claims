        <p>Republican moderates are exasperated by President Bush's posture on environmental issues. They are not alone. In less than three months Mr. Bush has begun to remind people of the country's last genuinely anti-environmental president, Ronald Reagan. But where Mr. Reagan's attitude was one of careless indifference -- ''You've seen one redwood, you've seem 'em all,'' was a typical Reaganism -- Mr. Bush's retreat on isses as large as global warming and as localized as poisoned drinking water seems aggressively hostile.</p>
        <p>It could also be politically ruinous. The president says he must soften environmental rules to prevent a recession. He thus revives the historically insupportable notion that economic progress and environmental protection are incompatible. Further, Mr. Bush appears to have forgotten that Republicans inevitably self-destruct when they challenge environmental values that command public support. Newt Gingrich's hard-line agenda on everything from clean water to endangered species in the mid-1990's succeeded only in energizing the Democrats and persuading Bill Clinton to embark on the aggressive program of wilderness protection that Mr. Bush now seeks to repudiate.</p>
        <p>If there has been any unifying theme to Mr. Bush's policies, it has been his eagerness to please the oil, gas and mining industries -- indeed, extractive industries of all kinds. The oil and coal mining companies helped shape his decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol on climate change as well as his earlier reversal of a campaign pledge to impose mandatory limits on carbon dioxide. These were hasty and ill-conceived decisions that have essentially left the United States without a policy on a matter of global importance.</p>
        <p>The mining industry also had a hand in two other rollbacks. One was a decision to withdraw a Clinton rule that reduced by 80 percent the permissible standard for arsenic in drinking water. The other was a decision by Interior Secretary Gale Norton to suspend important new regulations that would require mining companies to pay for cleanups and, for the first time, give the Interior Department authority to prohibit mines that could cause ''irreparable harm'' to the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seems to be backing off his plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, in part because Congress will not support him. But other sensitive and ecologically significant areas, particularly in the Rocky Mountains, remain vulnerable. Ms. Norton has targeted some 17 million acres of land, in 11 Western states, now designated as wilderness study areas. Mr. Bush is prepared to open up the 19 national monuments created by Mr. Clinton. And the administration has signaled a retreat on Mr. Clinton's most ambition conservation measure -- a Forest Service rule protecting nearly 60 million acres of largely untouched national forest from new road building, new oil and gas leasing and most new logging.</p>
        <p>Killing that plan would represent a big victory not only for the timber companies but also for the the oil and gas industries. Although the roadless areas contain less than 1 percent of the nation's oil and gas resources, the energy companies have long had the forests in their sights. During his distinguished tenure as Mr. Clinton's Forest Service chief, Mike Dombeck managed to keep the drillers at bay. But Mr. Dombeck has now retired to private life, along with nearly every other friend of the environment from the Clinton administration. With few exceptions, they have been replaced by industry lobbyists and hard-edged advocates of development. It will be Congress's job to hold the line against them.</p>
