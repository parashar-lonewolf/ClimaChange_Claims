        <p>The cold war, gone but not lamented, had a powerful effect on America, not only on government, politics and military strategy, but also in a subtler and even contradictory way on what might be called the national psyche, the collective consciousness.</p>
        <p>Fear of the sort suggested in Sidney Lumet's "Fail Safe," a 1964 movie ending with the nuclear destruction of Moscow and New York, certainly reflected at least one element of the American mind during the cold war, and anxiety over the possibility of annihilation may be one of its permanent legacies.</p>
        <p>But the effect of the superpower conflict on the American psyche was neither uniform nor uncomplicated.</p>
        <p>Instead, it moved minds in various ways. Certainly, it affected emotions and attitudes about the United States and the world; it could inspire fear or exultation, patriotism or national self-loathing. Scholars, looking back particularly on the early years of the superpower confrontation, have seen its influences on such divergent elements of American life as the organization of the family and even the success of modern abstract painting.</p>
        <p>Even the matter of nuclear dread is full of complexity. While popular fiction over 40 years showed the threat or the effects of a nuclear holocaust, it is difficult to tell how many Americans actually spent much of their time worrying about about the danger of nuclear war. A Sense of Fragility</p>
        <p>Did the cold war permanently change the way Americans think or look at the world? For many, it gave purpose to national life, arising out of the perceived need to defend American freedom and values. For others it created powerful skepticism about America's role in the world and about the goodness and integrity of the American Government.  Even as the confrontation with the Soviet Union inspired many to patriotic fervor and a belief in American superiority, others found it alienating. These people saw the conflict as a grand and convenient excuse to blame national shortcomings on an external enemy of exaggerated importance -- not the first or last time Americans have displayed this trait. The national view of Japan right now is a vivid example.</p>
        <p>If there is a single permanent effect, it is probably in the pervasive sense of the globe's fragility, an awareness of mankind's capacity to self-destruct that has been compounded by environmental degradation and the theory of global warming. As a result of the cold war, Americans may actually be less confident that science, technology and enlightened control of nature will lead to constantly improving lives -- a belief that prevailed for much of this century.</p>
        <p>"The cold war was a major organizing principle of American life, politically and culturally and in other ways as well," said Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia University. "But that doesn't mean it cut in one direction."</p>
        <p>"On the one hand, the existence of nuclear weapons and of a clear, distinct and powerful enemy with those weapons created an undercurrent of anxiety that found its way into films, novels and presumably into ordinary life," Mr. Brinkley said. Part of that anxiety, he said, translated into "a strengthened sense of mankind's capacity for evil" and "a great skepticism about the human capacity to make wise decisions." A Boost for 'Triumphalism'</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Brinkley added, "the cold war also gave an enormous boost to American exceptionalism and triumphalism, the idea that America was carrying the banner of freedom in a world in which freedom was threatened."</p>
        <p>But however fraught with anxieties, the very predictability of the superpower confrontation provided a certain reassurance, particularly in the later years when the threat seemed less immediate. The enemy was easy to identify -- a single country run by unlikable men who seemed nonetheless to be psychologically stable and in control. In this sense the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Soviet empire could produce a new unease stemming from a more complicated, less predictable world order.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the ultimate instruments of cold war terror, nuclear weapons, are far from being eliminated. Weapons of mass destruction existed in a handful of stable countries, but now the prospect is that they will be held by a larger number of countries, not all of them stable, some of them newly created out of the Soviet Union's disintegration. New conflicts in a less predictable world could revive old nuclear anxieties. Optimism and Disillusion</p>
        <p>Certainly, it is not difficult to see the cold war's imprint on American attitudes during the various major events of the post World War II world. And in each of these events, contradictory effects blend in the collective mind -- insecurity, exaggerated self-love, polarization and bitterness in political debates, as well as the nation's tendency to swing from moods of optimism and hope to darker days of anger and disillusionment.</p>
        <p>The anti-Communist witch hunts of the McCarthy period, for example, would have been inexplicable without the fears provoked by the perceived Soviet threat. The sense that a powerful, evil and messianic force bent on world conquest was loose in the world led to a misguided search for enemies and traitors within. The paranoia was reined in, and Senator Joseph McCarthy, the most prominent figure in it all, was censured in the Senate. The McCarthy witch hunts had a disillusioning effect, however. They convinced many people that the nation had a a susceptibility to paranoia and demagoguery.</p>
        <p>The Vietnam War produced probably the most intense domestic conflict since the Civil War, but it too would have been inconceivable outside the context of superpower conflict. It ended with the most powerful episode of self-doubt, of questioning America's role in the world, that the country had ever experienced.</p>
        <p>That self-doubt, the ambivalence about America's nature, remains a part of the collective heritage even now. In particular, many who came of age during the 1960's protest years have never regained the confidence in the essential goodness of America and the American Government that prevailed in earlier periods.</p>
        <p>But the global confrontation had other implications, including the tendency to see almost every world event as part of a broad contest in which scores were always being kept -- how many countries in the United Nations, for example, voted with "us" and how many with "them. The Olympic Games moved the superpower conflict onto the playing field. Sports as National Conflict</p>
        <p>"There was a time when whatever the Soviet Union could aim at us was ominous, whether it was missiles or athletes," said Robert Hope, president of Whittle Events, a sports entertainment marketer. "At the Olympics the meanest team in the world was always there. Now, there won't be this sense of countries comparing themselves. The interest will be much more focused on individual performance."</p>
        <p>In these attitudes, some scholars have seen deep consequences for everyday life. Elaine Tyler May of the University of Minnesota, for example, has written "Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era," a book in which she argues that pervasive insecurity and the ideological contest with the Soviet Union had a major influence on the family. She argues that the traditional family with the woman as homemaker became a "glamorized, professionalized and eroticized" symbol of America's claim to a superior way of life, with its abundance of labor-saving devices, its comforts, its warm security.</p>
        <p>Another scholar, Serge Guilbaut, an art historian at the University of British Columbia and the author of "How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art," argues that the cold war changed the nature of modern art. Before the cold war, he says, national opinion tended to regard modern painting as an individualist rebellion against conformity. Shifting Views of Art</p>
        <p>After the cold war began, Mr. Guilbaut says, Americans began to warm to the notion that abstract painting embodied the freedom of the West, in contrast to the artistic controls of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the sharpest paradox of the cold war's impact comes in the mixed, ambiguous view of America that was so often revealed in literature. If optimism and a certain trust in what used to be called "the American way of life" remained strong, a countercurrent of ambivalence grew at the same time. The enormously successful spy novels of John Le Carre, for example, always depicted the cold war conflict as a grim and cruel affair in which there were few moral differences between the two sides.</p>
        <p>The contrast between many of the cold war-era thrillers and the depictions of World War II are striking in this regard. War movies like, say, "Patton" showed crusty, patriotic heroism in action. Cold war films like "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold" showed both sides locked in a deadly game in which nobody was pure and from which nobody really benefited.</p>
        <p>"The cold war was very good fodder for drama, because you had what was perceived as a clearly virtuous position against what was seen as clearly bad," said Sidney Pollack, director of "Three Days of the Condor," in which the C.I.A. is more villainous than heroic. "But then you come along and try to muddy the waters a bit to try to see an issue from both sides, and that makes good drama."</p>
