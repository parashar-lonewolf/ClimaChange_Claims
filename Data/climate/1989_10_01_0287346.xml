        <p>LEAD: Most of the discussion about preserving the ecology of our planet has focused on Earth-based solutions. These have been aimed at protecting the environment and providing energy to meet the demands of the planet's expanding population. In the near- to mid-term, these are important and valuable steps.</p>
        <p>Most of the discussion about preserving the ecology of our planet has focused on Earth-based solutions. These have been aimed at protecting the environment and providing energy to meet the demands of the planet's expanding population. In the near- to mid-term, these are important and valuable steps. But in the long term, a key to humanity's continued evolution will be the penetration of space and the economic and scientific exploitation of the solar system's inexhaustible resources and unique physical characteristics.</p>
        <p>A few months ago, President Bush outlined some challenging steps toward this goal. His proposal, made on the 20th anniversary of the first lunar landing, called for the establishment of a base on the moon to be followed by a manned mission to Mars. But unlike President John F. Kennedy's earlier proposal to go to the moon, the Bush proposal contained no timetable and no guidelines for financing. He left those issues to the National Space Council, headed by Vice President Quayle.</p>
        <p>Pursuing space missions is important, but not just for economic and scientific reasons. It is also important as a means to meet the future energy needs of this planet without creating further ecological deterioration.</p>
        <p>During the first two decades of the space age, the exploration and uses of space were conducted primarily by the United States and the Soviet Union. Now other countries have begun making long-range, multibillion-dollar plans for space exploration and exploitation. These nations, in many instances, wish to participate in international space missions and to share both in the gains and the costs.</p>
        <p>But the real key to entering space is the development of an infrastructure that can be expanded signficantly over an extended period. This infrastructure of permanently manned space stations and orbiting industrial parks will be able to support a broad spectrum of scientific investigations, technology development and commercial ventures. A prerequisite for space-based infrastructure will not only be the transportation of material and people, but also the availability of adequate electrical power.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union and Japan already have ambitious plans for generating power in space, at first for use in orbit and subsequently for use on earth. Plans for a long-term Soviet space power development program were presented at the International Astronautical Federation Congress in 1985 and were followed by statements from several leading Soviet space technologists. A recent article in a Soviet scientific journal about that nation's space program written by V.S. Aveyevsky, a Russian expert on manufacturing in space and a winner of the Lenin Prize, stated that ''the idea of satellite electric power stations generating energy for consumers in space and on the ground has grown into one of the most fundamental space research programs.''</p>
        <p>Japan's Space Activities Commission recommended in 1987 that Japan should endeavor to become an important participant in space activities by the beginning of the 21st century. The commission stated that to conduct space activities on a large scale, Japan should promote research and development into the efficient utilization of solar energy for the generation of electricity in space.</p>
        <p>The space power systems capable of capturing and converting solar energy and then beaming that energy from orbit to a receiving site in space or on earth were studied by the Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the late 1970's and early 1980's. At the time, these power systems were judged to be too expensive because of the high cost of transporting propellants, materials and space structures into orbit from earth.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Bush's recent speech, there appears to be an opportunity for the United States, and other nations, to develop a lunar base and the lunar resources necessary for large-scale projects like space-based power generating systems. The economic justification for using lunar resources instead of earth resources includes a significant reduction in transportation costs from the moon into an earth orbit, compared with launchings into orbit directly from the earth. Launching materials into an earth orbit from the moon would also alleviate the environmental impacts that would result from multiple earth launchings. THE development of space-based power systems will extend well into the next century. New systems will be needed to supply the power needs of space shuttles, free-flying platforms and space stations in high-earth orbits, and lunar bases. Development of space-based power sources, can - and should - begin with a modest test project to demonstrate the feasibility of new solar energy technologies to collect and beam power between objects in space and to the earth.</p>
        <p>A cooperative international test project for space-based power systems provides a unique opportunity to advance this technology. Such a test project could lead to further cooperative efforts among nations that expect to benefit from space-generated power. International participation could also make it easier to obtain agreements on the use of orbits and the portions of the electromagnetic spectrum necessary to transmit energy to earth from space. A test program could also lead to an international consensus on the future course of space power development.</p>
        <p>Based on activities already under way in several nations, a power generating program for space could form the basis for the development of space-based industries and support structures. An industrial infrastructure in space could help humanity meet its future energy needs without exacerbating the ecological deterioration resulting from global warming.</p>
        <p>The significance of an international test project has been recognized and recommended as part of the activities for the International Space Year in 1992. It is now time for industry in the United States, in cooperation with NASA, to take the initiative and join with other nations in this test project. The rewards for joining in this project could be as vast as space itself and ultimately could conserve the resources and ecology of the earth.</p>
