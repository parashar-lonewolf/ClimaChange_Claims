        <p>Britain, America's staunchest ally in Europe, joined in the widespread expressions of disappointment today over the American repudiation of the new International Criminal Court but said it would use its close trans-Atlantic ties to try to change Washington's attitude.</p>
        <p>''What we are involved in is a very detailed and active conversation with the U.S., trying to allay their fears,'' Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told the BBC. ''We do not share their view about this.'' He added that Britain saw the disagreement as a ''serious matter.''</p>
        <p>The object of the Europeans' concern was the American veto Sunday of a Security Council resolution extending the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The measure was supported by all the other members, most notably Britain and France.</p>
        <p>Denmark assumed the six-month presidency of the European Union today and led the chorus of criticism of the American move. ''I deeply regret this dramatic step that threatens U.N. peace operations in general,'' said the country's foreign minister, Per Stig Moller.</p>
        <p>Carl Bildt of Sweden, a former envoy to the Balkans for the European Union and United Nations, called the Bush administration decision ''a very dangerous exercise in diplomatic brinkmanship with possible consequences that no one is fully aware of.''</p>
        <p>At the State Department today, a spokesman said the United States would be reviewing American participation in other international peacekeeping missions as well. ''We are determined that our citizens not be exposed to legal jeopardy before the International Criminal Court as a result of participating in peacekeeping,'' the spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said. ''A solution has to be found.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boucher asserted that it was not the administration's intention to use its opposition to the international court as a pretext for withdrawing American forces from Bosnia and other peacekeeping missions -- a position favored by some in the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>The United States cast its veto after its demand to put United States peacekeepers beyond the reach of the new International Criminal Court was rejected, then agreed to a three-day extension to give all sides time to seek a political solution.</p>
        <p>It was this opportunity that Britain moved on today. ''I totally understand the concerns of the United States of America,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament. ''They are perfectly legitimate concerns. Our view, however, is that they are met.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair has strongly emphasized Britain's close relation with Washington. He promised to ''stand shoulder to shoulder'' with Mr. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, and the two men have built up a close relationship.</p>
        <p>But today's divergence is just one of a growing number testing ties between Washington and London and provoking critics at home to express doubt that Mr. Blair is having the influence with the American administration that he seeks.</p>
        <p>Britain has vigorously objected to American tariffs on steel imports and made it clear last week that it did not agree with Mr. Bush's call to replace Yasir Arafat as Palestinian leader. Britain is also a vocal supporter of the Kyoto treaty on eliminating greenhouse gases, which the United States has refused to ratify. But Mr. Blair said today that these disagreements would not shake Britain's links with the United States, which he called the ''foundation stone'' of Britain's foreign policy.</p>
        <p>In Brussels, the European Commission spokesman, Gunnar Weigand, said at a news conference that the United Nations had asked European nations to consider taking over the police-training task force in Bosnia if America refuses to extend its mandate for the mission. The European Union has already agreed to assume responsibility for the force at the end of this year. Moving up the date would be ''logistically tight and quite difficult,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dominique Moïsi, a leading French political analyst, said the American rebuke of the court was motivated by arrogance and irresponsibility. ''Arrogant because they are placing themselves outside and above the law,'' he said. ''And irresponsible because one day they will need a world in which they, too, belong.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''At a time when the U.S. is trying to convince the Europeans to follow their way in the Middle East, this is not a very good symbol, to say the least.''</p>
