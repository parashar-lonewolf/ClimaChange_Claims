        <p>Of all the places where the cold war was waged, this was surely the coldest.</p>
        <p>Even now, buried somewhere under 100 feet of snow and ice, still unrecovered after 58 years, lie the bodies of three American servicemen, casualties of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union on the world's most frigid and remote continent.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 30, 1946, a United States Navy patrol plane with a crew of nine, mapping the Antarctic coast as part of a military effort called Operation Highjump, crashed in a snowstorm here after its radar failed to detect a slope not shown on charts.</p>
        <p>Now the United States Navy, piggybacking on scientific explorations of western Antarctica, has begun an effort to locate the plane and recover the remains of the crew members who died.</p>
        <p>At least two of the six crew members who survived the crash of the plane, code-named George1, are still alive, living in warm climates on opposite sides of the United States. Both the men -- James H. Robbins, then a 19-year-old radioman, and William Kearns, the 22-year-old co-pilot -- still remember vividly the sense of dread they felt after regaining consciousness and realizing where they were and the challenge they faced.</p>
        <p>''Our biggest fear, with no one else on the continent at the time, was being left alone in six million square miles of ice and snow,'' Mr. Kearns recalled in a telephone interview from Sarasota, Fla. ''If our own people couldn't rescue us, we were sunk. It was a hell of a feeling.''</p>
        <p>For nearly two weeks after the crash, the survivors endured rugged weather, injuries and a sparse diet, mainly dried meat. After a reconnaissance plane finally spotted them huddled at the wreckage, they felt relief, but still had to haul ailing comrades on a ski-sled to a spot where the rescue seaplane could land.</p>
        <p>''It was only 10 miles, but I had to keep turning and turning that sled to stay on course and had to dig in my heels to slow it as we went down an incline,'' Mr. Robbins said in a telephone interview from his home in Palm Desert, Calif.</p>
        <p>The crew members and their plane were part of what to this day remains the largest expedition ever in Antarctica, Operation Highjump, which was led by the renowned polar explorer, Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd, and consisted of 13 ships, 23 aircraft and 4,700 men.</p>
        <p>According to a 1946 Navy memorandum, the mission's goal was ''consolidating and extending U.S. sovereignty over Antarctic areas, investigating possible base sites and extending scientific knowledge in general.''</p>
        <p>In another document, Secretary of State Dean Acheson wrote, ''This government should follow a definite policy of exploration and use of those Antarctic areas considered desirable for acquisition by the United States.''</p>
        <p>With the cold war turning more frigid by the month, the venture unnerved the Soviet Union. The Soviet whaling fleet had just begun plying Antarctic waters, and a military publication called Red Fleet warned darkly that the operation was proof that ''American military circles are seeking to subject the polar regions to their control.''</p>
        <p>Argentina and Chile were none too happy, either. Both countries had their own overlapping claims to areas extending down from the tip of South America. Their fears of an American incursion were heightened when Chile asked Washington's permission to send an observer along, but was turned down.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, those conflicting claims and the suspicions they generated, if not entirely forgotten, no longer dominate Antarctic issues. The initial flight on Nov. 27 to try to locate the wreckage of the George1 was a joint one, conducted aboard a Chilean Navy Orion P-3 aircraft with a Chilean crew and NASA scientists working together.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't just a routine task for us,'' said Capt. Christian Aldunate, the senior Chilean pilot on the recovery flight. ''It was a challenge to find clues that could help locate the plane, even though we knew it would be almost impossible to get at it because of the ice and snow that had piled up over so many years.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than anyone else, the Chilean pilots appreciate the bravery of the crew of the George1 and the dangers they faced.</p>
        <p>During an 11-hour flight from and back to Punta Arenas, in the extreme south of Chile, the search plane dipped as low as 500 feet over mountainous Thurston Island so scientists could use radar and laser beams to try to locate the remains of the United States Navy PBM Mariner seaplane.</p>
        <p>''Even today it's not easy, but we can rely on information from satellite photos, G.P.S. systems and wind predictions,'' Captain Aldunate said, referring to global positioning networks. ''But from the time they took off until the time they arrived in the area, they had no idea what to expect. They didn't know what the weather or runway conditions were like, and that's why there were so many crashes and emergencies back then.''</p>
        <p>Though little known in the outside world, the three men who died in the crash -- Wendell K. Hendersin, Maxwell Lopez and Frederick Williams -- are still celebrated in Antarctica as heroes. At McMurdo Station, a United States research base on the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf, there is a plaque to honor the men, the first Americans to die in Antarctica on any of Admiral Byrd's many expeditions.</p>
        <p>Even today, Mr. Kearns, a retired journalist who is the author of a book about Antarctica called ''The Silent Continent,'' expressed reservations about the recovery effort, which depends on government funds and further feasibility studies. He described weather conditions as ''precarious and changing so rapidly that it that would endanger the recovery crew, and I don't like the idea of risking any additional lives.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Robbins, whose memoir of his experience, ''Antarctic Mayday,'' has been published at a Web site, south-pole.com, worries that with global warming the crash site is ''moving towards the sharks, and they will end up as bait if we don't do something.''</p>
        <p>But then, he also has another incentive. He inadvertently left behind a cache of film, on which he documented the ordeal, ''so that if we all died and they found us, the camera and the film would be there.''</p>
        <p>''It really irritates me that it ended up staying there,'' he said, ''but it's still got to be in the same cavity of that little pup tent, untouched.''</p>
