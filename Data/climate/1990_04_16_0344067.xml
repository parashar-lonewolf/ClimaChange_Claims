        <p>LEAD: Assembled by the United Nations in an attempt to arrive at an international consensus on global warming, a team of scientists says it is a ''virtual certainty'' that the temperature of the earth's surface will rise substantially in the next century.</p>
        <p>Assembled by the United Nations in an attempt to arrive at an international consensus on global warming, a team of scientists says it is a ''virtual certainty'' that the temperature of the earth's surface will rise substantially in the next century.</p>
        <p>The scientists generally agree with the theory that has been largely accepted by other national and international panels: that energy trapped in a greenhouse effect by industrial gases will warm the earth by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit within the next 60 years.</p>
        <p>A number of scientists, though, have raised doubts about the theory and about models of climatic change on which it is based. Skeptics call the model inaccurate or incomplete.</p>
        <p>The stakes are huge: Backers of the greenhouse theory say it will lead to worldwide flooding, climatic change and social disruption, #3 Groups Examine Theory Three United Nations teams are examining the theory and its policy implications. A team led by Britain is assessing the state of scientific knowledge about climate change. The conclusions that support the greenhouse theory are in this team's draft report. A group headed by the Soviet Union is looking into how such changes would affect social and economic systems. The third group, led by the United States, is preparing suggested policy responses to such changes. Final reports from all three groups are to be issued this year.</p>
        <p>Although still in draft form, the report generally supporting the greenhouse theory is likely to play a role in a White House conference on the changes in global climate. President Bush, who will open the meeting Tuesday, has invited 17 nations plus the European Community and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to participate.</p>
        <p>Michael R. Deland, the chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality, said the conference was intended to ''integrate the scientific and economic research challenges posed by the climate change issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deland, who is co-chairman of the conference, said in an interview that the White House called the conference to accelerate United Nations efforts to collect information needed for policy decisions about the greenhouse effect. He denied the contention of some Democrats and environmentalists that the Bush Administration had organized the forum to justify delaying national and international efforts to cope with global warming.</p>
        <p>Many Unanswered Questions</p>
        <p>In February, the President spoke to the international group assembled by the United National to study the greenhouse theory and emphasized the many unanswered questions about the evidence supporting the theory and the uncertainity about the economic consequences of reducing the use of fossil fuels and taking other steps to lower emissions of industrial gases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks appeared to reflect the skepticism of those scientists who questioned whether the available evidence was sufficient to predict that the earth will warm substantially in the next century.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Deland noted, however, the President has offered to serve as host of a conference to begin work on international climate change treaty. Mr. Bush has also proposed that $1 billion be budgeted for research into global warming issues.</p>
        <p>Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who is an advocate of a strong international response to the threat of global warming, has questioned the motives of the Administration in calling the conference on climate change.</p>
        <p>He said in a telephone interview that it was ironic that the findings of the international panel supporting the greenhouse theory would be made public on the eve ''of a conference that was designed to highlight scientific uncertainty,'' and added, ''The report confounds the skeptics.''</p>
        <p>Substantial Modifications Likely</p>
        <p>D. Allan Bromley, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, said he had had only a ''cursory look'' at the draft report. But he said scientists on the panel had told him the draft was likely to be modified substantially before it is issued in final form.</p>
        <p>Asked about the report's predictions of global warming, Dr. Bromley, also a co-chairman of the upcoming conference, said: ''There are still large uncertainties with any of the models. There is a consensus that if we continue to put greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at the rate of this century, we eventually will get global warming. But we don't know the exact time and magnitude, and some gaping uncertainties that underly these models have not yet been resolved.''</p>
        <p>The draft report found that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxides, gases that retain radiation from sunlight and thus contribute to a warming of the earth, are continuing to build up in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>To stabilize concentrations of carbon dioxide at present levels, it said, ''an immediate reduction in global man-made emissions by 60 to 80 percent would be necessary.'' Such emissions come chiefly from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil.</p>
        <p>Analysis of Geologic Records</p>
        <p>The authors of the report said they had a high degree of confidence that the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere would warm by 2.7 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. While the models show there is likely to be increased drought at mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the available data permit only relatively low confidence in this finding, the report said.</p>
        <p>In the last 100 years, the temperature of the globe has gone up by three-tenths of a degree to 1.1 degrees Fahrenheit, a range consistent with the climate models, the report said. But it also said it cannot be determined at this point how much of that increase can be attributed to greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The report noted, however, that an analysis of the geologic records of prehistoric epochs shows that the correlation of increases of carbon dioxide in the air with temperature changes is similar to the predictions of the computer models.</p>
        <p>Richard S. Lindzen, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has been one of the most vocal critics of the conclusions of the climate models, said he had not seen the draft report. But when told of its findings, he said, ''The conclusions sound off the wall to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindzen said there are still so many uncertainties in the models, including the role of increased cloud formation and water vapor as a result of warmer temperature, that they cannot accurately forecast what will happen in the next century.</p>
