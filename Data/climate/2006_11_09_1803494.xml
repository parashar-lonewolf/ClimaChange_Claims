        <p>A blue streak sweeps through the region, and a victory in a hotly contested Senate race takes center stage, announcing a new breed of Democrat.</p>
        <p>Alaska</p>
        <p>Sarah Palin, a Republican and former mayor of an Anchorage suburb, became Alaska's first female governor, fighting off a comeback bid by Tony Knowles, a Democrat and former governor. Ms. Palin, a social and fiscal conservative who calls herself a ''hockey mom,'' rose to prominence by uncovering misconduct in the administration of Gov. Frank Murkowski, whom she later trounced in the Republican primary in August.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knowles had called Ms. Palin inexperienced and said he was better positioned to help the state profit from its natural gas reserves, but Ms. Palin beat him by eight percentage points.</p>
        <p>Representative Don Young, a congressman since 1973, was easily re-elected.</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  99.5% reporting  Palin: 99,145 48.7%  Knowles: 82,956 40.7%</p>
        <p>Arizona</p>
        <p>Immigration dominated the political discourse in Arizona, from a number of ballot initiatives to the closely watched Senate race. Republicans positioned themselves as hard-liners on immigration, and for Senator Jon Kyl, the incumbent Republican, the strategy paid off. He gained almost a 9-point victory against his Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, a developer and former state Democratic Party chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kyl's win was a major victory for the Republicans, who lost crucial Senate races across the country and could not afford to lose a seat that was, not so long ago, solidly Republican.</p>
        <p>One House seat in the spotlight was held by Representative J. D. Hayworth, a Republican first elected in 1994. But he lost to Harry Mitchell, a former state Democratic Party chairman, 50 percent to 46 percent.</p>
        <p>Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, easily held onto her seat by an almost 28-point margin against Len Munsil, a Republican.</p>
        <p>Immigration was an issue in several ballot initiatives, directly or indirectly. Seventy-four percent of the voters approved an initiative to make English the state's official language, but most Hispanic voters disapproved of the measure. The voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 100, which would ban the opportunity for bail to illegal immigrants.</p>
        <p>Voters narrowly rejected a measure that banned same-sex marriage, approved a measure to raise the minimum wage, passed an antismoking measure and rejected a measure that, in the hopes of increasing voter participation, would have established a $1 million ''voter reward'' lottery.</p>
        <p>SENATE  100% reporting  Kyl: 607,778 52.8%  Pederson: 506,759 44%</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  100% reporting  Napolitano: 727,739 62.9%  Munsil: 405, 456 35.1%</p>
        <p>California</p>
        <p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger found the formula for winning as a Republican in this state that usually goes against his party: sound like a Democrat.</p>
        <p>Deeply unpopular less than a year ago, the governor courted the mostly Democratic Legislature, criticized President Bush and signed bills to raise the minimum wage and combat global warming. The result was a resounding victory over State Treasurer Phil Angelides as Republicans around the country -- and even around his state -- struggled.</p>
        <p>The national tide was seen most clearly in the re-election races of two Republican congressmen with districts near Sacramento that would usually be safe for them. Representative Richard Pombo, under fire for ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, lost to a Democrat, Gerald McNerney. And Representative John Doolittle narrowly won re-election over his Democratic challenger, Charlie Brown.</p>
        <p>Aside from governor, Democrats won six of the seven races for statewide office; they included former Gov. Jerry Brown, elected attorney general. Senator Dianne Feinstein was re-elected with almost 60 percent of the vote, the best showing in decades by a Senate candidate, in defeating Dick Mountjoy.</p>
        <p>Californians upheld their reputation for frequent and unpredictable use of the initiative process, voting on 13 ballot measures and taking liberal stances on some and conservative ones on others.</p>
        <p>They rejected an initiative to require parental notification before a minor can have an abortion and one to limit government's power of eminent domain. They also voted to reject public campaign financing, and to toughen penalties for sex offenders and require them to submit to lifetime Global Positioning System monitoring. Yesterday, a federal judge blocked enforcement of the sex offender law, ruling that it was probably unconstitutional, and ordered a hearing later this month.</p>
        <p>The voters also continued a pattern of being averse to taxes, but amenable to higher state debt. They approved $37 billion in borrowing through bond acts for highways, housing, schools and levees, but rejected taxes on cigarettes and oil production.</p>
        <p>SENATE  99.5% reporting  Feinstein: 3,983,385 59.7%  Mountjoy: 2,324,856 34.8%</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  99.5% reporting  Schwarzenegger: 3,778,168 55.7%  Angelides: 2,656,053 39.2%</p>
        <p>4TH DIST.  100% reporting  Doolittle: 104,307 49.2%  Brown: 97,022 45.8%</p>
        <p>11TH DIST.  100% reporting  McNerney: 88,026 53.1%  Pombo: 77,669 46.9%</p>
        <p>Colorado</p>
        <p>The last time Colorado Democrats elected a governor and majorities in both houses of the legislature was 1958. So the election of Bill Ritter, a former Denver prosecutor, to the Colorado Statehouse felt like a watershed, capping a four-year string of Democratic victories that has turned a red state into one that is more blue.</p>
        <p>But the Colorado electorate did not vote in the way, say, California Democrats might have. The same night the state elected Mr. Ritter governor, and increased to four the Democrats' share of Colorado's seven-member Congressional delegation, voters also approved a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and rejected proposals to extend many basic legal rights to same-sex couples and to legalize marijuana.</p>
        <p>''This is a centrist electorate,'' said Floyd Ciruli, an independent pollster based in Denver. ''In this election, voters punished Republicans, but they'll keep Democrats on a short leash unless they approach their victories cautiously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ritter, who won more than 56 percent of the vote in defeating Representative Bob Beauprez, a Republican, was born and reared on a Colorado farm. He has said that he is against abortion but committed to upholding the right of women to seek one. He portrayed himself as tough on crime but pragmatic on immigration, arguing that the construction and farm industries were being hurt by strict new immigration laws. He advocated a strong role for government in solving public problems.</p>
        <p>That centrist stance contrasted with Mr. Beauprez's image as a hard-line social and fiscal conservative who once backed a measure that threatened to shut down community colleges or allow state roads to go unrepaired. Independent voters supported Mr. Ritter by a huge margin.</p>
        <p>''As Republicans, we've got some work to do,'' Mr. Beauprez said in his concession speech. ''There's a bit of a wind blowing out there, and it's not necessarily a warm, friendly wind.''</p>
        <p>In House races, the former State Senator Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat, defeated Rick O'Donnell, the Republican former chairman of a state education commission.</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  97.9% reporting  Ritter: 779,741 56.3%  Beauprez: 566,303 40.9%</p>
        <p>7TH DIST.  99.7% reporting  Perlmutter: 99,824 54.8%  O'Donnell: 76,825 42.2%</p>
        <p>Hawaii</p>
        <p>There was little suspense about the outcomes of the races for governor, Senate and the two House seats in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat, easily held back his Republican challenger, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, to capture his third full term. He immediately renewed his promise to make the war in Iraq, which he opposes, his first priority. Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican, overcame Hawaiian voters' anti-Republican mood to win her second term, defeating Randy Iwase.</p>
        <p>Mazie Hirono, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor, defeated Bob Hogue to win the House seat in the largely Democratic Second District. In the First District, Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat, won his 9th consecutive term and 10th over all.</p>
        <p>SENATE  99.4% reporting  Akaka: 197,731 61.3%  Thielen: 118,867 36.8%</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  99.4% reporting  Lingle: 202,906 62.6%  Iwase: 114,550 35.3%</p>
        <p>Idaho</p>
        <p>This heavily Republican state had two surprisingly close races.</p>
        <p>In one, a three-term Republican congressman, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, defeated a Democratic newspaper publisher, Jerry M. Brady, in the race for governor. The current governor, James E. Risch -- a Republican who took office in May after his predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne, became the United States interior secretary -- decided not to seek a full term but to run instead for his former job as lieutenant governor.</p>
        <p>In the western of Idaho's two House districts, which Mr. Otter represents, State Representative Bill Sali, a Republican, narrowly beat Larry Grant, a Democratic lawyer. Mr. Sali, who emerged from a divisive primary with many enemies within his party, was seen as vulnerable; Vice President Dick Cheney campaigned with him, and national Republicans paid for advertisements attacking Mr. Grant.</p>
        <p>''The Democrats have been closing the get-out-the-vote gap in Idaho, and yet it wasn't enough,'' said Douglas C. Nilson, a political scientist at Idaho State University, in Pocatello. ''Last-minute Republican attack ads really helped.''</p>
        <p>Solid majorities approved a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and rejected a proposition to limit the use of eminent domain for economic development.</p>
        <p>''We are the reddest of the red states,'' said Todd Shallat, the director of the Center for Idaho History and Politics at Boise State University. ''We're dealing with God, guns and gays. At a time when the whole nation, even in Montana, was sending Republicans packing, the Republicans swept every statewide office here.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shallat, a historian, said the state's demographics were changing. Boise, the capital and largest city, is growing rapidly with migrants from the Pacific Northwest and Southern California, and now leans Democratic, and an influx of Latino immigrants statewide could make future races more competitive.</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  98% reporting  Otter: 231,292 52.6%  Brady: 193,800 44.1%</p>
        <p>1ST DIST.  96.2% reporting  Sali: 111,669 50%  Grant: 99,687 44.7%</p>
        <p>Montana</p>
        <p>Jon Tester, a new-style Western Democrat, narrowly won his Senate race against Conrad Burns, the Republican incumbent, who had been seeking his fourth term. The victory secured at least a 50-50 tie for the Democrats in the Senate and capped a fierce contest crucial to the party's hopes of gaining control of Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tester, the president of the State Senate, is a farmer and a part-time butcher who often waved to voters with his left hand, showing where he had lost three fingers in a meat grinder. He is a macho Rocky Mountain politician whose image was molded after his patron, Gov. Brian Schweitzer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tester's win and the victory by Bill Ritter, the Democrat in the Colorado governor's race, amounted to major triumphs for Mr. Schweitzer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schweitzer has been promoting a new image for the Democratic Party in the Rocky Mountain West, with candidates strong on gun rights and environmental protection, against free-trade deals and in favor of the death penalty, lower taxes and abortion rights.</p>
        <p>States once taken for granted as Republican strongholds now have a blue Democratic streak running through them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns, who as of yesterday evening had not conceded the race, was hurt by his ties to Jack Abramoff, the convicted lobbyist, having received more money from Mr. Abramoff than any other Republican.</p>
        <p>Recent visits by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney did not help Mr. Burns and might even have hurt. In exit polls, 60 percent of voters said they believed that Mr. Burns had been in office too long, and 55 percent said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's performance.</p>
        <p>Voters approved an increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 and a measure banning certain state officials from becoming lobbyists too soon after leaving their government jobs. The Republican representative, Denny Rehberg, easily won re-election.</p>
        <p>SENATE  100% reporting  Tester: 198,302 49.1%  Burns: 195,455 48.4%</p>
        <p>Nevada</p>
        <p>Rural voters proved critical in Representative Jim Gibbons's triumph in the governor's race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons, a Republican from Reno, defeated his Democratic opponent, State Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus, a political science professor from Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''We have one of the most solid Republican bases in the rural counties, and thank God for our rural counties,'' Paul Adams, chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons's lead had narrowed significantly in the last month after a waitress said he had tried to force himself on her in a parking garage. The accusation, which Mr. Gibbons has denied, is under investigation.</p>
        <p>Senator John Ensign, a Republican, comfortably defeated Jack Carter, a Democrat who is the son of former President Jimmy Carter. And the Republicans maintained their 2-to-1 advantage in the state's House delegation.</p>
        <p>The Republicans also held control of the State Senate, but lost four of six statewide offices: attorney general, secretary of state, comptroller and treasurer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams attributed the losses to ''voters looking for some change.'' Democrats maintained control of the state assembly, picking up one seat each in both houses of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Voters approved an increase in the state's minimum wage, to $6.15 an hour from $5.15 an hour, for employees who do not have health benefits. The measure calls for further increases if the federal minimum wage is raised and in years when inflation is greater than 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Nevadans also approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict the use of eminent domain; by state law, they must approve it once more before it can take effect.</p>
        <p>And voters rejected separate ballot proposals that would have legalized marijuana and barred smoking in public places.</p>
        <p>SENATE  100% reporting  Ensign: 321,186 55.4%  Carter: 237,875 41%</p>

        <p>One of the nation's tightest House races was still undecided yesterday.</p>
        <p>With 99 percent of precincts reporting, the Republican incumbent in the district around Albuquerque, Heather A. Wilson, led the Democratic attorney general, Patricia A. Madrid, by 1,364 votes. But thousands of ballots remained to be tallied in Bernalillo County, which includes Albuquerque and has far more registered Democrats than Republicans. The county clerk told The Associated Press that the counting would not be completed until tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Iraq was a hot topic in the campaign to represent the district, which has sent Republicans to the House for nearly 40 years. Ms. Wilson, a four-term incumbent and a former staff member of the National Security Council, sits on the House Intelligence Committee. And Ms. Madrid, who has served two terms as the attorney general, held Ms. Wilson partly to blame for inaccurate reports on Iraq's weapons programs.</p>
        <p>New Mexico's Democratic senator, Jeff Bingaman, easily defeated Allen W. McCulloch, a Republican. The Democratic governor, Bill Richardson, routed John Dendahl, a Republican. The state's other two representatives -- Tom Udall, a Democrat, and Steve Pearce, a Republican -- also won re-election.</p>
        <p>SENATE  99.7% reporting  Bingaman: 382,568 70.5%  McCulloch: 159,882 29.5%</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  99.7% reporting  Richardson: 373,274 68.7%  Dendahl: 170,213 31.3%</p>
        <p>1ST DIST.  99.4% reporting  Wilson: 102,343 50.3%  Madrid: 100,979 49.7%</p>
        <p>Oregon  It was a good night for the Democrats in Oregon. The party will control both legislative chambers and the governor's mansion for the first time since 1990.</p>
        <p>Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a Democrat, won a second term, and Democrats kept control of the State Senate. But they won a majority in the State House, which was controlled by Republicans.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 55 percent to 45 percent, Oregonians turned down a ballot proposal that required parental notification when girls ages 15 to 17 sought abortions. They overwhelmingly approved a separate measure under which the state will use its purchasing power to negotiate discounts on prescription drugs for state residents who have no insurance coverage for them.</p>
        <p>The Republican candidate for governor, Ron Saxton, had described Mr. Kulongoski as a lackluster leader. But the governor took the election results as a vote of confidence. Voters rejected two ballot measures that imposed new financial constraints on the governor's plans for more spending on schools and universities, health care and public safety. Mr. Kulongoski acknowledged that some of his proposals would require higher taxes.</p>
        <p>All five members of the state's Congressional delegation were re-elected. The four Democrats are in line for more influential committee and subcommittee positions.</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR  78.4% reporting  Kulongoski: 566,139 51.3%  Saxton: 470,138 42.6%</p>
        <p>Utah</p>
        <p>Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Finance and Judiciary Committees, easily won a sixth term, defeating a Democratic opponent, Peter Ashdown, the founder of an Internet service provider. All three House incumbents, two Republicans and one Democrat, were re-elected.</p>
        <p>SENATE  100% reporting  Hatch: 343,372 62.6%  Ashdown: 169,034 30.8%</p>
        <p>Washington</p>
        <p>Maria Cantwell fell victim to the changing balance of power in Congress in 1994, when Republicans swept Democrats from control and she lost her seat after one term. Ms. Cantwell retreated from politics, only to return in 2000 and eke out a victory for the Senate seat held by Slade Gorton, the Republican.</p>
        <p>This time, empowered by voters' disapproval of the national Republican leadership, and as an incumbent senator, Ms. Cantwell sailed to re-election by a solid margin over the challenger, Mike McGavick, a Republican businessman.</p>
        <p>At her victory celebration in Seattle, when it was clear that Democrats had won control of the House, Ms. Cantwell told supporters, ''We're going to change the course in our country because tonight we're changing who is in charge.''</p>
        <p>According to a poll by The Associated Press, nearly two-thirds of Washington voters said they disapproved of the war in Iraq and President Bush's performance, and most of them said they had cast ballots for Ms. Cantwell.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGavick, an outspoken critic of the Bush administration, drew most of his support from voters who strongly backed the president, according to the poll.</p>
        <p>The only one of the state's nine House races not called as of yesterday evening was in the Eighth District, where Dave Reichert, a Republican seeking a second term, held a slight lead over Darcy Burner, a Democrat and former Microsoft executive. In the other races, the incumbents, six Democrats and two Republicans, prevailed.</p>
        <p>Ballot initiatives to repeal the estate tax and regulate eminent domain were defeated.</p>
        <p>The fate of a measure promoting clean energy remained unclear; voters appeared to be narrowly favoring it as of late yesterday evening.</p>
        <p>SENATE  54% reporting  Cantwell: 659,011 57%  McGavick: 451,748 39%</p>
        <p>8TH DIST.  47.6% reporting  Reichert: 61,921 51.1%  Burner: 59,268 48.9</p>
        <p>Wyoming</p>
        <p>The race for Wyoming's only House seat was not settled as of yesterday evening, but the Republican incumbent, Representative Barbara Cubin, was leading the Democratic challenger, Gary Trauner, by fewer than 1,000 votes. Ms. Cubin declared victory in an interview with The Associated Press, but Mr. Trauner had not conceded. Wyoming election officials said yesterday that the vote margin was just wide enough to avoid an automatic recount. However, either candidate can request one.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cubin swept into the House in 1994 as part of Newt Gingrich's ''Republican Revolution.'' But her sometimes caustic personality appeared to turn off some voters.</p>
        <p>After a contentious debate in October, she reportedly told the Libertarian candidate, Thomas Rankin, who has multiple sclerosis, that if he were not in a wheelchair she would ''slap'' him.</p>
        <p>''It's things like that that have not played well,'' said Thomas Seitz, a professor of political science at the University of Wyoming.</p>
        <p>SENATE  100% reporting  Thomas: 134,942 70.1%  Groutage: 57,640 29.9%</p>
        <p>HOUSE  100% reporting  Cubin: 93,197 48.3%  Trauner: 92,227 47.8%</p>
        <p>THE 2006 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 14, 2006, Tuesday  A report about Nevada in the State by State election summary on Thursday referred incompletely to voting on smoking in public places. The ballot had two measures to ban smoking, not one. The more restrictive of the two measures was approved. Voters did not reject a ban.</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 22, 2006, Wednesday  Reports about Washington State in the State by State election summary on Nov. 8 and 9 referred incorrectly to a voter initiative on property rights, which was defeated. The measure would make governments pay for enacting zoning restrictions that reduce the value of private land; it would not regulate eminent domain.</p>
