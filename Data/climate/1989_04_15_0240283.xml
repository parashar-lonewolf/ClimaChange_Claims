        <p>LEAD: There are alternatives to shipping oil past the otters and icebergs of Prince William Sound, including fuel-efficient cars and different sources of energy. But so far industry and the Federal Government have avoided them.</p>
        <p>There are alternatives to shipping oil past the otters and icebergs of Prince William Sound, including fuel-efficient cars and different sources of energy. But so far industry and the Federal Government have avoided them.</p>
        <p>The oil companies say they are prospecting in the Alaskan wilderness because that is where the oil is and because other parts of the country are steadily being drained of oil resources.</p>
        <p>But with the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez making clear some of the risks of extracting oil in Alaska, conservationists and those favoring other fuels are pointing toward more accessible solutions, including conservation and the use of coal and natural gas.</p>
        <p>Yet each of these alternatives would require new investments, and some could lead to higher costs for consumers, to different types of environmental harm or to a higher trade deficit. Fuel Efficiency Is a Resource</p>
        <p>''The largest single untapped oil resource available to this country is the fleet of automobiles and light trucks,'' said Ralph C. Cavanagh of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group. The Federal Government should put pressure on manufacturers to build vehicles that use fuel more efficiently, he said, because getting a few more miles per gallon out of new cars is a surer, safer bet than drilling for oil that might not be there.</p>
        <p>Few politicians take seriously the threat by Gov. Steve Cowper of Alaska to close the Trans-Alaska Pipeline if oil operations cannot be run more safely. But even if the Exxon Valdez spill has no effect on oil production in Alaska, output on the North Slope is now at its peak and the oil companies expect it to begin a natural decline. That means the United States will eventually have to make do with less oil from Alaska anyway.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of views about the potential for conservation.</p>
        <p>A recently completed study found that oil consumption in the United States is now ''two million barrels per day lower than consumption would have been if automobile fuel efficiency had not improved since 1975.'' Two million barrels is the amount normally carried by the Alaska pipeline each day. That is one-fourth of domestic production, and about 5 percent of the nation's total energy use. The study was conducted by a private consultant at Environmental Analysis Inc. and scientists at the Department of Energy and its Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>But the effort toward developing more efficient cars has largely stopped. Congress had mandated that new cars reach an average of 27.5 miles per gallon by 1985, but the Reagan Administration held the level to 26 miles per gallon in 1986; this year it is 26.5.</p>
        <p>President Bush is expected to act soon to return the standard to 27.5 miles a gallon for the 1990 model year, industry and Administration officials say. That would save about one billion barrels of oil during the lifetime of the vehicles affected, or about 1 percent of the nation's consumption, but that is less than what conservationists want.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say improved gasoline mileage is no longer a major goal of car buyers. ''Look at the car ads,'' Mr. Cavanagh said. ''All you see is performance, acceleration and luxury. Fuel efficiency is not one of the hot buttons in marketing jargon.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, there is little incentive to buy a car that uses less gas. A recent study by the American Petroleum Institute found that last year a gallon of gasoline cost less than half what it did at the peak of price increases in 1981, taking inflation into account. Efficiency Costs Little</p>
        <p>Last year 10 members of Congress asked the Department of Energy to analyze the cost of requiring better gas mileage instead of drilling in Alaska. They argued that a little money spent to make cars more fuel-efficient would save large amounts of gasoline. Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat who last year joined in a request for a comparative analysis of conservation and production, argues that achieving an average of 35 miles per gallon would save 660,000 barrels of oil a day by the year 2000. In 30 years, the same time as the expected life of an oil field, that would amount to about 7.8 billion barrels.</p>
        <p>That is far more than the oil industry is likely to find in Alaska, where the Interior Department has calculated that there is a 19 percent chance of finding ''commercial amounts of oil.''</p>
        <p>The energy need not come only from conservation. A 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant can substitute for about 9.5 million barrels of oil each year. At that rate, about 75 nuclear plants could produce as much energy as the 715 million barrels that came through Valdez, Alaska, last year.</p>
        <p>The approach has limits, however. The first is that the nation does not use 715 million barrels of oil for electric production, but only a little more than 200 million barrels. The second problem is that the reactors can cost $5 billion each to build. At that price, using uranium to save oil is like using steak to save Hamburger Helper. And so far there is no place to put the resulting radioactive waste.</p>
        <p>Coal is another substitute. American mines will produce about 970 million tons this year, including 760 million tons for use by utility companies. A ton of bituminous coal can replace four barrels of oil.</p>
        <p>Replacing all the oil used in electrical generation would take 50 million more tons or so, an amount within the mining industry's capacity. And with coal costing 40 percent less than oil per unit of heat, the price is right. Natural Gas a Possibility</p>
        <p>But burning coal produces acid rain. Avoiding that problem would require new, clean-burning power plants in place of older plants that now stand idle. Acid rain aside, coal produces more carbon dioxide per unit of electricity than either natural gas or oil, and that gas has been identified as a cause of the global warming expected to occur as a result of pollution.</p>
        <p>Another choice is natural gas. Alaska's oil production is the equivalent of about four trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year. Last year natural gas production was 18.5 trillion cubic feet, but in the early 1970's the industry was delivering over 22 trillion cubic feet a year. But if the demand came now, the industry would have to rebuild its capacity, undoubtedly at higher price. And natural gas cannot be substituted for oil in all uses.</p>
        <p>Since oil can be obtained abroad, the United States could limit the risk to its environment importing more. But the market value of Alaskan oil last year was more than $9 billion, and without that production world oil prices would probably rise by several dollars a barrel. And the country is already running a trade deficit of $130 billion a year, with oil accounting for about $40 billion of that.</p>
