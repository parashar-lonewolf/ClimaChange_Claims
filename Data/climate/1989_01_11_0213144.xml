        <p>LEAD: The relentlessly right-thinking and ferociously articulate characters in Susan Miller's new play, ''For Dear Life,'' are the kind of people who can't contemplate the change of seasons without anticipating nuclear winter. They can't pour a glass of milk without crying over the snapshot of a missing child on the carton.</p>
        <p>The relentlessly right-thinking and ferociously articulate characters in Susan Miller's new play, ''For Dear Life,'' are the kind of people who can't contemplate the change of seasons without anticipating nuclear winter. They can't pour a glass of milk without crying over the snapshot of a missing child on the carton. They can't go to the bathroom without worrying about the depletion of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>They're not exactly a fun crowd, and they wear out their welcome quickly at the Public Theater. Were ''For Dear Life'' a satirical dissection of its pretentious characters or a serious discussion of the social issues to which the dialogue pays lip service, it might at least qualify as an attenuated revue sketch or, failing that, as a syllabus for the New School. But Ms. Miller, the author of ''Nasty Rumors and Final Remarks'' and ''Flux,'' has so little distance on her material that ''For Dear Life'' is as smug and narcissistic as the indolent dilettantes who inhabit it.</p>
        <p>The play's ostensible subject is marriage. Jake (Tony Shalhoub), a disk jockey infatuated with old standards and major league baseball, and Catherine (Laila Robins), a film critic, seem perfectly happy, but Jake is worried. The world is falling apart, so why shouldn't their marriage follow suit? ''Maybe it's just that you and Catherine are impatient with each other's gestalt,'' says their helpful friend Dottie (Christine Estabrook), a West Coast film maker.</p>
        <p>Then again, maybe not. By Act II, set almost two decades later, the marriage has indeed broken up, though we don't know why; Jake and Catherine, both devoted to their mildly rebellious teen-age son (Stephen Mailer), still seem to be in love. In Act III, Ms. Miller flashes back to the son's first birthday, but once again she withholds any explanation of the couple's divorce, announcing instead that it's a waste of time to ''look for reasons.'' Why should Ms. Miller do the hard work of examining her characters when she can end her play with a laundry list of buzzwords (Hitler, the atomic bomb, Vietnam, AIDS) that so efficiently illustrate how deeply concerned a citizen she is?</p>
        <p>Early on, Jake and Catherine speak of the ''long-researched phrases'' they use in their writing, and apparently this is Ms. Miller's literary method as well. There isn't a spontaneous line in the script, which, like some of the playwright's previous work, seems an unintentional parody of J. D. Salinger's Glass-family stories. Jake is a happy man because his life ''is made up of shimmering minor moments,'' while the impossibly erudite Catherine is so ''tired of syllables'' she yearns to have a low-class New Jersey accent. My favorite howler is Jake's poetically expressed fear, while vacationing at his country house, that ''a tree could fall into our happiness,'' though a close second is the unanswered question ''Where's the tabula rasa here?''</p>
        <p>Such vague phrasemaking ducks the introspection that the play disingenuously purports to provide; even the details that might give the characters a superficial reality are fuzzy. While ''For Dear Life'' emulates Michael Weller's ''Loose Ends,'' it's all just loose ends. Jake and Catherine's generation is unclear - they eventually seem to be late-fortysomething, though cast a fashionable decade younger - and the shifts in time are apparent only from the Playbill, so completely does the writing blur any distinctions between the play's various periods. No wonder that the talented director, Norman Rene, can't breathe life, dear or cheap, into any of it, and that some good actors (and not-so-good ones) look consistently silly.</p>
        <p>Between the splintery scenes, the audience is treated to Jake's radio program: performers like Sinatra, Astaire and Ella Fitzgerald singing such great songs as ''A Foggy Day'' and ''I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan.'' For trapped theatergoers, unfortunately, plans are not so easily changed.  Crying Over Unspilled Milk  FOR DEAR LIFE, by Susan Miller; directed by Norman Rene; set by Loy Arcenas; costumes by Walker Hicklin; lighting by Arden Fingerhut; dance by Theodore Pappas; fight staged by B. H. Barry; associate producer, Jason Steven Cohen. Presented by Joseph Papp. At the Public Theater, Martinson Hall, 425 Lafayette Street.  Jake ... Tony Shalhoub  Maggie ...
