        <p>Since this summer, a new contraband has been running second only to marijuana in the Customs seizures made here on the Mexican border. It is more profitable than cocaine by some estimates, believed to be bigger business these days than gun-running, and illegal to import for a futuristic reason: it harms the planet.</p>
        <p>It is that old staple on car-repair shop shelves, Freon. And it is taking on a sinister new role as the contraband of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Virtually all production and importation of the ozone-destroying refrigerant has been banned in the United States since January, but the continued demand for it among American owners of more than 80 million older cars whose air conditioners use it has sent black-market prices spiraling, Federal officials say.</p>
        <p>Concerned that market forces will undermine a landmark global agreement to stem the use of ozone-eaters, those same Federal officials are waging a ''war on Freon'' with some of the same seriousness as the war on drugs.</p>
        <p>In recent months, they have been training hundreds of border inspectors and prosecutors to crack down on the thousands of tons of Freon that enter the country illegally each year and add a bit more to the holes in the protective ozone over the Earth's poles.</p>
        <p>Beginning with a Miami-based task force known as ''Operation Cool Breeze'' nearly two years ago, tough-on-Freon Federal prosecutors have won at least 18 convictions of major smugglers, accompanied by millions of dollars in penalties and sentences of up to 57 months for the biggest violators. A Freon case brought the first-ever extradition for an environmental crime, officials said, and the first United States felony convictions based on violations of the Federal Clean Air Act amendments on ozone-depleting gases.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors and inspectors believe they have deterred some of the larger shipments of Freon, which is the commonly used Du Pont brand name for a coolant belonging to the class of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's.</p>
        <p>But not the smaller ones, and not for long.</p>
        <p>''The profits are tremendous -- people pick up a 12-ounce container in Mexico for $2 and sell it here for $23,'' said Steve Solow, assistant chief of the environmental crime section of the Justice Department. ''And we anticipate there will be another surge in attempts to smuggle in large quantities; that's why the department has developed a national enforcement initiative.''</p>
        <p>The street price for a 30-pound cylinder of Freon has more than doubled since last year to well over $500, said Thomas A. Watts-Fitzgerald, the United States Attorney who has spearheaded Operation Cool Breeze.</p>
        <p>He calculates that buying cocaine, converting it to crack and selling it brings a 4-to-1 profit ratio; buying a canister of Freon in another country for $42 and selling it here for $550 produces a 13-to-1 profit ratio.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't take a math genius,'' he said. ''It's basic economics.''</p>
        <p>A typical air conditioner on a car built before 1993 that uses Freon takes two to three pounds of the odorless compound. It is legal to sell and use existing stashes of Freon, but they are expected to run out in two years.</p>
        <p>The most recent cause for worry, Federal officials say, is indications that serious Freon smugglers have taken to crossing the loose United States border with Canada.</p>
        <p>''We're beginning to see some instances of smuggling routes that go back to the days of Prohibition, using islands in the Great Lakes,'' said Michael Penders, special counsel to the director of criminal enforcement at the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>But the authorities are also concerned about an increase in the small-scale smuggling most common here on the California-Mexican border, where Customs officials confiscate six or seven illegal loads of Freon canisters a week, and often the cars of the smugglers as well.</p>
        <p>Gregory Schulte, a Customs investigator, said that since this summer, ''rat-packers'' -- small-scale smugglers -- have been caught with 5,320 pounds of Freon in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>Since Freon is still legal to manufacture and export in Mexico, ''What we're seeing here is that you could almost drive around aimlessly there and find some, throw it in the trunk and hope you get lucky,'' Mr. Schulte said.</p>
        <p>The Government is taking Freon smuggling with such gravity in part because it undermines the 1987 agreement known as the Montreal Protocol, in which more than 140 countries agreed to curb ozone-depleting gases.</p>
        <p>The ozone layer serves to veil the planet from ultra-violet radiation, which is harmful to plants and animals and has been shown to cause skin cancer, cataracts and other damage in humans. Government scientists have reported worsening ozone depletion in recent years over both poles.</p>
        <p>Because the exact quantities of smuggled Freon are not known and the science is sketchy, it is unclear exactly how much the illicit chemical could delay the healing of the ozone holes, which is expected to take decades even with full compliance with the Montreal plan.</p>
        <p>If estimates by a private group called Ozone Action that about 10,000 tons of CFC's are smuggled in per year are correct, then the smuggled Freon's impact is likely less than that of the thousands of tons still being produced and consumed each year in India, the former Soviet Union and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The Montreal agreement lets developing countries continue producing CFC's 10 years longer than industrialized ones, which had to stop last year.</p>
        <p>In addition, under a loophole in the agreement, hundreds of tons of Freon are still being produced for export in the United States as well this year.</p>
        <p>But even a small impact is too big, said John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone Action. ''We're already in a danger zone,'' he said. ''We're already drunk and shouldn't be driving that car, and another beer means just that much longer that you shouldn't be driving.''</p>
        <p>Ozone Action plans to issue a sequel to last year's report on Nov. 19 identifying Mexico as a major source of illegal CFC's entering the United States, Mr. Passacantando said. And the Montreal signatories are expected to meet this month to decide how to stop the export from one country to another.</p>
        <p>The planetary damage that the ozone-depleting gases wreak makes the Freon smugglers, in the eyes of some, the classic villains of the post-Cold-War world, polluters for profit who value money in their pocket over the health of the Earth.</p>
        <p>''The damage that can be imposed by UVBV'' -- the harmful radiation that ozone blocks -- ''goes down to the genetic level,'' Mr. Watts-Fitzgerald said. ''It literally has the capacity to affect life on Earth as we know it,'' but ''We have a hereditary inability to take the long view on some things as opposed to the short economic view.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Watts-Fitzgerald helped convict several Freon smugglers over the last two years who brought in hundreds of tons of the compound. Now, he and others said, would-be big shippers seem to be deterred, in part because the method most of them used -- pretending the Freon was only passing through the United States in order to avoid stiff excise taxes -- will no longer pass muster now that the full ban is in place.</p>
        <p>But all predicted that Freon smuggling, large and small, will continue until the last old-car owners cough up the cash -- more than $100 and sometimes several hundred dollars -- to convert their cars to less-polluting air conditioner coolants. Or until Freon gets so expensive and its replacements so cheap that it is foolish not to convert.</p>
