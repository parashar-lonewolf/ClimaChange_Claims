        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Too Many Dammed Rivers'' by Stewart L. Udall and W. Kent Olson (Op-Ed, Nov. 25), on hydroelectric development, gives misleading and inaccurate information on critical energy and environmental issues in the development of this important renewable energy resource.</p>
        <p>To meet this country's energy demands without increasing acid rain and global warming it is essential to use our domestic renewable resources. Standing in the way of this rational approach to energy development are small special interest groups who claim the mantle of environmentalist, but take no responsibility for the environmental impact of replacing power from a hydro project with fossil-fuel-fired plants. They find it acceptable to oppose a hydro project and then see its fishery destroyed by acid rain.</p>
        <p>Rivers behind dams aren't dead. They are full of fish, animals, birds, fishermen, boaters, water skiers and swimmers. The rivers behind the hydro dams that built the industrial strength of New York State are lined with property owners who count on that dam to keep the water levels up to their property line.</p>
        <p>The authors know there is no such thing as ''hydromania'' and no special treatment or subsidies for hydro development. Under Federal law, utilities are prohibited from buying power at prices that exceed the cost of alternatives.</p>
        <p>The hydro industry accepts its obligation to pay for reasonable environmental impacts associated with power production, but it cannot produce low-cost power for the ratepayer if it has to pay costly benefits on the waterway that accrue to only a very limited number of users.</p>
        <p>Hydropower provides 12 percent of this country's electrical capacity. Moreover, of the 67,000 dams in the United States only 5 percent have hydro capacity. That leaves a lot of dams where hydro could be added without environmental damage.</p>
        <p>The article fails to acknowledge that hydroelectric generation is the only energy technology required by regulation to identify its environmental impact, find appropriate mitigation and resolve it before the license is issued and the project built. No other energy technology requires that.</p>
        <p>There are no simple and easy solutions to meet the nation's growing demand for electricity and maintaining a safe environment. Hydroelectricity is not the sole remedy but it can play an important role in that solution.</p>
        <p>The so-called environmentalists who would prevent the use of hydro power are actually aggravating our environmental problems. It would certainly benefit us all if these special interest groups would become part of the solution, instead of part of the problem.
