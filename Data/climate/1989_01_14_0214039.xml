        <p>LEAD: James D. Watkins, the retired admiral chosen by President-elect Bush to be Energy Secretary, faces one of the harder tasks of any cabinet member.

        <p>James D. Watkins, the retired admiral chosen by President-elect Bush to be Energy Secretary, faces one of the harder tasks of any cabinet member. He must clean up the appalling mess at the nation's nuclear bomb factories, modernize the aging plants to avert unilateral nuclear disarmament and persuade a deficit-ridden Government to pay the $81 billion bill.</p>
        <p>To this gargantuan labor he brings strong convictions and the experience of an unusual double career in the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>As Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Watkins vigorously supported a half-baked proposal by then- Navy Secretary John Lehman to send carriers into Soviet waters in wartime. On another subject, troubled by questions from the nation's Roman Catholic bishops about the morality of nuclear deterrence, he favored research on antimissile defenses. President Reagan quickly transformed that position into his unrealistic Star Wars Astrodome shield.</p>
        <p>In his second career, as chairman of the President's commission on AIDS, Admiral Watkins confounded critics by his thorough and sensitive grasp of all aspects of the disease. In sharp distinction to the Justice Department's condoning of discrimination against AIDS victims, he called for strong new laws to protect the rights of those infected.</p>
        <p>He begins his third career with little specific knowledge other than his apprenticeship in Admiral Rickover's nuclear navy, but with a considerable store of credibility from his AIDS commission leadership. Restoring production of nuclear materials and cleaning up polluted production sites are barely compatible tasks, and whatever balance he seeks between them may bring him hosts of critics. But his forceful opinions and record of independence will lend weight to whatever solutions he proposes.</p>
        <p>A Secretary of Energy has other responsibilities, notably to devise an energy policy that will conserve oil and secure supply, and to find ways to delay the greenhouse effect. Both tasks require a degree of foresight far beyond the grasshopper horizons of the Reagan Administration. Admiral Watkins is an unusual leader. He may surprise everyone by boldly tackling the conventional wisdom and vested interests that have too long opposed planning energy for the morrow.</p>
