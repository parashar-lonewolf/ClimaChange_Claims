        <p>LEAD: Chemical evidence strongly suggests that low-level nuclear waste has been dumped into a large California lake in the past 36 years, a team of geologists reported yesterday. The scientists said they did not know the source of the waste, which they stressed posed no health hazard.</p>
        <p>Chemical evidence strongly suggests that low-level nuclear waste has been dumped into a large California lake in the past 36 years, a team of geologists reported yesterday. The scientists said they did not know the source of the waste, which they stressed posed no health hazard.</p>
        <p>The discovery was reported yesterday by Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a professor of geology at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and seven associates, including a scientist from the United States Geological Survey.</p>
        <p>He said that most of the apparent dumping occurred from 1952 to 1958 but that a smaller rate of radioactive pollution has continued since then.</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker said radioactive pollution had been detected at Mono Lake, a large volcanic crater lake 180 miles east of San Francisco. His team found that the lake contained much more of the radioactive carbon isotope carbon 14 than would be normal under any circumstances other than dumping. Laboratories and Hospitals</p>
        <p>''We know from geological sediments,'' he said in an interview, ''that the carbon 14 content of the lake had been steadily declining for the past 1,000 years. What the apparent dumping has done is to bring the ratio of radioactive carbon to ordinary carbon back to about what it was 1,000 years ago.''</p>
        <p>He surmised that the new carbon 14 had entered the lake as waste from laboratories, which commonly use the substance in tracing the progress of biological processes.</p>
        <p>''It might have come from Federal laboratories or even hospitals,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''At the time when most of it was going on,'' he said, ''it was probably a#7responsible disposal method to put it in Mono Lake. The lake is extremely rich in ordinary carbon, and the carbon-14 isotope would be diluted enough that it could cause no problems to human health or wildlife. Nevertheless, it was probably irresponsible not to have reported the disposal.''</p>
        <p>Mono Lake is rapidly subsiding because the streams that feed it have been increasingly tapped for the Los Angeles water supply. Consequently, the shore line changes each year, and calcium carbonate deposited on pebbles by the evaporating water reflects the changing carbon content of the lake from year to year. Dr. Broecker has also drawn samples of water from Mono Lake since 1958. Study of Gas Exchanges</p>
        <p>The purpose of Dr. Broecker's work, he explained, is to measure the rate at which atmospheric air and lake water exchange carbon dioxide. He and his associates have studied gas exchanges of this kind in various lakes as well as wind tunnels and laboratories.</p>
        <p>In the course of this study, the investigators discovered that the rate at which carbon 14 had been absorbed by Mono Lake greatly exceeded that of other bodies of water, and could not be explained in terms of geological activity or the atmospheric nuclear explosions of the 1950's and 1960's.</p>
        <p>''During the late 1950's,'' he said, ''the carbon 14 content of the lake increased some 50 times more than might have been expected because of bomb fallout and other predicted factors. Since 1958, the rate of increase has been about four times greater than normal, suggesting that some dumping has continued.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker said he had not informed the California authorities about the discovery ''because no hazard is involved.''</p>
        <p>''The only real problem this creates is for scientists who estimate the ages of carbon-based objects by the amount of carbon 14 they contain,'' he said. Fallout From Nuclear Tests</p>
        <p>Nuclear waste ordinarily contains a mixture of radioactive substances. Dr. Broecker said he and his colleagues would check levels of strontium 90 and cesium 137. ''But we are sure there can't be much of either one,'' he said. These two radioactive isotopes are common ingredients of the fallout from nuclear explosions, and both are extremely dangerous.</p>
        <p>Even with the increased load of carbon 14 in the lake, he said, the level was only about equivalent to what it had been in 1950 when nuclear tests were being conducted in the atmosphere.</p>
