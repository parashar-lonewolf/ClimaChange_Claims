        <p>SHARES of Chevron soared this month after the company announced a major oil find in the Gulf of Mexico. Then they lost back the entire gain, and more, over the next few days.</p>
        <p>Analysts were not surprised by the stock's decline. As intriguing as the discovery is, they say, there are too many unknowns to count the deposit as gas in the tank, let alone money in the bank.</p>
        <p>They are not ignoring the news, but their outlook for Chevron is based on real conditions today, not potential ones tomorrow. Even when they limit their attention to the here and now, however, they find it hard to agree on the company's prospects.</p>
        <p>It is easy to see why investors were thrilled, albeit briefly, by the discovery by Chevron and its partners: Devon Energy and Statoil of Norway. It could result in the biggest single addition to American oil reserves since the Prudhoe Bay find in Alaska in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Based on the most optimistic projections, the gulf field contains 15 billion barrels, about 50 percent more than the nation's existing reserves. But with commercial production years away, if it ever comes, and the oil sitting in rock 30,000 feet below the water's surface, 175 miles off Louisiana, investors will require optimism by the barrelful if they expect the discovery to aid the stock appreciably.</p>
        <p>Still, there are more problematic locations, geopolitically if not geologically. The Gulf of Mexico is a far more placid, stable spot than other gulfs that hold large quantities of oil. The deposit's location in our own backyard is one reason Tina Vital, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, calls the find ''exciting news.''</p>
        <p>''Assets in less volatile places in the world are valued more highly,'' she explained. The discovery ''shows how advances in technology have helped identify a potentially large development.''</p>
        <p>''It also shows that there may be more out there in the gulf, not just that it's there but that we might be able to do something with it.''</p>
        <p>Potentially. May. Might. ''There is a difference between resources and likely realization and production'' of them, Ms. Vital warned. ''You can have great resources, but they can sit there forever.''</p>
        <p>Christopher MacDonald, an analyst and portfolio manager at Westwood Management, thinks the oil will be extracted, but not cheaply.</p>
        <p>''Chevron will make a lot of money on this,'' he predicted, ''but it will be expensive to drill it, bring it back up and ship it to shore. It's going to cost a lot of money to get it to market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. MacDonald judges energy stocks by how fast they increase production and replace depleted reserves. Chevron may be in line for a big score on the second criterion, but he is not sure about the first.</p>
        <p>Companies like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and BP have trouble expanding production beyond the industry average because they are the giants that set the average. Mr. MacDonald prefers smaller companies like Marathon, Murphy Oil and Occidental, which have been increasing production by more than twice the 3 percent industry mean.</p>
        <p>Strong growth is especially important now, he said, because companies may no longer be able to count on rising energy prices. Crude oil has been depressed by what he called a ''perfect storm'' of events, a metaphor for a list of factors that incongruously includes an absence of serious hurricanes this season along with a semblance of calm in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>If he sees the barrel as half empty, Ms. Vital finds it half full. She thinks demand for oil will remain strong as global development progresses.</p>
        <p>''Increases in production will match increases in demand for the next 5 to 10 years,'' she forecast. ''To modernize people's standard of living requires a lot of fossil fuels.''</p>
        <p>In such an environment, average growth will do nicely for oil companies, and she expects Chevron's to be slightly above average. She has a ''strong buy'' rating on the stock and a target of $80 a share, a healthy rally from its close on Friday of $61.79. She also advises buying Exxon Mobil and the French company Total.</p>
        <p>The size of these companies lets them produce oil more cheaply than their rivals, she said. That is a big advantage when selling essentially a single product at a global price.</p>
        <p>''This is a commodity business,'' Ms. Vital said. ''What makes them profitable is that their costs are low. It doesn't matter necessarily what their reserves are.''</p>
