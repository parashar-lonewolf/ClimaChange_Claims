        <p>The last 12 months have been very painful for those of us who believe in collective answers to our common problems and challenges. In many countries, terrorism has once again brought death and suffering to innocent people. In the Middle East and in certain parts of Africa, violence has continued to escalate. In the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere, the threat of nuclear proliferation casts an ominous shadow across the landscape.</p>

        <p>UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 23  Following are excerpts from speeches today at the General Assembly by Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Jacques Chirac of France, as supplied, partly in translation, by the United Nations. The texts are at www .nytimes.com/international.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from speeches today at the General Assembly by Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Jacques Chirac of France, as supplied, partly in translation, by the United Nations. The texts are at www .nytimes.com/international.</p>
        <p>By Kofi Annan</p>
        <p>The last 12 months have been very painful for those of us who believe in collective answers to our common problems and challenges. In many countries, terrorism has once again brought death and suffering to innocent people. In the Middle East and in certain parts of Africa, violence has continued to escalate. In the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere, the threat of nuclear proliferation casts an ominous shadow across the landscape.</p>
        <p>And barely one month ago in Baghdad, the United Nations itself suffered a brutal and deliberate assault in which the international community lost some of its most talented servants. Yesterday it was attacked again. . . .</p>
        <p>Excellencies, you are the United Nations. The staff who were killed and injured in the attack on our Baghdad headquarters were your staff. You had given them a mandate to assist the suffering Iraqi people and to help Iraq recover their sovereignty. In future, not only in Iraq but wherever the United Nations is engaged, we must take more effective measures to protect the security of our staff. . . .</p>
        <p>Subject to security considerations, the United Nations system is prepared to play its full role in working for a satisfactory outcome in Iraq and to do so as part of an international effort, an effort by the whole international community, pulling together on the basis of a sound and viable policy.</p>
        <p>If it takes extra time and patience to forge that policy, a policy that is collective, coherent and workable, then I for one would regard that time as well spent. Indeed, this is how we must approach all the many pressing crises that confront us today.</p>
        <p>Excellencies, three years ago, when you came here for the Millennium Summit, we shared a vision, a vision of global solidarity and collective security, expressed in the Millennium Declaration. But recent events have called that consensus in question.</p>
        <p>All of us know there are new threats that must be faced or, perhaps, old threats in new and dangerous combinations, new forms of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>But while some consider these threats as self-evidently the main challenge to world peace and security, others feel more immediately menaced by small arms employed in civil conflict or by so-called soft threats such as the persistence of extreme poverty, the disparity of income between and within societies, and the spread of infectious diseases, or climate change and environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>In truth, we do not have to choose. The United Nations must confront all these threats and challenges, new and old, hard and soft. . . . In fact, all these struggles are linked. We now see, with chilling clarity, that a world where many millions of people endure brutal oppression and extreme misery will never be fully secure, even for its most privileged inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Yet the hard threats such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction are real and cannot be ignored. Terrorism is not a problem only for rich countries. Ask the people of Bali or Bombay, Nairobi or Casablanca. Weapons of mass destruction do not threaten only the western or northern world. Ask the people of Iran or of Halabja in Iraq.</p>
        <p>Where we disagree, it seems, is on how to respond to these threats. Since this organization was founded, states have generally sought to deal with threats to the peace through containment and deterrence, by a system based on collective security and the United Nations Charter.</p>
        <p>Article 51 of the Charter prescribes that all states, if attacked, retain the inherent right of self-defense. But until now, it has been understood that when states go beyond that and decide to use force to deal with broader threats to international peace and security, they need the unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Now some say this understanding is no longer tenable, since an armed attack with weapons of mass destruction could be launched at any time without warning or by a clandestine group. Rather than wait for that to happen, they argue, states have the right and obligation to use force pre-emptively. . . . It is not enough to denounce unilateralism, unless we also face up squarely to the concerns that make some states feel uniquely vulnerable, since it is those concerns that drive them to take unilateral action. We must show that those concerns can, and will, be addressed effectively through collective action.</p>
        <p>Excellencies, we have come to a fork in the road. This may be a moment no less decisive than 1945 itself, when the United Nations was founded. . . .</p>
        <p>The Council needs to consider how it will deal with the possibility that individual states may use force pre-emptively against perceived threats. Its members may need to begin a discussion on the criteria for an early authorization of coercive measures to address certain types of threats, for instance, terrorist groups armed with weapons of mass destruction. And they still need to engage in serious discussions of the best way to respond to threats of genocide or other comparable massive violations of human rights, an issue which I raised myself from this podium in 1999. Once again this year, our collective response to events of this type in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia has been hesitant and tardy.</p>
        <p>By Jacques Chirac</p>
        <p>The United Nations has just weathered one of the gravest trials in its history. The debate turned on respect for the Charter and the use of force. The war, embarked on without Security Council approval, has undermined the multilateral system.</p>
        <p>Having taken stock of this crisis, our organization can now resume its onward march. For it is above all in this forum, which is the crucible of the international order, that it behooves us to exercise our responsibilities to the world of today and to future generations. . . .</p>
        <p>Multilateralism is the key, for it ensures the participation of all in the management of world affairs. It is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy, especially in matters regarding the use of force or laying down universal norms. . . .</p>
        <p>In Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, who must have sole responsibility for their future, is essential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to the United Nations to give legitimacy to this process.</p>
        <p>It is also up to the United Nations to assist with the gradual transfer of administrative and economic responsibilities to the present Iraqi institutions according to a realistic timetable and to help the Iraqis draft a constitution and hold elections.</p>
        <p>Lastly, it is up to the United Nations to give a mandate to a multinational force, commanded naturally by the main troop contributor, in order to ensure the security of Iraq and all those helping with the country's reconstruction.</p>
        <p>In this way, the international community and the Iraqi people, united around a common project, will together end the tragic decades of this great country's history. . . .</p>
        <p>The fight against international terrorism is another key challenge. This is well in hand, under Security Council auspices and within the framework of our various treaties.</p>
        <p>Our determination is rooted in the horror of Sept. 11. The threat goes to the very heart of our democracies and societies. We are using force to combat terrorism, but that is not enough. It will return over and over if we allow extremism and fanaticism to flourish, if we fail to realize that it uses the world's unresolved conflicts and imbalances as its justification.</p>
        <p>In the face of proliferating weapons of mass destruction, we reject all faits accomplis.</p>
        <p>We must stand united in ensuring the universality of treaties and the effectiveness of nonproliferation regimes. We must strengthen our means of action in order to ensure compliance.</p>
        <p>France has proposed the creation of a permanent corps of inspectors under the authority of the Security Council. We need to give fresh impetus to this policy. Let us call a summit meeting of the Security Council to frame a genuine United Nations action plan against proliferation.  . . .</p>
        <p>In order to fulfill the missions entrusted to it and remedy some of its blatant shortcomings, the United Nations must change. Democracy, authority and efficacy must be our watchwords. Progress has been made, thanks to the secretary general, and new avenues are opening up. It is now up to the member states to take matters forward without delay and to put an end to the damage caused by the stalemate over reforms.</p>
        <p>The United Nations suffers from the current weakness of the General Assembly. Yet that is where debate on solutions to the world's great problems should take place and consensus be forged. A culture of confrontation must give way to a culture of action, aimed at achieving our common goals.</p>
        <p>Chief responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lies with the Security Council. It is therefore essential to its legitimacy that its membership reflect the state of the world. It must be enlarged to include new permanent members, for it needs the presence of major countries. France is thinking, naturally, of Germany and Japan, but also of some leading countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. It needs additional elected countries, as well, in order to make the Council more representative still. . . . This reform should be accompanied by a strengthening of the Council's authority.</p>
        <p>It is the role of the Council to set the bounds to the use of force. No one is entitled to arrogate to himself the right to utilize it unilaterally and preventively.</p>
        <p>Conversely, in the face of mounting threats, states must have an assurance that the Council has appropriate means of evaluation and collective action at its disposal, and that it has the will to act. . . .</p>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, against the risk of a world without order delivered up to violence, let us work to establish one governed by the rule of law.</p>
        <p>Against the injustice and suffering of a world of ever-widening inequalities -- even though it has never been as rich as it is today -- let us choose solidarity.</p>
        <p>Against the chaos of a world shaken by ecological disaster, let us call for a sharing of responsibility, around a United Nations Environmental Organization.</p>
        <p>Against the barbarity of a world in which fundamental rights are trampled on, where the integrity of mankind is under threat, where native peoples -- the heirs to an irreplaceable heritage -- vanish amid silence and indifference, let us uphold the demands of ethics.</p>
