        <p>LEAD: Robert C. McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser, testified today that Michael K. Deaver, after leaving his White House job to become a lobbyist, made an unannounced visit to Mr. McFarlane's White House office even after being told that such a visit would be improper.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Robert C. McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser, testified today that Michael K. Deaver, after leaving his White House job to become a lobbyist, made an unannounced visit to Mr. McFarlane's White House office even after being told that such a visit would be improper.</p>
        <p>Robert C. McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser, testified today that Michael K. Deaver, after leaving his White House job to become a lobbyist, made an unannounced visit to Mr. McFarlane's White House office even after being told that such a visit would be improper.</p>
        <p>Under questioning by Whitney North Seymour Jr., the independent prosecutor in Mr. Deaver's perjury trial in Federal District Court here, Mr. McFarlane said he could not recall the subject of Mr. Deaver's 10-minute visit to his office on July 17, 1985.</p>
        <p>''He had no appointment,'' Mr. McFarlane said today after identifying Mr. Deaver's name on a visitor log kept by his secretary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver had retained his White House pass when he resigned as deputy White House chief of staff more than two months earlier, on May 10, 1985, to form Michael K. Deaver &amp; Associates Inc. A year later, in May 1986. he turned in the pass, with its right to unannounced access to White House offices and tennis courts, Deaver aides said at the time, adding that ''people have misunderstood it.'' Trial Enters Third Week</p>
        <p>Mr. McFarlane, in testimony marking the start of the third week of the trial, said he had told Mr. Deaver that a White House lawyer believed it was improper for the lobbyist to telephone or visit the national security adviser at the White House. The testimony added weight to the prosecution's charge that Mr. Deaver had lied to a House subcommittee and later to a Federal grand jury in denying lobbying contacts with Mr. McFarlane after leaving the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver is not charged with violating the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, which forbids conflict-of-interest contacts with former government associates for at least a year after leaving a government post. But he has been charged with perjury to cover up a series of such meetings with Administration officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. McFarlane's testimony today covered two parts of the five-count indictment against Mr. Deaver. One count accuses him of lying under oath in denying that he participated, while he was still a White House official, in meetings that helped shape United States policy on controlling acid rain in Canada. Another charges him with falsely denying contacts with Administration offcials on the retention of a Federal tax benefit for corporations in Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver, as head of his consulting concern, obtained a contract from the Canadian Government in 1985 that brought him $100,000 a year. He also obtained another contract for $150,000 from Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Company, the New York investment banking firm, to help salvage the Puerto Rican tax provision. Smith Barney sought to preserve a tax inducement for manufacturers on the United States mainland to encourage the construction of new plants in Puerto Rico, a business the investment company handled. 'Mental Aberrations' Cited</p>
        <p>To prove the perjury counts, the prosecution must show that Mr. Deaver had a motive for making ''knowing false statements.'' Mr. Deaver's attorneys have said they may try to show that their client, whom they have said was an alcoholic, suffered ''mental aberrations'' that caused a loss of memory of any improper contacts.</p>
        <p>Under questioning today by prosecutors, two other witnesses challenged Mr. Deaver's denials of a conflict of interest in working for the Canadian Government as a private client after participating in meetings in the White House early in 1985, when the Administration's was shaping its acid rain policies in preparation for a meeting in March 1985 between Mr. Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada.</p>
        <p>Later in 1985 Mr. Deaver denied under oath that he had participated in the Administration's early planning of the Canadian meeting.</p>
        <p>But Robert M. Kimmitt, a former executive secretary of the National Security Council, identified documents that placed Mr. Deaver at three White House meetings in preparation for the meeting with Mr. Mulroney. Talks With Special Envoy</p>
        <p>After one meeting Mr. Kimmit scribbled a note saying, ''Deaver is still keen on the appointment special representatives'' by the United States and Canada to pursue the acid rain impasse.</p>
        <p>Telephone logs introduced in evidence today also showed that Mr. Deaver had talked to Drew Lewis, the first Secretary of Transportation in the Reagan Administration, the day before Mr. Lewis's appointment as the United States special envoy on the acid rain problem.</p>
        <p>Paul H. Robinson, a Chicago businessman who was the United States Ambassador to Canada until September 1985, testified that in a visit to Quebec in November 1984 Mr. Deaver had been the target of a ''very strong pitch'' on the need for bilateral action on the acid rain problem by Allan E. Gotlieb, the Canadian Ambassador to the United States.</p>
        <p>''Offhandedly,'' Mr. Robinson testified, Mr. Deaver told him to ''see what we can do about this, and try not to bureaucratize it.''</p>
