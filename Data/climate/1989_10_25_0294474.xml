        <p>LEAD: There was Morgan Fairchild, her golden mane unusually prim and preppy, lecturing the self-deprecatingly pompous anchor Murphy Brown, also known as Candice Bergen, about the environment. A funny flip-flop of stereotypes, of sorts; a sitcom turned morality tale.</p>
        <p>There was Morgan Fairchild, her golden mane unusually prim and preppy, lecturing the self-deprecatingly pompous anchor Murphy Brown, also known as Candice Bergen, about the environment. A funny flip-flop of stereotypes, of sorts; a sitcom turned morality tale.</p>
        <p>Truth to tell, as many in Hollywood can attest, Morgan Fairchild knows her stuff far better than most real television anchors, and has for a long time. She can speak passionately and in detail about the ozone layer and acid rain, and she and a handful of others, like Jane Fonda, Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand, were doing it before a lot of the rest of their colleagues got on the environmental bandwagon.</p>
        <p>But on they are. It's the choicest express in town, spearheaded by two new hometown groups: the Environmental Media Association, brainchild of the producer Norman Lear and his wife, Lyn, and the Earth Communications Office, run by Bonnie Reiss, an entertainment lawyer who is co-founder of the powerful Hollywood Women's Political Caucus. Many a night in many a lovely home or smart restaurant donated for the occasion you can have a lecture on toxic wastes or global warming along with your chardonnay or Perrier. As a producer said: ''If you're out of work, you can live off the environment in this town. Every day of the week now there's a breakfast, lunch or dinner.''</p>
        <p>That might be a little overstated, but indeed the two groups have made their presence felt. Both have the same general goal: to make Hollywood environmentally aware with briefings, lectures and the like. The hope is that the industry will then see fit to lace its movies and TV shows like ''Murphy Brown'' with at least occasional save-the-planet fervor.</p>
        <p>The two groups started out as one under the Earth Communications Office rubric, a united team of new-age environmentalists. But they parted ways earlier this year over different visions of the organization's future. The Lears, in effect, took the high-priced road, giving birth to an elite group: 35 industry high rollers like Robert Redford, the Disney chairman Michael Eisner and his wife, Jane, and the presidents of the three major networks, each pitching in somewhere around $25,000, some more, some less.</p>
        <p>Bonnie Reiss, whom friends describe as an environmental evangelist, the Aimee Semple McPherson of the movement, took the mid-level industry types. With a 90-person board, in for $5,000 a head, she wanted a much bigger to-do. Lots of chapters, lots of action, lots of evenings, lots of trips like this summer's fact-finding outing to the Amazon that included Tom Cruise, Mimi Rogers and John Ritter, among others.</p>
        <p>''I had this great awareness,'' Ms. Reiss said. ''It was like 'Field of Dreams.' If you do this, it will happen. I was at this global warming conference in Washington and after listening to them all for three days, I finally raised my hand and said: 'Excuse me. This is overwhelming. You're telling me that the globe is going to warm more in the next 50 years than it has in the past 10,000, and the hole in the ozone is now the size of the United States of America, and we're losing the rain forests at the rate of one football field a second - wouldn't one mention of any of this on ''The Cosby Show'' do more than all your scientific books combined?' ''</p>
        <p>Longtime-in-the-trenches environmentalists are skeptical, to put it politely. Bob Hattoy, the regional director in Los Angeles of the Sierra Club, goes around saying he doesn't want to turn environmental issues over to people who make ''Celebrity Bowling'' or ''Who's the Sheriff?''</p>
        <p>''I feel like a Greek chorus out here,'' he said, ''but when Hollywood finds an issue they tend to trivialize it and homogenize it. Sure we need the money and we love pretty people in on the issues. But the industry as a whole wasn't here two years ago, and they probably won't be here two years from now. It's the cause of the week, just like the disease of the week or justice of the week. E.M.A. and E.C.O. are trying to bring the industry along, but it's a little like trying to move Jell-O.''</p>
        <p>Not exactly battle lines, not exactly not. All these people, the old-timers and the Hollywood late-comers, are overlapping now at various functions, skirmishing to get comfortable together. In fairness, the hard-core environmental agitants-litigants on the East Coast like the Natural Resources Defense Council, which recently opened an office in Los Angeles, and the Environmental Defense Fund are doing some elbowing of their own now. They're trying to get pieces of this new Hollywood action, even if they do tend to look down their noses at it a bit. It's regional theater with a global reach.</p>
        <p>The one event all groups seem poised for is Earth Day 1990, a worldwide celebration on April 22, 20 years after the original. But whether Hollywood's crush on the earth has staying power and is not, as one amused critic said, another 10-minute hand-holding across America, waits to be seen. Clearly a lot of people out here are genuinely concerned; and just as clearly a lot more of our TV families are going to be recycling their bottles and newspapers and finding ways to lecture us on the greenhouse effect. Stay tuned.</p>
