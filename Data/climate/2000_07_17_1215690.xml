        <p>So what can we do about global warming?</p>
        <p>First, keep in mind the goal, which is to bring the potentially catastrophic warming under control by curtailing the release of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Ordinary people can help immediately by becoming more energy efficient. Stop using the familiar incandescent light bulbs and replace them with compact fluorescent bulbs, which last much longer and use only a quarter of the energy consumed by conventional bulbs.</p>
        <p>Compact fluorescent bulbs are significantly more expensive, but because they last so long (up to 10 times the life of a standard bulb) and use so little electricity, they are substantially cheaper in the long run.</p>
        <p>Next, when shopping for an appliance -- a refrigerator, a dishwasher, an air-conditioner -- select the one with the highest energy efficiency rating. There will be a sticker on the appliance, telling you how much energy it uses. Pay attention. There can be a difference of 30 percent to 40 percent or more in the amount of energy consumed by appliances with comparable features.</p>
        <p>Even more important is the choice you make in the car or truck you buy. Motor vehicles are responsible for about a third of the carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. The vehicles that are the most fuel efficient emit the least carbon dioxide. (Fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions are inversely proportional. If you double fuel economy, you cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.)</p>
        <p>According to the research and advocacy group Environmental Defense, if you buy a new car that gets 10 more miles per gallon than your old car, the amount of carbon dioxide reduction realized in one year will be about 2,500 pounds.</p>
        <p>So buying a car or truck that suits your needs and is fuel efficient is a big help.</p>
        <p>Honda and Toyota are bringing so-called hybrid vehicles onto the market in the U.S. Hybrids are cars that combine an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric motor. They are mid-sized cars that are achieving twice the fuel economy of conventional cars.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, summed the matter up as follows: ''The issue is not so much what we are doing, but how we power what we are doing. That's the first step.''</p>
        <p>Over the long term, the requirements are far more ambitious. Ideally, over the course of the next 100 or so years, a transformation will take place and most energy will end up coming not from fossil fuels like coal and oil, but from clean energy sources -- the sun, the wind, hydrogen and non-polluting fuel cells.</p>
        <p>''To get there at a cost that's affordable will require substantial technological development,'' said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, the chief scientist of Environmental Defense.</p>
        <p>To move from our pollution-choked present to a future in which climate change is not a mortal threat will take more than that all-important first step of an enlightened citizenry buying cleaner cars and more efficient appliances. Tough action by Congress and the president is needed, and soon. And international cooperation, with enforceable agreements covering both industrialized and, ultimately, developing nations, will be crucial.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the federal government can offer subsidies and other incentives to reduce the cost and foster the use of existing clean-energy technology, and to encourage the development of ever more efficient new technologies. And the government can -- and should -- develop more sophisticated strategies like emissions trading and more stringent requirements for reducing carbon dioxide emissions everywhere.</p>
        <p>Global warming is the most serious problem we face in the 21st century. Last week an intensive analysis by a respected geologist at Texas A&amp;M University suggested -- as most scientists have been saying for some time now -- that human activity, not natural factors, is the primary cause of the warming.</p>
        <p>We caused the problem and we have within our grasp a variety of potential solutions. To ignore those solutions, to be aware of them but not make use of them, is not just profoundly destructive, it's suicidal.</p>
