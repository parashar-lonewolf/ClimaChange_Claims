        <p>FORD says its 2003 Expedition has 123 innovations, a number that seems exaggerated if you hew to the dictionary, which defines an innovation as ''something newly introduced; a new method, custom, device.''

        <p>FORD says its 2003 Expedition has 123 innovations, a number that seems exaggerated if you hew to the dictionary, which defines an innovation as ''something newly introduced; a new method, custom, device.'' Some of the features are not truly new, for they have been incorporated into cars or trucks before. These include second-row seats that recline, second-row captain's chairs, an aluminum engine block and electronic brake-force distribution.</p>
        <p>But even if you disregard those items and some others, several true innovations remain on the list. By Ford's count, 27 of the advancements are either exclusive or are ''best in class'' designs. This is not just hype; those features move the Expedition well ahead of the competition in full-size sport utilities.</p>
        <p>The previous Expedition, introduced as a 1997 model, quickly became the best-selling big S.U.V. It also earned the government's highest front-crash ratings (five stars) for driver and passenger, and it did well in quality surveys by J. D. Power &amp; Associates.</p>
        <p>The 2003 model has been nearly completely redesigned. So has the Lincoln Navigator, a more luxurious vehicle that shares most of its mechanical parts with the Expedition.</p>
        <p>The new Expedition comes in two basic lines, with either two- or four-wheel drive. Base prices for the XLT range from $31,295 (rear drive, Value trim and 4.6-liter V-8 engine) to $39,535 (four-wheel-drive, Premium trim and 5.4-liter V-8). The Eddie Bauer line starts at $37,790.</p>
        <p>All Expeditions have a feature no other large S.U.V. (except the Navigator) can match: a third-row seat that folds into the floor. Eddie Bauer models can be ordered with power controls for that seat ($455) so it can be raised or folded by touching a button.</p>
        <p>The Expedition's most significant improvement -- an independent rear suspension -- is hidden from view, though one can see and feel its ramifications. Because full-size S.U.V.'s from other companies have bulky solid rear axles, their ride, handling and interior packaging are all products of compromise. But the independent suspension -- with each wheel reacting to bumps without affecting the opposite wheel -- opened up a host of possibilities for engineers. They made the Expedition's ride more supple and the springs stiffer, for better control and less wallow. The handling is responsive for such a large vehicle, with little of the sway or ''body roll'' of previous models. The body is lower, improving stability and making it easier to get in and out. Yet ground clearance increased, enhancing the Expedition's off-road capability. A new rack-and-pinion steering system also helps the handling.</p>
        <p>All these improvements have resulted in a nearly three-ton vehicle that handles surprisingly well and rides much like a modern sedan.</p>
        <p>Attention was also paid to interior noise, which is often excessive in large S.U.V.'s. A smoother body and better sealing have reduced wind and road noise to the levels that I'd expect of a passenger car.</p>
        <p>Although highway manners are important in this class, so is off-road capability, at least for a minority of customers. The basic four-wheel-drive system, ControlTrac, lets the driver switch among four settings: rear drive, which provides the best fuel economy; part-time four-wheel drive; full-time four-wheel drive, which divides torque from rear to front, depending on which wheels are slipping; and low-range four-wheel drive, for extreme off-roading.</p>
        <p>For $795 more, the AdvanceTrac option adds electronic braking at each wheel. This enables the Expedition to move in mud or snow if only one wheel has traction. AdvanceTrac also serves an an electronic stability control, applying individual brakes to straighten the truck out if sensors detect that it is starting to spin out of control. This is especially crucial in S.U.V.'s, which are more likely than cars to roll over.</p>
        <p>The new Expedition has the largest brakes in its class, and along with an antilock feature they incorporate a brake assist feature, which helps to reduce stopping distances by applying the brakes at full force in panic stops. (Testing has found that drivers tend to hesitate when they ought to slam the brake pedal and hold it.) I found the brakes effective, smooth and confidence-inspiring.</p>
        <p>Both V-8 engines are carried over from last year. Since power is important in this class, most buyers are likely to choose the 5.4-liter engine. It does not have quite the horsepower of its General Motors competitors, but it does have more torque, especially at the lower engine speeds that are especially important when towing trailers. The Expedition's towing capacity of 8,900 pounds is the best in its class.</p>
        <p>On vacation in the mountains, I found the larger V-8 provided adequate, but not excessive, performance. The four-speed automatic transmission impressed me; not only did it shift smoothly at all times, it seemed to anticipate and select the appropriate gear when the truck was climbing steep and moderate grades.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, fuel economy is miserable. I averaged less than 15 miles a gallon on the highway, and about 12 m.p.g. in town. Bad as this is, the competition is no better.</p>
        <p>For those interested in environmental issues -- an unlikely consideration among those buying gas-swillers like this -- both engines have ULEV (ultra-low emission) ratings. Of course, the carbon dioxide produced by burning all that gasoline is not part of the equation.</p>
        <p>The interior packaging is commendable. Getting rid of the solid axle freed up space between the rear wheels, allowing the third seat to be folded completely into the floor. Perhaps more important, the rearmost seat has enough room to allow three adults to sit with their legs in a normal position. The third seats of big S.U.V.'s from G.M. and Toyota are cushions that essentially rest on the floor with little real legroom. The Expedition's third seat is also split in a 60-40 proportion for more versatility.</p>
        <p>The designers did not stop there. The second-row bench is split 40-20-40, with each part folding separately, and the center section can be moved as much as 11 inches forward. (This makes it easier, for instance, for someone up front to reach an infant buckled into a child seat in the center position.) This three-part bench not only tumbles forward to permit entry to the rear, but all the sections fold to form a level cargo floor.</p>
        <p>Although the interior is well laid out, the pieces fit well and the quality of the materials is good, I had a few gripes about the controls and displays. The column-mounted shifter hides the four-wheel-drive selector and obscures the trip-computer switches. I like to monitor the fuel economy and outside temperature while I drive, but the Expedition requires you to call up those selections separately, using small, fussy switches. Certainly on a vehicle in this class, the outside temperature could remain displayed all the time.</p>
        <p>Adjustable brake and accelerator pedals are useful, and the Expedition makes full use of available safety technology. The front air bags adjust for how the driver is sitting and what the passenger weighs. The front and rear bumper beams have been lowered to match car bumpers better. Perhaps most important on an S.U.V. -- and a first in this class -- is an optional safety canopy air bag ($580) designed to deploy in a rollover.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: Innovative? Let us count the ways.</p>
