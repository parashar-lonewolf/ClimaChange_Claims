        <p>Sending Al Gore to Capitol Hill to get his administration's legislative program enacted in 100 days, as Gov. Bill Clinton promised to do Friday, could be the most substantive use ever of the historically trivial job of Vice President.</p>
        <p>Like most veteran lawmakers, Mr. Gore knows the legislative ropes and understands compromise, timetables and the other things that get bills passed. If Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore win, their party is all but certain to remain in control of Congress. And with Democrats there starving for an administration with generally similar goals, Mr. Gore might encounter little of the sort of institutional friction that has sometimes made it hard for Vice Presidents to play any Congressional role beyond the constitutional one of breaking ties in the Senate.</p>

        <p>Sending Al Gore to Capitol Hill to get his administration's legislative program enacted in 100 days, as Gov. Bill Clinton promised to do Friday, could be the most substantive use ever of the historically trivial job of Vice President.</p>
        <p>Like most veteran lawmakers, Mr. Gore knows the legislative ropes and understands compromise, timetables and the other things that get bills passed. If Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore win, their party is all but certain to remain in control of Congress. And with Democrats there starving for an administration with generally similar goals, Mr. Gore might encounter little of the sort of institutional friction that has sometimes made it hard for Vice Presidents to play any Congressional role beyond the constitutional one of breaking ties in the Senate.</p>
        <p>But the first-100-days mission has little in common with what is most distinctive about Mr. Gore's eight years in the House and nearly eight in the Senate. Congressional Futurist</p>
        <p>What he has been known for as a lawmaker has been a long view. Most politicians spend their time on crises, trying to solve immediate problems, but Mr. Gore is as close as American politics comes to a futurist, looking ahead, especially in scientific and technological areas and in trying to keep crises from occurring.</p>
        <p>In 1981, for example, he held a House hearing on global warming, an issue he has pursued ever since. In 1982 he emerged from a yearlong immersion in arms-control issues to urge the abolition of multiple-warhead missiles as a way to reduce the appeal of a nuclear first strike. That principle was enshrined in the treaty President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signed last month.</p>
        <p>He enjoyed more legislative success in the House than in the Senate. In 1980 he was a prime mover in creating the Superfund to clean up toxic waste dumps, and in 1984 he was the sponsor of legislation creating an organ transplant network.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, he secured passage of a bill to phase out chemicals that deplete the ozone layer and a measure to establish a national high-speed computer network to make the nation's most powerful computers more widely accessible to universities and other research institutions.</p>
        <p>If he has less of a record in the Senate, it is partly because he took time away from the job and partly because of differences between the two houses of Congress. It is harder to make a quick splash in the Senate. Presidential Run Costly</p>
        <p>In his first two years in the Senate, he was in the minority. Then his Presidential candidacy in 1988 preoccupied him for more than a year. It may have cost him more than time. As one colleague said on Friday, "To come here in your first term and run for President, that sets people's teeth on edge."</p>
        <p>He also took time to write his best-selling book on the environment, "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit" (Houghton Mifflin, 1992), and to be with his son, Albert 3d, who was nearly killed in an automobile accident in 1989 when he was 6 years old.</p>
        <p>But the Senate itself, though far more hospitable to newcomers than it used to be, still makes people wait their turn. Mr. Gore sits on two significant committees, Armed Services and Commerce, and heads a Commerce subcommittee that has not had wide influence. In contrast, a senior Senator, Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, sits on three important committees, Labor, Judiciary and Armed Services. He heads the Labor Committee and subcommittees on the other two.</p>
        <p>The style of the two bodies differs, too. The manner of the Senate is stiffer, more formal than the House, though its rules are less structured. A close friend, Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat, said Friday: "He enjoyed the House more. It's a better place. It's a more human place." Steady but Flexible</p>
        <p>There has been little discernible shift in Mr. Gore's interests or in his positions, although sometimes the context in which an issue is debated has moved him from one side to the other.</p>
        <p>Abortion is a prominent example. In his eight years in the House, the crucial voting issue was whether Federal funds could be used to pay for poor women's abortions under Medicare. Mr. Gore was opposed. But in recent years his votes have opposed other sorts of restrictions on abortion. And as a co-sponsor of the Freedom of Choice bill, which is designed to prohibit most state curbs on abortion, he is now quite acceptable to abortion-rights advocates and decidedly unacceptable to opponents of abortion rights.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore came to the House in 1977, his background as a reporter in Nashville gave him an edge on other young House Democrats as they competed for attention and influence. He knew how to make an issue interesting to newspapers and television. Ratings Reflect Liberalism</p>
        <p>On the House Commerce Committee, he pursued a populist agenda, challenging businesses for price gouging and threats to public health. His voting record was moderately on the liberal side. His votes, as rated by the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, ranged from a low of 40 percent in agreement with the organization to a high of 74, with several years around 70. The Chamber of Commerce of the United States, in contrast, found him over 41 percent just once, and usually well below that mark.</p>
        <p>His voting record in the Senate has been rated between 55 and 78 with the Americans for Democratic Action; it has wobbled between 17 and 60 with the Chamber of Commerce, not dramatically different from his ratings as a member of the House.</p>
        <p>A notable thing he did in the House was study. As the nuclear-freeze movement began in 1981, he became concerned about widespread expectations of nuclear war. He asked to be put on the Intelligence Committee. Once there, Mr. Gore undertook a year of tutored lessons to learn the issues before coming forward in March 1982 with his speech proposing to ban multiple-warhead missiles.</p>
        <p>He carried his argument to the relatively closed community of arms control experts and held his own. His House speech attracted interest from the Soviet Government before the American Government cared, but in time he influenced policy on issues like basic disarmament strategy, weapons choices and anti-ballistic missiles.</p>
        <p>He easily won his Senate seat in 1984 when Senator Howard Baker, a Republican who is now retired, stepped down. Both sought Presidential nominations in 1988, and both failed badly. Mr. Gore failed to fashion a coherent set of arguments for his candidacy.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, he went first to the Commerce and Governmental Affairs Committees, dropping the latter to pick up Armed Services in 1987 so he could continue to pursue arms control issues.</p>
        <p>On the Commerce Committee he heads the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space, which he has used to oversee NASA and to push legislation like the computer network measure.</p>
        <p>But with the Senate's rules hospitable to amendments on the floor, he has achieved leadership on an issue beyond the jurisdiction of his committees: the environment. A measure of his standing was that he led the Senate's delegation to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. 'Almost Scholarly'</p>
        <p>"I don't know of any legislator on the environment who has more knowledge of it than he does," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee. "He's moved in on it."</p>
        <p>Senator John C. Danforth, the Missourian who is the senior Republican on the Commerce Committee, calls Mr. Gore's knowledge of the environment "almost scholarly." And he admires Mr. Gore's tenacity in hearings: "When he engages witnesses, it's not just a few superficial questions that have been prepared by a staffer."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's most prominent vote in the Senate was probably his support for giving President Bush authority to go to war against Iraq on Jan. 12, 1991. Of all the Democratic members of Congress who seemed like potential Presidential candidates at the time, he was the only one to vote for war. Last summer he said he would not seek the Presidency this year because he wanted to spend time with his family.</p>
        <p>Colleagues like Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Danforth say they are struck by his intelligence and his seriousness. They admire his ability to master a subject, but sometimes wish he wouldn't share all he knows.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Downey put it, more positively, "He's most excited when he's explaining some concept he's just learned to you."</p>
