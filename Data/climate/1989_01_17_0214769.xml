        <p>LEAD: A bipartisan group of Congressmen is urging President-elect George Bush to delay an Interior Department sale of water rights in California because the department had declined to analyze the environmental consequences.</p>
        <p>A bipartisan group of Congressmen is urging President-elect George Bush to delay an Interior Department sale of water rights in California because the department had declined to analyze the environmental consequences.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent to Mr. Bush last Tuesday, the lawmakers urged him to delay renewing a 40-year-old contract to provide water from Federal reservoirs to a water district in the Central Valley of California.</p>
        <p>It was signed by Senators Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, and Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, and Representatives George Miller, Democrat of California, and Thomas E. Petri, Republican of Wisconsin. All four have shown a consistent interest in overhauling Federal water policy.</p>
        <p>The Congressmen complained that the Interior Department was ignoring environmental and economic considerations. They said the renewal would set a bad precedent and ''threaten the integrity'' of a law requiring that Federal agencies examine the environmental consequences of their actions. Setting a Pattern</p>
        <p>They also charged, ''These contract decisions are being made precipitously in the waning days of the outgoing Administration.''</p>
        <p>The contract in dispute, under which water rights would be renewed for the Orange Cove Irrigation District, is the first to come up for renewal among 300 long-term contracts to deliver hundreds of billions of gallons of water to farmers and communities in the Central Valley. The contracts date to the 1940's.</p>
        <p>James Moore, chief of the water and power division for the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation operations in California, said the long-term water contracts must be renewed automatically under a law passed by Congress in 1956. The department inteprets the law as meaning that the renewed contracts are exempt from the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires that all major Federal actions be reviewed for their potential impact on the environment.</p>
        <p>But members of Congress, along with private environmental groups as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department's own Fish and Wildlife Service, disagree that there is such an exemption. They said an environmental study should be required as a condition of renewing the contract.</p>
        <p>Noting that conditions have changed over 40 years, the members of Congress contended that a renewed contract should reflect the environmental consequences of the water lease and the need of California cities for water. They said it should encourage conservation among the Central Valley growers who receive the water.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, who initiated the letter, said in a separate statement, ''The message is that today's water policies require fiscal and environmental scrutiny that seemed unnecessary 40 years ago.''</p>
        <p>He said renewal of the contract without an environmental study ''is fiscally irresponsibile and environmentally indefensible.''</p>
        <p>Hal Candee, a lawyer who is a water expert for the Natural Resource Defense Council, an environmental group, said, ''The Interior Department is rushing to push through the first precedent-setting contract before this Administration leaves office.'' Conserving Scarce Water</p>
        <p>He said that since the National Environmental Policy Act would supersede any exemption given the water contract and that an environmental impact study would show great opportunities for protecting the valley and its waters from polluted runoff while also demonstrating opportunities for conserving scarce water in California.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moore of the Reclamation Bureau said: ''We are basically maintaining the status quo with the contract. There has been a demonstration over a period of years that the districts have used the water beneficially. We are not aware of any substantial environmental impacts as a result of providing this water.''</p>
        <p>In another development involving the National Environmental Policy Act, a decision has been put off on whether to adopt a rule requiring Federal agencies to analyze the effect of their actions on global warming linked to polution. B. J. Cooper, a White House spokesman, said the decision would be left to the President-elect because of his ''specific concerns about the environment.''</p>
        <p>The warming process is widely believed to be taking place because industrial gases are trapping radiation from the sun in the atmosphere, creating conditions like those of a greenhouse.</p>
        <p>The law now requires agencies to assess the environmental effects of their actions in the area where their actions take place. Under the proposed rule, now deferred, the agencies would also be required to review actions that might affect the worldwide environment, like air pollution contributing to global warming.</p>
        <p>Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, called the White House decision ''mistaken, shortsighted and extremely harmful.''</p>
