        <p>LEAD: The United States launched a $54.5 million satellite early today that will study weather conditions and make spy photographs, space agency officials said.</p>
        <p>The United States launched a $54.5 million satellite early today that will study weather conditions and make spy photographs, space agency officials said.</p>
        <p>The NOAA-11 satellite thundered aloft at 3:02 A.M. aboard a $9.5 million refurbished General Dynamics Atlas E rocket that once served as an intercontinental missile carrying a nuclear warhead.</p>
        <p>Besides photographing the Earth for United States intelligence agencies as well as for weather forecasters, the satellite is designed to track hurricanes, locate lost ships and planes and study global warming and damage to the earth's ozone shield.</p>
        <p>The rocket ''went up right on schedule, it looked like a perfect launch,'' said Jan Cooksey of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration office here. ''Everything is looking great so far.'' 'Quite a Loud Rumble'</p>
        <p>The satellite reached orbit about 540 miles high circling the Earth over the poles at 3:27 A.M., said Mort Fleischmann, a spokesman for the General Electric Company, which built the satellite.</p>
        <p>''We have kind of an overcast sky up here at Vandenberg, so from our viewing sight it was a bit strong and kind of a rosy glow in the hillside,'' said Franklin O'Donnell, a NASA spokesman. ''Then we caught the actual launch vehicle going up and there was quite a loud rumble.''</p>
        <p>The satellite, designed to circle the earth every 102 minutes, will replace the aging NOAA-9 satellite launched on Dec. 12, 1984, and will join NOAA-10, launched on Sept. 17, 1986. The NOAA-series satellites photograph the entire globe every 12 hours as the Earth rotates beneath them.</p>
        <p>Krishna Rao, research director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellite service, said NOAA-9 must be replaced because some of its temperature and humidity sensors failed and ''some other instruments are not up to par.'' Emergency Distress Signals</p>
        <p>The space agency launched the new satellite for the oceanic and atmospheric agency, the parent agency of the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischmann, the General Electric spokesman, said the satellite was built to monitor icebergs, measure temperatures and humidity at all levels of the earth's atmosphere and relay temperature, pressure and altitude information collected by 2,000 weather stations.</p>
        <p>Like the NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 satellites and two Soviet navigation satellites, NOAA-11 carries an instrument that detects emergency distress signals from lost or disabled ships and downed planes. The satellite can then relay the signals to rescue units.</p>
        <p>Since 1982 the system has saved more than 1,150 people worldwide after plane crashes, shipwrecks and even dogsled races that went awry, spokesmen for the space agency and the oceanic and atmospheric agency said. Global Warming to Be Studied</p>
        <p>The new satellite was also built to study the warming of the earth's atmosphere, caused by carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>As the earth slowly warms, there should be more clouds and humidity in the atmosphere, and those can be measured by instruments aboard the satellite, Mr. Rao of the oceanic and atmospheric agency said.</p>
        <p>Scientists fear that the warming may cause droughts in farm areas and increase melting of the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and inundating coastal communities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rao said NOAA-11 also carried an instrument designed to measure ozone gas levels around the world and at various altitudes, allowing scientists to monitor the extent and location of ozone loss.</p>
        <p>Ozone is the main constituent of smog at ground level, but ozone in the upper atmosphere shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.</p>
