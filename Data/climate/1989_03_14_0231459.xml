        <p>LEAD: The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing bold actions for the next decade to delay and lessen the expected warming of the earth from industrial gases accumulating in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing bold actions for the next decade to delay and lessen the expected warming of the earth from industrial gases accumulating in the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>In a report prepared for Congress, the agency is offering the first specific options from any government agency for mitigating the expected warming. Possible steps, the report said, were a sharp rise in car mileage, a similarly steep drop in energy use in homes, and fees on the use of oil, coal and natural gas.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, Congress and the international community will study and debate the proposals before deciding whether to approve any of them. William K. Reilly, Administrator of the E.P.A., called the report ''a very important first step to focus domestic and international attention on policy options for dealing with global warming.'' Measures to Discourage Use</p>
        <p>The report, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, made these recommendations to deal with the so-called greenhouse effect:</p>
        <p>* An international effort to require all new autos produced around the world to achieve an average of at least 40 miles per gallon of gasoline.</p>
        <p>* Requiring all automobiles in industrial countries to install catalytic converters, like those required in the United States, to reduce gases from tailpipe emissions.</p>
        <p>* Taking measures that would reduce the amount of fuel it takes to heat single family homes to half the amount used in 1980.</p>
        <p>* Stopping net global deforestation by planting at least as many trees as are felled. Trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.</p>
        <p>* Imposing fees on coal, oil and natural gas to provide economic incentives to shift away from the use of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>* Accelerating research to develop solar power to compete with oil and natural gas.</p>
        <p>* Sharply increased use of wood and other vegetation, grown on plantations dedicated to that purpose, as a replacement for fossil fuels in the production of energy. Vegetation used for fuel produces far less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels do.</p>
        <p>* End all use of chlorofluorocarbons, industrial chemicals that contribute to global warming as well as to the depletion of the earth's protective ozone shield. Gases Trap Radiation</p>
        <p>The rate and magnitude of the expected global warming will depend on a number of factors. But scientists frequently cite a range of 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit as the most likely average increase in global temperature by the middle of the next century.</p>
        <p>The major gases that play a part in the greenhouse effect are carbon dioxide - largely from the burning of fossil fuels - methane, chlorofluorcarbons and nitrous oxides. These gases trap infrared radiation from the sun that would otherwise escape back into space, and thus cause the surface of the earth to warm.</p>
        <p>The report notes that many scientific uncertainties surround the timing and magnitude of the greenhouse effect. But a scientific consensus holds that the buildup of gases will cause substantial warming of the earth in the next century, and the E.P.A. warns that action must be taken now, not after all the uncertainties are resolved. 'Draconian' Measures</p>
        <p>Agency officials said that the recommended measures would not reverse but only slow the buildup of greehnouse gases. The agency did not propose measures that would stop the buildup because they would have to be ''draconian,'' one agency official said.</p>
        <p>One example of such a draconian measure, the official said, would be to bar all combustion of coal, which could have severe economic consequences.</p>
        <p>''A lot more analysis will have to be done on the economic and social costs'' of this and other options, Mr. Reilly said.</p>
        <p>Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Environmental Protection Subcommittee, said he would hold hearings on global climate change in early April, after the E.P.A. Science Advisory Board finishes its review of the report.</p>
