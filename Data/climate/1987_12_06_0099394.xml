        <p>THE GREAT JOURNEY  The Peopling of Ancient America. By Brian M. Fagan. Illustrated. 288 pp. New York: Thames &amp; Hudson. $19.95. BRIAN FAGAN sees the origin of the native Americans as an archeological detective story seeking answers to a series of questions: who were the first Americans, where did they come from and by which route did they migrate, and why did they move and above all when? There are many detectives, some overenthusiastic and a few eccentric, but most of them are dedicated, painstaking and impartial scholars. They have had to struggle with fragmentary and inadequate clues. None has yet found the ''smoking gun'' - an archeological site in the right place on the migration route, with plenty of datable material of sufficient antiquity and in sufficiently undisputed context to prove the validity of one given theory.</p>
        <p>As a curtain-raiser Mr. Fagan mentions a few of the early theories about the origins of the American Indians, including their being survivors of Atlantis, lost tribes of Israel (and many more fanciful ideas not included in this book). The 16th-century Jesuit Jose de Acosta made the brilliant guess that the Indians had reached the New World overland from Asia, in small groups of ''savage hunters driven from their homelands by starvation or some other hardship.'' It was not until the middle of the 19th century that scholars such as Samuel Haven, the author of ''Archeology of the United States,'' disposed of any idea that the Mound Builders were members of an ancient advanced civilization. Haven concluded that the first American Indian arrived in remote antiquity, probably across the Bering Strait since ''all their characteristic affinities are found in the early conditions of Asiatic races.''</p>
        <p>For the first act of his archeological drama, Mr. Fagan, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, moves us swiftly back to the very origins of mankind. A riddle is what caused human beings - so few in number in their early evolution and with so much attractive territory at their disposal - to move toward the terribly inhospitable wastes of northeastern Siberia. It is a strength of this book that its author is familiar with a wide range of researches from different countries and periods and from a spectrum of different disciplines. In an effort to determine whether the migrants came from far eastern Asia or by the European-central Asian route, he discusses finds by Soviet archeologists at Siberian sites. The argument appears to be settled in favor of far eastern stock by the physical anthropologist Christy Turner, who works on shapes of fossil human teeth, and by geneticists studying protein in American Indian blood.</p>
        <p>The single most exciting action in this drama was the crossing from Asia into North America. Geologists, oceanographers and meteorologists have combined to show that during some periods of glaciation the shallow Bering Strait was exposed as dry land. Debate rages about the route used by the migrants and whether they moved overland or were capable of crossing stretches of open water. And there is controversy over what kind of place the icy subcontinent of Beringia was. Once again, other disciplines have been brought to bear; and palynology, the study of pollen, ''has illuminated the Bering land bridge like a searchlight.'' But it is still uncertain whether Beringia was harsh frozen silt unsuited to animal grazing or whether there was a patchwork of wetlands and steppelike grass, as has been argued.</p>
        <p>Did the first hunter-gatherers move across Beringia 25,000 years ago, or was it much later? And having crossed unwittingly into the New World, did early man move south along an ice-free corridor between the Laurentide ice sheets of central Canada and the Cordilleran (Rocky Mountains) ones? Mr. Fagan has a fine knowledge of the investigators, their methods and their discoveries; but he has to conclude that ''despite years of patient endeavor, no one has yet found an archaeological site in Alaska and the Yukon that can be securely dated to earlier than about 15,000 years ago.'' Occupation of the Americas before then remains nothing more than a possibility. ''Given the great sophistication of late-twentieth-century archaeology, and the intense search . . . that is underway,'' Mr. Fagan says, ''the question . . . is now closer to resolution than ever before, and may even be solved in our lifetimes.''</p>
        <p>FINALLY ''The Great Journey'' deals with early man after he had moved south. We learn much about hunting and even butchery techniques of Clovis men (named after the site discovered in 1932 at Clovis, N.M.), efficient hunters who flourished on the Great Plains after 11,500 years ago. We move on to the bison hunters, with forays to the Eskimos in the far north and a few references to South America. The author, a rigorous scholar, is cautious about sites where there is confusion about stratigraphy, inconsistency about radiocarbon dating, or a lack of undisputed artifacts in primary stratigraphic context or associated with clear evidence from other disciplines. At times the reader must fight off carbon dates like a bison bombarded by flint heads. But that is small criticism of a book that succeeds in telling a complex story lucidly. This is an admirable introduction to questions that have exercised men ever since the discovery of the Americas.</p>
