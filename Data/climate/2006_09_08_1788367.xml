        <p>Conservative Groups By Wal-Mart's Side  As Wal-Mart Stores struggles to rebut criticism from unions and Democratic leaders, the company has discovered a reliable ally: prominent conservative research groups like the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Manhattan Institute. But in newspaper commentaries and other forums in which they defended Wal-Mart's actions, the groups consistently failed to disclose their ties to the retailer.  BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Lebanese Ports Still Blocked  Commercial planes streamed into Beirut's international airport after Israel formally ended its eight-week air blockade. It did not end its sea blockade as planned, saying restrictions are needed until United Nations forces can enforce an arms embargo on Hezbollah.  PAGE A10</p>
        <p>Five Years Later, a Look at Some of 9/11's Echoes  The echoes of Sept. 11 define Americans in ways barely conceivable five years ago. A Muslim woman's head scarf poses questions of national loyalty. A worker at the Pentagon goes nowhere without a $4.99 flashlight. A city attorney weighs the balance between fighting terrorism and protecting the civil liberties of his constituents. All across America, antiterror grants from the federal government are equipping towns with gleaming fire engines and other emergency gear. Five people in five cities reflect on the nation's road forward.  PAGE A22</p>
        <p>9/11 Show Under Fire  ABC is under growing pressure to re-edit scenes from its mini-series ''The Path to 9/11.'' Also, a review by Alessandra Stanley.  PAGES A18 AND E1</p>
        <p>Federer Reaches Semifinals  Roger Federer defeated James Blake in four sets and gained the semifinals of the United States Open. Federer will face Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, who eliminated Tommy Haas of Germany. SPORTSFRIDAY, PAGE D1</p>
        <p>Denmark Suspects May Walk  Danish investigators are concerned that they may not have strong enough evidence to keep five of seven terrorism suspects in custody. Also, one suspect had sent an e-mail message to a newspaper shortly before his arrest.  PAGE A16</p>
        <p>Wider Silicon Valley Inquiry  The California attorney general's inquiry into the purloining of phone records by agents of Hewlett-Packard has revealed that the monitoring effort began earlier than previously indicated and included journalists as targets.  BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
        <p>Redesigning Crops for Fuel  In an era of $3-a-gallon gasoline and growing concern about global warming from fossil fuels, seed and biotechnology companies see a big new opportunity in developing crops tailored for use in ethanol and other biofuels.  BUSINESS DAY, PAGE C1</p>
