        <p>Window washing ranks high on the list of most hated household tasks, and some glass makers are hoping that this loathing runs deep.</p>
        <p>Today, Pilkington, a British glass maker, is set to outline its American sales plans for a new technology: window glass that cleans itself.</p>
        <p>The company first showed the self-cleaning glass in Britain in February and has been selling it in limited test markets in Ireland and Austria. Pilkington officials said the new glass, which is now being manufactured in Ottawa, Ill., will be available to American consumers later this year.</p>
        <p>But Pilkington will not have the market to itself for long. PPG Industries, a large, Pittsburgh-based glass maker, is working on its own version of the technology, and hopes to have a product on the market soon. Some Japanese companies have also said they are working on self-cleaning windows.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the holy grails of glass manufacturing, windows that clean themselves,'' said Richard W. Karcher, president of Pilkington Building Products North America.</p>
        <p>Although glass makers have visions of self-cleaning skyscrapers and windshields, both Pilkington and PPG are concentrating on the residential market first. Some 60 million residential windows are sold in America each year. Pilkington has about 5 percent of that market, and hopes the self-cleaning technology will increase its share to 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The self-cleaning glass, which Pilkington is calling Activ, will add about 20 percent to the price of basic windows, which typically cost $200 to $600. That makes the self-cleaning glass a more expensive option for home builders and remodelers, skeptics said.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how many working families are going to be able to afford self-cleaning windows anytime soon,'' said Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the Soap and Detergent Association, a trade group.</p>
        <p>Some home builders also wonder about demand for the product.</p>
        <p>''I won't say the technology won't sell, but you won't have people rushing out to change their windows,'' said Alan Hanbury Jr., a home remodeler in Newington, Conn., and chairman of the remodelers' council of the National Association of Home Builders. ''The majority of people will be content to let their windows remain dirty.''</p>
        <p>Pilkington hopes its technology will win over the skeptics. A permanent coating of titanium oxide gives it the self-cleaning properties.</p>
        <p>When water hits most glass it beads up and runs off, and dust particles in rainwater rivulets can leave streaks or spots. The titanium oxide attracts the water and makes it run down the glass in a continuous sheet. That pushes off dirt particles and diffuses dust across the window, rather than clumping it together in droplets. Because this part of the self-cleaning technology requires water, homeowners in dry areas will have to occasionally spray their windows with a garden hose to help the glass clean itself.</p>
        <p>Yet even without water, the glass will in most cases clean itself, Pilkington scientists said. Once the glass is exposed to ultraviolet rays from sunlight for several days the titanium oxide acts as a catalyst slowly breaking down organic dirt into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Pilkington scientists said consumers would be able to watch small smudges slowly disappear.</p>
        <p>Still, the company said it has to be careful not to promise too much.</p>
        <p>''If we oversell it we will be in trouble,'' said Christopher Barry, Pilkington's technical services director. ''Since it is constantly cleaning, it never looks totally spotless like a piece of crystal.''</p>
        <p>PPG is being even more cautious, for now calling its glass low-maintenance rather than self-cleaning. PPG's new product also works by applying a layer of titanium oxide to the surface of the glass to break down dirt and force rainwater to fall evenly down the glass. Jeff Worden, a company spokesman, said PPG expected its new glass would be available ''shortly'' but has not announced any specific date.</p>
        <p>Much of the push to sell self-cleaning glass will come from the companies that make finished windows. The Pacesetter Corporation, based in Omaha, has been experimenting with samples of the Activ glass and hopes to start selling it this year. ''I think it will work for us,'' said Steve Jensen, a vice president at Pacesetter. ''Our average customer is middle aged to retirement aged, and our common theme is minimal maintenance.''</p>
        <p>But the Pella Corporation, a large window maker based in Pella, Iowa, is unsure there will be much demand, especially because many new windows open in ways that make them easy to clean. ''Is this really going to be something consumers want?''' asked Jennifer Grove, a marketing director there.</p>
        <p>A 1999 survey by Better Homes and Gardens magazine reported that readers ranked self-cleaning glass first when asked what home amenity they sought.</p>
        <p>''I have been waiting for this product,'' Joan McCloskey, one of the magazine's editors, said. ''Those of us who have houses with pretty yards really want to bring the outside in.''</p>
