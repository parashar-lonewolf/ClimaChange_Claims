        <p>LEAD: Speeches before the United Nations General Assembly do not typically make history, or policy. Today, President Reagan has a chance to do both. He makes his last address to a U.N. that's far more alive and hopeful than anyone would have dreamed possible when he took office.</p>
        <p>Speeches before the United Nations General Assembly do not typically make history, or policy. Today, President Reagan has a chance to do both. He makes his last address to a U.N. that's far more alive and hopeful than anyone would have dreamed possible when he took office.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the U.N. shows more promise than it has for 40 dreary years. The great powers are feeling cooperative, the third world pragmatic, the U.N. leadership purposeful. The U.N. has helped ease the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, move the Iran-Iraq war toward resolution and bring peace to the Western Sahara. But continued progress will require a continued commitment from member nations.</p>
        <p>Having promised to make good America's U.N. debts - mostly with the next President's money -Mr. Reagan could use his swan song to provide some needed leadership. For example: Despite recent successes, the Security Council remains, in the eyes of most world leaders, a court of last resort. Making the Council effective will require using it systematically. Members could be watching difficult situations, bringing the combatants together for discussion, shaping cooperative policies to head off crisis.</p>
        <p>In the heat of violence in the Persian Gulf, Washington found it hard to take seriously a proposal from Moscow for a U.N-flagged naval force. Let Mr. Reagan now make his own proposal for a cooperative effort aimed at defusing a developing crisis. Economic support for the front-line states threatened by South Africa, for example, would be a wise and decent policy for East and West, and more effective against apartheid than sanctions. Like the Security Council, the U.N.'s peacekeeping apparatus is flaccid with disuse. It must be strengthened if nations in crisis are to look to the U.N. with any hope of an effective response. During the last U.N. session, the Soviet Union suggested several proposals to enhance peacekeeping capabilities. They were vague, and the U.S. took relish in puncturing them. If Mr. Reagan doesn't like Moscow's ideas, here's his chance to offer his own. The U.N. must also prove it can address concerns like health, poverty and the environment. Mr. Reagan has consistently urged a stronger humanitarian role on the organization. Yet the U.S. funnels little of its humanitarian aid through the U.N.</p>
        <p>He would do well to pledge full U.S. backing for some specific projects: the reconstruction of devastated Bangladesh would be a good one. A plan for phasing out the chemicals threatening the earth's ozone layer would be another.</p>
        <p>The U.N.'s founders believed that the horror of two wars had made the world ready for a new political order, in which nations would work together to avoid conflict. Their effort had barely begun when the cold war overtook it, and their dreams have since been mocked by 40 years of ideological rigidity and querulous rhetoric. But their hopes seem less naive today than yesterday. And an American President in a history-making mood could bring them closer still to reality.</p>
