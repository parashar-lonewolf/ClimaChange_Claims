        <p>Odd species, we. The articles regarding the widening of Route 25A [''State Plans for Route 25A Meet Opposition'' and ''How the Towns View Changes to Route 25A,'' Oct. 5] highlight our inability to take responsibility for our own actions.</p>
        <p>Merchants want more parking, local residents want less through traffic, travelers want wider lanes and  everybody is against smog and global warming. Isn't it interesting that  nobody offers to get out of their cars!  We even drive to meetings to protest the expansion of roads!</p>

        <p>Odd species, we. The articles regarding the widening of Route 25A [''State Plans for Route 25A Meet Opposition'' and ''How the Towns View Changes to Route 25A,'' Oct. 5] highlight our inability to take responsibility for our own actions.</p>
        <p>Merchants want more parking, local residents want less through traffic, travelers want wider lanes and  everybody is against smog and global warming. Isn't it interesting that  nobody offers to get out of their cars!  We even drive to meetings to protest the expansion of roads!</p>
        <p>Look at us. We travel in two-ton steel cages propelled by the burning  of fossil fuels to get our gluttonous posteriors to a gym so that we can  use electrically powered exercise equipment to burn off the fat we  accumulate by never using our own muscles to propel us from home to job or store.</p>
        <p>While our climate is quite hospitable to walking and biking, the L.I.R.R. had to abandon Federal Istea-funded installation of bike lockers at train stations because not one town on Long Island expressed an interest. Aren't we absurd? My advice to everybody interviewed in your article is simple: stop whining and get a bike.</p>
