        <p>DETROIT, April 28 - The fuel economy of new cars and trucks ticked up slightly in the 2003 model year, but has remained stagnant over the last five years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's annual fuel economy report, which was released Wednesday.</p>

        <p>The fuel economy of new cars and trucks ticked up slightly in the 2003 model year, but has remained stagnant over the last five years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's annual fuel economy report, which was released Wednesday.</p>
        <p>On average, new cars and trucks get significantly fewer miles to the gallon today than in the late 1980's. Improvements in engine technology and car design have been more than offset by the continuing preference of Americans for sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks over cars.</p>
        <p>As vehicles become larger and heavier, they are also getting faster.</p>
        <p>In the 2003 model year, an average vehicle could reach 60 miles per hour from a standing stop in 10.2 seconds, which is down from 14.1 seconds two decades ago.</p>
        <p>''Fuel economy peaked in 1987, and since then, S.U.V.'s and light trucks have increased in popularity,'' said Margo T. Oge, director of the E.P.A.'s Office of Transportation and Air Quality. New technologies like hybrid electric vehicles and cleaner diesel engines may eventually help, she said, but they do not yet sell in large enough numbers to make an appreciable impact.</p>
        <p>Daniel Becker, a global warming expert for the Sierra Club, said: ''We're guzzling dramatically more gas than we were in the 1980's, so no one should be surprised that we're paying more at the pump, in hock to OPEC, and poisoning the atmosphere. Our government and the auto companies need to turn this situation around.''</p>
        <p>Domestic automakers, and particularly General Motors, have resisted raising fuel economy standards for years, arguing that tighter rules would put them at a disadvantage because they build more trucks than foreign rivals.</p>
        <p>''If we address this issue by adding a lot of cost to vehicles, or by forcing consumers into vehicles they don't really want to buy, let's face it -- we're going to sell fewer cars and trucks, hurt our own competitive position and hurt the U.S. economy,'' said Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, in a speech earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The average car or light-duty truck got 20.7 miles to the gallon in the 2003 model year, compared with 20.6 miles in 2002. The E.P.A.'s report last year put the 2002 figure at 20.4 and projected a rise to 20.8 in 2003; the new report uses updated sales data.</p>
        <p>The agency now expects 20.8 miles per gallon for the 2004 model year.</p>
        <p>All these figures exclude the largest and least efficient S.U.V.'s, like Hummers, which are so heavy that they fall outside government fuel economy rules.</p>
