        <p>The chief American negotiator at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro made a last-minute appeal to the White House on Wednesday night to reverse its refusal to sign a treaty on protecting animals and plants.</p>
        <p>But the negotiator, William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was firmly rebuffed today by top aides to President Bush, who rejected any effort to change the American position.</p>
        <p>It was another in a series of rebukes by the White House to environmental proposals favored by Mr. Reilly, who heads the United States delegation to the Rio summit, formally called the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Strains in Administration</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly's action and the White House reaction reflect not only the enormous strains that exist in the Bush Administration over environmental policy, but the personal pressure Mr. Reilly is under in Rio as the United States is increasingly denounced as having abandoned its role as the world's most environmentally concerned country.</p>
        <p>In a confidential memorandum sent to the White House on Wednesday night suggesting the policy change, Mr. Reilly said the Administration's announcement last Friday that it would not sign the treaty "is the major subject of press and delegate concern here." The memorandum was made available to The New York Times by an official opposed to Mr. Reilly's position.  [ Excerpts, page A6. ]</p>
        <p>But hours after Mr. Reilly proposed treaty changes in the memorandum and then announced some aspects of the plan at a news conference in Rio this morning, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, and the President's domestic policy chief, Clayton Yeutter, rejected the idea. Giving Reilly 'More Guidance'</p>
        <p>"The modifications were minor and it was communicated to Reilly that this doesn't come close to fitting the bill," said a senior White House official who asked to remain unidentified. "Clayton called him and said no way. The feeling here is that he was trying to present an option and that's his role. We'll just have to give him more guidance."</p>
        <p>President Bush said tonight he was not concerned about the criticism in Rio of his Administration, which he attributed to environmental extremists who "started protesting before they even knew what our position was."</p>
        <p>Questioned on the issue at a news conference, he vigorously defended his environmental record and suggested that signing the biodiversity treaty would imperil American jobs.</p>
        <p>"I am not going to go down there and forget about people that need jobs in the United States of America," he said. "I'm going to take a strong record, the leading record on science and technology, the leading record on oceans, the leading record on forests, the leading records on protecting the elephant, the leading records on C.F.C.'s. We've got a good record."  [ Excerpts from news conference, page A16. ]  In an interview in Rio earlier today, Mr. Reilly was visibly upset when informed that the someone in the Administration had disclosed his memorandum, which was stamped confidential.</p>
        <p>The brief interview ended abruptly when Mr. Reilly was shown the memorandum. He said, "I think I've said enough," and walked out of the room.</p>
        <p>At home, Mr. Reilly has lost almost every major internal battle he has fought in the last 10 months that pits environmental initiatives against economic growth. Beginning last summer, Mr. Reilly fought unsuccessfully to block a proposal by Vice President Dan Quayle that would open half the nation's wetlands to development. He has been unable to speed new regulations required by the 1990 Clean Air Act that have been delayed by the President's Council on Competitiveness headed by Mr. Quayle, and last week he lost another struggle when President Bush personally took Mr. Quayle's side and allowed companies to increase air pollution without public comment.</p>
        <p>In Rio, he is defending policies he does not eagerly support. The treaty to preserve biodiversity, which was the product of intense negotiations in Nairobi last month, is considered one of the two main achievements of the Rio conference.</p>
        <p>The State Department announced on Friday that Mr. Bush would not sign the treaty because of the Administration's concern that it would limit biotechnology development in the United States and could infringe on American patent protection for biological inventions. It also said the Administration was concerned about how money for the plan would be dispersed. 'Relatively Small Fixes'</p>
        <p>Brazil, however, has been eager for the United States to sign the treaty because of the prestige that would add to the conference. On Tuesday, representatives of Germany, Canada, Britain and India indicated their nations would sign the treaty, joining 98 other countries that had already announced their intentions to approve it.</p>
        <p>In the memorandum to Mr. Yeutter, Mr. Reilly said that Brazil had offered to try to "fix" the biodiversity treaty so that the United States would support it. Mr. Reilly attached a list of modest changes in the text of the treaty that he argued might be enough to gain the White House's support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly said he proposed "relatively small fixes of language, the removal of some small, troublesome clauses that create anxieties about intellectual property rights, technology transfer, concessional terms, the regulation of biotechnology."</p>
        <p>In the memorandum, Mr. Reilly said: "The changes proposed, while not making everyone in the U.S. Government totally happy, would address the critical issues that have been identified. They are worth a last examination."</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the changes did not come close to resolving the more fundamental concerns they had about the treaty. "It caused a little commotion at the White House," another official said. "The response was what you'd expect. A flat no." U.S. Is Isolated</p>
        <p>The Administration's refusal to sign the treaty has isolated the United States and made it the focus of international scorn at the Earth Summit, which has attracted representatives from 178 nations to Rio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reilly was eager for the United States to sign because the treaty could lead to the preservation of hundreds of millions of acres of forests and other wild habitat around the world.</p>
        <p>He was supported by Curtis Bohlen, Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, who led the American delegation that negotiated the biodiversity treaty in Nairobi. The two are friends and before joining the Bush Administration worked together at the World Wildlife Fund, an international conservation group in Washington that specializes in biodiversity issues.</p>
        <p>The Administration's decision not to sign the treaty was based in large part on a memorandum written by David M. McIntosh, the executive director of the President's Council on Competitiveness. Mr. McIntosh argued in the April 14 memorandum that economic harm from signing the treaty would substantially outweigh environmental benefits.</p>
        <p>In particular, Mr. McIntosh said, the American biotechnology industry, one of the more promising new industrial sectors, could suffer because the treaty could harm the ability of American biotechnology companies to protect their biological inventions overseas, and it opened questions about how biotechnology companies would be compensated for products developed from biological resources collected from foreign countries. 'Extensively Flawed'</p>
        <p>"The current draft convention is so extensively flawed that it is highly unlikely that the sufficient corrective action could be accomplished at a single negotiating session, and thus, any final convention that might be completed in May would remain seriously flawed," Mr. McIntosh said in his memo.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. McIntosh was at the center of a group of White House staff members that met to determine how to react to Mr. Reilly's proposal, and then quickly decided to reject it.</p>
        <p>The White House's decision was communicated to the United States delegation in Rio, and this afternoon Mr. Reilly's first assurances to reporters -- "We have prepared specific language that would satisfy our concerns," he said this morning -- began to shift.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Mr. Reilly said there was too little time to revise the treaty, since it was to be signed on Friday. "I don't foresee any reasonable possibility this treaty will change between now and tomorrow morning," he said.</p>
        <p>The biodiversity treaty requires nations to adopt national strategies and plans for conserving species and ecosystems while at the same time advancing economic development. Both the treaty and a separate one to control global warming require rich industrial countries to provide money and technology to help poor developing countries carry out the treaties.</p>
