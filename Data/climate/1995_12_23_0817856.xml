        <p>Unable to attract a rival bidder, CBI Industries did an about-face yesterday  and accepted a sweetened $2.2 billion cash bid from Praxair Inc., ending a two-month takeover battle.</p>
        <p>CBI's board agreed to the deal late yesterday afternoon, after Praxair had threatened to withdraw its $33-a-share bid and pursue a previously announced tender offer at $32 a share.</p>
        <p>Other bidders looked at the company but at the end of the day it was fairly obvious that Praxair had the most to gain," said Joseph S. Cappello, an analyst  with New Vernon Associates in Parsippany, N.J., referring to CBI's failure to find a so-called white knight to rescue it from Praxair.</p>
        <p>The prize for Praxair, one of the largest industrial gas companies in the world, was CBI's carbon dioxide manufacturing business, which is the world's largest. The combined company would command a larger share of the global market. The companies had recently begun battling in Brazil, where Praxair had tried to  cut into CBI's near monopoly of that market.</p>
        <p>"I think it's fabulous that the deal went through," Mr. Cappello said. "It's  great for CBI's shareholders and the synergies that can be derived from this transaction are fabulous for Praxair."</p>
        <p>John E. Jones, CBI's chairman, agreed. "The shareholders of CBI are well served by this merger agreement," he said in a statement released by the two companies yesterday. "Praxair's position as a world leader in industrial gases will strengthen CBI's global operations and present our employees with significant new opportunities."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jones felt very differently on Oct. 27, when H. William Lichtenberger, Praxair's chairman and chief executive, called him and offered $32 a share for his company, a 60 percent percent premium over CBI's closing price of $20.125 on the New York Stock Exchange that day.</p>
        <p>CBI's board rejected Praxair's offer, saying that the bid did not reflect the company's true value. The board also authorized its investment bankers to solicit other offers.</p>
        <p>CBI and Praxair announced their agreement yesterday after the stock market closed. Earlier, CBI, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., ended trading at $32.875, up 62.5 cents, while Praxair, based in Danbury, Conn., closed at $31.875, also up 62.5 cents.</p>
        <p>Praxair had sales of $2.7 billion in 1994, while CBI's sales were $1.9 billion. In addition to its industrial gases unit, CBI has a construction and engineering division and a services unit that ships and stores oil. Praxair said that it was not sure whether it would keep the two units, or sell them. The company was also unsure whether the merger would result in layoffs.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a civil complaint charging insider trading in CBI stock related to the takeover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capello said that Praxair would benefit from the acquisition in at least  three ways. By raising the profit margins at CBI's carbon dioxide unit to the same level as Praxair's would add $15 million to $20 million in operating profit, he said. Carbon dioxide is used in the soft-drink and refrigeration industries.</p>
        <p>Praxair would be able to benefit from losses in CBI's American operations to  lower the combined company's overall tax payments. And the merger ends the growing competition between the two companies in Brazil.</p>
