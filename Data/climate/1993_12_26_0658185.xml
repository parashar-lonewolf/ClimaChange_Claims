        <p>In renovating the facade of 555 Fifth Avenue, the owner and the architect decided not to follow the white brick road.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to make an elegant statement on Fifth Avenue," said Peter L. DiCapua, senior vice president of Atco Properties and Management, the owner and manager.</p>
        <p>So the planned new facade for what has been for 38 years a 20-story white brick office building at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 46th Street will feature alternating piers of Caledonia gray flame-finished granite, mocha-colored semi-circular elements, sandstone aluminum panels and bronze-tinted, thermally insulated glass casement windows.</p>
        <p>In addition, the nine upper floors will have their own special greenhouse effect: sloping glass skylights and cantilevered bay windows that protrude from the office space by 24 inches, to help create greenhouse-style offices, including 16 corner ones. Trees will be planted on five terraces of the 228,000-square-foot building, which was built in 1955 and designed by Emery Roth &amp; Sons.</p>
        <p>The emphasis, Mr. DiCapua said, is on the vertical. "The current look of the building is very much a squatty, low-profile 1955-type look, which Emery Roth was famous for when they built it," he said. "We thought the verticality of a new curtain wall would be very important."</p>
        <p>The architect, Der Scutt, known for Trump Tower and the facade renovations of 625 Madison Avenue and 575 Lexington Avenue, said the design had been created to harmonize with the neighboring buildings, including the landmarked 1920's Fred French Building next door.</p>
        <p>The new facade is the final phase of a multimillion-dollar renovation of the building, which has long housed Wallachs clothing store. The renovation includes a new two-story marquee-style entrance that features Caledonia gray granite columns flanking both sides of a bronze canopy; a gray marble lobby with waterfall, new elevator cabs with marble and bronze panels and new public corridors with marble flooring.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiCapua said the renovation would begin Jan. 3 and was expected to be finished in June. He said tenants would be disrupted for only one day, when existing windows were to be removed and new trim installed to connect with the previously installed new windows.</p>
        <p>Atco is a subsidiary of the Hemmerdinger Corporation, which owns and manages one million square feet of commercial space in Manhattan and a million square feet of industrial space in Queens. It also has residential holdings in the Central Park South area and in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>The Fifth Avenue building, Mr. DiCapua said, is 80 percent occupied, with two leases recently signed that will raise the occupancy rate to 90 percent.</p>
        <p>"There's no question that the renovation should help fill the building," he said. "Our goal, though,is not to bring in any particular percentage of tenants but to maintain our building as a premier building in the premier central business district. Our philosophy is long-term. We're really marketing the building, not our available space."</p>
        <p>Or, as Mr. Scutt said, Atco has recognized that if it takes a "traditional 1950's, dull, horizontal, brick building, with aluminum windows and no character whatsoever," and renovates it to "provide something special" for the tenants.</p>
        <p>"The company will be competitive in this very tough market," he said. MERVYN ROTHSTEIN</p>
