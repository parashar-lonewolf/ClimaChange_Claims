        <p>THE GENOME WAR</p>
        <p>How Craig Venter Tried to Capture</p>
        <p>the Code of Life and Save the World.</p>
        <p>By James Shreeve.</p>
        <p>403 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.</p>
        <p>The great genome race between J. Craig Venter and the publicly financed Human Genome Project lasted barely two years. It began in May 1998, when Venter, a renegade scientist, established a commercial company to finish sequencing human DNA some years ahead of the public program, and ended at the White House in June 2000, when both sides agreed they had passed the finish line simultaneously.</p>
        <p>In this brief period, Venter's company not only ordered the 3 billion DNA letters in the human ''book of life'' but also sequenced the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a warm-up. Venter first had to activate 300 temperamental sequencing machines, at $300,000 each, in order to read the letters on millions of short fragments of DNA. Then he needed the second-biggest computer in the world, to figure out how all these fragments fit together in the overall genome. Finishing this job in two years was an extraordinary achievement.</p>
        <p>Yet, for all his success, Venter, a Vietnam veteran and former surfer, is widely seen as an incarnation of evil. To many scientists he is ''Darth'' Venter, a once pure researcher who joined the dark forces of Mammon. In this view, the Human Genome Project offered a careful, accurate analysis of the genome for the benefit of future investigators, while Venter's aim was simply a quick and dirty botch-up, its only purpose to gain commercial rights to something that should be the common possession of humanity.</p>
        <p>While the genome race was on, it received blow-by-blow coverage on the science pages, and not a few books have followed since then. The special selling point of ''The Genome War,'' by James Shreeve, is that he enjoyed unrestricted access to Venter's company, Celera Genomics, from its founding. So we get the inside story of Venter's ups and downs as he enlisted quirky laboratory personnel, dealt with critical machine failures and politicked nonstop. It all makes for a gripping tale. Venter's sequencing strategy depended on radical techniques, and it was by no means predetermined that he wouldn't fall flat on his face.</p>
        <p>In addition to his verbatim accounts of events at Celera, Shreeve gives thumbnail sketches of the key players on the Human Genome Project, plus interview-based reconstructions of their crucial meetings. He makes it clear why both groups had to settle their differences. Because of the huge publicity, far more people were interested in the race than could understand the result. This meant each side was hostage to the danger that the other would suddenly orchestrate a fanfare and declare itself the winner. In a way, that's pretty much what happened, except that they did it together. Both admitted that their announced results were far less polished than originally intended.</p>
        <p>Curiously, of all the actors in Shreeve's story, it is Venter who comes least to life. We are repeatedly told how he rubs people the wrong way -- a number of independent sources report that he is widely disliked -- but we aren't really shown why. Venter comes across like an affable and enthusiastic uncle. One gets the feeling that Shreeve may have been a little bit too overawed to put in all the warts. The reader is left puzzled how this amiable buffer has managed to move scientific mountains.</p>
        <p>Personal unpopularity scarcely explains the widespread vilification of Venter. It is not as if scientists are generally known for their people skills. Nor does the accusation that Venter prostituted science to commerce fully account for his denigration. He made it clear from the start that his company never intended to make money from its basic sequencing of the genome; indeed, the raw sequence has been made generally available. True, Celera did use its privileged position to hunt for sections of DNA that could be patented for medical applications. But that raises wider issues about patenting policy. Many scientists think the authorities grant patents to mere fragments of DNA too liberally. But if that is so, it is scarcely Venter's fault. In any case, involvement in gene patenting is widespread among scientists, including many in the Human Genome Project.</p>
        <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the real objection to Venter is that as a scientist he came up by the back stairs. His background was anything but Ivy League, and until his 40's he was a brain chemist rather than a member of the close-knit community of geneticists. Once he did become part of the gene-sequencing business, he had plenty of radical ideas and an abundance of energy, but this didn't stop his grant applications being turned down for his supposed lack of expertise. Yet throughout the 1990's he repeatedly showed that he could indeed do just what the genetics establishment said he couldn't.</p>
        <p>In the case of the overall human genome, Venter's divergence from orthodoxy centered on a technique with the alarming name of the ''whole genome shotgun.'' The idea was to use a supercomputer to piece together the book of life from millions of tiny random phrases. If this worked, it would render redundant most of the laborious alternative techniques on which the public program was based, not to mention its payroll of thousands of employees. Not surprisingly, the genetic establishment closed ranks and collectively poured technical ridicule on the ''whole shotgun'' strategy.</p>
        <p>Venter, however, managed to persuade his backers to stake $300 million on his confidence that the problems were not insuperable. Once more, his judgment seems vindicated. Not everybody is convinced that Venter did exactly what he promised: in the flurry to meet the deadline, both sides cut corners, and some ardent anti-Venterites insist Venter didn't use the ''whole shotgun'' but took a helping hand from the public program's results. From a larger perspective this looks like quibbling. Venter's technique has now been successfully used to sequence other complex genomes, not just by Celera but by the public program itself.</p>
        <p>Shreeve gives the story an epilogue: in 2002, Venter was sacked by the directors of Celera Genomics, who wanted to focus on the pharmacological potential of their patent rights. Venter has since set up a research foundation and is aiming to genetically engineer a microbe that will create energy from waste products of fossil fuels. This may seem like a long shot, but the past advises one not to bet against J. Craig Venter.</p>
