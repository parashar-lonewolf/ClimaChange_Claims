The Soviets have left behind a lot of weaponry, they said. Page 1  At Afghan guerrilla talks, confusion reigns supreme 5  Soviets say 89,000 troops are home 5  The Vatican declared racism a sin, issuing a document that touches on apartheid, anti-Semitism, tribal conflicts, the rights of aboriginal peoples and the discrimination encountered by migrants. 1  Panama's economy has survived months of sharp contraction and concerted pressure from the United States, and in a remarkable show of resilience some sectors are reporting a modest rebound. 4  Salvadoran political parties agreed in principle to meet with leftist rebels to discuss a peace initiative that would lead to rebel participation in national elections. 3  President Bush met Canada's leader, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, in Ottawa and agreed to pursue an accord to reduce acid rain, a commitment Canada has eagerly sought. 3  News analysis: Jamaica's election of Michael Manley as Prime Minister occurs when the Caribbean country's economy is on the rise. But doubts run high over whether Mr. Manley can continue the progress. 3  A liberal view of Hungary's uprising in 1956 - that a neutral Hungary would not be a Soviet threat - was printed by the official press. Differing views on the uprising are considered the focus of a deeper debate over pluralism. 28  Bonn defers decision on short-range missiles 3  National 6-10, 32  The biggest price increases in years were recorded last month by the Government's producer price indexes.

Industry experts predict that January net withdrawals will be greater. 1  Lawmakers assailed Bush proposals for the budget only a day after welcoming the President on Capitol Hill. ''We started reading the fine print,'' a Senator said. 1  Ronald Brown was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He is the first black to head a major American political party, one that has become better financed in recent years but remains dispirited. 1  Man in the news: Ronald Brown, the son of middle-class parents in Harlem, is a well-paid, powerful lawyer and lobbyist for several big corporations. He is also deeply rooted in liberal Democratic politics. 8  A request to halt the North trial was denied by a Federal appeals court panel that told the Justice Department it could only prohibit disclosure of classified information in the case against Oliver North. 6  C. Boyden Gray's financial reports should be amended to show $86,900 that the White House counsel has said he earned in 1985 and 1986 but did not report, the Office of Government Ethics has suggested. 10  New control over Federal secrets proposed by a Presidential order will be countered in a campign mounted by the A.C.L.U. The order would give agency heads sweeping authority to deny access to information. 32  The examination of John Tower, nominee for Secretary of Defense, has confounded Federal agents and senators trying to cut through the fog of gossip about his private life. 10  John Tower's surgeon found ''no evidence that the Senator abuses alcohol,'' after conducting extensive tests, the surgeon said. 10  A clash between U.S. and Texas officials came in the border town of Harlingen, where local officers raided the Federal immigration office, evicting workers and aliens because of alleged fire and health code violations. 6  Anti-black violence against a church in Alton, Ill, is worse than any in the church's 125-year history, members say.

Mr. Kean would assume office when his term as Governor of New Jersey expires next January. 29  Some local school board members in New York City are taking steps to circumvent a new law intended to reduce conflicts of interest, the sponsor of the bill says. He is considering legislation to close loopholes. 29  The removal of radium in Queens from an abandoned medical supply plant is about to start, and Federal officials are planning a campaign to head off neighborhood fears about the operation's safety. 31  A small fire in Queens mushroomed into tragedy, killing three people in a high-rise, because of errors commonly made by fire victims, the authorities said. 31 Most of Yonkers seems reconciled to the construction of low-income units in white neighborhoods, six months after the city attracted nationwide attention by defying a court order. 30  Queens man who said police beat him is cleared in case 30  Goodman imbroglio splits New York G.O.P. 31  Neediest Cases 32</p>
