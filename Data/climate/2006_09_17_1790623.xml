        <p>Housing is one of those emotional terms, like terrorism and global warming, that bring out a weird sort of anxious fatalism in people. Everyone knows that affordable housing is scarcer than ever, that entire regions like Fairfield County have become practically off limits to young people and the working class, and that the only way to deal with the problem is through passive acceptance or abject surrender: turning half of one's gross income over to the mortgage or moving to the Dakotas.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is giving up. A report in July by two nonprofit groups, the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the Regional Plan Association, offers a big-picture dissection of the housing crisis that can leave a reader feeling not overwhelmed, but hopeful. While acknowledging that the housing squeeze poses a serious threat to the region's economy and quality of life, and that the situation has become worse in recent years, the report, ''Balanced Housing for a Smart Region'' (available at chpcny.org or rpa.org), is bursting with strategies and tactics for attacking the problem on multiple fronts.</p>

        <p>Housing is one of those emotional terms, like terrorism and global warming, that bring out a weird sort of anxious fatalism in people. Everyone knows that affordable housing is scarcer than ever, that entire regions like Fairfield County have become practically off limits to young people and the working class, and that the only way to deal with the problem is through passive acceptance or abject surrender: turning half of one's gross income over to the mortgage or moving to the Dakotas.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is giving up. A report in July by two nonprofit groups, the Citizens Housing and Planning Council and the Regional Plan Association, offers a big-picture dissection of the housing crisis that can leave a reader feeling not overwhelmed, but hopeful. While acknowledging that the housing squeeze poses a serious threat to the region's economy and quality of life, and that the situation has become worse in recent years, the report, ''Balanced Housing for a Smart Region'' (available at chpcny.org or rpa.org), is bursting with strategies and tactics for attacking the problem on multiple fronts.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, such strategies are desperately needed. The rapid escalation of home prices since 2004 has reduced the number of Connecticut towns with ''affordable'' median home prices from 67 to just 12 -- and none were in Fairfield or New Haven Counties.</p>
        <p>The report sets forth several useful principles, among them these:</p>
        <p>Sprawl is not an option. The region will need to create housing for an estimated three million to four million people in the next 25 years, but this time there will be no Robert Moses to lead the multitudes into the promised land, because there is no such place. Yes, parts of eastern Long Island, New Jersey, the Hudson Valley and upper Fairfield County, particularly near Danbury, still have room left for traditional single-family homes on suburban-style lots, but this region's commutes are already the longest in the country, and there is a limit to how much bulldozing of open space people can tolerate.</p>
        <p>The good news is that the region is rich in poor cities, industrial wastelands and other underused properties. Connecticut in particular has sought to turn the curse of blight into a virtue, seeking, in places like Bridgeport, to resurrect brownfield sites and abandoned buildings for housing.</p>
        <p>'High-density' is not a dirty word. And neither is ''affordable housing.'' Communities throughout the region have long fiercely opposed the obvious answer to the housing shortage, which is to build more apartment buildings and other forms of multifamily housing and subsidized housing for people with low and moderate incomes. Some of the resistance comes from plain old white-flight racism, but some stems from the not-unreasonable belief that newcomers with children burden the schools and end up costing a community more than they pay in taxes.</p>
        <p>The report concedes that this is true in many cases, but certainly not all. And it says that remedies are available. Not every household has children; the elderly people, divorced singles and young couples who make up a significant part of the housing market can generate large tax surpluses in a community. A smart mix of new housing, in other words, can help, not hurt, a community's fiscal bottom line.</p>
        <p>Smart is better than dumb. Properly understood and executed, the philosophy of ''smart growth'' encompasses the notion of walkable communities, ready access to mass transit and architecture that is dense and compact but attractively built. If the region is ever going to break its addiction to the car and the curses of low-density sprawl and traffic congestion, communities arranged on smart-growth principles will lead the way.</p>
        <p>Big government is not the problem. Little government is. Hundreds of local municipalities control decisions about land use, and their individual acts of resistance to housing solutions have left the whole region worse off. But states can help, first by developing broad strategies for planning and managing growth. The report holds up New Jersey as a model for the nation, while giving Connecticut mixed marks. Connecticut rarely challenges the tradition of home rule that gives communities final say on land use; even worse, the state has all but abandoned any commitment to affordable housing. Connecticut spent $121 million on affordable housing in 1990, but it spends only about $20 million today.</p>
        <p>States and localities can use other means to spur affordable housing, by breaking the link between school financing and property taxes -- a huge disincentive to low-cost housing -- by giving money to nonprofit groups to buy and preserve housing, and by creating state housing trust funds that can be used to create mixed-income housing.</p>
        <p>We're all in this together. The report stresses that the region's far-flung suburbs are all extremities of one social and economic organism. Solutions in one area will help communities in another. The region is large, sprawling and full of competing interests and rivalries, but affordable housing is the quandary that unites us all.</p>
