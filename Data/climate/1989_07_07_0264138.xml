        <p>LEAD: Shaken by scandal and political crises, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's Government is quietly taking up another delicate problem this week: how to overcome a widespread perception of weakness at the economic summit conference that Mr. Uno is to attend in Paris next week.</p>
        <p>Shaken by scandal and political crises, Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's Government is quietly taking up another delicate problem this week: how to overcome a widespread perception of weakness at the economic summit conference that Mr. Uno is to attend in Paris next week.</p>
        <p>To counter that perception, Mr. Uno and his aides are reported to be working on several Japanese initiatives for the summit meeting, including an expansion of its two-year-old $30 billion plan to ''recycle'' Japanese trade surpluses to international lending agencies.</p>
        <p>Also under consideration is a separate $2 billion proposal to assist in tree-planting programs in poor countries stripped of their forests.</p>
        <p>But these initiatives are already being viewed as modest, compared with Japanese economic proposals at economic summit meetings in the last two years, at least partly because Mr. Uno has been politically disabled by voter resentment of a recently enacted tax increase. Disagreement in Government</p>
        <p>Japanese officials said there was disagreement within the Government about how much Mr. Uno can afford to propose at Paris, with many people concerned about voter feelings that domestic needs are not being met.</p>
        <p>''Definitely the wind is getting colder, very chilly for increasing economic assistance,'' said a Japanese policy maker, who added that increasingly voters are suggesting that ''it's high time for the Government to look inward.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Uno's concern about his political problems is serious enough that several times he has felt compelled to assure both the public and visitors, including Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, that he definitely plans to remain in office by the time of the summit conference, which starts July 14.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in his meetings with Mr. Baker on Tuesday, Mr. Uno reportedly assured the Secretary at least twice that he would see him in Paris. He was said also to have impressed Mr. Baker's entourage with his forcefully stated intention to defend Japanese interests at the summit meeting. Japan Moves Cautiously</p>
        <p>This year marks the 15th annual summit conference of the world's major industrial democracies, with Paris preparing to salute the bicentennial of the French Revolution. Since the beginning of the meetings, Japan has only very slowly and cautiously moved to play a greater role.</p>
        <p>Until the last few weeks, many people had expected Mr. Uno to continue in the recent tradition of speaking out forcefully, in contrast to Japan's reticence of the early 1980's and before. Now diplomats are not so sure how Mr. Uno will act.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister, for example, is shadowed by speculation over the last week that that he might have had to resign if the governing Liberal Democratic Party did especially poorly in Tokyo municipal elections, or if there were new disclosures in the sex scandal involving Mr. Uno.</p>
        <p>The Tokyo elections on Sunday did bring a serious setback, but Mr. Uno has behaved anything but defensively since then. On Wednesday he went out to campaign for parliamentary elections this month, and he has also held long meetings with aides to master the complicated summit issues. 'Intent on Studying'</p>
        <p>''He's been very intent on studying up,'' said an official who took part in Mr. Uno's preparations. ''He's a great performer, and he knows how to present cases. Irrespective of the domestic situation, he seems determined to make the summit a success so that his reputation can be regained to some extent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Uno took office about a month ago after Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resigned to take responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal. The scandal, combined with an unpopular sales tax enacted last year and recent disclosures about extramarital affairs for Mr. Uno, have sent the Government's popularity rate tumbling.</p>
        <p>Besides the ''recycling'' plan for international lending agencies and the forestation initiative, Japan is also planning to endorse further sharp reductions in chlorofluorocarbons, the chemical deemed responsible for depleting the earth's ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials say they are aware that Japan is perceived to have a poor record on environmental issues, especially on the protection of whales and other endangered species. Cutbacks in Chemicals</p>
        <p>Taking action on the environment, Seiroku Kajiyama, the Minister for International Trade and Industry, announced this week that Japan would seek deeper cuts in the consumption of the ozone-depleting chemicals than were agreed to by the industrial nations in Montreal in 1987.</p>
        <p>Japan is also planning to call for stepped-up research and monitoring of various emissions believed to be responsible for a ''global warming'' trend. Japanese scientists say they believe they are in a position to develop new technologies to trace this trend, although many environmental groups criticize Japan by saying that action, not more research, is required.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials said that in the dispute that has developed between France and the United States, in which France seeks a global body that might enforce emission standards on member nations, Japan has joined with the Bush Administration in expressing skepticism of the French idea.</p>
        <p>''We share the concerns of the United States on this,'' a Japanese summit planner said. ''But maybe some sort of mechanism is necessary. The details need to be worked out.''</p>
        <p>Japan's preparations are also testimony to the power in Tokyo of the permanent Government bureaucracy that establishes policies and continues in office despite the coming and going of Prime Ministers and lesser politicians. Many people say that this bureaucracy is probably the most powerful of its kind among all the industrial democracies to be represented at the summit meeting.</p>
