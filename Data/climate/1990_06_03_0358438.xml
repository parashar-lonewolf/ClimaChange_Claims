        <p>LEAD: When the Ford Motor Company announced in December 1988 that it had developed a catalytic converter that would not require platinum, the metal's price plunged. Platinum producers feared that demand would evaporate. But Ford's new converter is still in testing, and platinum demand is near an all-time high.</p>
        <p>When the Ford Motor Company announced in December 1988 that it had developed a catalytic converter that would not require platinum, the metal's price plunged. Platinum producers feared that demand would evaporate. But Ford's new converter is still in testing, and platinum demand is near an all-time high.</p>
        <p>Platinum prices have been sustained at about $500 an ounce this year by environmentally conscious governments in the United States and Europe, and by status-conscious Japanese. The metal's leading uses are in jewelry and catalytic converters.</p>
        <p>Jewelry accounted for 38 percent of the 3.4 million ounces sold outside Communist (or formerly Communist) nations in 1989. A record 1.15 million ounces of platinum went for jewelry in Japan, almost 20 times the amount used by American jewelers.</p>
        <p>Another 37 percent of the non-Communist world's demand came from producers of catalytic converters. Slightly more than half of this amount went into converters in the United States, the first country whose air pollution standards made the devices necessary. Tougher American pollution laws will require a new generation of converters that will use even more platinum.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of tighter environmental standards is making the converters more common in Europe as well, especially in West Germany, where stricter anti-pollution regulations are already in place.</p>
        <p>Platinum is also an important chemical catalyst, used in making many products worth far less per ounce than the pure metal: gasoline, fiberglass, optical glass, certain types of rubber, some electrical equipment, even plastic seat covers and nylon carpeting. But the metal's chemical use has diminished as manufacturers seek ways of doing without this costly ingredient.</p>
        <p>Investors, too, are becoming less likely to buy platinum as they become disenchanted with the financial returns.</p>
        <p>And the music industry's platinum records? They are usually made of nickel, with shiny foil or paint, and not a single gram of platinum.</p>
        <p>Of Metal and Politics</p>
        <p>South Africa, Soviets Are Main Suppliers</p>
        <p>For all the economic sanctions the United States has invoked against South African apartheid, trade in platinum continues undisturbed. The non-Communist world depended on South Africa last year for 77 percent of its platinum, and the United States was no exception, buying in about the same proportion.</p>
        <p>The only other major source, the Soviet Union, produced about 16 percent of international supplies - up from about 10 percent in previous years, as the Soviet Union tried to earn more Western currencies.</p>
        <p>The worldwide stock of platinum is close to meeting demand, but turmoil in either country could disrupt shipments.</p>
        <p>Some analysts suggest that political reforms in the Soviet Union and South Africa could bring new militancy among mine workers looking for improved conditions. News of unrest in either country regularly sends platinum prices climbing; calm sends them back down. While jewelry makers could easily turn to gold and silver, automobile makers cannot.</p>
        <p>Jeremy S. Croombes, an analyst at Johnson, Matthey P.L.C., the London-based corporation that is the world's largest trader in the metal, said he is especially worried about unrest among black miners in South Africa.</p>
        <p>''The black population might want to sit back and let various leaders negotiate on their behalf,'' Mr. Croombs said. ''Or they may want to make their voices heard through strikes and industrial disruption.''</p>
        <p>Investment Ups and Downs</p>
        <p>Once-Healthy Market Collapsed Last Year</p>
        <p>For a while, platinum appeared likely to join silver and gold as a mainstay in any precious-metal portfolio. Investment demand, virtually nil until the early 1980's, grew to 155,000 ounces in 1983, 490,000 ounces in 1985 and 630,000 in 1988. A range of bars and coins was proliferating.</p>
        <p>But last year, as gold and silver prices stagnated, investors decided they needed only 160,000 more ounces of platinum. The Japanese, the world's most active platinum investors, turned away abruptly, cutting their demand from 415,000 ounces in 1988 to 65,000 in 1989.</p>
        <p>''The demand for platinum as an investment tool has been dragged down by gold and silver prices, which have performed more poorly than platinum,'' said Bruce Kaplan, a precious metals consultant in Los Angeles. Last year, platinum prices fell from about $560 an ounce to about $500. Investors are less interested in using platinum as a hedge against inflation, Mr. Kaplan said.</p>
        <p>Higher demand from jewelry and industry sources has kept platinum prices relatively stable this year - which might be making the metal less attractive to investors.</p>
        <p>Common wisdom in the platinum business is that the metal seems brighter when its price is moving, no matter which way. The Japanese are said to buy when the price is falling, while Europeans and Americans jump in on the way up.</p>
        <p>New Technology</p>
        <p>It Isn't Likely To Curb Demand</p>
        <p>For a while, it seemed that Michigan had more to say about platinum prices than producers or investors. In December 1988, Ford announced ambitious tests of a catalytic converter made without platinum. About 40,000 Cougars and Thunderbirds in California were to be equipped with the new devices. On the day of Ford's announcement, platinum prices plunged $71 per ounce. Ask the company how things are going with its platinum-free converters now, and the response is a copy of the 1988 press release.</p>
        <p>Platinum assists in converting nitrogen oxide pollutants in automobile exhaust into carbon dioxide and water. Few still believe that pollution control equipment can dispense with platinum entirely.</p>
        <p>Ford says that even if converters without platinum are practical now, tighter emissions standards might require platinum to be reintroduced.</p>
        <p>Ford contends that its new converters will at least enable the company, and the nation, to lessen its reliance on South Africa and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Some auto makers are increasing their use of rhodium, another precious metal that is often found in platinum ores. ''Rhodium will undoubtedly be an essential component of auto catalysts used in Europe,'' Mr. Croombs said. Its use in catalytic converters increased 16 percent worldwide in 1989. At $1,600 an ounce, rhodium is far more costly and rare than platinum, but also more efficient for use in converters.</p>
        <p>But even as some turn to other metals, the demand for platinum in converters increased 9 percent in 1989 and is likely to grow more quickly this year. The growth is likely to be greatest in Western Europe, where only three of every 10 cars already have the converters.</p>
        <p>WHEN PRICE IS NO OBJECT</p>
        <p>Where price is no object, platinum fuel cells are fine. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has used the exotic batteries to power its space shuttles.</p>
        <p>Now the developers of these cells need to make the giant leap back to earth and find less expensive, everyday applications.</p>
        <p>The cells, which look somewhat like stacks of car batteries, use platinum to catalyze a chemical combination of hydrogen and oxygen, generating electricity. Lee Marino, a spokesman for Johnson Matthey P.L.C., said that the fuel cells waste 10 percent less of their power than do standard utility engines.</p>
        <p>Major corporations are eager to pursue this new technology. International Fuel Cells, a division of the United Technologies Corporation, is already selling platinum fuel-cell generators that can heat and provide emergency power for small apartment buildings.</p>
        <p>A Japanese joint venture between International Fuel Cells and the Toshiba Corporation developed the cells for the space shuttle.</p>
        <p>In the longer range, scientists say that the power cells can propel buses and delivery trucks. ''There are a variety of potential applications for the future that we're only beginning to explore,'' Mr. Morino said.</p>
