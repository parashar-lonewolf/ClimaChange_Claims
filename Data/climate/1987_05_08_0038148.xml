        <p>LEAD: Michael K. Deaver discussed with President Reagan the appointment of a special envoy to Canada on acid rain before he left the White House to become a lobbyist for Canada, according to papers filed in Federal District Court here today.</p>
        <p>Michael K. Deaver discussed with President Reagan the appointment of a special envoy to Canada on acid rain before he left the White House to become a lobbyist for Canada, according to papers filed in Federal District Court here today.</p>
        <p>The disclosure that in 1985 Mr. Reagan and Mr. Deaver personally discussed the appointment of Drew Lewis as the United States representative on the issue was made by Whitney North Seymour Jr., the independent counsel who is prosecuting the former Presidential aide on perjury charges. Mr. Deaver is accused of lying to a Federal grand jury about his lobbying for Canada and other clients after he resigned as deputy White House chief of staff in May 1985.</p>
        <p>The indictment charges that he said he had only limited involvement in the appointment of Mr. Lewis, Mr. Reagan's first Secretary of Transportation. It also charges he lied about lobbying contacts to the grand jury and to a House subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour said in court papers that Mr. Deaver expressed support for Mr. Lewis's appointment in conversations with Mr. Reagan, the White House chief of staff, Donald T. Regan. and the national security adviser, Robert McFarlane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seymour was responding to defense queries that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered him to answer. Mr. Reagan asked Mr. Lewis to take the envoy's post on March 14, 1985. Mr. Seymour said he had evidence that Mr. Deaver spoke to Mr. Lewis by telephone ''sometime after 11:04 A.M.'' that day. Mr. Deaver is accused of lying to the grand jury by denying he spoke with Mr. Lewis by phone before the appointment was announced. He left the White House in May 1985 to set up Michael K. Deaver &amp; Associates, which lobbied for Canada, among other clients.</p>
