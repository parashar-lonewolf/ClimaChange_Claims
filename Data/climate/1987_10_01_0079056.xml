        <p>LEAD: The Senate today overwhelmingly approved its second appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1988, a $10 billion package for the Interior Department and related agencies such as the Forest Service.</p>
        <p>The Senate today overwhelmingly approved its second appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1988, a $10 billion package for the Interior Department and related agencies such as the Forest Service.</p>
        <p>The 91-to-5 vote came less than a day after the Reagan Administration warned that the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto because the proposal exceeds the Administration's target by $1.1 billion.</p>
        <p>A similar veto threat has been made against the other appropriation measure for 1988, covering the Treasury Department and Postal Service. The White House is opposed to subsidized mail rates for nonprofit groups.</p>
        <p>Both bills would set spending levels for the fiscal year that starts Thursday. This leaves 11 other appropriation bills awaiting Senate action. Meanwhile, the Government is continuing to operate under stopgap spending authority. $530 Million Over House The Interior Department bill is about $530 million higher than the House's version. The differences will have to be resolved by negotiators from the two chambers.</p>
        <p>Among the major differences is the issue of how quickly the Government will move ahead to increase spending for a $2.5 billion technology program designed to reduce pollutants in the burning of coal. The program was requested by President Reagan.</p>
        <p>The Senate wants a two-year $850 million appropriation for research aimed at cutting emissions of chemicals that are transformed in the air to produce acid rain. The House has called for $500 million over three years. Environmentalists Opposed</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan, who promised Canada earlier this year that the United States would step up research designed to reduce acide rain, sought approval of the entire $2.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists are opposing the financing because they feel it would sidetrack efforts in Congress to move ahead with legislation mandating reductions in polluting emissions from coal-fired power plants and factories.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Office of Management and Budget issued a statement saying that unless the bill is scaled back in a House-Senate conference, ''The President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto'' it.</p>
        <p>The budget office said the bill contained a variety of items that could be delayed or that could be financed by state and local governments, including land acquisition for conservation and grants for historic preservation.</p>
