        <p>Like many Americans of his generation, 42-year-old John Driscoll holds many memories of the cold war, particularly the fear that came with the air raid drills at school, when he and the other students crawled under their desks, practicing for the day the Soviet hydrogen bombs fell.</p>
        <p>"It seems surreal now," he recalled recently, a short time after the Soviet Union formally announced its demise.

        <p>Like many Americans of his generation, 42-year-old John Driscoll holds many memories of the cold war, particularly the fear that came with the air raid drills at school, when he and the other students crawled under their desks, practicing for the day the Soviet hydrogen bombs fell.</p>
        <p>"It seems surreal now," he recalled recently, a short time after the Soviet Union formally announced its demise. "Every summer, when I heard heat lightning over the city and the sky would light up, I was convinced it was all over. My whole childhood was built on the notion that the Soviets were the real threat."</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Driscoll is a teacher of economics and government at a high school just outside Washington. Working with Junior Achievement, he is helping to coordinate food shipments to Moscow, the capital of the empire that terrified him as a child. And on a recent visit to Moscow, he said, he found that "these folks have absolutely no confidence in themselves."</p>
        <p>Across the country, planners, academics, Government officials and many ordinary Americans are reassessing their view not just of the former Soviet Union but of America as well -- trying to understand how the political and military rivalry with the Soviets altered Americans' lives over the last 45 years, what false assumptions it engendered and how the United States should change now that the cold war is over.</p>
        <p>"We're confused," said Robert Jay Lifton, a psychiatrist who is director of the Center on Violence and Human Survival at John Jay College of the City University of New York. "People no longer know how to view the world or how to understand our own national problems, which have to some degree been subsumed by the cold war."</p>
        <p>The rivalry between Moscow and Washington so dominated the world's diplomacy, commerce and even its culture that it is no wonder Americans are finding it difficult to adapt.</p>
        <p>The two nations that emerged with the strongest militaries when World War II ended spent the next 45 years waging multi-layered competitions, first in Europe, then Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
        <p>With constant coaching from their Government, most Americans came to believe that the Soviet goal was to impose its system on the entire world, as it had on Eastern Europe between 1945 and 1948. So the United States embraced "containment" -- halting the spread of Communist ideology and its presumed influence on American society.</p>
        <p>America threatened war to break a Soviet blockade of West Berlin in 1948-49 and airlifted tons of food to the stranded enclave. It also spent billions of dollars to resurrect the economies of Western Europe and fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953.</p>
        <p>The first Soviet nuclear test was in 1949, and the Soviet Union grew toward nuclear parity with the United States until each nation had the power to destroy the other in an instant. The knowledge that each side had weapons so fearsome that they could never be rationally fired left the constant hope that no matter how bitter it grew, the war would always remain "cold."</p>
        <p>But even as they tried to settle their scores by proxy wars and diplomatic confrontations, the two sides continued to flirt with mutually assured destruction. The severest test of nerve, and perhaps America's greatest single cold-war victory, came in 1962 when President Kennedy forced Khrushchev to withdraw Soviet missiles from Cuba.</p>
        <p>America's single greatest defeat of the period was surely the Vietnam War, with the devastating social and political turmoil that came with its loss.</p>
        <p>In the service of containment, the United States ringed the Soviet empire with military bases and built anti-Soviet alliances wherever possible the world over. This competition cost the United States several trillion dollars -- no one has a real account -- and more than 100,000 lives. And the domestic ramifications permeate American society to this day.</p>
        <p>The drive to ferret out Communist influence at home made perceived "loyalty" a major preoccupation of governments, police agencies, school boards and even social organizations.</p>
        <p>The fears of subversion and betrayal were fed by several sensational trials, like those of Alger Hiss for perjury and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage. And they fed demogagic attacks on thousands of citizens by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and his imitators.</p>
        <p>The fears abated little until the mid-1980's. And by then America was fully and perhaps irreversibly engaged around the world.</p>
        <p>When the cold war ended, the United States had 375 foreign military installations staffed by more than 500,000 servicemen and women worldwide. Its diplomatic engagement was just as extensive; through the 1980's America backed its bid for world influence with more than $16 billion in foreign aid each year. And American businesses were selling their products and services worldwide.</p>
        <p>But now that the great conflict has at last run its course, Americans are facing not just the giddy spectacle of a grand, global political victory. Behind it lies a quandary of historic dimensions, as disorienting as any this nation has ever faced.</p>
        <p>Over the next several days The New York Times will examine how the cold war's end has affected major American institutions and what sorts of changes may lie ahead. Politicians, intelligence officials, foreign policy experts, military analysts along with military-industry scientists and engineers all say they realize that the major force that has directed them these last four decades no longer exists. But few of them have clear ideas of what their new missions should be. Images Popular Culture Widely Influenced</p>
        <p>For most Americans it will be difficult to forget the cold war's pervasive influence on American entertainment and culture. Cold war themes were the subject of uncounted novels, pop songs, art work and more. Many of the most indelible images came from films.</p>
        <p>Among them was the scene from "Dr. Strangelove," the 1963 black comedy, showing Slim Pickens waving his cowboy hat, shouting "Yahoo, Yahoo!" as he rode the hydrogen bomb down toward its target, a missile field in Russia.</p>
        <p>Cold war images permeated films until the very end. In "Rocky IV," released in 1985, Sylvester Stallone battled a superhuman-seeming, steroid-grown Soviet boxer who warned him darkly, "I will break you." Moments later he fell bleeding to the floor, another stunned victim of underestimated American might.</p>
        <p>But already, film images are changing, too, demonstrating that America is not entrapped by cold war stereotypes, no matter how memorable.</p>
        <p>In "Star Trek VI," playing in theaters now, the Klingon empire is in collapse, and its chancellor, not coincidentally named Gorkan, wants to make peace, meaning "an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility that the Klingon empire can no longer afford," as the character Spock observes.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Meyer, the film's director, said Leonard Nimoy, who plays Spock, proposed the film in 1990, just as the Berlin wall was falling, saying: "The Klingons have always been our stand-in for the Russians. What about a Berlin wall coming down in space?"</p>
        <p>But in the Star Trek film, as in American political life, the prospect of losing an enemy leaves the leaders fearful and uncertain.</p>
        <p>"I was used to hating Klingons," William Shatner, as Captain Kirk, mutters wistfully. Legacy  Giving Up Secrecy Is Hard to Do</p>
        <p>When Steven Garfinkel delivers a lecture to Federal security professionals, he begins by showing them a slide that invariably leaves them perplexed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garfinkel is director of the Information Security Oversight Office, the Federal agency that coordinates Government policy on classified documents. Late last year, he turned to his slide as he spoke to a gathering of Defense Department security specialists at a training seminar in Richmond, Va.</p>
        <p>It listed the names of 12 Government agencies involved in intelligence or security policy, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and Mr. Garfinkel's own office.</p>
        <p>"What do all these agencies have in common?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"They're all defense- or security-related," one man shouted. "All of them were formed after World War II," offered another. But these were not the answers Mr. Garfinkel was after.</p>
        <p>With some coaxing, he finally led his audience to the response he wanted: All of the agencies were products of the cold war. Across the room members of the audience nodded.</p>
        <p>Then came Mr. Garfinkel's next question: "With the cold war over, which ones can we get rid of?"</p>
        <p>"They didn't have any suggestions for deleting any of them," Mr. Garfinkel recalled.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Garfinkel and others attest, the cold war gave birth to a Government culture of secrecy and clandestine activity that had never existed before to any great degree, except in wartime.</p>
        <p>Before the cold war, the nation did not even have a formal system for classifying documents, though some agencies did keep secrets. Today, however, Government officials classify almost seven million documents a year -- so many that Washington has an agency to coordinate policy for keeping secrets.</p>
        <p>But with the cold war's end, some people are asking whether all this secrecy is still needed. In July, the Federation of American Scientists began publishing the Secrecy and Government Bulletin, declaring in its first edition that "in the cold war era, secrecy driven by fear and the politics of superpower rivalry became deeply imbedded in national affairs and led to serious political, moral, financial and environmental abuses.</p>
        <p>"The end of the cold war provides an unsurpassed opportunity to rectify this problem," it added.</p>
        <p>The bulletin's editor, Steven Aftergood, said that government secrecy had often prevented Congress and the public from "paying attention to abuses, wasted money, failed programs" and that "a whole realm of government is beyond any pretense of democratic decision-making."</p>
        <p>But even with the cold war over, Mr. Aftergood, Mr. Garfinkel and others say the Goverment has offered no plans to reduce the number of materials stamped secret each year.</p>
        <p>"I think it's fair to say that no one's talking yet about changing anything," Mr. Garfinkel said. "It looks like this cold war institution is going to be institutionalized beyond the cold war." Education  Need for Change Is Long Overdue</p>
        <p>When Allen Barrow was teaching high school seniors in suburban Washington in the 1950's and '60s, "everybody expected Soviet missiles," he said, adding, "At times there was a lot of fear."</p>
        <p>The school system helped feed that fear. Like thousands of other teachers across the country, Mr. Barrow showed his students films about the enemy. He particularly remembers one "called 'Against the Wall,' I think, in black and white, about the purges of Stalin, the millions of people executed."</p>
        <p>Mr. Driscoll, one of his former students, had no trouble recalling that film.</p>
        <p>"They lined up people in front of ditches and shot them," he said. "It was real newsreel film. I remember the hats flying. And I thought, 'This is the way the Russians act!' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrow believes the cold war was a boon to education, in some ways, because it made his students "more aware that things that go on way over there are going to affect us here." He and others also noted that it gave an unquestioned boost to certain subject areas, such as science and engineering, particularly after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, the first man-made earth satellite.</p>
        <p>But other educators point to darker effects as well.</p>
        <p>As the "rhetoric of the cold war -- good guys and bad guys," filtered into the class room, said Theodore Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, "study of Japan or Asia was limited," while academic attention was lavished on the Soviet Union. For that, he said, America is now paying a price.</p>
        <p>Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, has been studying not just America's schools but those of countries whose students usually score much better by generally accepted international standards of measurement. Among them are schools in Germany and Japan. The difference, he says, goes back to America's view of itself in the cold war's first decade.</p>
        <p>The United States ended World War II the globe's unquestioned leader, the only nation to enter the postwar era at full industrial capacity and in possession of nuclear weapons. As a result, from 1945 into the late 1950's, "we were enormously confident in our economic institutions, and in our social structure, including the schools," Mr. Tucker observed, while the Germans and the Japanese, and to some extent other Europeans, had to rebuild.</p>
        <p>"But what is only now becoming apparent is that World War II led to a fundamental restructuring of the world economy," he added, alluding to the growing global trade of increasingly high-technology products. The Germans, Japanese and others restructured their societies, including their school systems, to suit. But American education stuck to a pattern that was largely set early in this century.</p>
        <p>"We drifted," Mr. Sizer said. "We were so damned focused on Russia that we never faced up to the changing economic reality."</p>
        <p>"There were important exceptions," he said, "but in general American education underwent a mindless continuation of the existing system."  Direction  Fear Giving Way To New Concerns</p>
        <p>Dr. Lifton and his staff at the Center on Violence and Human Survival have been monitoring the views of selected clusters of people on broad national issues for many years. But his current study, begun before the cold war ended, came up with a result that surprised him.</p>
        <p>About 80 people from different social backgrounds in the New York area were interviewed in depth starting in 1987, and at the beginning "the fear of nuclear war we encountered was fairly widespread," he said, adding, "They spoke of a holocaust, the end of the world."</p>
        <p>But Charles B. Strozier, co-director of Dr. Lifton's center, said that by 1990 "we began to note how that imagery was changing: Rather than fear of nuclear war, people began offering environmental images, fear of the greenhouse effect, the ozone layer and Chernobyl as dangers to the future."</p>
        <p>Out of that, Dr. Lifton said, Americans appear to be turning their concern away from mortal enemies toward dangerous social problems instead.</p>
        <p>But in the view of John Mack, a psychologist, it may not be so easy for the nation's leaders to follow.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mack is founding director of the Center of Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age at Harvard University. His studies convince him that in America, the cold war greatly exaggerated the human tendency "to judge ourselves by who we are and who we are not -- male or female, good guy or bad guy, American or Russian."</p>
        <p>That need, Dr. Mack says, is a central feature of the human psyche, and it grew far stronger because the other side was poised to strike with nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>For the last 40 years, America's leaders have played on that, he said. But now, with the new era, how will the nation's leaders cope when "they can't find a reliable enemy to mobilize the nation any longer?" he asks.</p>
        <p>With the enemy at last removed, Dr. Sizer wonders whether America can "be driven by a sense of our own ideals" without the additional impetus of fear of annihilation.</p>
        <p>Or, as Dr. Mack asks, will the nation's leaders create new enemies instead? "Will we fall back," he wonders, "to the old easy way of divide and blame, mobilize the people out of fear?"</p>
        <p>That is the looming question of America's new age.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>NEXT: The American military struggles to redefine itself. HOW WAR BECAME 'COLD'</p>
        <p>Athough Walter Lippmann and Bernard Baruch have been given credit for inventing the term "cold war," it was coined by the publicist and speechwriter Herbert Bayard Swope. By his own account, given in "William Safire's Political Dictionary," Mr. Swope first began using the phrase in personal letters just before World War II, when Americans were talking about possibly entering "a shooting war" with the Germans. Mr. Swope considered that phrase "rather tautologous and redundant," he said in a letter to Mr. Lippmann, so he came up with the phrase cold war -- "the proper opposite of the so-called 'hot war.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Swope said he first used the phrase referring to the American-Soviet conflict in a speech he wrote for Mr. Baruch in 1946. But Mr. Baruch said he and his advisers decided that the phrase "was too severe," and so he did not use it until 1947. By that time, apparently, he had decided that the severity was warranted. In a speech in Columbia, S.C., he said: "Let us not be deceived. Today we are in the midst of a cold war."</p>
        <p>The phrase caught on quickly after that, in part because Mr. Lippmann began to use it, too.</p>
