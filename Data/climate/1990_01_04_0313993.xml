        <p>LEAD: Generations of children have delighted in the scary lore that Tyrannosaurus rex was the largest and fiercest predator ever to walk the earth.

        <p>Generations of children have delighted in the scary lore that Tyrannosaurus rex was the largest and fiercest predator ever to walk the earth. A leading paleontologist has announced, however, that another family of dinosaurs every bit as large and ferocious flourished 30 million years before tyrannosaurs ever saw the light of day.</p>
        <p>The latest addition to the bestiary of dinosaurian supervillains is named Epanterias amplexus - a rare, giant version of allosaurs, the common carnivorous dinosaurs. Neck and tail vertebrae, jaw bones, teeth and other revealing fossil fragments from an epanterias have been found and excavated by a University of Colorado group headed by Dr. Robert T. Bakker.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bakker, one of the world's leading paleontologists, said the latest find would enable scientists to piece together a fairly coherent portrait of epanterias that is likely to change ideas about predators and prey in the Jurassic period - the middle period of the age of dinosaurs, in which the first mammals appeared. For one thing, huge Jurassic plant-eating dinosaurs like the brontosaurs, also called apatosaurs, must have been terrorized by much more formidable predators than was formerly believed.</p>
        <p>An Informal Announcement</p>
        <p>Although the discovery of the epanterias fossil has not yet been published in a scientific journal and therefore has not been evaluated by other paleontologists, the University of Colorado decided to announce the discovery and issued a statement.</p>
        <p>A few bone fragments from two other epanterias specimens were discovered in the last century but were generally ignored by paleontologists, Dr. Bakker said yesterday in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>He said epanterias was about 50 feet long - the same length as the largest tyrannosaurs - and had jaws that could expand like those of a snake. Epanterias could have gobbled an animal the size of a 1,400-pound cow at a single gulp, Dr. Bakker said.</p>
        <p>The epanterias bones discovered by the Colorado group were found in an ancient, fossilized lake bed known as the Morrison Formation near Masonville, Colo. It was in the same rock formation that the fragments of the first epanterias specimen were found, and misidentified, by the pioneer dinosaur hunter Edward Drinker Cope in 1877. Some bones from a second epanterias were discovered in 1932 near Norman, Okla., but these also languished in obscurity until the latest discovery focused scientific attention on them.</p>
        <p>Plan for Composite Model</p>
        <p>Dr. Bakker's group plans to collaborate with Dr. James Madsen, former chief paleontologist for the state government of Utah, and scientists from Brigham Young University and the Oklahoma State Museum to assemble a composite model of epanterias based on all three specimens.</p>
        <p>Superficially, Dr. Bakker believes, epanterias must have looked very much like its distant relative, the tyrannosaur. It walked on its three-toed hind legs, its jaws were armed with daggerlike teeth and it was very large, weighing some four tons. But unlike tyrannosaurs, epanterias had large, powerful forelimbs, each tipped with three claws, unlike the two-clawed tyrannosaur forelimbs. Epanterias also probably moved with a crouching gait, with its head much closer to the ground than that of a tyrannosaur.</p>
        <p>In most respects other than size, epanterias evidently resembled its cousins, the allosaurs, which have been described as the ''tigers of the Jurassic.'' Allosaurs are frequently found in Jurassic rock deposits. Some 100 specimens have been recovered and displayed in American museums.</p>
        <p>''Most experts have assumed that the allosaurs, about 35 feet long, were the worst threats to the herbivores of the Jurassic, some of which were gigantic and probably able to fend off even an allosaur,'' Dr. Bakker said. ''But epanterias would have spelled trouble for everyone.'' Epanterias was probably the only Jurassic dinosaur large and strong enough to kill a full-sized brontosaur on its own, he said, although smaller allosaurs hunting in packs could also have brought down large prey.</p>
        <p>When Epanterias Lived</p>
        <p>The allosaurs were the dominant land carnivores of the Jurassic period, which extended from 195 million years ago until the dawn of the Cretaceous period 141 million years ago. ''Epanterias seems to have lived during a span of only 1.5 million years - a very short time for a reptile genus, as we think of reptiles today,'' Dr. Bakker said. ''Of course, if epanterias was warm-blooded, as I believe it was, this would be consistent with its relatively short survival as a genus.'' It is certain, he said, that epanterias had died out completely at least 30 million years before tyrannosaurs evolved in the late Cretaceous period. Epanterias apparently fell victim to the same wave of mass extinctions that ended the Jurassic period.</p>
        <p>The reason for these extinctions is unknown, although Dr. Bakker and some others believe they occurred when lowered sea levels created land bridges between continents. This would have facilitated major migrations that could have introduced lethal disease organisms to newly vulnerable animal populations. A similar mechanism might account for the mass extinctions that included the demise of all dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous 65 million years ago, Dr. Bakker believes.</p>
