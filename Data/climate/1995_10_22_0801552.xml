        <p>With nearly 3,000 buses in its fleet, New Jersey Transit ranks as the second-largest public transit operator in the country, behind only the New York  City Transit Authority.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to vehicles powered by alternatives to diesel fuel, New Jersey Transit has one of the country's smallest fleets, with only five experimental buses equipped to run on compressed natural gas.</p>
        <p>That ratio concerns environmentalists, who want New Jersey Transit to do more to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel. They note that transit agencies around the country are switching to compressed natural gas in light of recent scientific data indicating that it produces less soot than diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>"If this does not change, we will be stuck with dirty diesel buses and their  deadly pollution for years to come," said Mary D'Arcy, transportation advocate for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Law and Policy Center, in Trenton. The group expects to start a "Dump Diesel" campaign in November in cooperation with the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.</p>
        <p>New Jersey Transit, though, says that environmentalists should not be too quick to jump on the compressed-gas bandwagon.  Diesel fuel, the agency says, satisfies Clean Air Act requirements and is easier to handle and cheaper than compressed natural gas.</p>
        <p>"When you get into some of these new areas of technology, you're never sure what you might encounter," said Chuck Berkshire, deputy general manager of maintenance support for New Jersey Transit. "The diesel engine has been cleaned up immensely, and they're making it more efficient."</p>
        <p>It is an important debate, and not just because the choice of whether to stick to diesel or add natural-gas-powered vehicles will affect air quality, tax dollars and transit efficiency. Whatever New Jersey Transit does will very likely have a ripple effect on other transit agencies.</p>
        <p>Around the country, diesel is still king, but compressed natural gas is the fastest-growing alternative fuel. In January 1994, there were 297 natural-gas buses; now, there are 1,000 out of a total fleet of 52,000. And more than a dozen transit systems have pledged to stop buying diesel buses, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Cleveland, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Long Island bus division.</p>
        <p>In Sacramento, Calif., 95 out of 200 buses run on compressed natural gas -- the highest percentage in the country -- and 40 more will arrive next year. Mike Wiley, assistant to the general manager of the Sacramento Regional Transit District, said the natural gas buses break down less frequently (10,375 miles between road calls by the mechanic for compressed gas; 5,380 miles for diesel) and cost less to operate (26.6 cents per mile versus 46.8 cents).</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, natural gas hasn't worked out as well. New Jersey Transit experimented with five such buses out of its Orange garage for two years and suffered repeated failures by engines and transmissions, as well as other maintenance problems.</p>
        <p>The difficulty lay in the uneven quality of the methane gas delivered by Public Service Electric and Gas, the transit agency said. So now, after working  out the kinks, New Jersey Transit plans to try it again starting next month, with three buses operating out of its Mercer County garage and two operating out of Orange.</p>
        <p>Passengers have no way of telling the difference between diesel and natural gas, unless they look underneath the buses (a natural-gas bus has six torpedo-shaped tanks) or put them on a scale, where a natural-gas bus would weigh 4,000 pounds more.</p>
        <p>Instead of ordering more natural-gas buses, New Jersey Transit is leaning toward developing other technologies, including soy-based diesel fuels, liquefied natural gas and hydrogen power. This is because diesel engines are improving quickly in cleanliness and efficiency. It is also because the start-up costs of converting to compressed natural gas -- fueling, ventilation, maintenance, retraining, and more -- would be "phenomenal," Mr. Berkshire said.</p>
        <p>A clean-burning diesel bus costs about $250,000; a natural- gas bus costs $50,000 more. "If you're in a budget crunch and you can achieve clean air goals  with either technology, you find that some transit agencies are opting to go with clean diesel," said Chip Bishop, a spokesman for the American Public Transit Association in Washington.</p>
        <p>But for all the improvements in diesel, natural gas still produces less soot.</p>
        <p>In March, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham Young University released a study indicating that fine particles emitted by automobile engines, power plants and other sources could increase the risk of death by 15 percent in cities with the dirtiest air.</p>
        <p>And as part of a continuing program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., researchers have found that compressed natural gas  engines "have been substantially better in several areas -- carbon monoxide, particulate matter and lower nitrous oxide emissions," said Rob Motta, a senior  project engineer.</p>
        <p>Those arguments, plus those from diesel supporters, will probably be aired at a public workshop on "Clean and Alternative Fuels for Motor Vehicle Fleets" on Friday, organized by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, Division of Energy, and the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>A Memorial in Motion</p>
        <p>For the past month, drivers have been seeing a mysterious poster on buses: a woman's portrait with the legend "Gone but Not Forgotten." The posters, it turns out, are a memorial to Gloria Van Natten, who ran the Van Natten Advertising Company in Glen Ridge before she died in July at 68. The company places ads on New Jersey Transit and independent buses. "It's just kind of a way of saying, 'She's gone, but everyone that knew her loved her,' " said her daughter, Suzanne Van Natten Mzur. "She liked to travel, and we thought it would be kind of cool putting her on buses."</p>
