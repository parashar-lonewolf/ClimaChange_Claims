        <p>THIS election year is full of pronouncements about the futur'. But perhaps none is as startling as the architectural apparition now rising amid the prickly pear on a scraggly stretch of land outside Austin. It is here that Pliny Fisk 3d -- ecologist, designer and professional renegade -- is building his experimental Advanced Green Builder Demonstration house, a brave strange-looking leap into the eco-future.</p>
        <p>Huge silver cisterns stand heroically at the entrance and glint in the sun. "How do you hide the 13,000 gallons of rainwater a month the average family needs to survive a drought in this climate?" Mr. Fisk mused.</p>
        <p>You don't.</p>
        <p>For the last 20 years, Mr. Fisk, an architect and landscape architect (he holds master's degrees in both), has been running his nonprofit Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems here, a sort of Ice Station Zebra for ecological research and design. The 2,000-square-foot, $250,000 demonstration house, which will be open to the public when -- and if -- it is finished this year, is conceived as a sort of model home for environmentally committed Mr. and Ms. Blandings of the future. They will use energy-efficient appliances and low-flush composting toilets and will have no problem gardening with waste water. Their house will rely on and commune with nature's own resources and rhythms. Photovoltaic roof panels will capture energy from the sun and transform it into electricity; rain is to be the family's only source of water.</p>
        <p>Part futuristic, part primitive -- Mr. Fisk gamely calls it "the esthetics of the unfinished" -- the structure brings together much of the center's thinking under one impossible-to-miss roof.</p>
        <p>Once considered on the fringe, the center, which Mr. Fisk, 51, co-directs with his wife, Gail Vittori, 41, a former head of the Austin's Solid Waste Advisory Commission, is now widely considered to be in the vanguard of the country's eco-friendly or "green building" movement. "He's given the whole movement a more technical bent and a less touchy-feely direction," said James White, an Environmental Protection Agency scientist.</p>
        <p>Let other architects and builders throw around words like "green" and "sustainab ility" as a marketing tool. Mr. Fisk is trying to figure out what they actually mean. A man with photovoltaic energy who possesses some qualities  of a mad scientist and obsessed inventor, he may be found huddled over a Crock-Pot or computer in his "earth lab," analyzing blocks of alternative building materials, some of them looking like dead ringers for shredded wheat.</p>
        <p>The other day, the lab was filled with fluorescent 'ights broken in a hailstorm; Mr. Fisk, who finds inspiration in both science and Tinkertoys, was exploring their re-use as glazing for solar collectors. Called a "building ecologist" by one colleague and a "hands-on curmudgeon" by another, he has an eclectic reach. It extends from locating forgotten or neglected regional building materials, which can nurture new businesses, to applying local solutions to similar climates and regions around the globe.</p>
        <p>Thanks largely to Mr. Fisk and Ms. Vittori (who call each other "P. Fisk" and "G.V."), Austin is now a hub of "sustainable building" activity, including a city program that helps consumers rate "how green is my building." Mr. Fisk has  advised Mississippi flood victims on how to rebuild in environmentally sound ways. And he is undoubtedly the only architect in the country who has advised both President Clinton and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. During the mid-1980's the Sandinistas asked him to design a housing project for Misquito Indians that  wasn't dependent on imported building materials. After intensely analyzing local resources, he came up with an energy-efficient spin on traditional Nicaraguan building: roofs made of clay tiles interlocked with palm fronds.</p>
        <p>"We're trying to discover opportunities that might literally be under our feet," Mr. Fisk explained on a frigid morning recently, warming his own feet by  the wood stove in the center's somewhat ramshackle offices in a former general store (minus the original gas pumps). "We're trying to develop techniques and materials to help figure out what the dickens we" -- meaning the big "we," the planet -- "should be doing."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisk can be incomprehensible at times (that's where Ms. Vittori comes in). But everything comes down to this: As he puts it, "There can't possibly be  only one way of doing things." That conviction, which causes him to rethink practically everything, to some potential clients' chagrin, is in full flower in his demonstration house, under roofs that soar like Texas derricks, silos and grain elevators.</p>
        <p>Conceived as "a kit of parts that you can adapt," in Mr. Fisk's words, the design grows out of a balance between nature and need. Many parts of the building play multiple roles. For example, the galvanized steel roofs, which hover over the building like Spanish tildes, provide shade and also contain a system to "harvest" rainwater, a sophisticated variation of the old barrel under the eaves.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether an average family with good conservation habits can survive on a mere 25 gallons a day, for everything from washing dishes to heating and cooling the radiant ceilings and floors. Although the average household uses 70 to 110 gallons a day, this is the amount Mr. Fisk and Ms. Vittori are budgeting -- for philosophical reasons and because their fixtures are highly efficient.</p>
        <p>The water will be purified naturally in waste-water landscapes using gravel and plants. "The landscape is vital to how a building works," Mr. Fisk said. "It's not just a thing to look at."</p>
        <p>The core of the house is a breezeway, an idea drawn from the Texas vernacular. But by contrast to more conventional architectural ideas of regionalism, most of them stylistic, Mr. Fisk is dedicated to using local materials that will not damage the environment. Columns and beams are made from  experimental cements concocted in his backyard from bottom ash (a byproduct of aluminum smelting) and fly ash (from coal-burning). He is using straw from Texas grasslands to make the home's clay walls and its plywood panels. Portland cement releases too much carbon dioxide, he contends, contributing to global warming.</p>
        <p>"Right now, there's a standard way people build houses," Ms. Vittori said. "They all look the same, with same materials. We're saying design should grow out of nature's resources, the materials, the water, the energy, the waste -- the whole thing."</p>
        <p>But the most far-reaching idea may be the way "Max's Pot," as the center is nicknamed, envisions family living space. Cribbing ideas from Tinkertoys and Erector sets, Mr. Fisk is creating exterior walls that can be unbolted, in the belief that "a building that is changeable is a proper investment by society." The components are long metal cages made of crushed cars that he thinks can also be fashioned into furniture.</p>
        <p>"Families change over time," he explained. (Just as his did: he has two college-age children from a previous marriage, he and Ms. Vittori have a son, 14, and a daughter, 8.) "But there is an extraordinary amount of waste in changing buildings. A house is built, and then the next owner has a totally different idea of what the kitchen should be. So they spend another $30,000 tearing it out, and on it goes. Maybe we should be throwing out a new idea. Does the kitchen make sense as we move into the next millennium?"</p>
        <p>Although it is still in the conceptual stages, Mr. Fisk is planning a mobile  kitchen on wheels, a k a "meals on wheels," appropriated from another vintage Tepas staple, the barbecue. Instead of using air-conditioning, "why can't a kitchen move out of the house in good weather?" he reasons.  A utility channel in the floors will allow the sink and stove to travel to the breezeway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisk's space-saving concept for the bathroom probably won't win mainstream adherents: he is planning a circular bathroom, with movab'e fixtures  attached to a central pole, around which family members would orbit. A shred of  privacy would be achieved with heavy cloth dividers. He sincerely believes that  a family of four can happily coexist with one tiny bathroom. "The amount of waste in bathrooms is ridiculous," he said. "This has to do with the evolution of Texans on the planet Earth."</p>
        <p>Taking advantage of Texas breezes, the building has a second-floor outdoor sleeping porch, like farm'ouses of old. But will this house be as beautiful? And is America ready for it? Those questions are still unresolved. Bob Berkebile, a  Kansas City architect who often collaborates with Mr. Fisk, notes that in order  to be loved, a green building has to "lift the spirit" as well as perform. As Mr. Fisk put it, "It has to bridge science and art."</p>
        <p>The demonstration has already drawn financing and donations from an array of  sources, including the United States Department of Energy, the Texas Governor's  office, the Lower Colorado River Authority and Austin's electric utility and Health Department as well as an eco-parade of some 27 companies. They are interested in Mr. Fisk's conclusions, among other things, as to how much photovoltaic panels can lower electric costs.</p>
        <p>George James, a program manager at the Energy Department who is working with  Mr. Fisk and others on developing mass-produced energy-efficient housing, said:  "Like Buckminster Fuller, Pliny's ideas may be more appreciated a hundred years  from now."</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Fisk may be leading the way, consumers aren't so far behind. "In a lot of ways, the buying public is ahead of the builders," Mr. James said. "They're interested in comfort and low utility bills and in environmentally friendly housing. The builders will change, but it'll take a while."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisk views his calling as "absolutely inevitable." The grandson of a Wall Street financier (Pliny I) who lost his fortune, and son of a microbiologist (Pliny II), Pliny III grew up near Yorktown Heights in Westchester County, in a  house that was never finished and with a yard filled with compost piles and rusting Rolls-Royces.</p>
        <p>At the University of Pennsylvania, he studied architecture with Louis Kahn and landscape architecture with Ian McHarg. He also delved into social systems science at the Wharton School. In 1974, he came to Austin to teach architecture  at the University of Texas and immediately plunged into a career juggling "political hot potatoes," in his words.</p>
        <p>After founding Max's Pot with his ex-wife, Daria, he went to @rystal City, Tex., to help Mexican-American leaders build solar collectors and water heaters  after the natural gas was shut off in a political dispute. He advised them to use mesquite for fuel, which he said has "twice the B.T.U. volume of Texas coal."</p>
        <p>Perhaps his most heralded project to date is the Blueprint Farm in Laredo, Tex., an adaptation of Israeli techniques of dry-land farming.  Mr. Fisk's design, which was not totally completed due to lack of financing, included a shading system made up of paper-thin shades and tents on poles, an idea adapted  from Bedouin tent societies in Iran. The poles were fashioned from drilling rods, salvaged from defunct south Texas oil fields. The buildings are currently  being recycled as the Rio Grande International Studies Center, a nonprofit environmental museum.</p>
        <p>"People think Pliny is a dreamer, but he dreams great dreams," said Dr. Tom Vaughan, a biologist who is the president of the Rio Grande center. The dreams include self-reliance and buildings that participate with nature. It is a "lift  yourself up by the bootstraps" notion that is at once conservative and radical.</p>
        <p>"You know, it might not work," he said cheerily, while gazing at the vaulted  metal roofs that continue to confound Austin motorists. "It's a possibility."</p>
