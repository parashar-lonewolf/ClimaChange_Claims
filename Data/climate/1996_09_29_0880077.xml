        <p>The future used to be so much simpler. A century ago, prophets had no trouble knowing what life today would be like. The Popular Science Monthly already realized in 1895 that the 20th century would be ''the Trolley Age.'' In ''Looking Backward,'' the best seller that fomented a national political movement in the 1890's, Edward Bellamy foresaw that the Socialist government of the year 2000 would give each citizen an annual ''credit card'' -- and that the allotted sum would be so generous that the happy citizen wouldn't even want to spend it all. The house of 2000, according to H.G. Wells, would have self-cleaning windows, and the floor would be easy to sweep because the architect would ''have the sense and ability to round off the angle between wall and floor.''</p>
        <p>Wells's most audacious prophecy was about prophecy itself -- what he called ''the discovery of the future.'' Soon, he announced in 1902, experts will make forecasts that ''will be just as certain, just as strictly science, and perhaps just as detailed as the picture that has been built up within the last 100 years to make the geological past.'' Today his smug confidence sounds preposterous, but in fact Wells was quite prescient. The future has been discovered. Most people still don't realize it, but we can scientifically predict what will happen in the next 100 years.</p>
        <p>We can't foresee the technical details -- whether, for instance, the Digital Age will last longer than the Trolley Age -- but we can confidently predict the important things: how humans of 2006 or 2096 will fare materially and emotionally. We can do this by studying the prophets of the past century, which for sheer quantity has been the golden age of prediction.</p>
        <p>Doomsaying was popular all century among the intelligentsia -- E.M. Forster envisioned a mechanized dystopia long before ''Brave New World'' and ''1984'' -- but in the early years, prophets like Bellamy still hoped that utopia would arrive with Socialism. Other optimists were busy at pulp magazines like ''Amazing Stories'' and ''Modern Mechanix,'' which promised the 13-hour workweek, the Nuclear-8 sedan and an aerocar in every driveway. The peak of optimism was the 1939 World's Fair. It featured the General Motors ''Futurama'' -- a tour of ''the wonder world of 1960'' on the seven-lane ''express Motorway'' -- and a huge model of a planned community called Democracity, which The Times Magazine hailed as ''The City of Tomorrow Morning.''</p>
        <p>''It is no impossible dream of H. G. Wells or Jules Verne,'' the article explained. Democracity would have convenient suburbs, ample parking and ''little or no traffic congestion.'' It wouldn't need a police force, since ''a city devoid of slums and poverty will breed little crime.'' As the city's planner, Henry Dreyfuss, told the Magazine: ''Living in a spacious world, filled with beautiful and useful things, Man of Tomorrow will be a happy, healthy animal.''</p>
        <p>Man of Tomorrow has looked a lot less healthy since World War II. If he's not fatally irradiated, he's likely to be a mutant trying to survive in a wasteland. If he's not enslaved by technology, he's at least profoundly alienated by it. Scientists have been turning out popular books prophesying nuclear annihilation and assorted environmental catastrophes. Dystopian visions have become the norm in films like ''Planet of the Apes, ''Blade Runner,'' ''A Clockwork Orange'' and ''Waterworld.'' Perhaps the closest thing to a popular modern utopian novel is ''Time and Again,'' the 1970 book in which the narrator reaches an enlightened, unpolluted world by going back in time to 1882 -- the reverse of the trip taken by Bellamy's narrator in ''Looking Backward.''</p>
        <p>Today's pessimism would have been difficult for the old prophets to understand, because the modern world actually contains many of their predictions. For all their loopy utopianism, the optimists got a lot of things right. The air-conditioned house, predicted in a 1915 article in Ladies Home Journal headlined ''You Will Think This a Dream,'' is here. We have the dishwashers imagined by Wells and the ''electronic ovens'' featured in the old RCA/Whirlpool ''Miracle Kitchen.'' Thanks to the Futurama's expressways, New York is ''spreading in wide and splendid suburbs toward Boston and Philadelphia,'' just as Wells predicted.</p>
        <p>People enjoy long retirements and routinely live to their 80's, as Bellamy dreamed, and they have even more cultural wonders than the citizens of his utopia. In ''Looking Backward,'' a visitor to Boston in 2000 is astonished to discover he can listen to any of four concerts being transmitted by wires from distant halls. He tells his host how incredible this would have seemed in the 19th century: ''If we could have devised an arrangement for providing everybody with music in their homes, perfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to every mood, and beginning and ceasing at will, we should have considered the limit of human felicity already attained.''</p>
        <p>Well, we have the music. What happened to the felicity? If Bellamy were here today, I would suggest he look for the answer -- and learn how to predict the next century --</p>
        <p>by heading off not to Boston but to another utopia that</p>
        <p>I once visited: Shangri-La.</p>
        <p>Lost Perspective</p>
        <p>James Hilton created Shangri-La in ''Lost Horizon,'' his 1933 novel about a peaceful Himalayan valley of long-lived people, but there was already a real place named Hunza that fit the description. This isolated valley, in northern Pakistan near the Chinese border, is inhabited by people of uncertain origin who speak a language unrelated to any other known tongue. For more than a century, travelers who braved Himalayan cliffs to reach Hunza have been returning with reports of a ''valley of eternal youth'' where illness is virtually unknown and farmers work the fields at the age of 140. A Harvard Medical School physician investigated Hunza and declared it a ''bastion of longevity'' in a 1974 article for National Geographic titled, ''Every Day Is a Gift When You Are Over 100.'' When I went there seven years ago to write about the fabled ''Hunza health secrets,'' I understood why everyone called it Shangri-La.</p>
        <p>It was the most beautiful place I'd ever seen. The valley's lush green terraces were shielded from the outside world by a 25,000-foot pyramid of snow shaped just like the mystical mountain in Hilton's novel, and there seemed to be a remarkable number of old people as hale as the monks of Shangri-La. But my enchantment didn't last. The great Hunza secret to old age turned out to be its absence of birth records. The illiterate elders didn't know how old they were, and they tended to overestimate their ages by a decade or two, as I discovered by comparing their recollections with known historical events. Hunza didn't have an unusual number of centenarians, it turned out, and its traditional way of life was not a formula for good health.</p>
        <p>The mountain air did seem pristine, but the people spent most of their time inside mud huts breathing horribly polluted air from open fires. They suffered from bronchitis and a host of ailments like tuberculosis, dysentery, malaria, tetanus and cancer. An iodine deficiency in their diet caused mental retardation. Children went hungry in the spring as food stores dwindled. The life expectancy for people in the isolated traditional villages, according to a 1986 medical study, was only 53 years for men and 52 for women. The healthiest people were the ones living in more modern villages near a new road to the outside world. There, trucks were bringing in food, vaccines, antibiotics, iodized salt and stoves with vented chimneys. Nearest this road, life expectancy was rising, a trend that would have delighted the designers of General Motors's Futurama: better living through highways.</p>
        <p>The people of Hunza were not delighted, though. Virtually everyone I interviewed believed that the intrusion of modern civilization was shortening lives. People blamed their current health problems on chemicals in imported fruit and germs in imported grain, and they insisted that the valley had once really been Shangri-La. An elderly woman named Bibi Khumari told me: ''The people today are like pencils. We were like tree trunks. The babies were so healthy in the old days.''</p>
        <p>''How many babies did you have?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''Sixteen. But the first 13 died.''</p>
        <p>''Thirteen died? But you said in those days the babies were so healthy.''</p>
        <p>''I had a curse from the fairies,'' she said. That was why my children were dying. Otherwise the babies were healthy.'' She paused, then added absent-mindedly, ''Nowadays there is not as much fairy sickness.''</p>
        <p>I was surprised at her nostalgia, but I shouldn't have been. She was no different from the typical person in America or anywhere else. We're living through the greatest miracle in the history of our species -- the doubling of life expectancy since the Industrial Revolution -- but we prefer to believe that our troubles are growing. Like the people of Hunza, we focus on current problems instead of looking at long-term trends. Besides reducing felicity, this short-term thinking makes for lousy prophecy.</p>
        <p>The best way to predict the next century is to study the past few millennia, as the economist Julian L. Simon has been doing ever since he saw a headline in these pages in 1965 warning of a population doomsday. Simon was properly alarmed and decided to make population control his lifework. But then he came across long-term historical studies -- the kind ignored in the popular press -- that contradicted the prevailing despair about population growth. Simon, who now teaches business administration at the University of Maryland, went on to debunk doomsday predictions with his own forecasts, and also with his own money.</p>
        <p>The Long-Term Forecast</p>
        <p>Simon's latest book, ''The State of Humanity,'' includes 660 pages of historical statistics and concludes with 2 basic predictions for the next century and any century thereafter:</p>
        <p>1. Humanity's condition will improve in just about every material way.</p>
        <p>2. Humans will continue to sit around complaining about everything getting worse.</p>
        <p>If you doubt his forecast, Simon will be glad to make a bet. He and a consortium of fellow optimists have $100,000 available to wager all comers, with a limit of $10,000 for any single bet. A neutral party will hold both sides' money in escrow. You can name the sum and pick any year after 2000. Simon will bet you that the average person in any country that year, compared with today, will live longer, be better nourished and educated, have a bigger home, make more money and enjoy more free time in a world that's safer, cleaner and blessed with cheaper energy and natural resources.</p>
        <p>But be warned. Simon has already won money from professional prophets, notably Paul R. Ehrlich, the popular ecologist. Ehrlich's 1968 book, ''The Population Bomb,'' envisioned a fifth of humanity starving to death by 1985 (and that was the most optimistic scenario). In a later book, ''The End of Affluence,'' he predicted that prices of natural resources would soar. Simon, knowing these prices had been falling for centuries, proposed a wager. In 1980, Ehrlich and two colleagues picked five metals (chrome, copper, nickel, tin and tungsten) and bet $1,000 that they would be more expensive in 1990. A decade later, all five metals were cheaper. Simon collected his winnings and issued an open challenge to bet on any measure of material human welfare.</p>
        <p>So far, Simon has found a couple of bettors on future food supplies and lumber prices, but he hasn't been able to get another wager with Ehrlich or other well-known prophets. Ehrlich has ducked Simon's challenge by offering to bet instead on various ''global indicators,'' like the future atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide or the amount of cropland per person -- trends that disturb environmentalists but that aren't reliable measures of human welfare. It's true, for instance, that the amount of cultivated cropland per person is shrinking today, as it has been for centuries, but that's because farmers grow so much more food per acre that they need less land. The important statistic is the amount of food produced per person, which has been rising for centuries. The loss of cropland has been a recurring scare in doomsday books, but it's actually good news: less cropland means more habitat for humans and wildlife.</p>
        <p>Simon acknowledges that technology creates environmental problems, and if strict environmental preservation is your highest priority, he won't try to persuade you that things are getting better. But he's confident that humans will eliminate most environmental problems and adapt to the rest. Whatever climate changes are caused by the greenhouse effect, farmers will keep producing more food. New plagues and forms of pollution will appear, but life expectancy will keep rising because humans will find new ways to cope. As people in poor countries get richer, they'll buy the technologies that have reduced air and water pollution in rich countries. They'll be able to afford more parks and nature preserves, and they'll have more opportunities to visit them.</p>
        <p>Only war or political upheaval, Simon believes, could halt human progress. ''I predict that the incidence of war will decline,'' he says, ''because the incentive for conquering land is becoming lower now that we need so much less land for agriculture. But I wouldn't bet on this prediction. It's probably true that a higher percentage of the world's population is living in peace than ever before in history, but we don't have good long-term data.''</p>
        <p>It's often argued that the mere existence of nuclear weapons is an unprecedented burden on humanity: we all live in fear of an entire city being instantly destroyed. But our ancestors lived in fear, too. They didn't build massive walls around their towns for esthetic reasons. Even the farmers in the sheltered land of Hunza weren't safe. They built a massive fort to protect themselves against farmers in a neighboring kingdom, who would periodically invade, hoping to make slaves of the Hunza villagers.</p>
        <p>When you consider how widespread legal slavery and political despotism used to be, today's threats to personal liberty don't seem so frightening. Free democratic societies have never before been so common around the world. The possibility of Big Brother or a Brave New World seems less likely today than earlier this century, when many prophets -- both utopians and dystopians -- believed that central planning made for a more efficient society. Democracies feared they couldn't compete militarily or economically with dictatorial regimes, but the dictators lost the wars and ruined their economies. It is possible, of course, that dictators will regain power, or that intrusive governments and powerful special interests will stifle freedom and economic growth. But Simon is ready to bet you it won't happen.</p>
        <p>Future Angst</p>
        <p>In the eighth century B.C., long before the Parthenon was built, the poet Hesiod announced that Greek civilization had no future. Greeks had once enjoyed an ''age of gold,'' he wrote, but now they were burdened with ''soul-crushing cares'' in the ''age of iron.'' Soon, things would be even worse: ''To mortal men shall remain only the most woeful anguish.''</p>
        <p>Unless a 2,700-year-old trend is about to reverse, humans will be making the same complaints 100 years from now. The utopian prophets early this century mistakenly assumed that human nature could change dramatically -- no greed, no crime, no conflict -- once we satisifed our basic material needs. But technological abundance merely gives us more opportunities to worry. Simon likes to quote an old saying: ''No food, one problem. Much food, many problems.''</p>
        <p>Our social discourse next century will be shaped, as usual, by nostalgists and technophobes. The ancient Greeks believed Pandora's Box was a punishment for the discovery of fire, and we've never lost that distrust of new technology. Last century, The New York Times warned that electric light would damage people's retinas; French experts predicted that railroad travel would cause passengers' blood vessels to burst. Railroads were decried by literati like Melville and by the aristocrats, who complained that the lower classes would ''move about needlessly.'' In ''The Theory of the Leisure Class,'' Thorstein Veblen summarized the perennial attitude among the gentility: ''Innovation is bad form.''</p>
        <p>New technologies threaten vested interests and give political and religious leaders opportunities to rally traditionalists against unholy menaces. Today's fundamentalist Muslims ban satellite dishes as a form of moral pollution; 17th-century Catholic and Protestant clerics opposed surgery as an ''unnatural'' way to relieve pain; 5,000 years ago, shamans probably sacrificed virgins as penance for the sin of irrigation. Next century's clerics will find new causes for alarm, and they will be abetted by the growing class of secular worriers. Academics and bureaucrats will seek funds by discovering new problems to study. Journalists will win awards and attract audiences by finding new scourges, real or imagined.</p>
        <p>As the rest of the world becomes as rich as America, people everywhere will have the luxury of fretting about the problems that consume us. As more of their babies survive, they'll focus on endangered species of beetles. Once they've removed raw sewage from drinking water, they'll worry about one-part-per-billion traces of chemicals. Environmentalism looks very much like the great conservative crusade of the next century. The movement includes traditional technophobes -- landed gentry, intellectuals, bureaucrats, political activists -- and appeals to the innate desire to revive ''a sacred age of the remote past,'' as the philosopher Robert Nisbet has observed. In its quest to restore a ''utopia of nature,'' Nisbet says, environmentalism has succeeded Christianity and Socialism to become Western history's third great redemptive struggle.</p>
        <p>Why we can't see that by historical standards we're already living in Shangri-La? Why do we listen to doomsayers? It seems to be our evolutionary heritage. Our species thrived by learning to plan for the future, and to fear it. We react instantly to danger, and nothing seems as dangerous as the unknown. We're primed to pay attention to frightening stories on the evening news, and we'll pay for the adrenaline rush of watching a disaster in the movie theater. The only other drive that produces such a visceral response is sex, which creates its own set of discontents. The evolutionary imperative to reproduce -- to attract the best mate and support the most children -- seems to have imbued us with endless desires for more status and more resources. No matter how much better we're doing than our ancestors, we're always doing worse than some of our neighbors. No matter how much healthier and wealthier everyone becomes, we always read about a ''gap'' between one group and another.</p>
        <p>And no matter how much our life expectancy increases, we know that it is finite. We're prone to that literary pitfall, the pathetic fallacy, in which the poet believes that Nature is reflecting his own mood: the rain clouds are weeping for his lost love. We think the world is getting worse because our bodies are deteriorating. In 1902, when H.G. Wells was 36, he declared that ''we are entering upon a progress that will go on, with an ever-widening and ever more confident stride, forever.'' Four decades later, when he was 79 and fatally ill, he saw no hope for humanity. ''This world is at the end of its tether,'' he wrote. ''The end of everything we call life is close at hand and cannot be evaded.''</p>
        <p>It's conceivable that something in the next 100 years will cheer us up. Perhaps drugs or genetic engineering will tame our rogue hormones and make us more blissful. Maybe someday we'll live forever by downloading our brains into synthetic bodies. Would the conquest of death be enough to make our cybernetic descendants content? Or would they sit around reminiscing about how much happier and healthier everyone was when bodies were made of mortal flesh? I know where I'd put my money.</p>
