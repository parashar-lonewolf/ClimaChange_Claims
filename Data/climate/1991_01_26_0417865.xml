        <p>As the battle heats up to win over consumers who are concerned about the environment, packaging is becoming more of an issue. When one package is marked "environmentally friendly," and the one next to it is not, would you buy the former in hopes of doing a little to improve the health of the planet?</p>
        <p>Surveys indicate that a lot of shoppers would. Some would even pay more: In a nationwide survey of 313 women conducted in June for Gerstman &amp; Meyers, a New York packaging design company, 78 percent of the respondents said they would pay 5 percent more for a product with environmental benefits and almost half (47 percent) said they would pay 15 percent more. The number of people willing to pay an extra 15 percent almost doubled, from 27 percent, just a year ago, the company reported.</p>

        <p>As the battle heats up to win over consumers who are concerned about the environment, packaging is becoming more of an issue. When one package is marked "environmentally friendly," and the one next to it is not, would you buy the former in hopes of doing a little to improve the health of the planet?</p>
        <p>Surveys indicate that a lot of shoppers would. Some would even pay more: In a nationwide survey of 313 women conducted in June for Gerstman &amp; Meyers, a New York packaging design company, 78 percent of the respondents said they would pay 5 percent more for a product with environmental benefits and almost half (47 percent) said they would pay 15 percent more. The number of people willing to pay an extra 15 percent almost doubled, from 27 percent, just a year ago, the company reported.</p>
        <p>Faced with this trend, makers of consumer products and package designers are continuing to strive to improve their image with people concerned about the environment. 'Confusing' Claims</p>
        <p>Their new approach is called "green marketing" and in their efforts to portray themselves as environmentally concerned, some companies are making claims that do not stand up under close examination. A group of 10 state attorneys general concluded recently that "attempts to take advantage of consumer interest in the environment have led to a growing number of environmental claims that are trivial, confusing or even misleading."</p>
        <p>In its report, issued in November, the group offered recommendations for what it called "responsible environmental advertising." The Federal Trade Commission has been asked by manufacturers and the packaging industry to issue a nationwide rule regulating environmental claims, but until it does "The Green Report" by the attorneys general is probably the best guide available for evaluating ecological assertions.</p>
        <p>One type of claim that should be avoided, the report said, is such broad, vague statements as "environmentally friendly" and "safe for the environment." The problem with these value judgments is that they may not adequately reflect the pros and cons of what is most important for the environment. Is ease of disposal more important than toxic pollution generated during manufacturing? Is cutting down trees to make paper worse than the oil spills associated with the production of plastics?</p>
        <p>If any claim is made, it should be accompanied by justification, the attorneys general said. For example, the Procter &amp; Gamble Company would probably have violated the guidelines if it simply put "better for the environment" on its packages of Downy fabric softener. But by adding the phrase "less packaging to throw away" on the small paperboard container that can be used to refill a large plastic bottle, it appears to meet the guidelines.</p>
        <p>Another kind of claim that should be avoided is those that promise broad environmental benefits after just one ingredient has been removed. For instance, if the maker of an aerosol spray stops using ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons as propellants, it is not automatically entitled to label the product "ozone friendly." Other ingredients, like methyl chloroform, that may still be in the product are also regarded by many scientists as harmful to the ozone layer. And volatile organic solvents that are often substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons contribute to the formation of harmful low-level smog.</p>
        <p>In general, the report said claims should be as specific as possible. For aerosols, it said, a more appropriate label would be one that states, " 'Does not contribute to ozone depletion' and also lists the substitute and all other ingredients used in the product."</p>
        <p>Here is what "The Green Report" said about some other environmental terms used on packaging:</p>
        <p>RECYCLED. By itself, this word does not provide enough information to make informed product choices. What percentage of a product or package must be made of recycled material before it is entitled to the claim? There is no accepted standard.</p>
        <p>Another question is what constitutes recycling. The point of recycling is to re-use materials used by consumers, thus reducing the drain on natural resources and shrinking the amount of trash that must be disposed of. In manufacturing, these are called "post-consumer materials."</p>
        <p>But some industries routinely re-use scrap from their own processes in making new products and call these recycled. According to some definitions, paper that does not contain any trash can be labeled recycled.</p>
        <p>"The Green Report" points the way to meaningful recycled labeling. A small note on the inside back cover notes that "the text is printed on 100 percent recycled paper, 5 percent of which is post-consumer waste."</p>
        <p>RECYCLABLE. This is probably the most contested claim of all. Most materials can be recycled with enough effort and money, so almost anything could carry the label.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers say using the label helps educate the public about recycling. But environmentalists and the members of the study panel say the claim is often simplistic and misleading, particularly in areas where there are no convenient recycling plants. Why should a consumer buy one product instead of another because of the claim that it is recyclable, when both will actually end up in the same landfill? The study contends that the recyclable label should be used only where recycling is actually taking place.</p>
        <p>DEGRADABLE. This claim and the related "biodegradable" and "photodegradable" labels have generally been dismissed as irrelevant by the attorneys general and environmental groups. They say that such terms mislead consumers by implying an environmental benefit when there is no evidence that degradability offers any advantage if a product is disposed of in an incinerator or landfill, where all waste decays very slowly. Several states have brought legal actions against companies that made degradability claims for plastic trash bags and disposable diapers.</p>
        <p>COMPOSTABLE. Although many products can be composted -- the biological decay of organic materials -- in fact, very few plants exist in this country for composting municipal solid waste. "Without the ability to have an item composted in the consumer's area, promoting a product as 'compostable' is utterly meaningless and thus deceptive," "The Green Report" concludes.</p>
