        <p>The "new world order" projected by President Bush to grow out of the Persian Gulf war is looked upon by third-world spokesmen with skepticism, suspicion and doubt that it will really bring anything new to their relations with the developed world.</p>
        <p>That's a conclusion that seemed warranted after an international conference sponsored here by the International Press Service Council on Information and Communication.</p>
        <p>Most participants either represented or seemed to be influenced by the views of third-world nations. And that's where more than 80 percent of the world's population lives, as pointed out by Kofi N. Awoonor, Ghana's United Nations representative.</p>
        <p>What, ideally, would a new world order be like? asked Benjamin Mkapa, Tanzania's Minister of Information, in a panel discussion. In his view, it would "herald more equal political, economic and cultural relations between states. It would promote a greater access to and sharing of productive technology  [ and ]  provide for more evenhanded competition. And it would open opportunities for all states and peoples, not just the developed ones, to express and enjoy a greater cultural freedom."</p>
        <p>Neither he nor other speakers expressed much hope for such a revolution in international relations. Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan, in the keynote speech, added the further requirement that "a new agenda for the next century" should go beyond traditional concerns to "the survival issues -- global warming, the loss of species, reversing deforestation, the question of future water supplies for a planet of 10 billion."</p>
        <p>In a speech read by Hasan abu Nimah, Jordan's envoy to Italy, the Crown Prince said "that using oil as an environmental weapon is something that desperate warmongers are quite willing to do," as shown by the gulf war. "If the oil wars have begun," he added, "the water wars may not be far behind -- and then conflicts stemming from the consequences of soil loss, forest loss, high global temperatures and rising sea levels."</p>
        <p>In the Crown Prince's view, however, "the United States seems to have virtually given up all claims to international leadership on these issues." It was generally accepted by the conferees that the U.S. now was the world's only superpower -- hence the necessary leader in a changing world.</p>
        <p>One Western voice, that of George Gerbner of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, cited television as an obstacle to a truly new order. Its enormous power and reach, he said, were controlled by "a handful of global conglomerates with something to sell"; and its daily content left the world "drench [ ed ]  . . . in expertly choreographed brutality."</p>
        <p>TV, according to Professor Gerbner, teaches that violence, like the gulf war, is an effective solution to problems. He said it also encouraged support for anything that enhanced people's sense of security in what they saw as a "mean world." Hence the worldwide "tidal wave of television" produced support for political decisions leading to wars, from populations conditioned to believe that violence could improve their security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mkapa also thought it "not implausible that if a new world order emerges" from the gulf war and the collapse of Communism, "it will be based on respect for the force of might rather than the force of argument."</p>
        <p>For one thing, he said, the U.N. has been remarkably firm in pursuing a military course against Iraq, possibly signaling more such collective action in the future. For another, third-world nations can no longer play off one superpower against another. Now there is no rival to temper the power of the one remaining superpower.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Mkapa's view, moreover, "even the most vainglorious and irredentist of third-world leaders cannot but have been shocked and unnerved by the awesome destruction poured over Iraq by the war machines of the coalition forces" -- mostly those of the industrial world.</p>
        <p>These developments, he said, might mean less instability and adventurism in the third world; but they would tend also "to work for increased dominance" by the developed nations rather than for "more respectful, more naturally beneficial relations."</p>
        <p>In the U.S. too, the conference was told, though there's much hope for a new world order, widespread questions also exist. That conflict will be detailed in another article.</p>
