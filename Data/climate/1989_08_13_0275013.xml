        <p>LEAD: THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS GATHERED in the East Room of the White House on June 12 thought they had died and gone to heaven.</p>
        <p>THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS GATHERED in the East Room of the White House on June 12 thought they had died and gone to heaven.</p>
        <p>After eight years of receiving the brushoff from the Reagan White House, treated like rabble outside the gate, the Sierra Club and its ilk were on the guest list to hear the new President unveil his proposals to fight air pollution. As George Bush ticked off his initiatives - most notably, to act on the long-delayed devastation of acid rain - the environmentalists understood themselves to be witnessing the greening of the Presidency. ''The logjam has been broken,'' Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said later. Bush hit ''a grand slam,'' said the National Wildlife Federation president, Jay D. Hair.</p>
        <p>The mood that morning was ceremonial, befitting the occasion. But it contrasted with the pyrotechnics that had lit up other White House chambers, the Roosevelt Room and the Cabinet Room, in previous weeks, when the Administration engaged in a bruising internal debate over the environmental line the President should take.</p>
        <p>At seven Cabinet-level meetings, three of them run by Bush, William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, crusaded for strong anti-air-pollution measures that would, in effect, sock it to American industry. Several of the President's Cabinet Secretaries and department heads favored doing much less. When the shouting subsided, Bush ignored his more senior advisers and signed on to Reilly's proposals, amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970. And Reilly, a political newcomer who says that during the battle he felt as though he were having his ''brains beat in,'' exulted: ''We got a program that adds 50 percent or maybe more to what the country lays out on pollution control every year. And, by heaven, that is a strong measure of Presidential commitment.''</p>
        <p>Pale and thin, with a soft voice and courtly manners, the head of the non-Cabinet E.P.A. - a regulatory body that enforces antipollution laws, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Superfund, for the cleanup of toxic wastes - has emerged from a position of traditional inconsequence to become a key policy shaper. Reilly has had this President's ear like no other chief in the agency's 19 years. Most recently, this was evident at the Paris economic summit: Bush, alone among the seven world leaders, brought his chief environmental adviser. For one meeting, a limousine whisked the two to the Louvre pyramid, where the E.P.A. Administrator, a polyglot, interpreted for Bush in environmental talks with Francois Mitterrand.</p>
        <p>Months earlier, it would have seemed farfetched for the 49-year-old Reilly to be an intimate of the powerful. He came to government after 15 years as president of the Washington-based Conservation Foundation, a think tank with a reputation for not ruffling feathers.</p>
        <p>As the first professional conservationist to head the E.P.A. since Russell Train, during the Ford years, he carries with him all the pent-up hopes and visions of a renascent environmental movement. A steady stream of issues has put the E.P.A. on front pages for months and kept Reilly so busy he has sometimes taken home three briefcases at night. But the danger as some environmentalists see it is that Reilly will be placated with promises. Since Bush's ringing statement of purpose on clean air was announced in June, the White House has sent to Congress a bill whose specifics, weakened from a preliminary draft, have drawn fire from some environmentalists. ''The President's rhetoric was great, but the program he laid out doesn't match it,'' says Daniel Becker, a Sierra Club lobbyist. ''Children who are yet unborn will graduate from college before they'll breathe clean air.''</p>
        <p>IF A TOUGH CLEAN-AIR BILL - THE MOST IM-portant environmental legislation Bush is likely to introduce in his first term - is ''a litmus test'' for the President, as Reilly once told him, it is also a litmus test for Reilly himself. When he was named last January, conservationists generally hailed Reilly's appointment, but some wondered if he had real fire in his belly. In the environmental movement, he was a cautious moderate. At Reilly's confirmation hearing, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the liberal environmental protection subcommittee, wondered whether Reilly would ''conciliate, mediate and negotiate away our environmental laws.''</p>
        <p>Reilly is the nation's top environmental cop. There is no swagger or flamboyance in his manner; he cultivates a statesmanlike image. In conversation, he is a generous anecdotalist, but his speech is rarely earthy or direct; often it sounds like boilerplate from speeches he has given.</p>
        <p>Several colleagues note that Reilly's low-key style has served him well in the noisy environmental field. Business lobbyists come to see him expecting a zealot, but find an administrator in a conservative suit with a dapper pocket hankie. He acts exceedingly nice - and they're disarmed. ''I've seen that happen with auto executives and oil guys,'' says William Rosenberg, head of the E.P.A. air-pollution office. ''There's no question where he stands, and yet he says it in such a pleasant way you don't feel you want to kill the guy when he's done.'' Six months after his appointment, Reilly has discovered that to survive in big government, he has had to reconcile his fundamental civility with the need to be a tough advocate. It was barely eight weeks into his tenure that his credibility and Bush's claim that ''I am an environmentalist'' were almost irreparably damaged over a single issue: the March 24 wreck of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's scenic Prince William Sound. Public opinion polls pummeled the President for not acting decisively for two weeks, not until crude oil had reached two national parks and the projected death toll - 2,000 otters and 33,000 birds - had stunned conservationists. The President chose a passive approach in part because of advice he was given by Reilly and others that Exxon could handle the cleanup.</p>
        <p>The Monday after the Friday disaster, a concerned Reilly had called the White House and said, ''I think I'd better get up there.'' After two days in Alaska, Reilly returned at dawn and reported to the President. ''My position was that it's an incredible catastrophe,'' says Reilly now. ''It breaks your heart to look at the impact of it.''</p>
        <p>Yet he did not press Bush to federalize the cleanup. Not until a week later, when Exxon's efforts had proved inadequate and public pressure was mounting, did Bush assign the Coast Guard to a limited role. The Administration's response was ''tardy and derelict,'' says Senator Baucus. ''I think the Administration should have jumped in full force and directed Exxon to clean up.''</p>
        <p>Reilly didn't urge early Federal action, according to aides, because he believed Exxon officials who told him they could manage the 11-million-gallon spill, the worst in the nation's history. When it came to flying in dozens of oil-skimming boats and miles of containment booms, Reilly thought a huge corporation could act more decisively than government, with less taxpayer expense. Furthermore, Reilly says Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper told him a Federal presence was not needed. ''Our position as we brought it back was a position that was very widely held up there at the time,'' he asserts.</p>
        <p>SURPRISINGLY, THOUGH ENVIRONMENTAL-ists and members of Congress have scorched Bush for his dilatory response, they have not included the E.P.A. Administrator in their criticism. It may be the environmentalists are unwilling to alienate the best ally they have in the Administration. Or they may simply recognize in Reilly's caution the hallmark of a career in which he has regularly broken ranks with the more emotional and populist wing of the environmental lobby.</p>
        <p>Reilly has been a card-carrying Green most of his professional life, but he did not come by his sympathies as a backpacker or member of an organic-farming commune. Rather, he was an academic. Having grown up in Fall River, Mass., he got a master's degree in urban planning from Columbia University, after receiving a B.A. from Yale and a law degree from Harvard. He worked on land-use issues for the President's Council on Environmental Quality, under Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1970's, at the Conservation Foundation, Reilly began a program called Business and the Environment, which brought together industry and conservation groups to forge a consensus on polarizing issues. The concept was controversial with most environmentalists, who thought that sitting down with polluters was selling out the cause. Reilly argued the game had changed - that after the sweeping laws of the early (Continued on Page 63) 70's, the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts - it was necessary to involve people who ran the polluting plants to bring about change.</p>
        <p>The idea of escorting corporate America to the table to talk politely about pollution appealed to establishment philanthropies like the Rockefeller and Mellon Foundations, which underwrote Reilly's work. In fact, the Conservation Foundation, which in 1985 became affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund, has become the very nexus for a strand of environmentalism that has run through do-gooding elements of the American establishment since 1916, when the Rockefellers and others gave the land that would become Acadia National Park. On its ''very classy board,'' as one officer termed it, are New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean; Anne Bass, the Texas socialite; Joseph F. Cullman 3d, a retired chief executive officer of Philip Morris, and - most interesting, perhaps, in light of Reilly's advice on the Alaska oil spill - top officers of Exxon Chemical.</p>
        <p>With all its potential clout, the foundation has rarely been politically active. It has been called ''the Vatican of the environmental movement'' for its conservative, measured reports. ''I would say they have had surprisingly little effect in the areas I've worked in,'' says Richard Ayres of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is known as the ''shadow E.P.A.'' because it helped draft nearly all the antipollution laws. ''I've never seen anything they did that was really relevant to policy change.''</p>
        <p>Gordon Binder, Reilly's chief of staff and formerly a top aide at the Conservation Foundation, rebuts that: ''I don't buy for a moment the criticism that because we weren't out there litigating or arguing on the Hill that we weren't making a difference. We had a different role.'' Last year, the foundation sponsored a forum on protecting ecologically vital wetlands. It sat down oil and timber executives with wildlife defenders, and together they called for no ''net loss of the nation's remaining wetlands.'' The position found its way onto candidate Bush's official agenda.</p>
        <p>T HE ESSENCE OF REILLY'S predicament is this: By instinct a moderate, in the context of the Bush Administration he is an out-and-out zealot. On pollution matters, most of Bush's men still carry a torch for the Reagan years, when new environmental regulations were blocked on the ground they would stall America's economic engine.</p>
        <p>''In an Administration that believes in free-market ideology,'' Reilly says, picking words carefully in his top-floor office of the shabby E.P.A. head-(Continued on Page 66) quarters in Washington, ''the guy who speaks for the environment has got to do so very clearly, because there won't be anybody else delivering the message.''</p>
        <p>The hint of belligerence in his tone reflects the long battle over the President's clean-air bill. The pro-environmental position the President announced in June may have looked like an Administration consensus; but as a reconstruction of the White House infighting illustrates, no consensus ever existed.</p>
        <p>For years, an alliance of antiregulatory conservatives and defenders of economic interests from auto makers to coal miners has frustrated attempts to strengthen the Clean Air Act. Last amended in 1977, the act is the nation's most sweeping environmental law, but over the years it has grown feeble, as pollution far exceeded expectations.</p>
        <p>Smog, which reached the highest levels in a decade during the torrid 1988 summer, is the ultimate symbol of the law's failure. Partly as a result, the environment rose up as a belated campaign issue. Candidate Bush promised to clear the air.</p>
        <p>At first, Reilly hoped to deliver to Bush a list of amendments to the Clean Air Act that represented the collected wisdom of the Domestic Policy Council, a Cabinet-level group that threshes out the President's proposals to Congress. But in mid-April, at a meeting of all the major players except Bush, Reilly unveiled his blueprint for a consensus - and trespassed into a minefield.</p>
        <p>According to officials present, Richard G. Darman, the powerful director of the Office of Management and Budget, who was chairman of the meeting, flagellated the blueprint as too costly to industry and demanded that the working group that drafted the proposals come up with much broader options, reflecting cheaper measures. In particular, Darman criticized a plan to reduce by half acid rain, which devastates life in lakes and streams and is suspected of damaging forests, mostly in the Northeast and Canada. Invoking an O.M.B. predecessor, Darman recalled that David Stockman had dismissed a ''preposterous proposal'' on acid rain in 1983 with the quip that every fish saved might as well be solid gold. And now, Darman continued, here comes Reilly with a proposal that would cost twice as much.</p>
        <p>''That's because there are half as many fish,'' Reilly replied.</p>
        <p>There was laughter. But Darman's acerbic critique, in keeping with his reputation for abrasiveness, was a major setback. ''It was an uncompromising attack, basically, on the proposal to spend any money at all on acid rain, as nearly as one could follow it,'' recalls Reilly.</p>
        <p>According to some Administration officials, Reilly was simply naive in hoping to place a consensus option on the President's desk. What Reilly should have done, says one source who followed the early stages of the four-month process, was to be prepared from the outset with alternatives less inimical to industry: ''Nobody in the White House in a Republican Administration is just going to sign onto an E.P.A. option without seeing a bunch of others.''</p>
        <p>Darman, a Reagan holdover, and other White House conservatives are averse to the traditional ''command and control'' policies of the E.P.A. The agency wanted an across-the-board cut of 10 million tons a year of sulfur dioxide, which is spewed from tall smokestacks of coal-fired power plants, mostly in the Midwest. In the air, sulfur dioxide changes chemically and falls to earth as acid rain, often hundreds of miles away. A 10-million-ton cut, the E.P.A. believed, was ''the magic number'' needed to reduce acid rain by half. Darman eventually came out for a least-cost option that would cut seven or eight million tons. Reilly believed if he split the difference with Darman, the Administration bill would reek of compromise, cease to be credible and be ''dead on arrival'' in Congress.</p>
        <p>This was a watershed moment in Reilly's political education. He was forced to question whether conciliation with his Administration foes would get him anywhere.</p>
        <p>''I sure got the feeling in making the rounds of the other agencies, Agriculture, Labor and all the rest of them, that it wasn't going to work if I tried to look for points of consensus with everybody,'' he says now. Instead of looking for common ground, Reilly ordered the E.P.A. to refine its research and sharpen its debating points. Some positions were discarded, but on the whole Reilly became an outspoken advocate. ''It was the real world,'' he says. ''It was a clarification to me that getting this stuff out was going to be a bitch.''</p>
        <p>His most controversial proposal was to dampen Americans' love affair with gasoline-fueled automobiles, the chief cause of urban smog. The E.P.A. made the suggestion that fully half the cars on the road in the dirtiest cities be required to run on ''clean'' fuels, such as methanol.</p>
        <p>When Reilly laid this on the table at a Cabinet-level meeting in May, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, ''went ballistic,'' according to one participant. Moore contended Reilly's program for natural-gas-based methanol would ruin the auto and petroleum industries. Reilly countered that the costs, which would be passed on to consumers, were much less than Moore claimed, and that poll after poll showed Americans were willing to pay for stronger environmental laws. ''The Energy Department weighed in on what sounded to me like an oil-company line, just totally savaging the proposal,'' he says.</p>
        <p>On June 5, at the final White House powwow on clean air, Reilly summarized his positions. Then Darman delivered his most damning blast. According to officials present, he argued that Bush should simply write off his pledge to be an environmental President: Bush could never make nature lovers a Republican constituency, Darman said coolly. Environmentalists cannot be pleased. Their expectations will rise and become excessive, and in the end Bush would be trashed. It was better to recognize that and give up now, rather than after proposing to enact such expensive legislation.</p>
        <p>The President took notes but said little through the 90-minute meeting. Then on Friday, June 9, he flew to Camp David to make his decisions, keeping even his closest advisers guessing. Reilly's best clue to the outcome came late that night, when he had a long talk with Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who was to receive the final decision papers from the President by helicopter the next day, and Reilly realized Sununu agreed with him. This was a surprise, for Darman and Sununu have formed an alliance as the two most powerful figures atop the President's staff. But on the matter of air pollution, Sununu, a former New Hampshire Governor, who has long favored controlling acid rain, a problem in his home state, broke with the budget director. Sununu ignored, as did the President, the advice to write off the environment on political grounds.</p>
        <p>O F THE CLEAN-AIR options discussed in the Domestic Policy Council, the President chose the most-stringent options -those advocated by the E.P.A. - on most of the dozens of issues that were on the table. On acid rain, he proposed cutting 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide annually, as well as 2 million tons of nitrous oxide, another cause of acid rain, by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>To fight urban smog, the President has asked Congress to tighten standards for automobile emissions, gasoline volatility and small sources of noxious fumes, such as dry cleaners. Bush endorsed a scaled-back version of Reilly's clean-fuel program for cars that would, Bush said, in language that has chilled Detroit, ''reconcile the automobile and the environment.'' It would require auto makers to manufacture alternative-fueled vehicles that eventually could represent 30 percent of the market in the nation's dirtiest cities.</p>
        <p>Still, the President did not tell environmentalists everything they wanted to hear, which reflects Reilly's caution in never having argued for the wish list of the National Clean Air Coalition, an environmental lobby. For instance, neither the President nor Reilly would touch raising the Federal tax on gasoline, which is one way, some believe, to cut auto use by favoring fuel conservation. To do so would violate Bush's no-new-taxes pledge.</p>
        <p>In the month between the announcement of goals and drafting detailed legislation, Reilly's opponents regrouped and diluted the bill's impact on industry. Reilly said the final draft was ''faithful in every respect to the spirit and letter'' of the original.</p>
        <p>To the letter, maybe. But environmentalists angrily charge the spirit has been violated. In June, for instance, Bush promised to reduce automobile-tailpipe emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, which are ''cooked'' by the sun to produce ozone. But in July he said every new car need not show improvement. General Motors, say, could average the pollution of its entire output to meet the Government standard, balancing emissions of a big Cadillac and a small Chevrolet. Environmentalists argue this would allow Detroit to produce some models that pollute more than they already do.</p>
        <p>Overall, critics are skeptical that Bush's bill will bring, as promised, all but three cities - New York, Los Angeles and Houston - into line with Federal ozone standards by the year 2000. The deadline, they contend, will have to be extended, as it has been over and over since the 1970's.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, given the 12-year deadlock on this issue, Bush had been widely expected to offer a weaker package, and the relative stringency of his proposed measures has disarmed many Congressional Democrats. Now it is almost certain the President will sign a bill, palatable if not perfect to environmentalists, next year.</p>
        <p>T HE TOUGHNESS OF the clean-air bill matters, not only at home but abroad, where it sends a signal on America's willingness to tackle an expensive, controversial problem as environmentalists increasingly are asking for world cooperation to fight pollution. To many people, 1988 was ''the year the Earth spoke back,'' a recognition of the emergence of a host of ills threatening Earth's life-sustaining capacity.</p>
        <p>''The sense I've had over the last year is the environment is much less under control than we'd thought,'' says Reilly. ''This is a new generation of problems. They weren't there in the late 60's and early 70's.''</p>
        <p>The most notorious of these is global warming, or the greenhouse effect, which occurs primarily when carbon dioxide is pumped into the air by burning coal, oil and natural gas. Trapped in the upper atmosphere, molecules of carbon dioxide reflect heat like the panes of a greenhouse. Scientists are divided over how much planetary temperatures could rise, but many predict that by the middle of the next century a surge in sea level could push the Atlantic miles inland, ocean currents could change direction, and the earth's breadbaskets could become 1930's-style dust bowls.</p>
        <p>Reilly, like most environmentalists, believes the threat must be addressed in a global treaty; it won't work if one country acts unilaterally while the rest of the world merrily burns fossil fuels. But the idea of a global treaty threatens many in the Bush Administration, who worry about the impact on industries such as energy and transportation. Although Congress directed the President in 1987 to develop a global warming policy, virtually nothing has been done. This year, when the E.P.A. produced a report on stabilizing global warming, the recommendations were instantly controversial. They included raising auto fuel efficiency to 40 miles per gallon, replacing fossil fuels with wood grown on special plantations and developing solar power.</p>
        <p>Some of the most closely read paragraphs in the final communique of the recent Paris economic summit pertained to global warming. The seven leaders endorsed the efforts of a United Nations group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to draft an agreement similar to the 1985 Vienna Convention for Protection of the Ozone Layer. Reilly welcomed this as a bold stroke, the first time such leaders had favored a greenhouse treaty. But environmentalists despaired that the seven leaders hadn't committed to specific goals. ''It's not exactly an action agenda,'' says David Wirth of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''It would have been reasonable to identify, as an interim goal, reductions of 20 percent of carbon dioxide by the industrialized world by 2005.''</p>
        <p>R EILLY'S ROLE AS A Bush intimate in Paris has more or less astonished his E.P.A. troops. Since Nixon created the agency in 1970, it has, at best, existed on the margins of Presidential awareness. Once, when Reilly sent the President a copy of a speech he had given, it came back from the Oval Office with a handwritten note in the margin. E.P.A. staff members gushed: Bush's two sentences were more Presidential feedback than the agency received in eight years from Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>When Reagan did think of the E.P.A., it was to declaw it, and a string of political appointees kept agency professionals on a short leash. Suits against polluters dropped 40 percent between 1980 and 1988, and only 19 of 1,100 toxic waste sites were cleaned up. As Vice President, George Bush was a leader of the antiregulatory assault, earning a D rating for his record from the League of Conservation Voters.</p>
        <p>This raises an intriguing issue: In declaring himself an environmentalist, appointing Reilly and heeding his advice, has Bush shown that he is secretly a Green? Or has he mostly made a political decision to steal the environmental issue from the Democrats? Either way, the environment may reap the benefits. Politics undoubtedly plays a role, but it is also true that many of the decisions Bush and his E.P.A. chief have made have caused industry - a core Republican constituency - to howl.</p>
        <p>And Reilly has used the power he has gained to shape an increasingly aggressive E.P.A. The agency announced a gradual ban on cancer-causing asbestos, which the Office of Management and Budget had sandbagged for years. Reilly is also moving against toxic material in crop sprays, which has upset agribusiness.</p>
        <p>Reilly has so far failed to bring a majority in the Bush Administration around to his view, and he may never win over many. Indeed, Washington is filled with E.P.A.'s natural enemies. In late July, for example, the Energy Department asked Congress to exempt the largest nuclear weapons plant, the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, from Federal water-pollution standards.</p>
        <p>But Reilly has forged a consensus with the one player who matters most. ''Bill has an interesting role,'' says a White House staff member involved in environmental policy. ''There are people in the Cabinet who don't trust him because they view him as an advocate for a particular point of view. But that is exactly the reason the President does trust him.''</p>
        <p>Reilly and the President, strangers six months ago, have discovered a personal chemistry. Over private lunches they've shared an odd, but not wholly incompatible interest in the outdoors, Reilly's rooted in campaigns to save the whales, the President's in his love of hooking the big ones. The evening in June that Bush first announced his clean-air bill, he telephoned Reilly from Wyoming, where he'd flown to promote it. ''He thanked me and congratulated me and was very modest about his own part in it, and very generous about mine,'' Reilly says. ''And he told me he caught six fish.''</p>
