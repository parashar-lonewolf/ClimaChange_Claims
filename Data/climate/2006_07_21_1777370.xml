        <p>10 P.M. (Showtime) SEXUAL HEALING Joe and Harry Gantz are the, um, masterminds behind HBO's ''Taxicab Confessions.'' But this, their latest series, takes a decidedly clinical approach to their favorite topic. The sex educator and therapist Dr. Laura Berman (above center) each week helps three couples for whom intimacy has become something of a snooze.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Disney) READ IT AND WEEP Doing in the popular girls should always be so easy, and satisfying. In this made-fortelevision movie, Kay Panabaker plays an ordinary14-year-old teetering on the brink of outcast status whose private journal is accidentally published, turning her -- and her book's way-cooler alter ego (played by Kay's older sister, Danielle)-- into media darlings. So there.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (13) BILL MOYERS ON FAITH AND REASON Richard Rodriguez, a Peabody Award-winning journalist and a lifelong Roman Catholic, remains with the church even though it condemns his homosexuality. Sir John Houghton, a scientist who weaves Christianity into his lectures on climate change, continues to believe despite his conviction that proof is necessary. This episode, Part 5 of seven, examines why, and how, two devout Christians maintain faith amid doubt. Says Sir John, ''One of the most important statements you should be prepared to make as a believer is 'I don't know.' ''</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (A&amp;E) BIOGRAPHY She looks like a million these days, but there was a time when Anna Nicole Smith (right) was nothing but a hardluck story. This special traces Ms. Smith's ascent to flush times through her marriage to a wealthy octogenarian, her reality show and her transformation courtesy of TrimSpa. Up next: motherhood.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (USA) MONK Nepotism pays off when Julie Teeger's basketball coach dies in what looks like an accident and she calls on her mother's employer, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), to solve the case.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (TBS) SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE (2003). And it finally does when a middleaged record executive (Jack Nicholson) grows up and starts dating his young girlfriend's mother.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (USA) PSYCH Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn they are not. Shawn (James Roday, left) and Gus crash a fancy wedding to recover a stolen engagement wing in this series about a phony psychic and his real best friend.</p>
