        <p>Despite growing interest in the fate of the planet, nothing short of sharp changes in government policies and people's attitudes will rescue the earth's ailing ecosystems from destruction, a report from the Worldwatch Institute says.</p>
        <p>In the institute's annual report on the state of the world, Lester R. Brown, president of the Washington-based environmental research group, is not without hope.

        <p>Despite growing interest in the fate of the planet, nothing short of sharp changes in government policies and people's attitudes will rescue the earth's ailing ecosystems from destruction, a report from the Worldwatch Institute says.</p>
        <p>In the institute's annual report on the state of the world, Lester R. Brown, president of the Washington-based environmental research group, is not without hope. Indeed, Mr. Brown notes that there were more journalists at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June than there were participants in a similar conference in Stockholm 20 years earlier. But he warns that the strides made in Rio were not nearly long or swift enough to save the earth.</p>
        <p>The report, "State of the World 1993," cites familiar examples of the earth's environmental problems, including rising population, increasing carbon emissions (which many scientists blame for global warming), depletion of the ozone layer, vanishing forests and the erosion of topsoil.</p>
        <p>It contends that if such trends continue, the world will be populated by too many people with too few resources to sustain them. By the middle of the next century, the report says, poverty, hunger and pollution will be even more widespread and perhaps irreversible.</p>
        <p>Though recycling and conservation can help alleviate these problems, the report says such measures are insufficient and calls for sweeping changes by government, industry and the public.  Higher Taxes Possible</p>
        <p>People in industrialized nations must want, and even demand, environmentally sustainable technologies, although this may require higher taxes, the report says. Governments, in turn, must make private companies responsible by enacting policies "that make economic and ecological imperatives converge."</p>
        <p>Governments should regulate the burning of fossil fuels, the production of hazardous chemical and nuclear waste, and the use of pesticides, the report says. More important, it goes on, they should subject all of these activities to taxation. The carbon tax, which is intended to discourage the use of fossil fuels, would be one such example. Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands have already adopted it.</p>
        <p>The report suggests that environmental taxes would not only encourage thrift but would also spawn many new, environmentally sustainable technologies that drew from alternative sources like solar and wind power.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Brown said the measures called for in the report would involve investments in the trillions of dollars, but he added: "People are always asking how much it would cost us to respond to these problems. I ask how much it would cost if we don't."</p>
        <p>He said a mandate for environmentally friendly technologies could be an economic boon for some companies and a powerful stimulus for industrial innovation. Winners and Losers</p>
        <p>"Those corporations that anticipate how environmental trends will influence the evolution of the global economy and incorporate them into their long-term plans will be the winners," he said. "Those companies that resist change will be the losers."</p>
        <p>Copies of "State of the World 1993" can be obtained for $10.95 from the Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington 20036.</p>
