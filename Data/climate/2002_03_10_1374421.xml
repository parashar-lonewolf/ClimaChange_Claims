        <p>It is hard to believe that Matthew Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, will have his group focus on seven issues [''The Island's Economic Issues,'' Jan. 27] but fails to include energy on the list.</p>
        <p>LIPA's budget this year projects spending $1.02 billion for fossil fuel (oil and natural gas) and purchased power out of a $2.44 billion budget. Thus, more than 40 percent of LIPA's budget and the average customer's bill will be spent on fuels that pollute.</p>
        <p>Ratepayers need to keep the billions of dollars for fuel in perspective as they wonder why renewable energy can't seem to gain a foothold. After all, Richard Kessel, LIPA's chairman, has boasted repeatedly that LIPA is spending $32 million per year for five years on energy efficiency efforts. That amount is minuscule when contrasted with the billions of money spent on fossil fuels. But LIPA's promises are as phony as a three-dollar bill. LIPA's own ''Clean Energy Initiative'' report from last June reveals that LIPA hasn't even spent $30 million for the two years and seven months covered by the report. They spent nothing in 1998, $8.54 million in 1999 and $21.21 million in 2000.</p>
        <p>In nearly three years LIPA spent less than $1 million on solar power. That's less than LIPA has spent in advertising about energy efficiency in the media. Certainly there has been no ''balanced'' spending to wean Long Island from expensive foreign and out-of-state suppliers of fossil fuels and toward renewables.</p>
        <p>While LIPA pays lip service to energy efficiency, it is lying to the public and its own numbers prove it.</p>
