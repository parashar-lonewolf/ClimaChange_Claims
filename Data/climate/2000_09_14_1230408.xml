        <p>New York City Council leaders proposed a law yesterday that would give New York the nation's first air-emission standard for the release of carbon dioxide. But they were the first to admit that carbon dioxide was not their real target.</p>
        <p>The bill, proposed by the Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, is aimed at forcing the city's older electricity generating plants to reduce overall pollution levels.</p>
        <p>''This is a back-door way of doing that,'' Mr. Vallone said.</p>
        <p>The carbon dioxide bill, which was written with the aid of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation group, is unusual on a number of fronts, environmental experts say. First, it would regulate an emission that is not generally considered a health threat; more dangerous pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are already monitored by state and federal authorities.</p>
        <p>Second, the bill would use a regulatory apparatus to do something other than its stated purpose. By reducing carbon dioxide from power plants, the bill's supporters say, other, more toxic emissions will be reduced as well, almost as a kind of biproduct.</p>
        <p>The backdrop of the proposal is a vast wave of electric power plants proposed for construction in the city over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Many electricity experts, including the chairwoman of the State Public Service Commission, Maureen O. Helmer, have said that the open market for electricity will push out the city's older power plants, which won't be able to compete economically with the newer, cleaner burning plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone, who is expected to run for mayor and has become an increasingly vocal critic of what he calls the failures of a deregulated energy market, said a carbon dioxide law would essentially give those older plants an additional push. Fines would be imposed on plants that exceeded a yet-uncalculated carbon dioxide cap, and the fines, according to the bill, would make the noncomplying plants uncompetitive, forcing them to clean up or close down.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for KeySpan Energy, which owns the city's largest generating plant, Ravenswood, in Queens, said he feared that the bill might have a negative effect on air quality.</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Bob Mahony, said that New York City plants, if pushed by a new law to burn cleaner, more expensive fuels like natural gas exclusively might find themselves in a competitive disadvantage with dirtier, coal-fired plants in the Midwest. The coal-burning plants would then produce and sell even more electricity in the region, but the cleaner plants would sit idle, resulting in more pollution, not less.</p>
        <p>An economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, Ashok Gupta, who helped write the carbon dioxide proposal, disagreed, saying that because of technical limits on power transmission, the region is probably already importing about as much Midwest energy as it can.</p>
