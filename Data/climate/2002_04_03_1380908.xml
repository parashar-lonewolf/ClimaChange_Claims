        <p>''Humpty Dumpty,'' Eric Bogosian's new play now being presented at the McCarter Theater Center here, unfortunately spills over from strident social satire into a cautionary tale. As in his previous work -- three plays and half a dozen one-man shows -- the pursuit of plenty as an American value, the contemporary warp on the pursuit of happiness, comes in for substantial disdain.</p>
        <p>But here his comic rage over the various forms of acquisitiveness and twisted self-justification that he sees running unchecked in American life is attached to a warning of global consequences. The play is brazenly conceived but pedantically executed. It has a finger-wagging quality, aimed particularly at a generation that will fondly recall stereo turntables and Van Morrison, that you keep wishing it would shake off. Still, though there is an element of paranoia in Mr. Bogosian's vision of the world -- which teeters, in the new play, like Humpty Dumpty on the wall -- current events have certainly made such speculation reasonable, maybe even plausible.</p>
        <p>Evidently inspired by occurrences like the Y2K scare and the California power shortage, the play was written last year. But its intentions were reinforced by the Sept. 11 attacks, and they are being given an urgent tingle by the virulent chaos in Israel. It is about Americans, the conspicuously consuming, career-manic sort, whose heedlessness toward graver matters leaves them unprepared when they have to cope with a vague, accumulating threat that begins to look apocalyptic.</p>
        <p>The play has the tinge of a horror story; to be more specific, it combines elements of Stephen King with a dollop of ''Lord of the Flies.'' Shortly after two couples -- one from Manhattan, the other from Los Angeles -- convene for a weeklong vacation together in a luxury cabin in the Adirondacks, the power suddenly and completely shuts down, not just in the cabin but, we discover, in the surrounding two counties.</p>
        <p>From then on, like a computer that eats a crucial file, the cabin becomes almost destructive in its lack of utility, and the rest of the world becomes a foreign country, beyond understanding. The anticipated week of luxury becomes a torment, as inconveniences and discomforts mount up.</p>
        <p>As tiny things begin to go wrong indoors -- tempers flare; during a panic attack, one of the women cuts her hand with a knife -- the situation outdoors becomes more and more ominous. No information seems to be available; the water is shut off; gasoline becomes scarce; the National Guard is called in; the stores run low on supplies; shotgun blasts are heard menacingly in the distance.</p>
        <p>But much of this happens late; Mr. Bogosian handles the encroachment of terror with inordinate patience. The clues that the times are out of joint are so subtle and few that almost until intermission it's impossible to determine the narrative path of the play.</p>
        <p>Instead, the characters exercise their stereotypical traits. The two just up from the city -- Max, a neurotic short-story writer (Bruce Norris), and his editor wife, Nicole (Kathryn Meisle), who has delicate self-esteem and is prone to anxiety -- and the two just in from the coast -- Troy, a brash, bullying movie producer (Patrick Fabian), and his blissed-out girlfriend, Spoon, an actress (Reiko Aylesworth) -- trade banter in the yuppie lexicon of brand names, cellphone-speak and hedonistic relish.</p>
        <p>This isn't wholly unpleasant. Mr. Bogosian has a fine eye for damning detail, and he's particularly good at making fun of the self-absorbed. And under the fluid direction of Jo Bonney (who is married to Mr. Bogosian), five actors provide first-rate ensemble work. (The fifth character is Nat, the local handyman, played by Michael Laurence.) Their handling of Mr. Bogosian's snappy upscale vernacular on a handsomely kitschy two-story set by Robert Brill (featuring perhaps the world's most massive antler chandelier) almost makes you forget that for an hour nothing much happens.</p>
        <p>It's quite a surprise, in fact, that when the curtain rises on Act II, two weeks have gone by, and everyone is still there. Among other things, this means that a great deal of exposition continues to be necessary, and the end of the play is not as cleanly revealing as it might be.</p>
        <p>After intermission the evolution of the crisis is impossible to predict. That is, you'll be surprised at some of the things that happen -- and some that don't. This is a play with a lot of red herrings (that cut hand, for example) and a strange, hiccuping pace that accurately (even if not purposely) reflects how time passes during uncertainty.</p>
        <p>But the characters begin to resemble figures in a fable or, worse, a sermon. Those who have been profligate and do not repent will come to a bad end. Those who struggle with their ill-conceived ways will have a second chance to configure their priorities. Nat, in his Thoreauvian simplicity and easygoing thoughtfulness, looms as large as goodness itself. He's a bore.</p>
        <p>Of course one way a piece of writing seduces you is by addressing your own concerns before you do so yourself, bringing into focus those inchoate thoughts you've only just begun to become aware are percolating in your brain. And in this respect, ''Humpty Dumpty'' will strike a chord with many theatergoers who are experiencing nascent unease. One reason the play is so disappointing in its details is that its grand allegorical conceit holds up.</p>
        <p>How real are the threats we read about every day -- nuclear holocaust, biological warfare, global warming, energy shortage, terrorism, plague -- that always seem to hover but rarely alight? Have we brought these things on ourselves through selfishness and indifference? Is there anything that can be done about them? Or are we as helpless as the king's horses and the king's men?</p>
