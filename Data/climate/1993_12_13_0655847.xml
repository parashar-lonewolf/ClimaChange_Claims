        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Philip M. Boffey correctly notes that hard questions face the Clinton Administration as it continues to search for global warming policies that will deliver real results ("China and Global Warming," Editorial Notebook, Dec. 8). Mr. Boffey raises a very controversial topic: whether American companies should be allowed to meet emissions reduction goals through investments abroad.</p>
        <p>In its recently released Climate Change Action Plan, the Administration stressed that overseas ventures -- also known as "joint implementation" projects -- would be encouraged. However, the missing ingredient is an Administration commitment that reductions achieved as a result of such projects will be counted toward the domestic reduction goal.</p>
        <p>Recently, U.S. electric utility companies have become involved in joint implementation projects that preserve valuable forest areas abroad, deliver ancillary economic benefits to local populations, and offset greenhouse gas emissions considerably. All this is accomplished at low cost, especially when compared with similar projects in the United States.</p>
        <p>If the Clinton Administration continues to pay only lip service to such joint implementation projects without providing a clear signal that reductions achieved abroad will be counted toward the U.S. goal, companies will begin to shy away from such opportunities and costs will be driven up in the process. The only way to put a dent in emissions rates in countries like China is to provide the proper incentives now.  JOHN MEYERS  Bethesda, Md., Dec. 8, 1993 The writer is an energy-environmental policy analyst.</p>
