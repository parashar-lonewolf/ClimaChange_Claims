        <p>LEAD: Alert and recovering from a two-and-a-half-day ordeal in an abandoned well, an 18-month-old girl underwent minor surgery at a hospital in Midland, Tex., yesterday, and doctors said they were optimistic about saving her badly bruised right foot.</p>
        <p>Alert and recovering from a two-and-a-half-day ordeal in an abandoned well, an 18-month-old girl underwent minor surgery at a hospital in Midland, Tex., yesterday, and doctors said they were optimistic about saving her badly bruised right foot.</p>
        <p>The girl, Jessica McClure, who was rescued Friday night at the climax of a life-and-death drama that brought wild cheers, sobs of joy and world attention to a depression-weary city of 90,000 people in West Texas, was tired but in stable condition at Midland Memorial Hospital yesterday.</p>
        <p>Examinations found no broken bones or internal injuries, and doctors said she was recovering from severe bruises of the foot and forehead and from the psychological trauma of being alone in the dark, wedged 22 feet underground, without food or water, for 58 1/2 hours.</p>
        <p>''She's doing fine,'' said Megan Pause, speaking for the hospital. ''They're pleased with her progress,'' she added, referring to a team of medical specialists that included pediatricians and vascular, orthopedic and plastic surgeons. 'I'm Just Glad She's Safe'</p>
        <p>With her parents - Chip McClure, an 18-year-old house painter, and Reba Gayle McClure, 17 - at her bedside in an intensive care unit, Jessica ate an orange Popsicle, cuddled her Winnie-the-Pooh doll, watched television, was given liquids intravenously and took naps between hugs.</p>
        <p>''I'm just glad she's safe and we got her back,'' Mrs. McClure said at a news conference. ''I am so happy we've got her back. The whole world has her back. I want to tell everybody in the world, thank you all for your caring. We love you all.'' Doctors said it might be several days before they knew whether her foot would develop gangrene and have to be amputated. But after surgery to relieve swelling and increase circulation to the injured foot, and after treatment in a hyperbaric chamber that provided healing oxygen to damaged tissues, they said they were hopeful.</p>
        <p>''We are cautiously optimistic about the skin and muscles that are involved,'' said Dr. Sheldon Viney, a vascular surgeon. ''We will still not be able to tell for a number of days, and possibly a week, whether we are going to be able to salvage the foot.'' 'A Beautiful Little Girl'</p>
        <p>A plastic surgeon, Dr. Terry Tubb, said that skin grafts, and their risk of causing scar tissue, might not be necessary to heal a trauma the size of a silver dollar on the child's forehead. ''The muscles look good,'' he said. ''She's a beautiful little girl, or will be, and we're going to minimize the scarring here.''</p>
        <p>Jessica seemed to be responding well psychologically. She said very little, either to her parents or to the medical personnel, but she did not cry and appeared to be alert if somewhat confused by the swirl of activity around her, a respiratory therapist said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Viney described her as lethargic and a little grumpy, having slept little in the well. ''The mother's been up there hugging her and kissing her, you bet,'' he said. ''What this baby needs is for her mother to hold her in her arms and that's what she's getting.''</p>
        <p>A pediatrician, Dr. Debbie Reese, said the child ''was unresponsive'' when the doctors first saw her. The girl had been found with strands of her hair wrapped around her fingers, apparently torn out in fear. ''Since that time, she has begun rapidly to respond to people she knows. She needs affection and love in the next couple of weeks,'' Dr. Reese said. Likely to Forget Ordeal</p>
        <p>Because Jessica is so young, she could forget her ordeal within a year if there are no other lasting medical problems, Dr. Reese said.</p>
        <p>The incident began Wednesday morning when Jessica fell into the well's 8-inch opening while playing with two other children in the back yard of an aunt's house where her mother helped run a small day care center. Children had apparently pushed away a rock or flower pot that covered the opening. The well is 120 feet deep, but she was caught 22 feet down in a small dogleg created when the hole was drilled 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Wedged in a near-fetal position, with her right leg pinned up near her chest, her left leg dangling down and her forehead against the side of the well, Jessica spent most of her time underground crying for her mother, singing, humming and occasionally sleeping.</p>
        <p>Rescue workers lowered a microphone and heat was blown into the hole to keep her warm, but doctors decided not to give her food or water, fearing it might aggravate possible internal injuries. Parallel Shaft Was Dug</p>
        <p>To get her out, workers drilled a shaft parallel to the well and then cut an upward-angling tunnel to her. Progress was slow because of the dense caliche, or hardpan rock, that blunted even diamond-tipped pneumatic drills.</p>
        <p>Ironically, mine experts said, the hardness of the rock that slowed rescuers may have saved her life. When the well was originally sunk, the hard rock made the drill-bit jump around, creating the dogleg in which Jessica became wedged instead of falling deeper into the well.</p>
        <p>Millions of people across the country and around the world watched the drama on television. The three major networks interrupted programs Friday night when Jessica, barefoot, dirty and strapped to a board like a papoose, was raised up from the well to a thundering chorus of hurrahs and horns from crowds that overwhelmed the rescue site.</p>
        <p>At Midland Memorial, where Jessica was rushed to the emergency room, a parade of cars circled late into the night and the switchboard was inundated with well-wishers' calls from around the world. Thousands of teddy bears began pouring in. Weight Loss Put at 3 1/2 Pounds</p>
        <p>Extensive X-rays found no broken bones and hospital officials said the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in Jessica's blood were good. But she was found to be 10 to 15 percent dehydrated and was given liquids intravenously and some solid food. Her weight was down from 21 pounds six weeks ago to 17 1/2 pounds.</p>
        <p>The traumas of inadequate circulation to her foot and forehead were the main problems, doctors said, and she was given treatments in a hyperbaric chamber, in which pure oxygen is forced into the bloodstream, speeding the healing of damaged tissues. Her toes were blue, but had turned red when she was brought out of the chamber. Two or three hyperbaric treatments a day were were planned.</p>
        <p>After a night's rest, Jessica underwent a fasciotomy, in which small incisions were made in the fascia, or protective membranes surrounding the muscle tissue, to relieve the pressure of swelling and to increase circulation in her right foot.</p>
