        <p>The vise tightened sharply early this morning on negotiators seeking a treaty to curb global warming, yet many delegates, even as they headed into the final 24 hours of talks, said they remained far from consensus.</p>
        <p>Disputes festered among blocs of countries large and small, rich and poor, over what rules, tools and penalties should be used to stem the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Scientists say those gases, from smokestacks, tailpipes, and burning forests, are contributing to a potentially calamitous warming trend.</p>
        <p>Some bleary-eyed lobbyists from private environmental groups said they saw progress in the form of a summary of key sticking points distributed late Thursday night. It contained language that they said could protect the atmosphere and satisfy the interests of dozens of countries.</p>
        <p>''It seems to take care of the two worst ends of this environmentally,'' said Kalee Kreider, the director of climate programs for the National Environmental Trust, a private group based in Washington. And some delegates said that the penalties for failing to meet commitments under the treaty appeared to be largely ironed out.</p>
        <p>But some delegates, environmental groups, and lobbyists representing businesses affected by provisions governing fossil-fuel use said the summary still contained land mines that could destroy the effort.</p>
        <p>The proposed treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, was drafted by more than 170 countries in 1997 in Japan, and this session was intended to complete the fine print. If enacted, it would commit three dozen industrialized countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to at least 5 percent below emissions in 1990. So far, no industrialized countries have ratified the pact.</p>
        <p>The European Union and the United States remain far apart on key provisions, including the amount of credit a country could get by investing in climate-protection projects abroad and how much credit toward emissions cuts could be gained by using forests to absorb carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>And developing countries, including giants like China and oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, pressed for large payments from industrial powers to help them adapt to impending changes in climate and sea level.</p>
        <p>''They have caused the problems, they have made the whole world unsafe,'' said Sani Daura, the Nigerian minister of the environment. ''We have the highest stakes, and unfortunately they have not been able to come to terms with our concerns.''</p>
        <p>Many environmental campaigners had complained about parts of the treaty that they said would allow countries to get credit toward emissions goals simply by protecting existing forests, which sop up carbon dioxide, the dominant greenhouse gas.</p>
        <p>They had also denounced treaty language that would allow rich countries to buy emissions credits from Russia, which gained the credits simply because its economy -- and emissions -- had shrunk after the fall of Communism.</p>
        <p>Both options would be constrained under the fresh summary of the text, which was issued late Thursday  night by Jan Pronk, the president of the meeting, called the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, better known here as Cop 6.</p>
        <p>Through the first nine days of the two-week meeting, Mr. Pronk, the gruff, plain-spoken Dutch environment minister, assumed the role of referee, public advocate, and cattle prod, pressing legions of delegates to work late into the night to hash out details.</p>
        <p>After hearing from the main negotiating blocs, he distilled their essential positions into 13 slim pages, prompting hundreds of delegates, lobbyists, and observers to sprawl on the blue carpet, sifting the text for problems or progress.</p>
        <p>The summary infuriated some delegates from wealthier countries, who saw a heavy-handed effort to impede plans for an unfettered trading system that would allow one country to get credit toward emissions goals for investing in cleaner power plants or other new technologies abroad.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pronk, at a news conference Thursday night, said the summary was a pragmatic effort to cut through competing interests.</p>
        <p>One sign that a compromise might be achievable was the observation by many participants that no one seemed particularly satisfied.</p>
        <p>''We need a decision, a decision on all key issues,'' said Mr. Pronk, who turned the screws at a news conference Thursday night by noting that the meeting hall had to be vacated for a convention by Saturday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The environmental and financial stakes are enormous, with the treaty constituting a pioneering effort to create a binding agreement under which industrialized countries would not only cut emissions, but invest billions of dollars in projects in poorer countries to prevent new emissions as their economies grow.</p>
