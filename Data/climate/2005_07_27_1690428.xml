        <p>The United States plans to join China and India in an Asian-Pacific climate agreement intended to replace the Kyoto pact as a method to control greenhouse emissions, an official attending the annual conference of Asian nations in Vientiane, Laos, said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The new five-member pact, described as an initiative of the Bush administration, would group the United States and Australia, developed countries that have not signed the Kyoto accord, with China and India, major producers of greenhouse emissions.</p>
        <p>Even though they are major contributors to air pollution, China and India have not been required to sign the Kyoto protocol because they are considered developing countries.</p>
        <p>The pact, to be called the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate, will join as partners nations that together account for more than 40 percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions, said the official said, who spoke anonymously so as not to pre-empt the formal announcement.</p>
        <p>The agreement will be a major item on the agenda later this week at the summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations now under way in Vientiane, the official said.</p>
        <p>The deputy secretary of state, Robert Zoellick, who is representing the Bush administration at the conference, is scheduled to arrive Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The aim of the pact will be to curb greenhouse emissions without hurting economic growth in the region, the official said. The main objection of the Bush administration to the Kyoto protocol is that the mandatory targets for reducing emissions by 2012 would be too much of a harness on developed industrial economies.</p>
        <p>Instead of mandatory targets, the new pact would aim to use the latest technologies to limit emissions and would try to make sure the technologies were available to countries that need them most, the official said. The members of the new grouping would include some of the world's major coal producers and exporters: China, South Korea and Australia.</p>
