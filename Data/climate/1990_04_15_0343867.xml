        <p>LEAD: THE biggest trees in Canada, some more than 300 feet high, cling to the spongy depths of the forest floor in the Carmanah Valley just north of here. They were ignored for centuries, but now the Sitka spruce in the isolated basin are being treated like the last bison herds of the West.</p>
        <p>THE biggest trees in Canada, some more than 300 feet high, cling to the spongy depths of the forest floor in the Carmanah Valley just north of here. They were ignored for centuries, but now the Sitka spruce in the isolated basin are being treated like the last bison herds of the West.</p>
        <p>As on the United States side of the border, all but a handful of the valleys here in North America's only temperate rain forest have lost their original tree cover to the advance of loggers. Until recently, the fight over the swath of ancient evergreens hugging the Pacific had been fought mainly in Washington and Oregon. But the battle has moved north.</p>
        <p>As massive logging at an ever faster pace has cut up the Canadian domain of thousand-year-old cedars and towering firs, British Columbia has been accused of waste and hypocrisy. Hundreds of thousands of acres of the old-growth forests have never been replanted, which has prompted some forest ecologists to label British Columbia ''the Brazil of the north.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, a Federal panel recommended last week that up to 2.5 million acres of national forest land in Washington, Oregon and California be off limits to logging. Technically, the recommendation was part of an assessment of the effect of logging on the spotted owl, which requires extensive old-growth habitat. But in Canada, the battle is just beginning. ''I tell my guys if they see a spotted owl to shoot it,'' said Jack Munro, Canadian president of the International Woodworkers of America, which represents 50,000 loggers.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, after years of protests by environmentalists and threats by mill owners to shut down plants if tree-cutting is slowed, the British Columbia government of Premier William Vander Zalm decided to allow logging in half the Carmanah Valley, while setting aside the other half as a park.</p>
        <p>The land is publicly owned, but logging rights were sold long ago. In making the decision, government officials lashed out at critics, some from as far away as New Zealand and England, who had urged preservation of what is left of Canada's once-vast rain forest.</p>
        <p>In British Columbia, timber companies cut nearly 600,000 acres last year, more than was logged in all the national forests of the United States. Nowhere have the woods been so depleted as on Vancouver Island, where miles appear barren, a stumpland where 250-foot-high trees used to stand.</p>
        <p>The Carmanah Valley, a relatively small 16,500-acre breach in the west side of Vancouver Island, has become the symbol of resistance to the oldest and most dominant industry in western Canada. Preserving even half the valley, which holds the world's biggest spruce trees, would cost several hundred jobs, industry officials say.</p>
        <p>But even some loggers, alarmed by a loss of both trees and jobs, say they are outraged by the overall pace of tree-cutting in the province.</p>
        <p>''The world is going to need our wood, and we just aren't managing it properly,'' said Mr. Munro of the loggers union. ''Most of the old-growth trees have been cut from the states, so now the pressure is on us.''</p>
        <p>British Columbia's economy is booming, creating nearly half of all the new jobs in Canada last year, and polls show a majority of the province's 3 million people want new restrictions on logging.</p>
        <p>''We're witnessing a very radical change in the way the public views forest management,'' said John Cuthbert, the chief forester for British Columbia.</p>
        <p>''In the good old days, there was lots of room to operate,'' he said. ''The province was still being developed. Now the timber supply has shrunk.''</p>
        <p>What has changed, he said, is that the coastal evergreens are now considered to be part of a forest of global significance.</p>
        <p>As North American political leaders have criticized tropical deforestation, the shearing of this continent's temperate rain forest has provoked cries of hypocrisy and shortsightedness. No matter how many trees are planted to replace them, foresters say it will be impossible to duplicate the network of redwoods, cedars, and sitka spruce that support one of the richest ecosystems on earth.</p>
        <p>''They are cutting these coastal old-growth trees at a rate that simply cannot be sustained,'' said Dr. Peter Pearse, a forestry professor at the University of British Columbia who headed a royal commission on logging. ''This forest is unique in all the world, and it is diminishing in the same sense that tropical forests are disappearing.''</p>
        <p>While the amount of trees cut here is a long way from the 25 million acres of tropical rain forest removed every year, environmentalists say that at that rate most of the remaining forest will be gone within a generation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuthbert said that logging was excessive and careless up until the mid-1980's, but that reforms are under way. A new law has gone into effect requiring companies to reforest.</p>
        <p>Recent debate has centered on the environmental value of the ancient forests. The trees wring moisture from the clouds and help keep the coastal climate cool.</p>
        <p>When large sections are leveled and the debris is burned - a practice known as clear-cutting and slash-burning - it can cause flooding in the winter, air pollution in the summer, and may contribute to global warming, according to forestry experts.</p>
        <p>Canadian logging practices are wide open. In the United States, for example, clear-cuts in the national forests are limited to 40 acres, but in Canada there is no such limit. Throughout this province, hundreds of square miles have been completely denuded, and are littered with rotting debris.</p>
        <p>Peter McAllister, president of the Sierra Club of Western Canada, said Canadian timber companies are ''plundering the province'' in a race to cut wood while prices remain at an all-time high.</p>
        <p>As in Washington and Oregon, much of these public lands are being leveled to feed a growing appetite for lumber in Japan. Environmental groups here, as well as in Washington and Oregon, say much of the ancient forest could be saved if overseas buyers were forced to get wood from second-growth tree farms rather than the centuries-old forest. But timber industry officials say that would require costly overhauling of mills and years of commitment to reforestation. As long as there are still several million acres of virgin forest in this province, there is little economic incentive to raise trees here as they do in eastern Canada, industry leaders say.</p>
        <p>Critics say the provincial government's stand on the forest is contradictory. British Columbia has stepped up promotion for a booming tourist trade built on the natural wonders of the province, but at the same time it has allowed its forests to be cut as never before.</p>
        <p>''I used to hear people in the states say that when their forests are cut, there will always be Canada,'' said Joe Foy, a leader of the conservation movement in British Columbia. ''But that isn't true. We aren't taking very good care of our piece of the globe. We have a small population, but the whole world grazes here. So it's important for us to preserve the blueprint and spare parts of the forests of the future.''  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
