        <p>Grizzly bears are listed as threatened under Endangered Species Act and only three small populations are left in US, outside of Alaska, Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park; Louisa Willcox, Wild Bears Project for Natural Resources Defense Council director, claims that government is quietly jeopardizing bear's survival through several actions including permit to mine Cabinet Mountain area (Montana); others, such as Dr David Mattson, United States Geological Survey wildlife biologist, contend increase in human population has been most detrimental to bear's existence along with climate changes, which have reduced available food; migration between Canadian populations and US does not seem to be occurring and, along with reducing needless bear deaths, could be instrumental in increasing Grizzy population; map; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Before the Europeans came to North America, the grizzly bear reigned, hunting the plains as far east as Minnesota, south to the deserts of Mexico and along the salmon-choked rivers of the Pacific Coast.</p>
        <p>Two centuries of settlement beat them back, and now just two main populations remain outside of Alaska -- one with 400 to 600 bears in and around Glacier National Park, the other in Yellowstone, with 500 to 600 bears. They are designated as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, but many biologists consider their population levels healthy.</p>
        <p>Three tiny populations, however, were stranded in the retreat and cut off almost entirely by roads, reservoirs and other development.</p>
        <p>Some experts say recent decisions and inaction by federal agencies may doom the most precarious of those, the 15 or so bears of the Cabinet Mountain group north of this small mountain town on the border with northern Idaho.</p>
        <p>A major potential threat, they say, is a copper and silver mine that is planned in the bears' remaining habitat. Nine environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court in July to overturn approval for the mine given by the Kootenai National Forest. The federal Fish and Wildlife Service signed off on the mine, saying it would not harm the bears.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say the mine is only the latest action by federal agencies in recent years to jeopardize the bears' survival, prompting speculation that the federal government may be writing off the marooned population.</p>
        <p>''It's the dirty little secret of grizzly bear recovery,'' said Louisa Willcox, director of the Wild Bears Project for the Natural Resources Defense Council, in Livingston, Mont. ''They are letting them quietly go extinct.''</p>
        <p>Fish and Wildlife Service officials dispute that notion, arguing that they have programs to put in place to protect the bears as long as certain budget items are approved.</p>
        <p>Some officials claim that the mine, with an estimated cost of $200 million, may not be built for economic reasons, but mining officials say their plans will move forward.</p>
        <p>Even if the mine is never built, there are so few bears here that their survival is uncertain, experts say.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Mattson, a wildlife biologist with the United States Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz., and a colleague modeled the population trends of the Cabinet Mountain bears and the adjacent but distinct Yaak Mountain population to the north with some 15 to 20 bears.</p>
        <p>The bears' decline is caused by an increase in human population in the region, he said, which has two main effects. If the human population continues to grow at the rate it has, the number of bear deaths is expected to increase as a result, Dr. Mattson said. ''That means they won't be reproducing faster than they are dying, and they will disappear within 20 years,'' he added.</p>
        <p>These isolated bears are especially vulnerable for other reasons, Dr. Mattson said. Climate change may contribute to the decline of the white bark pine nut, a critical source of food, as it has for the Yellowstone grizzlies. If something similar happens in the Cabinet Mountains, the bears may need to move to find food. ''If there is an isolated population with a human fence around them and they can't move, they can't survive,'' Dr. Mattson said.</p>
        <p>Mortality among the Cabinet- Yaak bears has been unusually high in the past four years. Of 30 adult bears, 14 have died, 9 from natural causes, mostly in the Yaak. The other five were killed by humans under different circumstances.</p>
        <p>Although the Yaak bears may benefit from their connection to Canadian populations, Cabinet bears probably will not. The ranges are adjacent, but there has been no known movement between the groups, largely because of a highway, railroad and river separating them.</p>
        <p>Michael Proctor, a Canadian biologist, recently studied the DNA of bears in Canada and in the isolated populations in the United States and found little movement across Highway 3 and into the United States. A few do make the journey, however, and experts are working on ways to encourage more to do so.</p>
        <p>The other isolated populations are in the North Cascades in Washington with as few as half a dozen bears and in the Selkirk Mountains in the panhandle of Idaho. The two groups straddle the United States-Canadian border. The American side of the Selkirks has 15 to 30 bears, but the population is roughly doubled when Canada is included.</p>
        <p>While those numbers are still precarious, Wayne Wakkinen, senior wildlife research biologist for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, said the Selkirk population seemed to be expanding. ''They have been isolated for the short term,'' he said, ''but as we see an increase in population we might get over that'' as they seek new habitat and encounter bears from other ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say that prospect is excessively rosy. They point to the refusal of the Fish and Wildlife Service to elevate the bears from threatened to endangered, for example. While federal officials acknowledge the numbers warrant such a listing, they cite a limited budget and contend that endangered status will still not offer greater protection.</p>
        <p>The Fish and Wildlife Service also ended a long-term program begun in 1994 to bring in more female bears to supplement the population because of opposition from local residents.</p>
        <p>Reducing bear deaths caused by humans has not been a priority in the Cabinets, Ms. Willcox of the Wild Bears Project said. ''We know how to do this,'' she said. ''This is basic simple stuff that was done in Yellowstone.'' Using bear-proof garbage containers, ending black bear hunting and increasing law enforcement will reduce their death rate, she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chris Servheen, the grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Missoula, agrees that more protective measures should be taken. ''We're very concerned about the Cabinet bears and always have been,'' he said. Claims that they are being ignored are nonsense, he added.</p>
        <p>This fall, if the budget permits, the agency plans to improve protection, adding bear-proof garbage cans and offering education for hunters, among other projects. Eventually more bears are to be brought in. ''The tools are in the toolbox,'' Dr. Servheen said.</p>
        <p>He also noted that the Forest Service would require Sterling Resources of Spokane, Wash., the mine's owners, to provide long-term protection of 2,000 other acres for the bear, and to shut down some roads in the area. The company is also to pay for a full-time officer and a bear management specialist to decrease deaths.</p>
        <p>If they do all that, Dr. Servheen said, the mine will have a limited effect on the bear.</p>
        <p>The mine is to be built on 1,560 acres of publicly owned forest on the western edge of the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness. Some 700 workers will be brought in to extract 10,000 tons of ore per day. It is expected to affect nearly 500 acres, with waste disposal and a mill site to process the ore, and will require nine miles of new roads and road reconstruction.</p>
        <p>Officials say they have no choice but to allow the mine, under the General Mining Law of 1872, long a bane of environmentalists. Passed to help settle the West, the law gives private companies publicly owned minerals at no charge. The government receives no royalties.</p>
        <p>Dr. Servheen and others say there are doubts that the mine will go forward because of costs. Noranda Inc., which had planned to open a similar mine nearby, recently abandoned its proposal.</p>
        <p>But Frank Duvall, the chief executive of the Sterling Mining Company of Montana, the owner of the mine known as Rock Creek, said it ''could be economic at today's prices.''</p>
        <p>The larger battle in protecting the grizzly is how to keep the separate populations viable. Rather than trying to protect bears in ''postage stamp'' ecosystems, many experts say the remaining habitats, including those in Canada, should be linked so that bears can move freely, providing additional protections.</p>
        <p>If the Cabinet Mountain bears decline or disappear, for example, bears from other ecosystems are able to move in. ''They're better equipped to ride out the local disturbances,'' he said.</p>
