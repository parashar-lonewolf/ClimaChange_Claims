        <p>THE name Institute of Ecosystem Studies conjures images of white lab coats and closed doors. But take a path under a large oak tree on the institute's grounds, and you'll be in the midst of beautiful, pink-hued Japanese anemones, rose-colored sedums, black-eyed Susans, multicolored cone flowers and pink and blue fall asters. Walk in another direction, and you'll enter a lush, undulating 200-acre preserve of Hudson Valley forest and meadows cut with walking trails.</p>
        <p>The institute, in Millbrook, N.Y., lives up to the seriousness of its name. Founded in 1983 under the leadership of Gene E. Likens, a Cornell University ecologist whose work is credited with leading to the discovery of acid rain in North America, employs over two dozen scientists in what has become one of the largest ecological research and education centers in the world.</p>

        <p>THE name Institute of Ecosystem Studies conjures images of white lab coats and closed doors. But take a path under a large oak tree on the institute's grounds, and you'll be in the midst of beautiful, pink-hued Japanese anemones, rose-colored sedums, black-eyed Susans, multicolored cone flowers and pink and blue fall asters. Walk in another direction, and you'll enter a lush, undulating 200-acre preserve of Hudson Valley forest and meadows cut with walking trails.</p>
        <p>The institute, in Millbrook, N.Y., lives up to the seriousness of its name. Founded in 1983 under the leadership of Gene E. Likens, a Cornell University ecologist whose work is credited with leading to the discovery of acid rain in North America, employs over two dozen scientists in what has become one of the largest ecological research and education centers in the world.</p>
        <p>But its story and its work are also bound up with the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum and the Gifford Garden, both formerly the property of well-to-do people who valued the plant world for its beauty and grace.</p>
        <p>The arboretum and garden remain scenic, but they have also become experimental areas and collections, with more than 1,000 perennials and woody plants, a third of them native to eastern North America and most of the rest well adapted to thriving there with little maintenance. Public education is part of the mission: the institute uses its garden and woods to illustrate the interdependence of plants and animals, and on a practical level, to demonstrate environmentally friendly gardening.</p>
        <p>''The garden and trails are ways we reach out to help the public understand what is important and vital about the way ecosystems function,'' Dr. Likens said.</p>
        <p>This harmonious coexistence of science and aesthetics comes naturally: before it became independent in 1993, the Institute of Ecosystem Studies was a division of the New York Botanical Garden.</p>
        <p>On a bright Sunday morning in late May, a white-haired couple sat in companionable silence in the Gifford Garden, holding hands and gazing at flowering red buckeye. An early tree peony was bursting with yellow blooms, a prelude to the displays of lilacs and peonies that would tempt June guests to linger in a pair of Adirondack chairs or under the gazebo. Now, at the end of summer, the garden explodes in color: red bee balm, pale blue veronica and seven-foot-tall inula magnifica, a Russian kissing cousin to the sunflower.</p>
        <p>The garden's plant collection is grouped thematically, in categories like shade-hardy, sun-loving, deer-resistant or pollinator-friendly. A rock-strewn xeriscape (meaning ''dry landscape'') bed contains 75 to 100 perennials that require minimal water, including hens-and-chicks, prickly pear cactus and the spiny Siberian pea tree. In the Shankman Rose Garden, 10 years of research directed by Brad Roeller, a Millbrook native who is the manager of Gifford Garden, bear fruit in a 16-by-24-foot plot of hardy, low-maintenance roses suited to the climate and organically grown.</p>
        <p>''The display beds here offer inspiration for every shape and size garden imaginable -- patio, formal, informal, large landscape, even a postage-sized patch,'' Mr. Roeller said.</p>
        <p>He is a proponent of site-driven design, letting environmental characteristics of a place, like the location of frost pockets, seasonal sun angles and soil composition, determine what to plant there.</p>
        <p>''I prefer working with nature, so that I can enjoy my garden, rather than manipulating a site to create a garden or landscape that has to be constantly tended,'' he said. ''Let the site tell you what will naturally flourish.''</p>
        <p>The institute's history begins with Mary Flagler Cary, the granddaughter of Henry Morrison Flagler and an heir to the Standard Oil fortune, who spent summers in the area as a child. In 1923, she and her husband, Melbert Cary, decided to purchase a retreat nearby. In 14 separate purchases, they acquired 1,924 acres.</p>
        <p>They called the property Cannoo Hills and built a woodland cottage, called Tea House, to stay in while they decided where to put a main house. Melbert Carey died in 1941, however, before they had chosen a site.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cary lost interest in building a country house. She rented a suite of rooms at the Cottonwood Motel in Millbrook and she channeled her energies into trees, carefully choosing which species would grow on her land and maintaining the trees she favored. She had a penchant for trees representing specific species, especially maples.</p>
        <p>In the institute's archives, interviews with Millbrook old-timers about Mrs. Cary revealed the intensity of her fixation. If she fancied a tree that belonged to someone else, she made a generous offer to buy it. If her offer was accepted, she had the tree transplanted to her property.</p>
        <p>She died childless in 1967 and left the property in trust, having instructed that it be preserved and used in a manner benefiting the public. In 1971, the trust's administrators and the New York Botanical Garden agreed to develop an arboretum.</p>
        <p>In 1975, Sally Gifford, owner of the adjacent property, sold the New York Botanical Garden 200 bordering acres, including a sunken octagonal display garden and a handsome Federal-style brick house. The New York Botanical Garden decided to establish an ecological science center at the arboretum, and in 1983 it hired Dr. Likens to establish it and direct its work.</p>
        <p>After the colorful, compressed views of Gifford Garden, the trails of Mrs. Cary's old arboretum make a great leg-stretching counterpoint.</p>
        <p>The Wappinger Creek Trail starts from the parking lot of the Gifford House, which now serves as the institute's visitor and education center, and extends a mile and a quarter, following the east branch of the creek and wending through hardwood forests, marshes and a sea of tall, wheat-colored grass. On the Sedge Meadow Trail, a boardwalk intrudes on a wetland.</p>
        <p>The soft dirt paths of the 1.3-mile Cary Pines Trail lead through white pines, luminous in their silver-needled splendor, and cascading hemlocks. Eventually, it breaks into bluestem grass meadows that are interspersed with small groups of trees and ideal for bird-watching.</p>
        <p>A fork off this trail leads to Fern Glen, which Judy Sullivan, the institute's native plant gardener, called ''the antithesis of a garden'' -- two acres populated by plants indigenous within a 50-mile radius of Millbrook.</p>
        <p>At the entrance, a bench encourages a stop at a small pond to watch the painted turtles, spotted frogs and thrashing water snakes that thrive in its murky waters. From there, boardwalks zigzag through diverse micro-habitats, from a shrub swamp, dense with green shoots of skunk cabbage and duckweed, to a comfortable perch on a handsome deck, overlooking the babbling Wappinger Creek.</p>
        <p>''It's meant to make people notice what is ordinary and commonplace, like sweet flag, buttercups, ferns and sedge, in a different context,'' Ms. Sullivan said, ''which makes it extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>IF YOU GO</p>
        <p>An Eden in Pursuit of Knowledge</p>
        <p>THE Institute of Ecosystem Studies (845-677-7600; www.ecostudies.org) is at 181 Sharon Turnpike (Route 44A), Millbrook, N.Y., about 75 miles north of New York City in Dutchess County. From the Taconic State Parkway, take the exit marked for Poughkeepsie, Millbrook and Route 44. Follow Route 44 east for two miles, turn left onto Route 44A, and drive about a mile to the Gifford House.</p>
        <p>The garden, trails, Fern Glen and 2.5 miles of scenic internal roadways (accessible by car, bicycle or foot) are open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday from mid-April through the end of October. Picnicking is permitted on the garden grounds. The deer ticks that cause Lyme disease are abundant in Dutchess County, where Millbrook is located, and visitors are cautioned to wear clothing that covers the skin.</p>
        <p>No reservations or fees are required for Gifford Garden or the arboretum. The staff is limited, but to inquire about a guided Gifford Garden tour, call 845-677-7600.</p>
        <p>Café Les Baux (152 Church Street, Millbrook, 845-677-8166), a charming bistro open for lunch and dinner, serves French-inspired casual food including croque-monsieur and lamb burgers. Sandwiches and salads go for $8.50 to $14; dinner entrees from $12 to $29.</p>
