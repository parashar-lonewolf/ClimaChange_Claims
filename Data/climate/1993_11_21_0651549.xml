        <p>THE installation that is the focal point of the current show at the Hammond Museum and Japanese Stroll Garden in North Salem is called "Travels in Space, Movements Through Time," and it is the result of a project that grew and grew until, the artist Sonia Sacoder Astor said, her husband gave her a deadline to finish the work.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, said Ms. Astor, a painter known for her Bosch-like triptychs and intricate collages, she might still be in her studio here, cutting out images from magazines and adding them to the teeming cosmos she has painted on seven-and-a-half-foot panels of foam core. Some of the imagery, which ranges from the earth's ozone layer to the depths of the sea and encompasses at least five centuries, was contributed by Ms. Astor's son, Ted, a photographer and piano teacher.

        <p>THE installation that is the focal point of the current show at the Hammond Museum and Japanese Stroll Garden in North Salem is called "Travels in Space, Movements Through Time," and it is the result of a project that grew and grew until, the artist Sonia Sacoder Astor said, her husband gave her a deadline to finish the work.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, said Ms. Astor, a painter known for her Bosch-like triptychs and intricate collages, she might still be in her studio here, cutting out images from magazines and adding them to the teeming cosmos she has painted on seven-and-a-half-foot panels of foam core. Some of the imagery, which ranges from the earth's ozone layer to the depths of the sea and encompasses at least five centuries, was contributed by Ms. Astor's son, Ted, a photographer and piano teacher. Her husband of 40 years, Gerald Astor, a writer, said he also took part by discussing art history and esthetics with his wife.</p>
        <p>Images of the Sistine Chapel and other historical references figure prominently in the work, which Gerald said had served as a jumping-off point for an as-yet-unpublished book he and his wife had written. That work, too, is called "Travels in Space, Movements Through Time," Mr. Astor's title for his wife's project. A House Filled With Art</p>
        <p>Ms. Astor is 5 foot 1, but her works are big, and it took her and five other people most of two days to remove the nearly room-size installation from her home studio here and mount it at the museum. The day before "Travels in Space" was disassembled for its own journey to North Salem, Ms. Astor, who has taught and exhibited widely in the county and in Manhattan, spoke about the "unconscious choosing" that guides her work and makes explorers out of viewers.</p>
        <p>With her that day in the art-filled house in which she and her husband have lived for 38 years was her son, who now lives in Ardsley but has a darkroom in the house, and her husband, who also works at home. In this atelier-like setting each has flourished, the three said. No one interferes with the other, but there is ample opportunity for sharing ideas.</p>
        <p>Ms. Astor said she could not explain much of her imagery: why angels and astronauts are so prominent, for example, appearing at intervals like themes in a symphony. Easier to discuss were the painterly qualities: the merging of landscape, moonscape and cityscape, the juxtaposition of large figures with miniatures and the addition to flat surfaces of cutouts she calls "liftoffs."</p>
        <p>The artist said her desire was to suggest nothing less than the past, present and future of the universe in the installation, which consists of a ceiling, a floor and three walls. Hers is a "maximal" art, she said, a term she said she coined to distinguish herself from the Minimalists. Her influences were Cubism and the painter Will Barnet, one of her teachers, who she said stressed the challenge of interpreting the three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional surface. Stirring the Viewer's Imagination</p>
        <p>Ms. Astor said she was also influenced by her son, whose photographic montages are included in the Hammond Museum show along with paintings by Alexandra Lord, Martin Silverman and Judith Surowiec and ceramics by Barbara Krohn. Her photographer son, she said, taught her about camera lenses, and while she has no desire to take photographs herself -- she said she would leave that medium to her son -- she used the perspectives offered by zoom, wide-angle and fish-eye lenses to draw viewers into the work and move their eyes around all of it.</p>
        <p>Ms. Astor said she hoped people would add to "Travels in Space, Movements Through Time" from their own imaginations. "This is an expanded vision," she said. "It allows for me not to put in everything but for the viewer to be the co-creator."</p>
        <p>Kneeling on the floor for a final time before dismantling the piece, Ms. Astor inspected the cutout figures made from such images as her son's photographs of Ms. Astor's mother and granddaughter, magazine pictures of President and Mrs. Clinton and Vice President and Mrs. Gore on the campaign trail, and a photograph of Rodin's sculpture "The Thinker."</p>
        <p>She wants visitors to come away sensing their own interdependence, she said, adding that she wants them to experience as well the exhilaration of seeing beyond the ordinary, whichart can make possible.</p>
        <p>"Travels in Space, Movements Through Time" will be at the Hammond Museum through next Sunday. For further information, the number to call is 669-5033.</p>
