        <p>NOW that spring has come and summer beckons, light, thirst-slaking vinho verde -- green wine -- can't be far behind for the Portuguese communities in Mineola, L.I., and Newark's Ironbound section. It also holds appeal for other, economy-minded consumers and for Pasquale (Pat) Iocca.</p>
        <p>Many in the wine world call Mr. Iocca the nation's No. 1 authority on Portuguese wines. Last week, guests at the International Wine Center, a Manhattan wine school, quickly saw why when he pronounced the name VEEN-you VEHRD; even buffs call this white wine VAIR-dee.</p>
        <p>The occasion, Mr. Iocca said, was "the single largest tasting of vinho verde ever held in the United States." Tapping his resources as wine product manager at the Portuguese Trade Commission, he easily rounded up 19 bottles -- 12 costing under $6.</p>
        <p>Some say the word "green" (the wine is actually pale yellow) alludes to the bracing acidity, the fizz (injected carbon dioxide) and the fresh, youthful personality. Others point to Portugal's verdant northwest corner, just south of the Spanish border, which exported 126,100 cases to the United States in 1991, up from 28,416 cases in 1980.</p>
        <p>Mary Ewing Mulligan, director of the center, laid the groundwork for Mr. Iocca's lecture. "Vinho verde is not a single type of wine but a whole region, with three distinct microclimates and four different grape varieties used singly or in combination," she said.</p>
        <p>Their varied styles shattered the conventional notion that vinho verde has only one aroma and one flavor.</p>
        <p>Vinho verde's astringency, sometimes unrelieved by barely detectable sweetness, needs toning down by food. The wine, an acquired taste, is understandable to fans of lean, appetite-whetting versions of muscadet, Chablis, Sancerre, Vouvray, dry and half-dry German rieslings, pinot grigio from Italy's Alto Adige region, New York seyval blanc and Washington semillon.</p>
        <p>To preserve the fruitiness, large and most small-estate producers make vinho verde in steel and glass-lined cement vats, rather than in wooden barrels. The wine is about 9 percent alcohol, as against the 12 to 13 percent in most wines, and is made to be drunk young, ideally within a year of the vintage, two at most.</p>
        <p>"You will find four or five but more commonly one or two big brands in stores outside America's Portuguese communities," Mr. Iocca said in an interview. He recommended Casal Garcia (about $5), Aveleda ($4.50), Casal Mendes ($4) and Gazela ($4.50). "These typical vinhos verdes are extremely skillfully made," he said.</p>
        <p>They are not vintage-dated because the high-volume producers of the wine are used to quick sales and consumption. "I would prefer," he added, "that all, at least those for export, be vintage-dated."</p>
        <p>The top grade, usually made only from the alvarinho grape, can be costly. Mr. Iocca called the estate-bottled, vintage-dated Palacio da Brejoeira (about $20) "the Lafite-Rothschild of vinhos verdes." He also recommended these estate-bottled brands: Quinta da Pedra ($16), Casa de Sezim ($9), Solar das Boucas ($9), Quinta de Sao Claudio ($8), Quinta do Outeiro do Baixo ($7.50) and Quinta d'Alem ($7).</p>
        <p>Jose Meirelles, the Portuguese-born co-owner and chef of Les Halles, a Manhattan bistro, pours Grinalda, a famous brand, as his house wine and suggests it with oysters on the half shell. He likes it with a salad nicoise with a vinaigrette that has more extra-virgin olive oil than vinegar.</p>
        <p>Jean Anderson, author of "The Food of Portugal" (William Morrow, 1986), said: "Vinho verde is sprightly and sturdy enough to stand up to spicy seasonings. I always use it for picnics."</p>
        <p>She pours it with gazpacho; cold shrimp; deviled crab; vitello tonatto; a salad of cold roast squab, green beans and radicchio, with warm gravy from pan drippings; cold poached salmon with cilantro green sauce; broiled red snapper stuffed with fresh fennel; cold pork slathered with garlic and marinated in the wine before roasting, and pasta mixed with cooked broccoli florets and slivers of pimento and roasted red pepper and pine nuts.</p>
        <p>The New York area's major suppliers include Lisbon Wines, 140-A Jericho Turnpike, Mineola (15 varieties), and Lisbon Liquors, 114 Ferry Street, Newark (10). In Manhattan, Garnet Liquors, 929 Lexington Avenue (68th Street), has three; Astor Wines and Liquors, 12 Astor Place, has four. Vinhos verdes are often discounted.</p>
        <p>Lareira, a restaurant at 64-66 East Jericho Turnpike in Mineola, offers 10 different vinhos verdes.</p>
        <p>The Portuguese also make red vinho verde. When asked to explain the contradiction, they shrug.</p>
