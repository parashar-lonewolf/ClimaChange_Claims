        <p>A glittering pedigree guarantees nothing, as the sponsors of the Senate's energy bill discovered. The bill came to the floor with the imprimatur of President Bush and many powerful Democrats. It failed to survive a procedural vote. The country has reason to be grateful. It was a bad bill.</p>
        <p>The main reason for the defeat was a provision opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. As some senators noted, there are other places to find oil at far less risk to the environment. Furthermore, the provision symbolized the bill's mindless bias toward energy production as opposed to conservation.</p>
        <p>A sound energy strategy would consist of a few simple components.</p>
        <p>Energy taxes -- stiff gasoline taxes, for example -- that reflect energy's social costs and that encourage efficiency and conservation.</p>
        <p>A larger Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to cushion temporary disruptions.</p>
        <p>Serious research into clean and competitive alternatives to fossil fuels. That doesn't mean repeating the costly synfuels boondoggle. It does mean searching for renewable energy sources like solar power and controlled nuclear fusion -- a field in which Europeans, operating with larger research budgets, have made breakthroughs.</p>
        <p>The bill contained a handful of useful ideas. But mostly it offered a vision for the next year, not the next century. And by taking tax hikes off the table, the Senate forced itself into second-best strategies that are complicated and contradictory. The bill's preamble, for example, grandly pronounced the need to reduce greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. But the bill itself provided generous incentives to the very fuels, including coal, that produce these gases.</p>
        <p>With one big exception -- a provision asking states to let utilities make money by promoting conservation rather than consumption -- strategies for encouraging efficiency got short shrift. Why? Many people, including Mr. Bush's top advisers, seem convinced that efficiency is the sworn enemy of economic growth.</p>
        <p>Conservation does exact a cost. But the cost is affordable, and it doesn't stop growth. Between 1973 and 1986, total U.S. energy consumption remained level, and carbon dioxide emissions actually dropped, even as the economy expanded by 40 percent. And the benefits of, say, cleaner air are not measured in conventional gross national product figures.</p>
        <p>The House has broken the Bush proposal into bits and pieces and may have several different bills ready before adjournment. But there will be no energy legislation this year unless the Senate redraws its bill, which seems unlikely. Still, the Senate's failure has produced useful lessons to guide the next attempt at a national energy strategy. Keep it simple. And make it balanced.</p>
