        <p>Once envisioned as a pioneering project to test how humans could live in space, Biosphere 2 is being taken over for a new purpose: to study global warming and other environmental changes on earth.</p>
        <p>Columbia University is expected to announce today that it will manage the 3.15-acre, $150-million terrarium in the Arizona desert and will turn it into a  laboratory and educational center for the earth sciences.  The university is not planning more missions like the unsuccessful attempt by eight men and women  to live there two years by recycling air and water, though such experiments have not been entirely ruled out.</p>
        <p>Instead, the huge greenhouse is being recast as the ultimate environmental test tube. George Rupp, Columbia's president, said yesterday, "This Biosphere 2  apparatus will give us a tool for conducting research that is unparalleled anywhere in the world and unlikely to be constructed anywhere again."</p>
        <p>For instance, the site can be used to study the effects of exposing a variety of plants and corals to differing levels of carbon dioxide, several scientists said yesterday. The rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is believed to be a major component of global warming.</p>
        <p>Deciding to give Columbia a five-year management contract is a troubled venture's latest step to regain credibility. Edward P. Bass, a Texas billionaire, began Biosphere 2 in 1984 with the goal of learning how colonies in space could be self-sufficient. (Biosphere 1, the founders said, is earth itself.)</p>
        <p>When construction was completed in 1991, the airtight structure 25 miles northeast of Tucson had a small tropical rain forest, a desert and a million-gallon ocean with a living coral reef. It enclosed 3,800 species of plants and animals.</p>
        <p>But by the early 1990's, most of the respected scientists who at first endorsed the project had withdrawn their support. They criticized the quality of the research and noted that the eight people in the dome had pumped in additional oxygen and tried to conceal it.</p>
        <p>In 1994, a concerned Mr. Bass, the country's largest patron of environmental  research, set out to save the project, forming a partnership with experts from Columbia and other institutions to plan its future.</p>
        <p>Michael B. McElroy, the chairman of Harvard's earth sciences department and chairman of a Biosphere 2 advisory board, said that Mr. Bass "saw that Biosphere had to have an association with a first-rate scientific organization." The arrangement with Columbia also helps Mr. Bass, who retains ownership of Biosphere 2, by enhancing its chances of receiving Federal research money.</p>
        <p>Under the new agreement, Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will manage scientific operations at Biosphere 2 starting Jan. 1. It will also expand a visitors' center, which attracts thousands of tourists, into an earth sciences museum; the hotel and conference rooms will house an educational program for undergraduates from Columbia and other colleges.</p>
        <p>Still, it was clear that the main attraction for Columbia was Biosphere 2 itself -- a relatively large and diverse enclosed environment that scientists can control and monitor. Its temperature and humidity can be set. Its 2,500 sensors record data every 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>As a result, for the first time researchers will be able to test sweeping theories about environmental changes, said Michael M. Crow, the university's vice provost. While acknowledging that the terrarium was a "crude" instrument, Dr. Crow said, "This allows for large-scale experiments in a manipulated environment, to see how it works in an artificial rain forest, an artificial desert, an artificial ocean."</p>
