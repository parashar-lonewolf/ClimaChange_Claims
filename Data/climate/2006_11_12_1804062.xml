        <p>9 P.M. (13, 49) PRIME SUSPECT: THE FINAL ACT -- She's lonely. She drinks too much. And a life of fighting crime has left her at the end of her rope. Still, Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison, played for the last time by Helen Mirren (left), isn't about to give in to retirement until she solves one final case: the murder of a 14-year-old girl, whose troubled best friend is a mirror image of Tennison at the same age.</p>
        <p>7 P.M. (ABC) AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS -- Six contestants compete for the first $100,000 prize of the season.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) THE SIMPSONS -- Atten-hut! After Bart squirms out of his commitment to the Army, Homer lands in basic training, where he infuriates his hard-nosed colonel, played by Kiefer Sutherland. Look who's in charge of war games now.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (ABC) EXTREME MAKEOVER: HOME EDITION -- Shawn Farina grew up watching her mother battle breast cancer. Now, at 26, Ms. Farina has the illness too, but has still found time to raise more than $449,000 for the American Cancer Society. Tonight, the team makes over the 135-year-old Indiana farmhouse of Ms. Farina, her husband and their three children so that Ms. Farina can pay her medical bills.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (13, 49) PENGUINS OF THE ANTARCTIC -- ''Nature'' ventures atop icebergs and beneath the water to track some of the continent's penguins (including these emperor penguins, above, the world's largest diving birds) as they deal with life changes caused by global warming.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Animal Planet) PREHISTORIC PARK -- More than 90 percent of the animals ever to roam the Earth are now extinct. But that hasn't stopped the zoologist Nigel Marven from imagining a wildlife park where a Tyrannosaurus rex, a saber-toothed tiger and a woolly mammoth could survive alongside their modern-day relatives. Tonight, the team visits prehistoric Scotland in search of giant insects and, at 9, heads to Texas to rescue a Deinosuchus, the largest crocodile ever.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Food Network) EMERIL LIVE -- Turkey? Not tonight, honey. In this episode, Emeril Lagasse revives some historic Thanksgiving recipes that would have made the Pilgrims proud.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (ABC) DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES -- Gabrielle decides to head back down the catwalk and Lynette has questions about her new neighbor. And guess who's coming to dinner? It's Bree's prickly mother-in-law.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (HBO) THE WIRE -- Poot returns to the corner after time in prison, and Herc and Dozerman are there to greet him. Bubbles fingers a witness for Herc, and Randy puts his math skills to work on the street. Meanwhile, Old Face Andre turns to Proposition Joe for protection against Marlin.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) BROTHERS &amp; SISTERS -- A disturbing letter, which could alter his future, weakens the resolve of Justin (Dave Annable, left) to stay clean.</p>
