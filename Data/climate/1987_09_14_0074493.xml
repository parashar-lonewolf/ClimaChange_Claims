        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You raise provocative questions about Reagan Administration energy policy and the escort of tankers in the Persian Gulf in ''The Real Cost of Gas: $5 a Gallon'' (editorial, Aug. 13). But you miss the mark. Throughout the tenure of the Reagan Administration, the United States has had no energy policy. Foreign policy has substituted for energy policy in the international arena (as in the reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers to reassure Middle East allies of continued support in the wake of revelations of the Iran-contra hearings). And domestically, ''free market'' policies have been a blanket solution to problems with energy resources, technologies and prices.</p>
        <p>Last November, John Layton, Department of Energy Inspector General, issued a report criticizing his agency for its lack of a long-term energy plan and of goals for short-term programs. The resulting disaster is much larger than the one looming in the Persian Gulf. The lack of energy policy has permitted the Administration to:</p>
        <p>* Roll back established fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>* Roll back programs aimed at increasing efficient heating and cooling of old and new buildings.</p>
        <p>* Abolish incentives for renewable energy development.</p>
        <p>* Gut the most successful conservation and weatherizing programs.</p>
        <p>This has effectively assured increasing dependence on oil imports from the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Energy needs should not be an Administration smokescreen for carrying out questionable foreign policy. Using our warships in the Persian Gulf to escort tankers loaded with fuel for other countries does not assist United States energy needs or economic competitiveness. It threatens further destabilization of the region and disruption of energy supplies.</p>
        <p>Reports that the United States is contributing to Iran's war machine by importing about $1.3 million a day in Iranian oil deepens the irony. This amounts to more than three times our annual budget for solar energy.</p>
        <p>The battle with Iran doesn't need to be fought on the high seas or in the air. In the 1970's we undermined the power of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by increasing energy efficiency 26 percent and reducing oil imports. The gas tank of every American car and the walls, ceilings and roofs of every American building can be made more energy-efficient and so diminish the political power of the Iranians. To reduce tensions in the Middle East and minimize the threat of increasing terrorism, we need to restore the renewable-energy programs that have been gutted or abolished and develop long-term energy policies where none exist. Otherwise the future costs we will pay will go far beyond gasoline at $5 a gallon.  TINA HOBSON, SCOTT RIDLEY  Washington, Aug. 29, 1987  The writers are, respectively, executive director and publications director of the Fund for Renewable Energy &amp; the Environment.</p>
