        <p>LEAD: A panel of experts told the White House today that smaller, simpler satellites that can monitor the Earth's climate should soon take priority over the huge Earth Observing System, an elaborate $30 billion array of six large satellites the space agency plans to place in orbit starting in 1997 or 1998.</p>
        <p>A panel of experts told the White House today that smaller, simpler satellites that can monitor the Earth's climate should soon take priority over the huge Earth Observing System, an elaborate $30 billion array of six large satellites the space agency plans to place in orbit starting in 1997 or 1998.</p>
        <p>The recommendation by a panel convened by the National Research Council buttressed the contentions of critics who say that the grandiose character of the Earth Observing System, or Eos, distorts research priorities, invites skyrocketing costs and could lead to the slighting of important studies.</p>
        <p>The system, whose initials spell the name of the goddess who in Greek myths was the mother of the stars and winds, would be the Federal Government's costliest environmental research project ever. Some aspects of the project have been attacked by critics who say scientists cannot wait until 1998 for vital information about how the global environment is changing.</p>
        <p>In a report requested by the White House, the panel of the research council found that Eos would leave a critical gap in efforts to measure the heating of the Earth's atmosphere in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Looking at Delay for Eos</p>
        <p>Less elaborate satellites requiring less development could fill the gap and also provide other critical data in the short term, the panel said in the report, which was made public in Washington yesterday. It concluded that ''if budget constraints arise, it would be more desirable to delay the launch of Eos spacecraft than to forgo or diminish the effectiveness of the near-term missions.''</p>
        <p>The panel members ''felt pretty strongly about that statement,'' said the group's chairman, D. James Baker Jr., an oceanographer who is the president of Joint Oceanographic Institutions Inc., a consortium that coordinates academic research. He said there was a ''very strong feeling'' in the scientific community and in Congress that ''we can't allow something that's going to happen in 1998 to delay our global change measurements.''</p>
        <p>Both Dr. Baker and Lennard D. Fisk, the space agency's associate administrator for space science and applications, said they believed there would be money enough to pursue Eos late in the decade and also provide satellite measurements of important aspects of climatic change in the meantime.</p>
        <p>The National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, is the major independent provider of scientific advice to the Government. Its study on Eos said at least one large 15-ton satellite was essential because 10 or 12 instruments must be grouped together on the same platform to monitor the Earth continuously from the same spot. NASA scientists say this is necessary if the project is to fulfill its mission of simultaneously measuring, for the first time on a global scale, many complex interactions of air, sea, land and living things that create and manipulate the Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>'Very Positive Endorsement'</p>
        <p>The report issued yesterday is ''a very positive endorsement'' of that central concept, said Dr. Fisk, who also said he was pleased with the report over all.</p>
        <p>But the panel said many of the project's objectives could be achieved by replacing at least three Eos satellites with smaller satellites, some of which could be launched sooner.</p>
        <p>At least three large satellites must be placed in orbit at five-year intervals, Dr. Fisk said, to provide simultaneous observations continuously over a planned research period of 15 years. But Dr. Baker said the decision to build more than one big satellite should depend on changes in technology and scientific knowledge. On this account, the study panel urged flexibility.</p>
        <p>It singled out for special concern ''a gap in the critical area of Earth radiation budget measurements.'' These measurements detail changes in infrared radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, which controls the heating of the planet's surface. Scientists consider the measurements essential to an understanding of global warming. An American satellite had been performing such measurements since 1985, but its instruments failed earlier this year.</p>
        <p>'Take a Hard Look'</p>
        <p>A joint French-Soviet satellite to be launched next year could fill the gap through about 1994, the report said, adding that that NASA could launch a satellite of its own to fill the gap after that.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fisk said NASA recognized that some Eos satellites could be supplanted by smaller ones. As for a new radiation-budget satellite, he said, ''we're going to take a hard look at it.''</p>
        <p>But ''you have to ask yourself, if you decided to do it, how fast you could do it,'' he said. Although development time for such a satellite might be shorter than for the Eos crafts, he said, it still might not be ready to fly in time to make much difference. If it did not go up until, say, 1996, he said, ''you'd have to ask the hard question, Is it worth it?''</p>
