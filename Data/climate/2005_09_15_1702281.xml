        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''President Says He's Responsible in Storm Lapses'' (front page, Sept. 14):</p>
        <p>President Bush claims that he takes responsibility for any failures of the federal government in its response to Hurricane Katrina. But does the president really know what taking responsibility means?</p>
        <p>It means fully financing government services like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers and putting responsible, qualified people in charge of them.</p>
        <p>It means restoring financing for education, Medicaid and environmental protection. It means not cutting or privatizing Social Security.</p>
        <p>It means taking drastic actions to help stop global warming. It means universal health insurance and health care. It means talking meaningfully about race in this country. It means rolling back tax breaks for rich people and corporations.</p>
        <p>It means requiring everyone to shoulder the burden. It means keeping your promises to provide safety for the nation. It means getting out of the Iraq disaster. It means recognizing that government is here to help people, not hurt them.</p>
        <p>So let's see if the president really takes responsibility. His history certainly doesn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling.</p>
