        <p>Studies combining astronomy, geology and biology have produced a new theory that links comets with the beginning of life on Earth and also some of the most devastating extinctions, including that of the dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>Astronomers, for example, have established that Chiron, a huge asteroid discovered in 1977, is in fact a comet with a halo of dust and ice that will make its closest approach to the Sun in 1996. Astronomers think that such enormous comets passing through the solar system could have scattered dust-bearing organic molecules associated with life and that they later disintegrated, with large fragments crashing into Earth and causing mass extinctions.</p>
        <p>Biologists and geologists have found evidence that amino acids, many of which are building blocks of life, may have been delivered to Earth by a giant extraterrestrial object believed to have struck the planet 65 million years ago with devastating consequences.</p>
        <p>This discovery was surprising because scientists had assumed that such molecules would have been destroyed by the object's fiery plunge through the atmosphere and the explosion on impact. Interplanetary Dust Theory</p>
        <p>Now scientists with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, writing in today's issue of the journal Nature, are proposing a theory to explain how comets could be the carriers of life's precursor chemicals to Earth as well as the agents of the destruction of life.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kevin Zahnle and Dr. David Grinspoon of the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., suggested a way in which cometary debris with biological molecules could be "swept up by Earth, collected gently and nondestructively as interplanetary dust."</p>
        <p>In their theory, a huge Chiron-like comet trapped in the inner solar system may have disintegrated over a long period of time, raining dust onto the planets. Cometary dust has been analyzed and found to be relatively rich in carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, the chemical elements essential for organic molecules. The dust particles are small enough to fall gently through the atmosphere, reaching the ground intact.</p>
        <p>The scientists said this could explain the presence of extraterrestrial amino acids found in sediments in Denmark from the time of the mass extinctions 65 million years ago, known as the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.</p>
        <p>In reporting the discovery last year, Meixun Zhao and Dr. Jeffrey L. Bada of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., said the amino acids had presumably been introduced to Earth by the six-mile-wide asteroid or comet that since 1980 has been blamed for the mass extinctions. Two Objections Raised</p>
        <p>Other scientists raised two objections to this interpretation. The supposed impact, they contended, would have vaporized the amino acids. And why were the amino acids distributed just above and below the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary clays, but not in the clay itself? This clay contained unusually large amounts of the element iridium, the clue on which the impact theory for mass extinctions was built.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zahnle and Dr. Grinspoon respond by suggesting that dust from the disintegrating comet was falling on Earth for thousands of years before and after the impact, leaving the traces of amino acid. But when it struck the Earth, the object would have destroyed any of the fragile amino acids it bore, accounting for their absence in the boundary clay.</p>
        <p>Christopher F. Chyba, a planetary scientist at Cornell University, said in an interview that the theory was plausible but added that other explanations for the boundary amino acids were possible. When the theorized comet collided with Earth, he said, the water and organic molecules in it would have vaporized and then cooled off, leaving amino acids as one product of the chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chyba said the theory provided an interesting possible solution to the problem of how organic molecules could have reached Earth from outer space in abundance. They have been found in small meteorites, but for extraterrestrial material to have had a substantial influence on prebiotic chemistry on Earth, it must have had other ways of arriving.</p>
        <p>In a commentary for the same issue of Nature, Mr. Chyba wrote that the new findings and interpretations "hold the promise of important advances" on the possibility that extraterrestrial material could be responsible for the origin of life on Earth.</p>
        <p>"The possibility is very much an open one," he added in an interview.</p>
        <p>Dr. Louis A. Frank, a physicist at the University of Iowa, provoked heated discussion recently when he interpreted ultraviolet images taken by a satellite as evidence for a steady fall of cometary ice. In "The Big Splash," published last month by Birch Lane Press, he said this bombardment could have been the source of much of the world's water, and perhaps of life itself.</p>
        <p>The more conventional theories center on chemical evolutionary processes on Earth leading to the origin of life some 3.8 billion years ago. But recent assumptions in which the original atmosphere was mainly carbon dioxide, Mr. Chyba said, make it more difficult to understand how organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously, without some "seeding" from outer space.</p>
