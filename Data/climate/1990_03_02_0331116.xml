        <p>LEAD: After weeks of negotiations in closed sessions, Senate leaders today diluted some provisions of their proposed clean air legislation to meet President Bush's demand for a less costly solution to the nation's pollution problems.</p>
        <p>After weeks of negotiations in closed sessions, Senate leaders today diluted some provisions of their proposed clean air legislation to meet President Bush's demand for a less costly solution to the nation's pollution problems.</p>
        <p>Announcing the result of negotiations with the White House, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said the bill was ''sound comprehensive legislation'' that would reduce acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals released in the air by industry.</p>
        <p>The White House said the senators, in settling for less stringent standards and a slower cleanup schedule, had satisfied in part Mr. Bush's demand for anti-pollution measures that do not pose risks to the economy.</p>
        <p>Action in Senate Scheduled</p>
        <p>The agreement cleared the way for a Senate action on the bill, which is to start next week. The original bill had been approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last fall. A separate clean air bill is before a House committee.</p>
        <p>The President's chief domestic policy adviser, Roger Porter, said that while the Administration would support the package announced today with the Senate, it may seek further changes in the House.</p>
        <p>The senators gave ground on several points. They agreed to stretch out the first stage of new regulations on automobile emissions to 1995 from 1993 and to allow a second stage, with even stricter limits on carbon monoxide and other pollutants, only under certain conditions.</p>
        <p>On acid rain, the Senate leaders agreed to allow power plants in Western and Midwestern states to continue burning low-sulfur coal for a longer period. When burned, low-sulfur coal produces sulfur dioxide, the major component of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Economic Impact Cushioned</p>
        <p>Senators from the affected regions wanted this provision to cushion the economic impact of reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants.</p>
        <p>The senators also softened a plan to reduce the risk from toxic substances released into the air by industrial plants. This step will lower the costs to industries for reducing airborne toxic chemicals.</p>
        <p>Both sides hailed the agreement as a fair compromise that would lead to significant improvements in the nation's air quality and in the protection of public health. But environmental groups and several senators said they had serious objections to many of the provisions and would fight for amendments on the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>Gene Karpinski, director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, an environmental and consumer advocacy organization, said, ''The clean air bill went into the back rooms and it looks like a dirty air bill is coming out.''</p>
        <p>William Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, the chief industry lobby working on the legislation, called the compromise ''a move in the right direction.'' But he added that industry still had ''some problems'' with the legislation, particularly with the proposed rules for airborne chemicals.</p>
        <p>The compromise removes the threat of a White House-sponsored filibuster in the Senate. In particular, senators from the Midwest and West objected to provisions for reducing the pollution from coal-fired power plants that cause acid rain, contending they would put a heavy burden on industrial and residential customers and hurt the coal industry.</p>
        <p>Senator Mitchell repeatedly stated today that he could not have prevented or ended a filibuster without a negotiated agreement. The agreement strikes a middle position between the ambitious cleanup requirements of the Senate bill drafted last fall and the less expensive approach of the legislation proposed by Mr. Bush last summer.</p>
        <p>Under $21 Billion Yearly</p>
        <p>When negotiations started in late January, President Bush said he would not accept legislation that exceeded the costs of his own proposal. Mr. Bush estimated the cost of the Senate bill at $41 billion a year and the annual costs of the Bush proposal at $19 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Porter, the assistant to the President for domestic and economic affairs, who headed the Administration negotiating team, said the package announced today would cost the nation ''under $21 billion'' a year.</p>
        <p>''The President is extraordinarily pleased with this agreement,'' Mr. Porter said, adding that the concessions made by the Senate resulted in a bill that would provide important environmental benefits ''in an economically efficient way.'' But in saying the White House might push for additional amendments in the House, Mr. Porter seemed to be reserving the right to further reduce the cost.</p>
        <p>Serious Problems Remain</p>
        <p>The legislation still faces a long and difficult path to enactment.</p>
        <p>A number of senators, environmental groups and industry spokesman said today that they had serious problems with provisions of the compromise. Amendments are likely to be introduced and debated at length on the Senate floor. And there are many differences between the today's compromise and the clean air legislation that is before the House committee.</p>
        <p>The proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970 are intended in part to provide new tools for reaching the unachieved goals of the original law. Despite deadlines that were originally described as mandatory, many areas of the country were unable to comply with requirements for reducing urban smog and toxic air pollution, even with repeated extension of deadlines by Congress. The initial deadline for controlling smog in urban areas, for example, was 1975.</p>
        <p>Senate negotiators gave ground on several critical points. They agreed to stretch out the first stage of a crackdown on pollution from auto tailpipes, originally scheduled to take effect in 1993, over a three year period ending in 1995. The negotiators also agreed to impose a second round of more stringent restrictions on auto exhausts, scheduled to go into effect in 2003, on a mandatory basis, only if 11 of 27 cities now seriously polluted are still out of compliance with the maximum pollution levels by the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>The Administration, which originally strongly opposed a second round of auto emission controls as being too expensive, has now accepted the additional controls on a conditional basis.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles an Exception</p>
        <p>The compromise bill envisions that all cities will come into compliance with the law's anti-smog requirements within 5, 10 or 15 years, depending on the current severity of the problem. An exception is made for Los Angeles, the city with the nation's most polluted air, which would be given 20 years.</p>
        <p>Both the Senate and the Administration had proposed that chemical producers be required to install the ''maximum available control technology'' to reduce the volume of toxic gases sent into air. The controls would be installed over the next 2 to 10 years, depending on the chemicals involved.</p>
        <p>The Senate also called for mandatory additional controls if, after the original equipment had been installed, people living near the plant were still exposed to a cancer risk of more than 1 in 10,000 over a 70-year lifetime of exposure to the pollutants. The Administration wanted additional controls only if deemed necessary by the Environmental Protection Agency on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        <p>The agreement retained the second round of controls based on estimates of risks to human health. But it changed the method by which the risks were calculated in a way that would reduce the number of people protected.</p>
        <p>The Senate and Administration were in basic agreement on the goal for acid rain control from the beginning. Both wanted a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in the Midwest by 2000, with the first reduction coming at a preliminary deadline of 1995. They also called for a ceiling on future pollution from power plants at levels not exceeding emissions in 1980.</p>
        <p>Sulfur dioxide, along with nitrogen oxides, are the precursor chemicals of acid rain, which has been found to damage aquatic life and buildings in the Northeast and Canada. Currently more than 20 million tons a of sulfur go into the nation's air each year, 17 million of which come from power plants.</p>
        <p>But many senators in the Midwest argued that the cost of reducing sulfur dioxide would place a heavy costs on utilities, which would then be passed on to industrial and residential customers. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and other Senators from states that produce coal with a high percentage of sulfur, said they feared that coal miners' jobs would be lost as utilities switched to low-sulfur fuel to meet the new requirements.</p>
        <p>Bowing to these concerns, the Senate leaders and the Administration extended the initial deadline to 1997 from 1995 for plants that choose to reduce sulfur dioxide by using scrubbers on high-sulfur fuel rather than switching to low-sulfur coal.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 3, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final</p>
        <p>An article yesterday about a Federal clean air bill described a type of coal incorrectly in some copies. It was high-sulfur coal that Senate leaders agreed to allow for a longer period at Western and Midwestern power plants.</p>
