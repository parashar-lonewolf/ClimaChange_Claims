        <p>LEAD: The last hope for Congressional action this year to overhaul the 1977 Clean Air Act disappeared today when the Senate's leading spokesman on environmental issues announced that he had abandoned months of negotiations with utility, environmental and union lobbyists on a compromise bill.</p>
        <p>The last hope for Congressional action this year to overhaul the 1977 Clean Air Act disappeared today when the Senate's leading spokesman on environmental issues announced that he had abandoned months of negotiations with utility, environmental and union lobbyists on a compromise bill.</p>
        <p>''I recognize reality, and the reality is that there will be no action on clean air legislation this year,'' said Senator George J. Mitchell, the Maine Democrat who heads the Environmental Protection Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. ''Unfortunately, there has been a one-sided debate in which costs are specific, benefits general. It is no wonder that so many prefer to ignore the problem, to plead cost, to plead complexity and finally to plead the need to adjourn.''</p>
        <p>Congress has been deadlocked since 1982 over efforts to amend the Clean Air Act and include in it provisions to control acid rain. The most immediate result of this year's failure to reach a compromise is that lawmakers will again be faced with a decision on extending compliance deadlines for meeting the ozone and carbon monoxide health standards contained in the 1977 law.</p>
        <p>The clean air bill is probably the most significant of what is likely to be a string of legislative casualties in the 100th Congress as lawmakers eager to adjourn and hit the campaign trail haggle over what can be accomplished in the remaining days of the session. The House of Representatives has essentially completed its legislative agenda but is awaiting Senate action on parental leave and child care bills as well as a major anti-drug bill. Compromise on Judges</p>
        <p>Although the Senate spent another day mired in debate over the parental leave and child care measures, sought by Democrats as part of an election-year drive to highlight family issues, action off the floor has produced a compromise that will allow about a dozen stalled judicial nominations to come up for confirmation votes. Republicans have charged that Democrats were holding up nearly 30 such nominations sought by President Reagan in the time-honored practice of blocking the appointments of a departing Administration.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, said today that his panel would clear about half of the 22 judicial nominees currently before it, while blocking action on the remaining nominees. Mr. Biden said that among those who will not come to the Senate floor for final confirmation is Judith Hope, currently a partner in a major Washington law firm, who was nominated by President Reagan to fill the vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a vacancy created by the resignation of Robert H. Bork.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biden said that the judges whose nominations would not be allowed to proceed had either ''clear, substantive problems'' with qualifications or backgrounds or were in ''intractable situations'' caused by disagreements between Senators representing their home states. He said that part of the path toward compromise had been paved by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, who agreed to drop his insistence on a death penalty provision in legislation to allow United States participation in an international treaty against genocide.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats had insisted on blocking judicial nominations in retaliation for Mr. Thurmond's earlier opposition to the genocide treaty. Although the treaty was approved by the Senate two years ago, the United States has been unable to participate because it has not made changes in American criminal laws to conform with the pact. Mr. Thurmond's agreement to drop the death penalty provision is expected to result in final approval of the implementing legislation. Clean Air Implications</p>
        <p>If Congress does not deciide on some kind of extension on the clean air standards, as many as 60 major cities that have failed to meet them could be subject to sanctions imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The E.P.A. has already notified several cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, that they cannot begin major new construction projects that would be sources of pollution.</p>
        <p>But Congress thus far seems unlikely to pass a further extension of the deadline. ''E.P.A. has announced its new ozone and carbon monoxide strategy, and it amounts to non-enforcement of the law,'' said Daniel F. Becker, legislative counsel for Environmental Action, noting that the E.P.A. could have sought cutoff of Federal highway funds, for example.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. announced several months ago that it would not move hastily against states and localities that had not met the standards and instead would tighten existing standards for the volatility of gasoline, thus decreasing the amount of vapors released into the air when gasoline is pumped into automobile tanks.</p>
        <p>''What we really need to do is come back to Congress next year and pass a strong clean air act that lives up to its name,'' Mr. Becker said. He said that environmental groups had been wary of the compromise under discussion because it would have achieved only one-third of the acid rain reduction over the next 15 years contemplated by Mr. Mitchell's original bill. Opposition in West</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell's bill was approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last November but had been prevented from coming to the floor by the Senate majority leader, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and a number of Senators from Western states, where low sulfur coal industries would have been adversely affected by provisions in the bill.</p>
        <p>Part of the difficulty for Mr. Mitchell in crafting a compromise was finding a way to balance not only the concerns of environmentalists and industry groups, but also the competing interests of producers of high sulfur and low sulfur coal. Sulfur is a pollutant that causes acid rain, and much of the negotiating has focused on whether standards for reducing sulfur dioxide emmissions from burning coal and the technology required to meet them would benefit one set of producers at the expense of the other.</p>
