        <p>The world will little note nor long remember whether or not John Tower becomes Secretary of Defense. Nor, in the long run - perhaps even in the short - will it much matter whether Eastern Airlines lives or dies. But as these questions dominated the headlines and broadcasts of a journalism that thrives on today:</p>
        <p>* More than 100 nations met in London to pursue a challenge set them by the European Community and the Bush Administration to eliminate by the end of the century industrial chemicals threatening the vital ozone layer.</p>
        <p>* In the backwash of anti-austerity rioting that left about 300 dead and 2,000 injured in Venezuela, President Carlos Andres Perez said (though he later tried to retract it) that his country might have to suspend all debt payments to foreign nations, significantly including the U.S.</p>
        <p>There's a pair of stories that really matter, and will for years to come -one a sign of international cooperation on an imminent environmental problem, the other a warning signal about the clear and present danger of third world debt.</p>
        <p>But even while they were hauling the bodies off the streets of Caracas, the Bush Administration was focused, like its predecessor, on the tired old question of the contras and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. That Reagan-generated conflict never did rise, and certainly doesn't now, to the high level of importance implied by the controversy it has aroused.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Baker was Treasury Secretary, he developed a plan, largely unsuccessful, to ease the third world debt problem - which hasn't gone away but has grown in severity. Now, instead of tackling it anew, he asks Congress for more aid to the contras. That's a slap in the face to the Central American presidents who recently signed a new peace proposal, and a sad commentary on the new Administration's regional priorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez probably won't actually suspend - not yet - all Venezuela's payments on its $33 billion foreign debt, although principal payments already have been halted. Default would too critically damage his nation's international credit standing. But the rioting that followed his imposition of relatively mild anti-inflation measures suggests that Latin populations - Venezuela's is one of the most democratic - cannot be squeezed forever to pay foreign debts.</p>
        <p>The danger is twofold. Tightening austerity measures to enable Latin governments to make huge payments - inflated by high interest rates set a decade ago - to gringo and European bankers ultimately will produce so much popular unrest that default may be forced and democracy could be overthrown. Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Venezuela - all bear virtually unbearable debts. Default and upheaval in one could lead to more of the same in the others.</p>
        <p>For the U.S., Latin default might threaten the banking system, and the overthrow of democracy obviously would damage hemispheric stability; even if neither happens, forced austerity in Latin America prevents its nations from importing American goods, a heavy burden on the U.S. trade imbalance.</p>
        <p>The necessary response, the only effective response, is debt relief - including the stretchout of terms, the reduction of interest rates, even in some cases the forgiveness of loans the Latin nations were pressured into accepting, together with the necessary legislation to make it possible for U.S. commercial banks to take these steps. If any of that is to happen, President Bush and Secretary Baker will have to take the lead.</p>
        <p>They already provide such leadership on important environmental questions. Acid rain prevention is high on Mr. Bush's agenda and Mr. Baker's first official pronouncement was a commitment to act against global warming. Now William K. Reilly, the director of the E.P.A., has been sent to London with an important Administration commitment to the worldwide elimination of ozone-threatening chemicals by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Ozone depletion allows more ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach the earth's surface. That increases the risk of skin cancer and eye cataracts, causes ill effects in crops and aquatic life and may contribute to global warming. Even after the offending chemicals are eliminated, those already in the stratosphere will continue for decades to attack the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has moved strongly but none too soon against these dangers. A similarly alert response to the debt crisis would make more sense than another dreary round of battle for the contras - or even for poor old battered John Tower.</p>
