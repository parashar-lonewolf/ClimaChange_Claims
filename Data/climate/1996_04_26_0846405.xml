        <p>Both Congressional Republicans and the White House can find something to crow about in the $159.4 billion budget agreement that Congress passed today, and each side has eagerly trumpeted its gains.</p>
        <p>Republicans met their goal of cutting $23 billion in discretionary spending from the budget over last year's levels.</p>
        <p>Even though they were forced into some political horsetrading with the White House and shifted millions of dollars to some programs that they have targeted for outright elimination or deep cuts, they were able to force the Administration to accept offsetting cuts from other programs.</p>
        <p>Though the agreement approved today does not address the larger, more important steps needed to balance the Federal budget -- particularly changes in  entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare -- the $23 billion in cuts kept the Republicans on track in their plan to balance the Federal budget by 2002.</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, conceded that much today when he was asked what his party's biggest concession had been: "Money," he replied. "Big time."</p>
        <p>On the other hand, though the provisions of the new agreement leave this year's budget $30 billion below President Clinton's request for 1996, the White  House can clearly claim the advantage on policy issues.</p>
        <p>The Administration was able to wrangle $5 billion in additional spending for  the jobs, education and health programs it felt strongest about. And it rescued  from the Republican trash heap the President's police-on-the-streets program, his Goals 2000 education program and his national service program, AmeriCorps.</p>
        <p>And after months of bruising fights between intransigent and outspoken adversaries, the Administration won almost across-the-board success on major environmental disputes in the new budget agreement.</p>
        <p>To the very end, a senior White House aide said, the talks on environmental issues were "an extremely high-energy, high-emotion, high-intensity series of discussions." The agreement gives President Clinton special waiver authority to  overturn provisions in the bill on several environmental issues, some of which had been debated for nearly a year, his aide said.</p>
        <p>Here is a rundown of specific features of the agreement:</p>
        <p>Endangered Species  The Administration will soon be able to resume listings of new species for protection under the Endangered Species Act, a procedure that has been halted since last summer, when Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, added an amendment on a spending bill that imposed a moratorium.</p>
        <p>Wetlands  The Environmental Protection Agency will retain the authority in existing law to veto permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers for draining and filling wetlands, a power that Senator Kit Bond, Republican of Missouri, had tried to limit.</p>
        <p>Tongass National Forest  President Clinton won in his fight with the three-man Alaskan delegation, Republicans all, over expanded logging in the Tongass National Forest. Though the White House agreed to pay about $100 million in economic aid to local governments in compensation, logging there will not be expanded.</p>
        <p>Mojave Desert  The bill would allow increased land use there, both recreational and for commercial purposes like mining. The President is expected to exercise a waiver  that would nullify that provision.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. Spending  The Environmental Protection Agency, which throughout the budget struggle has been targeted for exceptionally deep cuts in its spending, is to be made almost  whole, although its budget will not actually increase, as the President originally had sought, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>The agency will be allowed to spend about $6.6 billion in the fiscal year 1996, which is already half over and ends in October. That is a shade less than  it spent in the previous fiscal year, and is nearly $1 billion more than the amount allocated by the spending bill that Congress initially passed but that the President vetoed.</p>
        <p>Agency officials said the financing would allow it to resume a normal pace of enforcement actions and inspections, one area that has been severely crimped during the long budget impasse, although it would take a long time to catch up on the backlog of unfinished work.</p>
        <p>Toxic Wastes and Clean Water  Similarly, work will resume at dozens of Superfund sites all over the country where the task of cleaning up toxic wastes has been halted, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of millions of dollars are being restored to revolving funds that help the states pay for sewage and drinking water treatment plants, they said. Energy and Emissions There were some areas of policy in which Congress prevailed and the President decided not to fight any longer. For example, energy efficiency measures, steps  to avoid the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are implicated in global climate change and programs to encourage the development of new environmental technologies have all been cut.</p>
        <p>AmeriCorps  Republicans had targeted Mr. Clinton's national service program for elimination. Under the new agreement, it survived, though with only $400 million, $69.5 million below the 1995 budget and $417 million below the President's request.</p>
        <p>Goals 2000 The Administration's program to improve the quality of education was also on the Republicans' kill list. But it will continue through at least this fiscal year,  which ends Sept. 30, with $350 million, nearly $22 million less than last year.</p>
        <p>C.O.P.S. The Republicans retreated on a plan to turn the President's cops-on-the-beat program a block grant to states and they also provided $1.4 billion, a slight increase over last year's budget of $1.3 billion. Administration officials said  it was enough money to keep on track with its plans to put 100,000 new police officers on the streets in the next few years.</p>
        <p>Advanced Technology Program The Commerce Department-run program was an early Republican target for elimination. But in the end, the Republicans relented and appropriated $221 million for one of Mr. Clinton's pet projects, which last year received $341 million.</p>
        <p>Abortion Language Stripped from the bill is language that would have allowed states to deny payments for abortions for Medicaid recipients who become pregnant through rape  or incest. But Republicans preserved a provision that forbids Federal, state or  local Governments to deny accreditation, licenses or financial assistance to medical schools or hospitals that refuse to teach abortion procedures. The White House had opposed that language.</p>
        <p>H.I.V. Policy The conference bill overturns a recent law that requires the mandatory discharge of members of the military who test positive for the virus that causes AIDS. That provision was part of a $265 billion defense authorization bill that Mr. Clinton signed on Feb. 10 but only after pledging that he would fight to have the law reversed.</p>
        <p>Student Loans The Republicans dropped a plan to limit the Federal Direct Student Loan Program  to 40 percent of new Federal loans. Intead, the bill limited administrative costs of the program to $436 million. The student loan issue was one of the first that the Clinton Administration seized upon as political ammunition against the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Disasters and Security The bill authorizes $1.3 billion in supplemental appropriations for natural disaster relief for flooding in the Pacific Northwest and from last winter's blizzards in the Northeast. There is also $860 million for peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, $70 million for transferring F-16's to Jordan  and $50 million to Israel for anti-terrorism measures.</p>
        <p>Program Eliminations The budget kills 200 Federal programs, half of them in the Departments of Labor, and Health and Human Services. The Administration had suggested or supported many of the eliminations.</p>
        <p>Public Broadcasting The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which came under a pointed and sustained attack from conservative Republicans for having a purported liberal bent, received $250 million.</p>
        <p>Utility Assistance Nearly the entire budget for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program was restored -- $1 billion. Republicans ran into a maelstrom of protest and negative publicity when they proposed killing the program, which helps pay utility bills  for the poor and some elderly people. House and Senate budget negotiators wound  up cutting $100 million from the program.</p>
        <p>Debt Collection The budget would give a new set of teeth to the Federal Government's debt collectors. Under the legislation, delinquent debtors would be barred from obtaining Federal credit and Federal employees who owe the Government could see  their salaries garnished.</p>
        <p>Private collection companies would be used to collect some nontax debts and the bill would put the Treasury Department in charge of a new, centralized effort to collect deliquent nontax debts, which are estimated to exceed $55 billion.</p>
