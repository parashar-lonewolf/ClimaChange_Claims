        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' Opens May 1. This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40).

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who re-tailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GUARDIANS'  Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Góes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOW PEOPLE'  Paul Weitz's eyebrow-pencil-thin comedy about a man who hires actors to impersonate his family feels like one long, occasionally amusing party game whose players don't know when to call it a night. The excellent four-member cast, led by Debra Monk and directed by Peter Askin, finds charm and energy amid the vaporous bait-and-switch plot reversals (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'CHAMPION' and 'THE STUTTERING PREACHER'  Two new one-act plays, one a well-drawn family drama and the other a brash and ribald romantic comedy, from the New Federal Theater and Black Spectrum Theater. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'LITTLE WILLY' A slickly produced and paper-thin character study of Hitler's nephew, who moved to Long Island before World War II (1:05). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB'  David Calvitto is fun and scary as a television game-show host who turns sadistic, and Nancy Walsh and Bill Coelius are suitably airheaded as his contestants, but the play, by C. J. Hopkins, feels like a familiar comic skit that takes aim at an easy target (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'FAHRENHEIT 451'  A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'MEN OF CLAY' In a play that Jeff Cohen, the author, says is based on his father, four Jewish men gather to play tennis in early-1970's Baltimore and watch their way of life disappear. The play seems to want to generate nostalgia, but since these four are racist, sexist pigs, it's hard to wish them anything but ill (2:15). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 268-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'ON THE LINE' In a theater culture that is more likely to produce a play set in a well-heeled living room than on a factory floor, Joe Roland's unflinching portrait of a strike in New Jersey is a refreshing anomaly (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE MASTER RACE' Bertolt Brecht's middle-period classic in a robust new translation by Binyamin Shalom and a spare and powerful production by the Roust Theater Company, directed by James Phillip Gates (2:45). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Hunka)</p>

        <p>'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'KINKY BOOTS' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In this silly, quasi-inspirational British comedy, a staid shoe factory in Northern England avoids ruin by switching from the manufacture of men's dress shoes to that of thigh-high, stiletto-heeled boots worn by drag queens. The recipe for this feel-good movie, which cries out to be made into a musical, comes from the same cookbook that gave us ''The Full Monty.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>'LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO' (R, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Zoë (Bárbara Mori) is a gorgeous, vapid wife who longs for children, but her distant spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. Enter the rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose schedule is less regimented. Bubbling with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality, ''La Mujer de Mi Hermano'' is an overheated telenovela that considers procreation more important than honesty, and what we want more important than who we are. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LOOK BOTH WAYS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, ''Look Both Ways'' follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. The principal sufferers are Meryl (Justine Clarke), a morbid illustrator, and Nick (William McInnes), a terminally ill photographer, who discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac. Bogged down by stylistic gimmickry, ''Look Both Ways'' aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' (R, 110 minutes) This star-studded jigsaw puzzle of revenge and mistaken identity thinks that it's terribly smart, although it amounts to an empty, self-satisfied imitation of ''Pulp Fiction'' that reputable actors like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley can't salvage. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ON A CLEAR DAY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, ''On a Clear Day'' follows Frank (the great Peter Mullan), a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel. Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and a predictably inspirational thrust, the movie balances the sentimentality with excellent performances and a healthy dose of working-class vulnerability.(Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'SISTERS IN LAW' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and pidgin) Grass-roots feminism thrives in a Cameroon village, thanks to the pair of warmhearted, tough-minded women of law profiled in this excellent verité documentary. (Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TAKE THE LEAD' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Hip-hop and ballroom dancing styles fuse in a South Bronx high school at which a dance teacher, Antonio Banderas, turns gawky ducklings into gliding swans. It's sloppy but mildly endearing. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>COMEDY FORTNIGHT (Through Wednesday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater's festival offers nightly screenings of ''Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,'' starring Rob Corddry of ''The Daily Show'' as a disgraced paintball champion, and two more ''Best of First Sundays: A Hilarious Retrospective'' programs of film shorts.

        <p>SHELLEY WINTERS VS. THE WATER (Through Tuesday) BAMcinématek concludes its tribute to Winters, who died in January at 83, with ''The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972).

        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>THE ATARIS (Tuesday) The Ataris play pop-punk at its most suburban and apple-cheeked. They have been around since 1997, but their concerns haven't evolved much beyond those of the harmless skateboard rats next door. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOE BATAAN (Tonight) Since the 1970's, this keyboardist has been playing Latin soul that mixes mambo and jazzy R &amp; B. 9, BAMcafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; no cover. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DAN BERN, KAKI KING (Tomorrow) Dan Bern is a wry singer-songwriter. Like Loudon Wainwright III, he puts his bitterness in the foreground, usually in the service of a pointed joke with a lefty edge. Kaki King is a multifaceted guitarist whose style is grounded in driving yet intricate rhythms. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BLACK EYED PEAS, FLIPSYDE, PUSSYCAT DOLLS (Tonight) The Black Eyed Peas make lightweight hip-hop that revolves around the brash sexiness of the singer Fergie. Flipsyde is a socially conscious rap crew that incorporates some alt-rock. The Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque crew turned hit dance-pop act, make enticingly sassy boasts about their man-stealing skills. 7:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $54.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>MARSHALL CHAPMAN, JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight) The songwriter Marshall Chapman has been at it since 1973, and her songs, from ''Betty's Bein' Bad'' to ''Last Mango in Paris'' have been recorded by the likes of Crystal Gayle and Jimmy Buffet.

        <p>THE DRESDEN DOLLS (Tomorrow) Combining bash and chatter with Weimar-style cabaret, the singer and pianist Amanda Palmer and the drummer Brian Viglione play feisty call-and-response punk. Doors open at 6 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ELECTRIC SIX (Tuesday and Wednesday) Three years ago this Detroit garage band generated buzz with the smirking but rocking song ''Danger! High Voltage.'' Its latest album, ''Señor Smoke'' (Warner), never achieves dance-punk command, but the histrionic singer Dick Valentine and his boys know how to be manic. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BANNING EYRE WITH COUMBA SIDIBÉ (Tomorrow) The playing of the guitarist, author and African-music scholar Banning Eyre takes its cues from the fluid, nimble style of the West African guitarists who populate his CD ''In Griot Time.'' Tomorrow he will be joined by the deep-voiced Malian singer Coumba Sidibé and will play as part of her backing combo. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BELA FLECK &amp; THE FLECKTONES (Tonight) Bela Fleck, a banjoist, has moved far beyond bluegrass technique. His own tunes feature odd meters and tricky structures, though his band can make them sound briskly mechanical. He has also applied his technique to the classical repertory for one more kind of crossover. 11:30, B. B. King Blues Club &amp; Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>KIRK FRANKLIN (Tomorrow) Kirk Franklin is a preacher, not a singer, but that hasn't kept him from selling millions of albums. He leads a troupe that meshes P-Funk grooves with messages of uplift, putting hip-hop rhythms behind the old-fashioned gospel dynamics of wide-open belting and jubilant choir singing, updating the music without sacrificing it to slickness. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $37 to $65. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>GHAZAL (Tuesday) Kayhan Kalhor, who plays a spike fiddle, and Shujaat Husain Khan, who plays sitar, weave classical Persian and Indian styles into improvisatory jams.

        <p>GHOSTFACE KILLAH, DJ PREMIER, SLICK RICK (Tomorrow) There is lots of rapping lately about drugs and dealing, but the Wu Tang Clan alum Ghostface Killah brings a particular pathos to the rap game on his new ''Fishscale'' (Def Jam), cutting pure thrill with whiffs of regret. He is joined on the bill by the jazzy DJ Premier and the smooth storyteller Slick Rick. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $33. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GUSTER (Tonight) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 7, Hiro Ballroom, 366 West 17th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Pareles)</p>
        <p>SEU JORGE (Thursday) This Brazilian singer may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in the movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou'' and his role as Knockout Ned in ''City of God.'' His music avoids the traditional Brazilian styles, favoring crowd-pleasing funk-pop and loverman R &amp; B. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan; (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>HUGH MASEKELA (Tuesday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>VAN MORRISON (Monday) Van Morrison has flirted with country music before, but his latest album, ''Pay the Devil'' (Lost Highway), offers his slanted take on songs like Hank Williams's ''Your Cheatin' Heart'' and Rodney Crowell's ''Till I Gain Control Again.'' He's better at his own classic, agitated R &amp; B but can certainly work up a surly-cowboy pique. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 3 (212) 307-7171; $79.50 and $149.50.(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tonight) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as bossa nova chill-out music. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) These performance-artist glam rockers have both a healthy sense of irony and pop chops.

(Sold out.) (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SECRET MACHINES (Wednesday) This psych-rock act harks back to both Led Zeppelin-style pummel and the ragtag explorations of the Flaming Lips, prizing epic live sound as much as headphone spaciousness. 9 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SUPERSUCKERS (Thursday) The Supersuckers play amiable Satanist speed-metal patterned on Motorhead's ''Ace of Spades.'' 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TAKING BACK SUNDAY (Tuesday) These Long Island screamo boys shout their romantic confessions over punk rock that's tinged with radio-friendly metal. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BEN TAYLOR (Tomorrow) The son of James Taylor and Carly Simon, Ben Taylor has his dad's voice, his mom's kookiness and his own Northeastern hippie affect. 10:45 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TOOTS &amp; THE MAYTALS (Tonight) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand-new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $27.50. (Pareles)</p>

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9958; $35. (Sinagra)</p>

        <p>* KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit.

        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* MARY CLEERE HARAN  (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) A wonderful no-frills singer with a sophisticated wit, Ms. Haran has a remarkable talent for simultaneously interpreting standards in the spirit in which they were written and looking at them through 21st-century eyes. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $60 tonight and tomorrow; $50 Tuesday through Thursday.

        <p>* AFRO-LATIN JAZZ ORCHESTRA AND BALLET HISPANICO (Tonight and tomorrow night) ''Palladium Nights,'' a new ballet choreographed by Willie Rosario, aims to recreate the electricity of that legendary ballroom during mambo's 1950's heyday. A similar time warp occurs every time the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra performs Chico O'Farrill's ''Afro-Cuban Suite,'' as it plans to do here. 8, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $30 to $130. (Nate Chinen)</p>

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>TIM BERNE'S BIG SATAN (Tomorrow) Mr. Berne, a vigorous and exploratory alto saxophonist, makes interplay the driving force in his band, with the guitarist Marc Ducret and the drummer Tom Rainey, recently reunited for a monthlong tour. 8 p.m., Center for Improvisational Music, 295 Douglass Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 631-5882, www.schoolforimprov.org; cover, $12.

        <p>MICHAEL BLAKE'S FREE ASSOCIATION (Sunday) The tenor and soprano saxophonist Michael Blake pursues an exuberant variety of collective improvisation, with collaborators like the saxophonist Peck Allmond, the trumpeter Ron Horton, the bassist Ben Allison, the keyboardist Frank Kimbrough and the tubaist Marcus Rojas. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, near Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; no cover. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JOÃO BOSCO (Tuesday through April 30) Known in his early career as a hit-making songwriter for the Brazilian songbird Elis Regina, Mr. Bosco has been a popular singer on his own merits for some 20 years. But he rarely performs outside Brazil, which gives this engagement the tinge of a noteworthy event. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHEL CAMILO TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) A percussive, often cathartic pianist, Mr. Camilo recently released a recording of Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' (Telarc) with a 95-piece symphony orchestra. His trio, with the bassist Charles Flores and the drummer Dafnis Prieto, can sometimes seem nearly as expansive. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RON CARTER /KARRIN ALLYSON (Through Sunday) Mr. Carter, an august and influential bassist, has had mixed success as a bandleader; his best efforts usually involve the articulate pianist Stephen Scott, who joins him in this quartet. Ms. Allyson comes bearing a new album, ''Footprints'' (Concord), which delves into Jon Hendricks-style vocalese; as on the album, she digs in here with a strong ensemble spearheaded by the pianist Bruce Barth. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>

(Chinen)</p>
        <p>FREESTYLE JAZZ (Thursday) The avant-garde series formerly established at CBGB's Lounge now takes place every Thursday in a cozy side room adjoining an unassuming pub. This week's program offers three texture-minded trios, led by the trombonist Joe Fiedler, the trumpeter Roy Campbell Jr. and the multireedist Andrew Lamb. 8 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILL FRISELL QUINTET (Through Sunday, and Tuesday through April 30) On his latest Nonesuch releases -- ''East/West'' and ''Further East/Further West,'' both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard -- the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook, with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums. The addition of the saxophonist Greg Tardy and the trumpeter Ron Miles alters the ensemble's chemistry as well as its size. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Fridays and Saturdays; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MONCEF GENOUD (Tonight) Tunisian-born, Swiss-raised and blind from birth, Mr. Genoud applies an uncommon perspective to his acoustic piano playing, as he demonstrates on a strong new album, ''Aqua'' (Savoy). He performs here with a trio, his most comfortable setting. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROBIN HOLCOMB (Tomorrow) Ms. Holcomb seeks out meditative spaces as both a pianist and a singer, and she softens her experimental urges with an enveloping sort of lyricism. For this rare unaccompanied performance, she revisits old pieces and introduces some new ones. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVE KIKOSKI QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A well-rounded pianist in the modern mainstream, Mr. Kikoski often does his best work as an accompanist, which is only one reason to applaud this group's inclusion of the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAT MARTINO QUINTET (Through Sunday) The guitarist Pat Martino's new Blue Note album, ''Remember: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery,'' does exactly what it purports to do. And it works, because of the untroubled self-assurance of the emulation and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RENÉ McLEAN (Tonight) Mr. McLean, a saxophonist, leads an acoustic quartet in memory of his father, the alto saxophone legend Jackie McLean, who died three weeks ago. 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MYRA MELFORD (Tonight) Ms. Melford's solo piano playing is a study in subtle coloration and shifting grain, but it can also deliver the solid punch of the blues. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, survivor is truly the appropriate term). He leads a sympathetic group consisting of John Hicks on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MY EARS ARE BENT (Tuesday) This three-piece band, consisting of Ted Reichman on acoustic piano and electronics, Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ben Perowsky on drums, fashions an engrossingly layered chamber-music aesthetic that suggests more than a passing interest in independent rock. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (Aum Fidelity), the new recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one of them, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight and Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Tonight she plays and sings in a group featuring Bill Frisell and Tony Scherr on guitars, and Peter Scherr on bass, as part of the ''Live From Home'' series at the Housing Works Bookstore; on Tuesday she plays with yet another guitarist, Adam Levy, along with the pianist Art Hirahara and the bassist Matt Penman. Tonight at 7:30, Housing Works Bookstore, 126 Crosby Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-3324, www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe; cover, $20.

        <p>SIMONE: A TRIBUTE TO NINA SIMONE (Tonight) An intensely personal tribute on the third anniversary of Nina Simone's death, featuring her daughter, the accomplished Broadway actress known simply as Simone, and her closest musical partner, the guitarist Al Shackman. The setting is Town Hall, site of a pivotal concert in her early career. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50.(Chinen)</p>
        <p>TIERNEY SUTTON /LOSTON HARRIS (Thursday through April 29) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer, as she has demonstrated on a number of recent engagements. She shares a bill with Mr. Harris, a singer and pianist with a style patterned after Nat King Cole. 7:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TERRASSON-OKEGWO-PARKER TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) Throughout the latter half of the 1990's, the pianist Jacky Terrasson led one of jazz's fresher-sounding acoustic piano trios, distinguished not only by his fluid pianism but also by the resonant bass tone of Ugonna Okegwo and the pared-down percussive drive of Leon Parker. Regrouping here, the musicians present themselves as a collective, which could well have positive implications for the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with additional 11:30 shows next Friday and April 29, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and April 29. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHARLES TOLLIVER'S MUSIC INC. CONTINUUM (Tomorrow) In the 1970's, Music Inc. was a heavy-gauge quartet designed to showcase the exertions of a blazing young trumpeter named Charles Tolliver. This reincarnation features Mr. Tolliver, whose recent re-emergence has been a welcome bit of news, and Cecil McBee, his original bassist; the continuum comes in the form of two youngbloods, the pianist Robert Glasper and the drummer E. J. Strickland. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766 ; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* RANDY WESTON AND THE GNAWA MASTER MUSICIANS OF MOROCCO (Tuesday) Mr. Weston, the leading practitioner of a distinctly African approach to jazz piano, has a history of serious collaboration with the Gnawa Master Musicians of Morocco. This free concert aims to capture the fire of a performance in Mr. Weston's native Brooklyn seven years ago, which has been issued on CD as ''Spirit! The Power of Music'' (Sunnyside). 7 p.m., World Financial Center Winter Garden, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Sunday) James Robinson's City Opera production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. Yunah Lee sings Mimi, Eric Fennell steps in as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black is Musetta, and Philip Torre sings Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) On opening night at the New York City Opera, Kate Aldrich came through in the title role, capturing not only Carmen's devilish seductiveness but also her radical protofeminist pride in her own independence. Unfortunately, there was scant chemistry between her and Robert Breault as Don José. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight) The second cast will offer the season's final performance of Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Timothy Kuhn, new to the company this season, sings the title role; also making a debut on this stage is Claudia Waite, as Donna Anna. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Anne Midgette).</p>
        <p>* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he accomplished this vividly. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, the dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $205 tickets remaining tonight, $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'LOHENGRIN' (Monday) While Wagner's sprawling opera is playing at the Met, the Alliance Players offer the New York premiere of ''Lohengrin'' by the Italian avant-gardist Salvatore Sciarrino. This one-act opera is entirely introspective, based on what the composer calls the ''invisible action'' unfolding inside Elsa's mind. In his music, Mr. Sciarrino often paints with the finest of brushes, hinting at deep emotion through compressed whispers and the rustling of wind. For adventurous listeners, his interiorized postscript to Wagner promises to be fascinating. 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100; $35. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>'MISS LONELYHEARTS' (Wednesday) Juilliard has done much commissioning to celebrate its centennial this year, including a new opera that's been in progress for some time. Lowell Liebermann's piece is based on Nathanael West's novella, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, who has written or helped write librettos for significant works -- Tobias Picker's ''Emmeline,'' Lorin Maazel's ''1984,'' Ned Rorem's ''Our Town'' and Elliot Goldenthal's ''Grendel'' (opening at the Los Angeles Opera next month). Andreas Delfs conducts. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406; $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette).</p>
        <p>* 'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) After five months' absence, Jonathan Miller's handsome production has returned to the line-up at the Met with an almost entirely new cast. The soprano Andrea Rost and the bass-baritone John Relyea are endearing as Susanna and Figaro. And the mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, in her first appearances at the Met, has been winning praise for her rich-voiced portrayal of the hormonal page boy Cherubino. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'SUSANNAH' (Tonight through Sunday) It's easy to poke fun at Carlisle Floyd's opera for its folksy score, run through with hymn tunes, square dances and Appalachian ditties. Yet the opera, more sophisticated than it appears, about a sensual young woman in rural Tennessee who inadvertently stirs up envy and desire among the townspeople, has been moving audiences since its premiere in 1956. The Dicapo Opera Theater presents a 50th-anniversary production, directed by Michael Capasso and conducted by Steven Osgood. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438 ext. 10; $47.50. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Floria Tosca, opera's quintessential diva, is not a role for the fainthearted. Deborah Voigt, still searching for the perfect fit, role-wise, for her silvery voice, is taking it on at the Met for the first time. Franco Farina and James Morris can match her volume-wise if not with stylistic elegance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $175 tickets remaining on Wednesday. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ALEXANDER STRING QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) With lots of Beethoven under its collective belt, this San Francisco-based ensemble is no stranger to marathon performance cycles, and this coming week, it begins another lightning traversal, this time of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets. Tuesday's performance features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; Wednesday brings Nos. 4, 5 and 6. The five-concert series runs through May 1. 8 p.m., Baruch College Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-4085; $25. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>AXIOM (Tonight) Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this newly hatched new-music chamber ensemble in Takemitsu's ''Tree Line,'' Birtwistle's ''Tragoedia,'' Webern's ''Konzert'' (Op. 24) and Steve Reich's ''City Life.'' 8, Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406; free. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>OLGA BORODINA and ILDAR ABDRAZAKOV (Tuesday) The creamy-voiced, languid Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina is one of the best we have today, although her gifts as a recitalist are mixed; the voice is beautiful, the presentation has been somewhat passive. Her husband, a bass, joins her for a program of Russian music, including songs and arias by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and others. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC  (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, this orchestra's new music director, leads his charges in a program of symphonic pieces and songs celebrating contemporary urbanity, with the German cabaret star Ute Lemper as his soloist. Mr. Christie offers classic works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Copland, Eisler and Piazzolla, as well as more recent pieces by Heiner Goebbels, Kander and Ebb, and Chava Alberstein and Ms. Lemper's ''Ghosts of Berlin.'' 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) ''Discoveries and Masterworks'' is the name of this two-part program that combines staples of the repertory with less-known works. Sunday's program juxtaposes Schoenberg and Brahms, Kurtag and Schumann; Tuesday's, Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor with Chausson and Boccherini. Sunday at 5, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. The quartet will perform them all, in chronological order, on five programs starting on Thursday. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* MIDORI (Tuesday) Is Midori maturing into an adventurous performer? Her hefty contemporary program -- Judith Weir's ''Music for 247 Strings,'' Isang Yun's Violin Sonata, Lutoslawski's Partita and works by Gyorgy Kurtag and Alexander Goehr -- suggests a willingness to leave the instant crowd pleasers behind and take some chances. Her longtime accompanist, Robert McDonald, is at the piano. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 to $54. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Monday) Joel Sachs leads his expert student ensemble in their final concert of season. The program, like many of Mr. Sachs's adventures, is international and far-flung, with works by Andrew Ford, from Australia; Ryan Francis, from the United States; Bernd Franke, from Germany; Jose Maceda, from the Philippines; and Milica Paranosic, from the former Yugoslavia. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Mstislav Rostropovich approaches the music of Shostakovich with more authority and close personal knowledge than just about anyone. He returns to the Philharmonic to lead the composer's 10th Symphony and his gripping First Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 to $104. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>'POCKET CONCERTOS' (Tomorrow) It's one thing to commission a new concerto; it's another to commission 12 of them. This weekend, Miller Theater introduces the first concert in a three-year project conceived to create works for soloists and sinfonietta by some of the theater's favorite composers. Two of the concertos on this first program are for piano -- John Musto will perform his own, and Ichizo Okashiro's will be played by his sister, Chitose -- one is for accordion, by Julia Wolfe; and Benedict Mason has written a double concerto for bass and tuba. George Steel, who runs the theater and conceived the project, conducts. 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Not many pianists can give their own preconcert lecture with the erudition that Charles Rosen will very likely muster as he concludes his series on ''Mozart Within History.'' The theme of this third installment is Mozart's influence on later generations of Romantic composers.

        <p>* RICHARD MOVE (Thursday) Opening on Thursday for two weekends, Mr. Move, fresh from his duet with Desmond Richardson at the Martha Graham Dance Company gala on Tuesday, will present ''The Show (Achilles Heels).''

The cast also includes Katherine Crockett from the Graham company. Arto Lindsay did the score.

(Rockwell)</p>
        <p>SYMPHONY SPACE DANCE SAMPLER (Tomorrow) What looks like a roster of hundreds of dance companies and individuals in all styles, some hot and some not, will perform in this 12-hour marathon. 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10 per three-hour segment. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>AYNSLEY VANDENBROUCKE MOVEMENT GROUP (Wednesday) Circles symbolize communities in ''Full Circle,'' to be danced in the round with flashlights providing the only lighting. (Through April 29.) 8 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444 or www.smarttix.com; $15 in advance, $20 at the door. (Anderson)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY): FEMALE RESPONSES TO THE CLASSICAL IDEAL IN AMERICAN DECORATIVE ARTS,' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (See above.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through May 1. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art, abstraction. This show is stylishly installed (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. &amp; J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733, through May 6. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab where he was working. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>'When Artists Say We' This timely sociological experiment of a show features 17 artists or artist groups who were invited to create wall-diagrams or mini-exhibitions reflecting on the social networks out of which contemporary art emerges. Artists Space, 38 Green Street, (212) 226-3970, through April 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'B-Side' This engaging group show includes Tim Spelios's beautifully made Surrealistic drum set in which the components are square rather than round; Matt Freedman's life-size sculpture of a boy with a lion's teeth and elephant eyes; Mary Carlson's crocheted works, resembling splats of blood on the wall; Joyce Pensato's expressionistically painted clown face; Judith Page's ghoulish and viscous small portraits; Meredith Allen's funny and scary photographs of dogs; and a painting by Jim Torok that declares: ''You have no worries. Things are going well. Don't wake up.'' Sarah Bowen, 210 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4517, through April 30. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>PETER BEGLEY Parisian esprit enlivens Peter Begley's latest multipanel paintings. Their motif is the cornice: a ubiquitous emblem of Baron Haussmann's grand boulevards, which, abstracted and made delicately ornate, permits Mr. Begley to add illusory depth to his usual richly worked, waxy fields of warm color. Partly the filigree, partly the gentle rapture with his recently adopted city give to these new works a bit of the élan of old Raoul Dufy. Salander-OReilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606; through tomorrow. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>'JANE FREILICHER: NEAR THE SEA: PAINTINGS 1958-63 The beautifully relaxed, nearly abstract paintings that were Jane Freilicher's initial response to the vistas of eastern Long Island add a surprising piece to the unruly puzzle of late-1950's art and sharpen your sense of her ambition and achievement. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050; through tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NAN GOLDIN: 'CHASING A GHOST' A riveting if flawed three-screen video projection titled ''Sisters, Saints &amp; Sibyls'' hauntingly details the trauma that drives Ms. Goldin's invasive, yet oddly solitary photographs, as well as her lifelong battle with addiction.Its unalloyed honesty offers extreme evidence that most art begins in an attempt to heal a deep psychic wound. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200; through tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Markus Hansen: 'Other People's Feelings Are Also My Own' In high-definition video projections of pairs of photographs, Mr. Hansen, a Paris-based German artist, dresses like and adopts the facial expression of the man, woman or child in the picture next to his. Whatever his project means to say about modern identity, it is absorbing to study how closely he is able to match other people's feelings. Virgil de Voldere, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-9694; through tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark. GBE @ Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-5258; through tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Susie Rosmarin Proving that Op Art still is not dead, Ms. Rosmarin creates densely layered, gridded compositions of thin colored bands. The tautly frontal, vibrating patterns and pulsating spots of light engender a gripping retinal intensity. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; through tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>

Grand Chapiteau at Randall's Island. (800) 678-5440.</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' Opens May 1. This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'FAITH HEALER' Opens May 4. Ralph Fiennes, Cherry Jones and Ian McDiarmid make up the dream cast of this revival of Brian Friel's classic collection of Rashomon-like monologues about a man peddling salvation, his long-suffering wife and his manager (2:35). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>

        <p>'SHINING CITY' Opens May 9.

        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* 'AWAKE AND SING!' Dreams and disappointments, hopes and fears, encouraging words and bitter put-downs clash by day and night in Clifford Odets's turbulent comedy-drama about a Jewish family struggling to stay afloat in the 1930's. A gifted roster of performers -- including Mark Ruffalo, Lauren Ambrose, Zoë Wanamaker and Ben Gazzara -- manage to locate the dreaming centers of their characters, buried beneath layers of political sloganeering, everyday gripes or street slang. And even when the focus occasionally blurs in Bartlett Sher's ultimately moving revival, Odets's zesty dialogue, in which jazzy period colloquialisms are slung around like punches at a prize fight, is a joy to hear (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'FESTEN' An intensely staged, indifferently acted production of David Eldridge's adaptation of a 1998 Danish film about a grim family reunion, which was a big hit in London under the same director, Rufus Norris. While the mise en scène remains unsettlingly stark, the Broadway cast (which includes Michael Hayden, Julianna Margulies, Jeremy Sisto and Ali MacGraw) registers the tension and testiness of people suffering from a collective bad hair day. Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN'  (2:30). In this revival of Richard Greenberg's slender, elegant drama of family disconnectedness, Julia Roberts is stiff with self-consciousness, glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays and deeply, disturbingly beautiful. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to discern the virtues of the play itself in this wooden and splintered production, directed by Joe Mantello and also starring Paul Rudd and Bradley Cooper, who have little chance of capturing the audience's attention (2:30). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BASED ON A TOTALLY TRUE STORY' A chatty, autobiographical comedy by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa about a writer for comic books who moonlights as a screenwriter and playwright. Juggling his two jobs, the busy writer begins backsliding in his unofficial third, ''being a loving, giving, emotionally available boyfriend.'' Minor-key angst ensues in this perky two hours of comic navel-gazing (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality plays that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who re-tailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GUARDIANS'  Peter Morris's play juxtaposes the moral decline of two disparate characters caught up in the destructive tailwinds of the American invasion of Iraq: a cold-blooded tabloid journalist in London and a soldier in the United States Army. Lee Pace and Katherine Moennig give persuasive performances as the sleazy hack and the scapegoated grunt, but Mr. Morris's play is more flashily provocative than truly thoughtful (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY'  This terrific revival, directed by Michael Greif, identifies the unbearable wistfulness of being in John Guare's delirious heartbreaker of a comedy from 1977. The top-flight cast is led by Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott as sisters -- one living, one a singing ghost -- who move in and out of a lyrical and sordid world where tabloid prurience has become a religion. Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MACRUNE'S GUEVARA' The Young Mirror arm of Mirror Repertory revives John Spurling's odd 1969 play about an artist who left behind a wall full of drawings of Che Guevara and the man who saw something profound in them. Parts of the play read today like a funny sendup of art critics who see too much brilliance in outsider-art gibberish; other parts seem a bit like gibberish of their own (2:15). St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Góes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condoleezza Rice, is casual to the point of being offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SHOW PEOPLE'  Paul Weitz's eyebrow-pencil-thin comedy about a man who hires actors to impersonate his family feels like one long, occasionally amusing party game whose players don't know when to call it a night. The excellent four-member cast, led by Debra Monk and directed by Peter Askin, finds charm and energy amid the vaporous bait-and-switch plot reversals (2:00). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'STUFF HAPPENS'  Daniel Sullivan's sharp, invigorating production of David Hare's journalistic drama about the road to war in Iraq is conducted on the modest scale of a town-hall meeting. The characters (who have names like Bush and Blair) seem less like destiny-shaping gods than the ego trippers in your office. If that means they're too close for comfort, then ''Stuff Happens'' is doing its job (2:50). The Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'TRYST' A suspense drama of a distinctly old-fashioned stamp about the romance between a handsome cad (Maxwell Caulfield) and a lonely spinster (Amelia Campbell). Will the wily predator seduce and abandon the mousy milliner? Karoline Leach's play springs a few twists that lack psychological credibility but keep the plot on the boil (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'CHAMPION' and 'THE STUTTERING PREACHER'  Two new one-act plays, one a well-drawn family drama and the other a brash and ribald romantic comedy, from the New Federal Theater and Black Spectrum Theater. Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200. (Hunka)</p>
        <p>'LITTLE WILLY' A slickly produced and paper-thin character study of Hitler's nephew, who moved to Long Island before World War II (1:05). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB'  David Calvitto is fun and scary as a television game-show host who turns sadistic, and Nancy Walsh and Bill Coelius are suitably airheaded as his contestants, but the play, by C. J. Hopkins, feels like a familiar comic skit that takes aim at an easy target (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) John Patrick Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions in the clash between the head of a parochial school and the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 307-4100.(Lawrence Van Gelder)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>'FAHRENHEIT 451'  A visceral version of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel, staged by the Godlight Theater Company. No, firefighters don't burn books these days, but still you end up saying, ''Dang, that man had vision'' (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'MEN OF CLAY' In a play that Jeff Cohen, the author, says is based on his father, four Jewish men gather to play tennis in early-1970's Baltimore and watch their way of life disappear. The play seems to want to generate nostalgia, but since these four are racist, sexist pigs, it's hard to wish them anything but ill (2:15). June Havoc Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 268-4444; closing Sunday.(Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'ON THE LINE' In a theater culture that is more likely to produce a play set in a well-heeled living room than on a factory floor, Joe Roland's unflinching portrait of a strike in New Jersey is a refreshing anomaly (1:30). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Zinoman)</p>
        <p>'THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE MASTER RACE' Bertolt Brecht's middle-period classic in a robust new translation by Binyamin Shalom and a spare and powerful production by the Roust Theater Company, directed by James Phillip Gates (2:45). Walkerspace, 46 Walker Street, between Church Street and Broadway, SoHo, (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Hunka)</p>

        <p>'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>* 'CURIOUS GEORGE' (G, 90 minutes) In a refreshing departure from the animal heroes of most recent children's movies, this Curious George doesn't rap, punch out bad guys or emit rapid-fire commentary on pop culture. George is all monkey -- a quality that will not only appeal to children, but also come as a great relief to parents who grew up with the classic stories by Margret and H. A. Rey. With top-drawer voice talent, including Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and Dick Van Dyke; original songs by Jack Johnson; and old-fashioned two-dimensional animation, ''Curious George'' is an unexpected delight. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'DON'T COME KNOCKING' (R, 122 minutes) The visually majestic but dramatically inert reunion of Sam Shepard (who stars) and the director Wim Wenders, 22 years after their auspicious collaboration on ''Paris, Texas,'' might be described as a magnificent ruin. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'KINKY BOOTS' (PG-13, 106 minutes) In this silly, quasi-inspirational British comedy, a staid shoe factory in Northern England avoids ruin by switching from the manufacture of men's dress shoes to that of thigh-high, stiletto-heeled boots worn by drag queens. The recipe for this feel-good movie, which cries out to be made into a musical, comes from the same cookbook that gave us ''The Full Monty.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>'LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO' (R, 93 minutes, in Spanish) Zoë (Bárbara Mori) is a gorgeous, vapid wife who longs for children, but her distant spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. Enter the rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose schedule is less regimented. Bubbling with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality, ''La Mujer de Mi Hermano'' is an overheated telenovela that considers procreation more important than honesty, and what we want more important than who we are. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'L'ENFANT (THE CHILD)' (R, 100 minutes, in French) The latest from the Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne involves a young thief (Jérémie Renier) who one day sells his newborn son for a fat envelope of cash. What interests the Dardennes -- what invests their work with such terrific urgency -- is not only how a man would sell a child as casually as a slab of beef, but also whether a man like this, having committed such a repellent offense, can find redemption. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LOOK BOTH WAYS' (PG-13, 100 minutes) Written and directed by the Australian animator Sarah Watt, ''Look Both Ways'' follows a group of disparate and desperate characters over the course of one of the most depressing weekends in movie history. The principal sufferers are Meryl (Justine Clarke), a morbid illustrator, and Nick (William McInnes), a terminally ill photographer, who discover that a mutual fixation on catastrophe can be quite the aphrodisiac. Bogged down by stylistic gimmickry, ''Look Both Ways'' aims for existential drama but succeeds only in reminding us that misery loves company. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN' (R, 110 minutes) This star-studded jigsaw puzzle of revenge and mistaken identity thinks that it's terribly smart, although it amounts to an empty, self-satisfied imitation of ''Pulp Fiction'' that reputable actors like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley can't salvage. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE' (R, 91 minutes) With the help of her charmingly enthusiastic star, Gretchen Mol, the director Mary Harron unwraps the great 1950's pinup queen Bettie Page, who for years was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'ON A CLEAR DAY' (PG-13, 99 minutes) Set in and around the dockyards of Glasgow, ''On a Clear Day'' follows Frank (the great Peter Mullan), a laid-off shipbuilder who decides to fix his life by swimming the English Channel. Despite a familiar crop of lovable eccentrics and a predictably inspirational thrust, the movie balances the sentimentality with excellent performances and a healthy dose of working-class vulnerability.(Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>'SCARY MOVIE 4' (PG-13, 83 minutes) This parasitic franchise is back to feed on last year's disposable distractions, proving, if nothing else, that there's a laugh or two left in ''Brokeback Mountain'' parodies and Viagra overdoses. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>'SHE'S THE MAN' (PG-13, 105 minutes) ''Twelfth Night'' is recast as a hysterically peppy romantic comedy about a she-jock penetrating the boys' soccer team. Because girls can do anything boys can do, although their ultimate ambition is to put on a nice dress and go steady with a stupid jock. (Lee)</p>
        <p>'SISTERS IN LAW' (No rating, 106 minutes, in English and pidgin) Grass-roots feminism thrives in a Cameroon village, thanks to the pair of warmhearted, tough-minded women of law profiled in this excellent verité documentary. (Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TAKE THE LEAD' (PG-13, 108 minutes) Hip-hop and ballroom dancing styles fuse in a South Bronx high school at which a dance teacher, Antonio Banderas, turns gawky ducklings into gliding swans. It's sloppy but mildly endearing. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'THE WILD' (G, 94 minutes) Filled with softness and texture, ''The Wild'' follows Samson the lion (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland) as he escapes from the zoo to rescue his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. With inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a pukka koala and William Shatner as a menacing wildebeest, the movie also finds time to explore the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>COMEDY FORTNIGHT (Through Wednesday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater's festival offers nightly screenings of ''Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,'' starring Rob Corddry of ''The Daily Show'' as a disgraced paintball champion, and two more ''Best of First Sundays: A Hilarious Retrospective'' programs of film shorts.

        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>THE ATARIS (Tuesday) The Ataris play pop-punk at its most suburban and apple-cheeked. They have been around since 1997, but their concerns haven't evolved much beyond those of the harmless skateboard rats next door. 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Laura Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOE BATAAN (Tonight) Since the 1970's, this keyboardist has been playing Latin soul that mixes mambo and jazzy R &amp; B. 9, BAMcafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; no cover. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DAN BERN, KAKI KING (Tomorrow) Dan Bern is a wry singer-songwriter. Like Loudon Wainwright III, he puts his bitterness in the foreground, usually in the service of a pointed joke with a lefty edge. Kaki King is a multifaceted guitarist whose style is grounded in driving yet intricate rhythms. 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BLACK EYED PEAS, FLIPSYDE, PUSSYCAT DOLLS (Tonight) The Black Eyed Peas make lightweight hip-hop that revolves around the brash sexiness of the singer Fergie. Flipsyde is a socially conscious rap crew that incorporates some alt-rock. The Pussycat Dolls, a burlesque crew turned hit dance-pop act, make enticingly sassy boasts about their man-stealing skills. 7:30, Theater at Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.50 to $54.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>MARSHALL CHAPMAN, JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight) The songwriter Marshall Chapman has been at it since 1973, and her songs, from ''Betty's Bein' Bad'' to ''Last Mango in Paris'' have been recorded by the likes of Crystal Gayle and Jimmy Buffet.

        <p>ELECTRIC SIX (Tuesday and Wednesday) Three years ago this Detroit garage band generated buzz with the smirking but rocking song ''Danger! High Voltage.'' Its latest album, ''Señor Smoke'' (Warner), never achieves dance-punk command, but the histrionic singer Dick Valentine and his boys know how to be manic. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703; $12. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BANNING EYRE WITH COUMBA SIDIBÉ (Tomorrow) The playing of the guitarist, author and African-music scholar Banning Eyre takes its cues from the fluid, nimble style of the West African guitarists who populate his CD ''In Griot Time.''

(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BELA FLECK &amp; THE FLECKTONES (Tonight) Bela Fleck, a banjoist, has moved far beyond bluegrass technique. His own tunes feature odd meters and tricky structures, though his band can make them sound briskly mechanical. He has also applied his technique to the classical repertory for one more kind of crossover. 11:30, B. B. King Blues Club &amp; Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>KIRK FRANKLIN (Tomorrow) Kirk Franklin is a preacher, not a singer, but that hasn't kept him from selling millions of albums. He leads a troupe that meshes P-Funk grooves with messages of uplift, putting hip-hop rhythms behind the old-fashioned gospel dynamics of wide-open belting and jubilant choir singing, updating the music without sacrificing it to slickness. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212) 632-4000; $37 to $65. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>GHAZAL (Tuesday) Kayhan Kalhor, who plays a spike fiddle, and Shujaat Husain Khan, who plays sitar, weave classical Persian and Indian styles into improvisatory jams.

He is joined on the bill by the jazzy DJ Premier and the smooth storyteller Slick Rick. 7 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $33. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GUSTER (Tonight) Guster, a band from Boston, has followed the Dave Matthews Band's playbook for building an audience: touring constantly and singing unabashedly earnest folk-rock songs about the painful uncertainties of friendship, love and growing up. 7, Hiro Ballroom, 366 West 17th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Pareles)</p>
        <p>SEU JORGE (Thursday) This Brazilian singer may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in the movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou'' and his role as Knockout Ned in ''City of God.''

(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>HUGH MASEKELA (Tuesday) The South African flugelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit ''Grazing in the Grass.'' For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. 8 and 10:30 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>VAN MORRISON (Monday) Van Morrison has flirted with country music before, but his latest album, ''Pay the Devil'' (Lost Highway), offers his slanted take on songs like Hank Williams's ''Your Cheatin' Heart'' and Rodney Crowell's ''Till I Gain Control Again.'' He's better at his own classic, agitated R &amp; B but can certainly work up a surly-cowboy pique. 7:30 p.m., Theater at Madison Square Garden, 3 (212) 307-7171; $79.50 and $149.50.(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tonight) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as bossa nova chill-out music. 9, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SCISSOR SISTERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) These performance-artist glam rockers have both a healthy sense of irony and pop chops.

(Sold out.) (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SECRET MACHINES (Wednesday) This psych-rock act harks back to both Led Zeppelin-style pummel and the ragtag explorations of the Flaming Lips, prizing epic live sound as much as headphone spaciousness. 9 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, ticketweb.com or (866) 468-7619. (Sold out.) (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SUPERSUCKERS (Thursday) The Supersuckers play amiable Satanist speed-metal patterned on Motorhead's ''Ace of Spades.'' 7 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 777-6800 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TAKING BACK SUNDAY (Tuesday) These Long Island screamo boys shout their romantic confessions over punk rock that's tinged with radio-friendly metal. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BEN TAYLOR (Tomorrow) The son of James Taylor and Carly Simon, Ben Taylor has his dad's voice, his mom's kookiness and his own Northeastern hippie affect. 10:45 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $13 in advance, $15 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TOOTS &amp; THE MAYTALS (Tonight) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand-new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $27.50. (Pareles)</p>

        <p>* KAREN AKERS (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) The regal cabaret singer and the brassy songs of Kander and Ebb that she is offering in her new show may not be an obvious fit. But Ms. Akers locates the heart inside the brass and sass. 9 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 11:30, Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; cover, $60, with a $20 minimum; $60 prix fixe dinner required on Thursdays and at the early shows tonight and tomorrow.

(Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Tomorrow and Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Sunday at 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)</p>
        <p>* MARY CLEERE HARAN  (Tonight and tomorrow, and Tuesday through Thursday) A wonderful no-frills singer with a sophisticated wit, Ms. Haran has a remarkable talent for simultaneously interpreting standards in the spirit in which they were written and looking at them through 21st-century eyes. 8:45 p.m., with additional shows tonight and tomorrow night at 10:45, Café Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $60 tonight and tomorrow; $50 Tuesday through Thursday.

        <p>JOÃO BOSCO (Tuesday through April 30) Known in his early career as a hit-making songwriter for the Brazilian songbird Elis Regina, Mr. Bosco has been a popular singer on his own merits for some 20 years. But he rarely performs outside Brazil, which gives this engagement the tinge of a noteworthy event. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHEL CAMILO TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) A percussive, often cathartic pianist, Mr. Camilo recently released a recording of Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' (Telarc) with a 95-piece symphony orchestra. His trio, with the bassist Charles Flores and the drummer Dafnis Prieto, can sometimes seem nearly as expansive. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RON CARTER /KARRIN ALLYSON (Through Sunday) Mr. Carter, an august and influential bassist, has had mixed success as a bandleader; his best efforts usually involve the articulate pianist Stephen Scott, who joins him in this quartet. Ms. Allyson comes bearing a new album, ''Footprints'' (Concord), which delves into Jon Hendricks-style vocalese; as on the album, she digs in here with a strong ensemble spearheaded by the pianist Bruce Barth. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Fluent and fiery hard bop, from a well-traveled saxophonist and a rhythm section that includes the sharp pianist Anthony Wonsey and the hard-driving drummer Louis Hayes. 8, 10 and 11:30 p..m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $30. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FREESTYLE JAZZ (Thursday) The avant-garde series formerly established at CBGB's Lounge now takes place every Thursday in a cozy side room adjoining an unassuming pub. This week's program offers three texture-minded trios, led by the trombonist Joe Fiedler, the trumpeter Roy Campbell Jr. and the multireedist Andrew Lamb. 8 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILL FRISELL QUINTET (Through Sunday, and Tuesday through April 30) On his latest Nonesuch releases -- ''East/West'' and ''Further East/Further West,'' both partly recorded at the Village Vanguard -- the guitarist Bill Frisell conjures a compelling hallucination of the American popular songbook, with Tony Scherr and Kenny Wollesen on bass and drums. The addition of the saxophonist Greg Tardy and the trumpeter Ron Miles alters the ensemble's chemistry as well as its size. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20; $25 on Fridays and Saturdays; with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MONCEF GENOUD (Tonight) Tunisian-born, Swiss-raised and blind from birth, Mr. Genoud applies an uncommon perspective to his acoustic piano playing, as he demonstrates on a strong new album, ''Aqua'' (Savoy). He performs here with a trio, his most comfortable setting. 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROBIN HOLCOMB (Tomorrow) Ms. Holcomb seeks out meditative spaces as both a pianist and a singer, and she softens her experimental urges with an enveloping sort of lyricism. For this rare unaccompanied performance, she revisits old pieces and introduces some new ones. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>DAVE KIKOSKI QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A well-rounded pianist in the modern mainstream, Mr. Kikoski often does his best work as an accompanist, which is only one reason to applaud this group's inclusion of the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake. 8 and 9:45, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAT MARTINO QUINTET (Through Sunday) The guitarist Pat Martino's new Blue Note album, ''Remember: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery,'' does exactly what it purports to do. And it works, because of the untroubled self-assurance of the emulation and the simple satisfaction of a hard-swinging band. 8 and 10 p.m., with an 11:30 show tonight and tomorrow night, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>RENÉ McLEAN (Tonight) Mr. McLean, a saxophonist, leads an acoustic quartet in memory of his father, the alto saxophone legend Jackie McLean, who died three weeks ago. 7, Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 620-5000, ext. 344, www.rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MYRA MELFORD (Tonight) Ms. Melford's solo piano playing is a study in subtle coloration and shifting grain, but it can also deliver the solid punch of the blues. 8:30 p.m., Location One, 20 Greene Street, between Canal and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 219-8242; cover, $15. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>FRANK MORGAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) Now in his 70's, the alto saxophonist Frank Morgan is one of the last survivors of the bebop era (and in his case, survivor is truly the appropriate term). He leads a sympathetic group consisting of John Hicks on piano, Curtis Lundy on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>MY EARS ARE BENT (Tuesday) This three-piece band, consisting of Ted Reichman on acoustic piano and electronics, Mary Halvorson on guitar and Ben Perowsky on drums, fashions an engrossingly layered chamber-music aesthetic that suggests more than a passing interest in independent rock. 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ROY NATHANSON (Wednesday) ''Sotto Voce'' (Aum Fidelity), the new recording by the saxophonist Roy Nathanson, makes full use of his unusual skills as a conceptualist and raconteur. All the members of his band double on vocals, occasionally suggesting a literate and subversive barbershop quartet; one of them, Napoleon Maddox, provides the beat-box percussion that hustles the music along. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; cover, $15, with a two-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tonight and Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is that rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Tonight she plays and sings in a group featuring Bill Frisell and Tony Scherr on guitars, and Peter Scherr on bass, as part of the ''Live From Home'' series at the Housing Works Bookstore; on Tuesday she plays with yet another guitarist, Adam Levy, along with the pianist Art Hirahara and the bassist Matt Penman. Tonight at 7:30, Housing Works Bookstore, 126 Crosby Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-3324, www.housingworks.org/usedbookcafe; cover, $20.

The setting is Town Hall, site of a pivotal concert in her early career. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824; $32.50 and $37.50.(Chinen)</p>
        <p>TIERNEY SUTTON /LOSTON HARRIS (Thursday through April 29) Ms. Sutton's clear, sweetly sonorous voice isn't inherently a jazz timbre, but she is irrefutably a jazz singer, as she has demonstrated on a number of recent engagements. She shares a bill with Mr. Harris, a singer and pianist with a style patterned after Nat King Cole. 7:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $40 to $130. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>TERRASSON-OKEGWO-PARKER TRIO (Tuesday through April 30) Throughout the latter half of the 1990's, the pianist Jacky Terrasson led one of jazz's fresher-sounding acoustic piano trios, distinguished not only by his fluid pianism but also by the resonant bass tone of Ugonna Okegwo and the pared-down percussive drive of Leon Parker. Regrouping here, the musicians present themselves as a collective, which could well have positive implications for the music. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with additional 11:30 shows next Friday and April 29, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25; $30 next Friday and April 29. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHARLES TOLLIVER'S MUSIC INC. CONTINUUM (Tomorrow) In the 1970's, Music Inc. was a heavy-gauge quartet designed to showcase the exertions of a blazing young trumpeter named Charles Tolliver. This reincarnation features Mr. Tolliver, whose recent re-emergence has been a welcome bit of news, and Cecil McBee, his original bassist; the continuum comes in the form of two youngbloods, the pianist Robert Glasper and the drummer E. J. Strickland. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766 ; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* RANDY WESTON AND THE GNAWA MASTER MUSICIANS OF MOROCCO (Tuesday) Mr. Weston, the leading practitioner of a distinctly African approach to jazz piano, has a history of serious collaboration with the Gnawa Master Musicians of Morocco. This free concert aims to capture the fire of a performance in Mr. Weston's native Brooklyn seven years ago, which has been issued on CD as ''Spirit! The Power of Music'' (Sunnyside). 7 p.m., World Financial Center Winter Garden, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 945-0505; free. (Chinen)</p>

        <p>Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Sunday) James Robinson's City Opera production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. Yunah Lee sings Mimi, Eric Fennell steps in as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black is Musetta, and Philip Torre sings Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tomorrow) On opening night at the New York City Opera, Kate Aldrich came through in the title role, capturing not only Carmen's devilish seductiveness but also her radical protofeminist pride in her own independence. Unfortunately, there was scant chemistry between her and Robert Breault as Don José. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>'DON GIOVANNI' (Tonight) The second cast will offer the season's final performance of Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Timothy Kuhn, new to the company this season, sings the title role; also making a debut on this stage is Claudia Waite, as Donna Anna. 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; sold out. (Anne Midgette).</p>
        <p>* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he accomplished this vividly. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko, the dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Tonight at 8, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $205 tickets remaining tonight, $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'LOHENGRIN' (Monday) While Wagner's sprawling opera is playing at the Met, the Alliance Players offer the New York premiere of ''Lohengrin'' by the Italian avant-gardist Salvatore Sciarrino. This one-act opera is entirely introspective, based on what the composer calls the ''invisible action'' unfolding inside Elsa's mind. In his music, Mr. Sciarrino often paints with the finest of brushes, hinting at deep emotion through compressed whispers and the rustling of wind. For adventurous listeners, his interiorized postscript to Wagner promises to be fascinating. 8 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100; $35. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>'MISS LONELYHEARTS' (Wednesday) Juilliard has done much commissioning to celebrate its centennial this year, including a new opera that's been in progress for some time. Lowell Liebermann's piece is based on Nathanael West's novella, with a libretto by J. D. McClatchy, who has written or helped write librettos for significant works -- Tobias Picker's ''Emmeline,'' Lorin Maazel's ''1984,'' Ned Rorem's ''Our Town'' and Elliot Goldenthal's ''Grendel'' (opening at the Los Angeles Opera next month). Andreas Delfs conducts. 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 769-7406; $20, $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette).</p>
        <p>* 'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) After five months' absence, Jonathan Miller's handsome production has returned to the line-up at the Met with an almost entirely new cast. The soprano Andrea Rost and the bass-baritone John Relyea are endearing as Susanna and Figaro. And the mezzo-soprano Alice Coote, in her first appearances at the Met, has been winning praise for her rich-voiced portrayal of the hormonal page boy Cherubino. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 remaining tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Thursday. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'SUSANNAH' (Tonight through Sunday) It's easy to poke fun at Carlisle Floyd's opera for its folksy score, run through with hymn tunes, square dances and Appalachian ditties. Yet the opera, more sophisticated than it appears, about a sensual young woman in rural Tennessee who inadvertently stirs up envy and desire among the townspeople, has been moving audiences since its premiere in 1956. The Dicapo Opera Theater presents a 50th-anniversary production, directed by Michael Capasso and conducted by Steven Osgood. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 4 p.m., 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438 ext. 10; $47.50. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Floria Tosca, opera's quintessential diva, is not a role for the fainthearted. Deborah Voigt, still searching for the perfect fit, role-wise, for her silvery voice, is taking it on at the Met for the first time. Franco Farina and James Morris can match her volume-wise if not with stylistic elegance. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow, $175 tickets remaining on Wednesday. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ALEXANDER STRING QUARTET (Tuesday and Wednesday) With lots of Beethoven under its collective belt, this San Francisco-based ensemble is no stranger to marathon performance cycles, and this coming week, it begins another lightning traversal, this time of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets. Tuesday's performance features Nos. 1, 2 and 3; Wednesday brings Nos. 4, 5 and 6. The five-concert series runs through May 1. 8 p.m., Baruch College Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-4085; $25. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>AXIOM (Tonight) Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this newly hatched new-music chamber ensemble in Takemitsu's ''Tree Line,'' Birtwistle's ''Tragoedia,'' Webern's ''Konzert'' (Op. 24) and Steve Reich's ''City Life.'' 8, Studio 309, Juilliard School, 60 Lincoln Center Plaza, (212) 769-7406; free. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>OLGA BORODINA and ILDAR ABDRAZAKOV (Tuesday) The creamy-voiced, languid Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina is one of the best we have today, although her gifts as a recitalist are mixed; the voice is beautiful, the presentation has been somewhat passive. Her husband, a bass, joins her for a program of Russian music, including songs and arias by Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and others. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC  (Tomorrow) Michael Christie, this orchestra's new music director, leads his charges in a program of symphonic pieces and songs celebrating contemporary urbanity, with the German cabaret star Ute Lemper as his soloist. Mr. Christie offers classic works by Bernstein, Gershwin, Copland, Eisler and Piazzolla, as well as more recent pieces by Heiner Goebbels, Kander and Ebb, and Chava Alberstein and Ms. Lemper's ''Ghosts of Berlin.'' 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $60; $10 for students. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Sunday and Tuesday) ''Discoveries and Masterworks'' is the name of this two-part program that combines staples of the repertory with less-known works. Sunday's program juxtaposes Schoenberg and Brahms, Kurtag and Schumann; Tuesday's, Brahms's Piano Quartet in G minor with Chausson and Boccherini. Sunday at 5, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788; $28 to $49. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* EMERSON STRING QUARTET (Thursday) Among the great composers of the 20th century, Shostakovich was the most inscrutable. But in his 15 string quartets he came closest to showing his hand. These works are like entries in a diary, and he never imagined that they would become as popular as they are today. The Emerson Quartet plays these seminal works compellingly and has recorded them complete. The quartet will perform them all, in chronological order, on five programs starting on Thursday. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $60. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* MIDORI (Tuesday) Is Midori maturing into an adventurous performer? Her hefty contemporary program -- Judith Weir's ''Music for 247 Strings,'' Isang Yun's Violin Sonata, Lutoslawski's Partita and works by Gyorgy Kurtag and Alexander Goehr -- suggests a willingness to leave the instant crowd pleasers behind and take some chances. Her longtime accompanist, Robert McDonald, is at the piano. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $48 to $54. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE (Monday) Joel Sachs leads his expert student ensemble in their final concert of season. The program, like many of Mr. Sachs's adventures, is international and far-flung, with works by Andrew Ford, from Australia; Ryan Francis, from the United States; Bernd Franke, from Germany; Jose Maceda, from the Philippines; and Milica Paranosic, from the former Yugoslavia. 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today and tomorrow) Mstislav Rostropovich approaches the music of Shostakovich with more authority and close personal knowledge than just about anyone. He returns to the Philharmonic to lead the composer's 10th Symphony and his gripping First Violin Concerto, with Maxim Vengerov as soloist. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $33 to $104. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>'POCKET CONCERTOS' (Tomorrow) It's one thing to commission a new concerto; it's another to commission 12 of them. This weekend, Miller Theater introduces the first concert in a three-year project conceived to create works for soloists and sinfonietta by some of the theater's favorite composers. Two of the concertos on this first program are for piano -- John Musto will perform his own, and Ichizo Okashiro's will be played by his sister, Chitose -- one is for accordion, by Julia Wolfe; and Benedict Mason has written a double concerto for bass and tuba. George Steel, who runs the theater and conceived the project, conducts. 8 p.m., Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799; $25. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>CHARLES ROSEN (Sunday) Not many pianists can give their own preconcert lecture with the erudition that Charles Rosen will very likely muster as he concludes his series on ''Mozart Within History.'' The theme of this third installment is Mozart's influence on later generations of Romantic composers. The talk begins at 1:30 p.m., followed by the recital at 3 p.m., with works by Mozart, Schubert, Chopin and Liszt. Fred Sherry (cello) and David Bowlin (violin) join along the way. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500; $35. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>* VOICES OF ASCENSION (Wednesday) This superb church choir, led by Dennis Keene, goes ecumenical in a program devoted to Hebrew sacred settings, namely Bernstein's ''Chichester Psalms'' and Ernest Bloch's ''Avodath Hakodesh,'' a setting of the Sabbath morning service. 8 p.m., Church of the Ascension, Fifth Avenue at 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 358-1469; $10 to $45.

        <p>MARTHA GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY (Today and Tuesday) The big event in the company's slightly threadbare 80th-anniversary season came earlier this week, but ancillary activities continue.

        <p>HEDWIG DANCES (Thursday) From Chicago, this august modern-dance troupe will perform work by Jan Bartoszek (the company's artistic director), Jan Eckert and Maray Gutierrez that has been inspired by themes ranging from Goya's ''Caprichos'' to the intimate rules of the bath.

This megahip take on things Greek will offer Deborah Harry (a k a Blondie) singing live songs as Athena, and Rasta Thomas as Achilles, originally performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov in the piece's out-of-town White Oak Dance Project premiere in 2002. The cast also includes Katherine Crockett from the Graham company. Arto Lindsay did the score. Thursday through April 29 and May 2 through 6, 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, ext. 11, or thekitchen.org; $20. (Rockwell)</p>

(Rockwell)</p>
        <p>SYMPHONY SPACE DANCE SAMPLER (Tomorrow) What looks like a roster of hundreds of dance companies and individuals in all styles, some hot and some not, will perform in this 12-hour marathon. 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10 per three-hour segment. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* American Folk Art Museum: 'WHITE ON WHITE (AND A LITTLE GRAY): FEMALE RESPONSES TO THE CLASSICAL IDEAL IN AMERICAN DECORATIVE ARTS,' through Sept. 17. The importance of neo-Classicism to early American architecture, silver and fine furniture is not exactly news. This small, beautiful show follows its spread into more personal corners of visual culture: often exquisite, strikingly dimensional white-work bedcovers; luminously grisaille, sometimes wacky marble-dust drawings; and print-work embroidery mourning pictures. Few exhibitions this size (35 pieces) present quite such a vivid and rewarding picture of artistic assimilation and transformation. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 13. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>* FRICK COLLECTION: 'GOYA's LAST WORKS,' through May 14. This compact show is sublime. The most humane portraits are mixed with sketches, like diary entries, in which society is an irredeemable mob of lunatics and murderers. In exile in Bordeaux, Goya spent his last days in physical misery, lamenting man's essential evil while experimenting with the new medium of lithography and inventing the most exquisite, luminous paintings on tiny chips of ivory. Like the late works of Titian or Rembrandt, Goya's late works achieve a whole new level of freedom and depth, haunted by death but exalted. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>* The Museum of Modern Art: 'Without Boundary: Seventeen Ways of Looking,' through May 22. This excellent group show considers what ''Islamic'' means in the work of several contemporary artists, and it means many things, none simple. Just to see the uses made of calligraphy by Shirazeh Houshiary, Rachid Koraichi and Shirin Neshat is to understand the lesson in variety put forward here. At the same time, the show is far from didactic. It's beautiful, sexy and, in the case of Raqib Shaw's painting and Kutlug Ataman's video of Sufi meditation, ecstatic. (See above.) (Cotter)</p>
        <p>National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through May 1. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter)</p>
        <p>* The Studio Museum In harlem: 'Energy/Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction, 1964-1980,' through July 2. During one of the most radical periods in 20th-century American politics, the Black Power era, a group of African-American artists was working in one of the most radical forms of 20th-century art, abstraction. This show is stylishly installed (one gallery bursts with color, another has a cool platinum shimmer); the 15 artists are intensely individualistic and part of an important history. One, the sculptor Tom Lloyd (1921-96), opened the Studio Museum with a solo show in 1968. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* ECHOES FROM THE STEPPES: MONGOLIAN 17TH-, 18TH- AND 19TH-CENTURY BRONZES AND PAINTINGS The bronzes represent the four styles of Mongolian religious sculpture, but the main event is the 77 sakhuis paintings -- small, finely wrought, richly colored portraits of Buddhist priests and protective or wrathful deities that the nomadic Mongols wore, framed in silver, as amulets. E. &amp; J. Frankel, 1040 Madison Avenue, at 79th Street, (212) 879-5733, through May 6. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab where he was working. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>'When Artists Say We' This timely sociological experiment of a show features 17 artists or artist groups who were invited to create wall-diagrams or mini-exhibitions reflecting on the social networks out of which contemporary art emerges. Artists Space, 38 Green Street, (212) 226-3970, through April 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>'B-Side' This engaging group show includes Tim Spelios's beautifully made Surrealistic drum set in which the components are square rather than round; Matt Freedman's life-size sculpture of a boy with a lion's teeth and elephant eyes; Mary Carlson's crocheted works, resembling splats of blood on the wall; Joyce Pensato's expressionistically painted clown face; Judith Page's ghoulish and viscous small portraits; Meredith Allen's funny and scary photographs of dogs; and a painting by Jim Torok that declares: ''You have no worries. Things are going well. Don't wake up.'' Sarah Bowen, 210 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4517, through April 30. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Françoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through Oct. 16. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>PETER BEGLEY Parisian esprit enlivens Peter Begley's latest multipanel paintings. Their motif is the cornice: a ubiquitous emblem of Baron Haussmann's grand boulevards, which, abstracted and made delicately ornate, permits Mr. Begley to add illusory depth to his usual richly worked, waxy fields of warm color. Partly the filigree, partly the gentle rapture with his recently adopted city give to these new works a bit of the élan of old Raoul Dufy. Salander-OReilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606; through tomorrow. (Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>'JANE FREILICHER: NEAR THE SEA: PAINTINGS 1958-63 The beautifully relaxed, nearly abstract paintings that were Jane Freilicher's initial response to the vistas of eastern Long Island add a surprising piece to the unruly puzzle of late-1950's art and sharpen your sense of her ambition and achievement. Tibor de Nagy Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 262-5050; through tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>NAN GOLDIN: 'CHASING A GHOST' A riveting if flawed three-screen video projection titled ''Sisters, Saints &amp; Sibyls'' hauntingly details the trauma that drives Ms. Goldin's invasive, yet oddly solitary photographs, as well as her lifelong battle with addiction.Its unalloyed honesty offers extreme evidence that most art begins in an attempt to heal a deep psychic wound. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200; through tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Markus Hansen: 'Other People's Feelings Are Also My Own' In high-definition video projections of pairs of photographs, Mr. Hansen, a Paris-based German artist, dresses like and adopts the facial expression of the man, woman or child in the picture next to his. Whatever his project means to say about modern identity, it is absorbing to study how closely he is able to match other people's feelings. Virgil de Voldere, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 343-9694; through tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* MARK LECKeY: 'DRUNKEN BAKERS' This cinematically gifted British artist raises his game with a stop-action animation made by simply shooting a raunchy, well-drawn comic strip for adults in close-up, turning its speech balloons into spoken dialogue and adding realistic sound effects. Shown in an increasingly grubby white-on-white cube, the work is elegantly efficient, funny and dark. GBE @ Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-5258; through tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Susie Rosmarin Proving that Op Art still is not dead, Ms. Rosmarin creates densely layered, gridded compositions of thin colored bands. The tautly frontal, vibrating patterns and pulsating spots of light engender a gripping retinal intensity. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 223-2227; through tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>
