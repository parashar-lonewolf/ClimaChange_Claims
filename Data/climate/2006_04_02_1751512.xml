        <p>ON a traffic island bench in the middle of Broadway near West 112th Street, Gavin Schmidt sipped a cup of Oren's coffee -- milk, no sugar. Across the street from him, people shoved in and out of Tom's Restaurant, a crowd loitered around a chess game, and a gray-haired man wearing a flannel shirt and a lopsided green cap sketched the scene in a notebook.</p>
        <p>This traffic island is Dr. Schmidt's favorite place to drink coffee in the late afternoon. He is a climate modeler, meaning he uses physics to understand and make projections about the climate.

        <p>ON a traffic island bench in the middle of Broadway near West 112th Street, Gavin Schmidt sipped a cup of Oren's coffee -- milk, no sugar. Across the street from him, people shoved in and out of Tom's Restaurant, a crowd loitered around a chess game, and a gray-haired man wearing a flannel shirt and a lopsided green cap sketched the scene in a notebook.</p>
        <p>This traffic island is Dr. Schmidt's favorite place to drink coffee in the late afternoon. He is a climate modeler, meaning he uses physics to understand and make projections about the climate. But after a day in his office above the restaurant, he loves to sit back in this patch of Morningside Heights and try to make sense of the ebb and flow of the street, the city and the world.</p>
        <p>''The climate is like the city,'' he said as he gestured at the scene around him.</p>
        <p>The city is made up of millions of people making individual decisions: when to wake in the morning, what time to go to work, where to go on vacation. Yet many things about the city can be predicted. On weekdays, the subways will be more crowded at 8:30 a.m. than at midday. The government knows roughly how many jobs there will be next year.</p>
        <p>''It is the same thing with the climate,'' Dr. Schmidt said. ''We don't have to worry about every little detail of the weather to understand what is going on at the global scale, just like we don't have to worry about every person to understand how a city works.''</p>
        <p>Climate models put together a basic understanding of storms, clouds and weather, past, present and future. More often than not, these models match up well with observed data. As Dr. Schmidt put it: ''I think Albert Einstein once said, 'The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schmidt's demeanor melds the subtle elegance of an Oxford-educated Englishman (which he is) with the savvy of a street-smart New Yorker. Although born and raised in Britain, Dr. Schmidt, 38, moved to the Upper West Side a decade ago and has lived in the city ever since.</p>
        <p>''New York lets you be yourself,'' he said, ''and that is why I've stayed.''</p>
        <p>As usual, he was dressed in jeans, a colorful dress shirt and a black leather jacket. He speaks in a squeaky British accent (on the phone, a security guard once mistook him for a woman). His humor is dry and witty, and when he laughs, his bright hazel eyes become squinty.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schmidt runs a global climate model, called ModelE, out of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a part of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. ModelE is one of about a dozen global models that have been used to project the climate into the future. The results form the basis for international treaties on climate change, including the Kyoto Protocol, and for governmental stances regarding climate change across the world.</p>
        <p>ModelE breaks down climate into the basic laws of physics. The equations are written in Fortran, a computer language that is, as Dr. Schmidt puts it, ''very old and not very trendy.'' The computer code is 126,327 lines, to be exact, and when Dr. Schmidt scrolls through it on his computer screen, it looks like nothing so much as an extensive (and incomprehensible) grocery list.</p>
        <p>In his office, not long ago, Dr. Schmidt tried to translate a few lines:</p>
        <p>QNX=QMO2*BYAM(LMIN+1)</p>
        <p>QSATC=QSAT(TNX,LHX,PL(LMIN+1))</p>
        <p>DQ=MCLOUD*(QSAT-CQNX)/(1.+SLH*QSATC*DQSATDT(TNX,LHX))</p>
        <p>''These lines,'' he said, ''calculate how much water vapor condenses out of air to form a cloud as the temperature decreases.''</p>
        <p>ModelE suggests that the average temperature of the world is increasing.</p>
        <p>Such global warming may mean big changes for Dr. Schmidt's adopted city.</p>
        <p>''We don't have sea ice or polar bears to worry about,'' he said. ''But warmer winters and longer heat waves are reasonable conclusions.''</p>
        <p>A report by Cynthia Rosenzweig, one of Dr. Schmidt's colleagues at NASA, warns that in New York, global warming may cause ''dangerously hot summers, increased threats from mosquito-borne diseases, stressed water supplies and loss of beaches.''</p>
        <p>The biggest potential consequence of climate change in the city is flooding. Many entrances to the city's subways and tunnels, as well as the three major airports that serve the city, lie just a few feet above sea level. In 1938, a hurricane hit the city, and water filled a large chunk of Lower Manhattan. With sea levels expected to rise, future storms could be even more destructive.</p>
        <p>In other words, Dr. Schmidt said, ''Don't buy a basement property in Battery Park City.''</p>
        <p>BECAUSE so many people get their information about climate change from sources that sit on one side or the other of the global warming debate, Dr. Schmidt started a blog (www.realclimate.org) that provides context for climate stories in the news media. Since the blog was started in December 2004, it has helped nearly a million visitors navigate through the haze of politics surrounding climate change. But the blog has also generated strong criticism.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon in his small, cluttered office above the restaurant, Dr. Schmidt sat at his computer and read aloud one of the more heated messages: The quality of the postings on realclimate.org is disastrous. You're real losers, junk scientists, and you should be ashamed. I thought that you needed to be reminded of how bad your brainwashing procedures are.''</p>
        <p>''And that was from a string-theorist at Harvard,'' Dr. Schmidt said. ''Really, the hate mail is because I am a bad, atheist, environmentalist lefty.''</p>
        <p>He is quick to laugh at his spiteful mail, but he responds to most letters with patience and care. As a result, he says, some of his more agitated critics have become more reasonable over time. All the same, after a long day in the office, it is easy to understand why Dr. Schmidt likes to sit here on the traffic island in the late afternoon and just think.</p>
        <p>It was starting to get dark. The last spokes of sunlight had faded. Headlights and shop signs blinked on, peppering the street with dabs of color. Dr. Schmidt drained the dregs of his coffee and stood up. It was time to go.</p>
