        <p>LEAD: ''I'm basically an Irish storyteller,'' John O'Keefe explained. ''The single element unifying everything I've done is a strong sense of an oral tradition. I want to work a piece so that the audience can see it in their heads.''</p>

        <p>LEAD: ''I'm basically an Irish storyteller,'' John O'Keefe explained. ''The single element unifying everything I've done is a strong sense of an oral tradition. I want to work a piece so that the audience can see it in their heads.''</p>
        <p>''I'm basically an Irish storyteller,'' John O'Keefe explained. ''The single element unifying everything I've done is a strong sense of an oral tradition. I want to work a piece so that the audience can see it in their heads.''</p>
        <p>On Monday at the Second Stage, the 48-year-old San Francisco-based playwright began performances of ''Shimmer,'' a gripping autobiographical monologue that won critical acclaim when he first performed it in Manhattan in the winter at Performance Space 122. The one-man show has been revived by the Second Stage Theater, where it is to run through Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>To narrate this sharply detailed reminiscence of life at a juvenile-detention farm in the mid-1950's, Mr. O'Keefe wears a white T-shirt and overalls and effects a remarkable transformation from middle-aged playwright to scrappy adolescent. In the course of the 75-minute monologue, he slips in and out of at least a dozen different characterizations, from youthful inmates to grim custodians, all connected with the Tama County Juvenile Home, in Tama, Iowa.</p>
        <p>Spacey, the story's main character and the author's younger self, is a wide-eyed dreamer who has hatched an animistic personal philosophy in which elements in the natural world ''shimmer'' with portentous resonances. Shimmer and Synchronicity</p>
        <p>''The concept of 'shimmer' is that we've lost our ability to read signs from the universe,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. ''It might be that the wind moving through the trees at a specific moment tells you something about your relationship to someone or to the world. It's close to the Jungian concept of synchronicity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Keefe, who was born in Waterloo, Iowa, was first sent to live in juvenile homes at the age of 7 after his mother was declared unfit to care for him. For the next nine years, he was shuttled among eight foster homes, nine juvenile homes and five orphanages in 20 states. The Tama County Juvenile Home was the last state institution to hold him. The end of the monologue tells how he and his best friend flee the farm to nearby Marshalltown.</p>
        <p>'' 'Shimmer' is not strictly autobiographical,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. ''Though the characters themselves are real, the farm was a much more brutal place than I portray it.''</p>
        <p>The playwright looks back on his childhood with a surprising equanimity.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I was damaged by it,'' he said. ''I was always very healthy. From a very young age, I was a singer and performer. The arts kept things going for me and pulled me out from the mass of other kids who weren't as lucky.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Keefe recalled the moment when poetry entered his life.</p>
        <p>''It was in a juvenile home, and I was 15 but only in the sixth grade and could barely read or write,'' he said. ''A girl from Des Moines read a poem she had written before an assembly. I didn't realize that living people created poems, so I made one up and spoke it and won a lot of prizes. It catapulted me into a complete immersion into reading and writing, and within a year I was basically literate.'' A Playwriting Program</p>
        <p>Marshalltown turned out to be a significant theater community. At the local high school, he was plunged into theater work. Jean Seberg was a senior there when he was a freshman, and Mary Beth Hurt a junior when he was a senior. He attended Missouri State College and majored in music, but switched to philosophy and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Iowa, where he remained until 1971.</p>
        <p>In 1972, a playwriting program carried him to the Magic Theater in San Francisco, which produced five of his plays over the next 12 years. ''All Night Long,'' his surreal family drama, won the Bay Area Critics Award in 1983 for best play, and it was mounted by Second Stage in Manhattan in a production directed by Andre Gregory the next year. In San Francisco, Mr. O'Keefe helped found the Blake Street Hawkeyes, a theater-and-performance group whose best-known alumna is Whoopi Goldberg.</p>
        <p>''As a playwright, I still feel I'm in a process of apprenticeship,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. ''I don't feel you really get your chops until you're in your 50's and 60's. A fundamental goal of mine is to join the intuitive side of the theater with the sociological side.'' At the Serious Fun Festival</p>
        <p>On July 28 and 29, Mr. O'Keefe is to appear on a quadruple bill with the popular New York comedian Reno; Michael Peppe, a California performance artist, and Tom Cayler, a comedian and social commentator, at Lincoln Center's Serious Fun festival in a program called ''Oral Fixations.'' Though the piece he is to perform is another monologue, it is more fanciful than ''Shimmer'' and not at all confessional.</p>
        <p>''It's about a yuppie who is, in essence, attacked by a building,'' Mr.. O'Keefe said. ''There are five basic characters, and as usual I'm playing everybody. I imagine an environment where the acid rain has such a psychotic intensity that it can wash the ink out of money and melt your credit cards.''</p>
        <p>The Second Stage Theater is on Broadway at 76th Street. This weekend's performances of ''Shimmer'' are at 8 o'clock tonight and 7 and 9:30 P.M. tomorrow. Tickets are $22 for tonight's performance and tomorrow's early show and $18 for the late show tomorrow. Information: 873-6103.</p>
