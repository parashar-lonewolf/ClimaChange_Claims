        <p>EIGHTY years ago, the wilderness in and around Yosemite National Park was rife with the trilling, croaking songs of frogs and toads, but no longer, according to a new study.</p>
        <p>In what researchers say is the first documentation of a large-scale collapse  of an entire community of frog species, biologists have found that all seven native species of frogs and toads in the Yosemite region have declined since early in the century. Three of the species have disappeared from the still largely pristine study area.</p>
        <p>By comparing a recent survey of frog and toad species with one done in 1915, researchers were able to provide the kind of long-term data scientists have been saying are needed in the study of amphibian die-offs. For while many researchers are documenting declines of frogs and toads around the world, most focus on one  or a few species with data spanning 20 years at best, leaving some to question whether the drops in numbers seen are simply harmless short-term fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Researchers say the new study, published in the current issue of the journal  Conservation Biology, provides some of the best evidence that the declines are a long-term problem.</p>
        <p>"I was really very impressed by the study," said Dr. Martha Crump, a behavioral ecologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, suggesting that the new paper would convince the last remaining skeptics. "It's such a large fauna declining over such a large area. That's what makes this a really important study."</p>
        <p>Dr. Ronald Heyer, chairman of the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force  and a researcher at the Smithsonian Institution, said: "It's kind of chilling in its effect. Here we have what we consider to be a relatively protected place, and amphibian declines are occurring even there."</p>
        <p>The researchers, Charles Drost, who was a zoologist with the National Park Service at the time of this research and is now with the National Biological Service, and Dr. Gary Fellers, an ecologist with the National Biological Service, took advantage of a survey done in 1915 by some of the country's leading zoologists.</p>
        <p>In the earlier survey, led by Dr. Joseph Grinnell and Dr. Tracy Storer, a team of eight scientists surveyed numerous animals, including the frogs and toads, at sites along a transect 90 miles long passing through Yosemite National Park. In addition to having that team's published survey, Mr. Drost and Dr. Fellers were able to lay hands on the researchers' original field notes and photographs, enabling them to resurvey the original field sites.</p>
        <p>In the 1992 study, however, researchers focused entirely on frogs and toads.  Instead of simply scanning for adults, as the 1915 team did, Mr. Drost and Dr. Fellers also listened for songs, waded into pools and used nets to gather tadpoles for identification in the field. They also searched new sites to document more thoroughly the abundances of species in the area.</p>
        <p>Despite their efforts, the two consistently turned up far fewer frogs and toads than did their predecessors. Three species, the red-legged frog, the foothill yellow-legged frog and the great basin spadefoot, were not found at any of the original or new sites searched.</p>
        <p>In 1915, the western toad was described as "exceedingly abundant" at six sites, but researchers found only a single live adult and a small group of tadpoles at just one of the original survey sites. The mountain yellow-legged frog, described in 1915 as the most abundant amphibian at high elevations, had nearly disappeared; the researchers found only a single adult and a single tadpole in their survey of the 14 original sites. The Yosemite toad had declined or disappeared at 9 of the 13 original sites. Even the Pacific treefrog, a species that is doing well in many other parts of its range, had declined at nearly all of its high-elevation sites.</p>
        <p>The only species that was doing better in 1992 was the one non-native species, the bullfrog, which was introduced to the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1800's from the eastern and central part of the country.</p>
        <p>The declines occurred not only across a wide range of species and in a large  area but over a wide variety of habitats. Woodlands, alpine tundra and high desert are included in the study transect, a series of scattered sites running from Snelling, Calif., in the foothills, then east into the Sierra Nevada in Yosemite National Park and onward to Mono Lake.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephen Corn, a zoologist at the National Biological Service in Fort Collins, Colo., said researchers in other national parks were also finding decreases in the numbers of frogs and toads, though none so drastic or widespread.</p>
        <p>"The idea is here is a national park and we've got really major declines of what used to be common species," Dr. Corn said. "I think the National Park Service needs to be pretty concerned that things like this are happening." He said similar surveys had been recently finished or were ongoing in Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Glacier, Mount Rainier and Olympic National  Parks.</p>
        <p>In the search for causes of the declines, researchers quickly ruled out habitat destruction. "You can't find a place on earth that's entirely pristine," Mr. Drost said, "but by and large, this is about as pristine an area as you can find in the lower 48 United States." Mr. Drost said the field sites still look essentially as they did in the 1915 photos.</p>
        <p>Researchers also ruled out drought as a cause of the drastically lower numbers of frogs and toads, saying both surveys had been done after lengthy dry  periods. They said acid rain was also unlikely to be a primary cause as acidification does not appear to have played a role in population declines in other studies in the Sierra Nevada.</p>
        <p>Fish, however, have apparently played a role. Before people began stocking trout heavily in the lakes and streams in the Yosemite area in the 1920's, no fish were present at elevations above 4,000 feet. Researchers on the 1915 survey noted that in the few places where fish had been introduced, frogs were essentially absent. The introduced trout eat eggs, tadpoles and adult frogs.</p>
        <p>But researchers say fish cannot be assigned all the blame. Some of the declining species breed in bodies of water too small to support fish, and toads  carry toxins that keep them safe from fish predation. In addition, Dr. Fellers has field notes from his youth indicating that from the mid-60's to late 60's, long after fish had been introduced, frogs and toads were still very abundant in the area.</p>
        <p>The other causes of the declines are unclear. The culprits might include chemical pollution, disease and increasing ultraviolet light.</p>
        <p>Dr. Andrew Blaustein, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, echoed others in saying that researchers needed to consider not only multiple causes but interactions among those causes. He and colleagues have already shown that ultraviolet light can interact with disease, and others have shown that it  can interact with acidification to promote amphibian declines.</p>
        <p>Unraveling the mystery will require the continued monitoring of declines in process, but scientists may find that difficult, as the group charged with worldwide record-keeping is itself in danger of extinction. Dr. Heyer said the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force would run out of money by August and  had so far been unable to find new financing for its work.</p>
