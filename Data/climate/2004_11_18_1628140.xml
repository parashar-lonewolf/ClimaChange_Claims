        <p>Two top Canadian ministers said Wednesday that they had resolved to cut global-warming emissions of cars and trucks sold in Canada by 25 percent by the end of the decade.</p>
        <p>The commitment means that the auto industry faces steep cuts in greenhouse gases in Canada as well as in California and the Northeastern United States, a geographic expanse that encompasses nearly one-third of the cars and trucks sold in North America.</p>
        <p>The Canadian ministers said they expected to conclude soon several years of negotiations with the auto industry over the government's 25 percent emissions reduction goal, and they made clear in an unusual joint interview Wednesday that they would not settle for a lower reduction number.</p>
        <p>''We're very clear where we want to go,'' said John Efford, Canada's natural resources minister. ''We are not backing off from our position. Are we going to say 10 percent is O.K.? Fifteen percent? No. Twenty-five percent is our goal and the auto industry clearly understands that.''</p>
        <p>St√©phane Dion, Canada's environment minister, said ''the fact that California has moved, the fact that some northern states like Maine and New York are saying that they are considering to take the same regulations as California, if you add Canada to that, it's a third of the market. I don't see why North America can't be a leader instead of a follower.''</p>
        <p>Seven Northeastern states follow California's air quality regulations, and in a meeting earlier this month representatives from those states indicated they were likely to follow California's new greenhouse gas regulation, adopted in September, which lays out a 30 percent emissions reduction by 2016.</p>
        <p>The California regulation still faces an almost certain legal challenge from the auto industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dion and Mr. Efford also met Wednesday with Fran Pavley, the California assemblywoman who sponsored that state's greenhouse gas regulation. Ms. Pavley brought a letter from a top official in Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration seeking to work cooperatively with Canada on the issue. Mr. Dion has said he planned to visit the state to further study its plan.</p>
        <p>''We can drive the market forces,'' said Ms. Pavley. ''We can leverage the market forces if California joins with some states in the United States and Canada, which will help encourage the automobile manufacturers.''</p>
        <p>Automakers strongly oppose the proposed curbs on greenhouse gas emissions because they would be forced to substantially improve the fuel economy of the cars and trucks they make.</p>
        <p>Mark Nantais, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, said a 25 percent emissions reduction would require a costly reinvention of Canada's vehicles in a very short time.</p>
        <p>''Basically, it means that roughly 95 percent of the passenger cars in Canada won't make the cut,'' he said. ''We've told the government that we don't think their intent was really to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a fashion that's not sustainable, or place an undue burden on one sector over another. We're hoping we'll have a reasoned approach on this.''</p>
        <p>Regulating greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane is a separate issue from regulating emissions of smog-forming particles that come from the tailpipe, which can be filtered by using a catalytic converter. No such device exists to filter carbon dioxide, so automakers will have to substantially improve fuel economy to cut those emissions.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists regard the California regulation as increasingly important after the re-election of President Bush, who has opposed greenhouse gas regulations, including the Kyoto agreement, a global pact aimed at cutting emissions. They also say that technologies like hybrid electric cars, including the Toyota Prius, are proof that the industry already has the technology to exceed the proposals.</p>
        <p>Because California's air quality rules predated those of the federal government, California is allowed under the Clean Air Act to set its own rules. Other states can either follow all of Washington's air rules or all of California's more stringent rules. Earlier this month, representatives of the seven Northeastern states that follow California's air regulations met.</p>
        <p>''The indication was that none planned to alter their adherence to the program,'' said Ken Colburn, the president of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, which hosted the meeting. The states that currently follow or plan to follow California's air rules are New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island.</p>
