        <p>Earlier this month, scientists spotted a patch of open ocean about a mile wide at the North Pole, where the ice is normally six to nine feet deep. This remarkable discovery followed close on the heels of a prediction from Norwegian scientists that the polar icecap could disappear, at least in summer, in 50 years. To most climatologists, the thinning of the sea ice is further proof of the warming of the earth's atmosphere, a potentially disruptive trend that hardly mainstream scientists now dispute.</p>
        <p>This is the sort of thing that Al Gore loves to talk about, but so far global warming has barely entered the presidential campaign. In fact, except for a three-day period when Mr. Gore talked about energy policy, environmental questions generally have been hidden behind big-ticket items like Social Security, taxes and national defense. But few issues are as vexing and contentious as those that touch on the relationship between people and nature -- issues like clean air, the degradation of the oceans and marine life, the preservation of open space and biodiversity, and climate change.</p>
        <p>The nation faces two broad environmental imperatives. The first is to continue the momentum of the last 30 years, a period when Congress moved legislatively to clean up the damage inflicted by the Industrial Revolution and to give environmental concerns equal weight with economic development. The second is to help the rest of the world grapple with problems that override national boundaries, like global warming and destruction of biodiversity.</p>
        <p>Domestically, the green revolution took wing under Richard Nixon, who presided over the creation of an astonishing body of environmental law. It accelerated under Jimmy Carter, and burst forward again under Bill Clinton, who is ending his term with a series of intricate regulatory moves designed to outfox a hostile Congress and add millions of acres of threatened wilderness to the public domain before he leaves office. But at no time could this progress be taken for granted. President Ronald Reagan's appointees did their best to thwart the will of Congress through inertia and lax enforcement. In 1995, the Gingrich Republicans came very close to rescinding some of the country's basic environmental protections.</p>
        <p>The attitude of the White House is decisive. Mr. Reagan's appointees undermined existing law because the president did not care. The Contract With America gang failed because Mr. Clinton did care. So it goes, throughout government. Whether the Army Corps of Engineers, which for decades loved to build dams and straighten out free-flowing rivers, serves or damages the environment depends on whom the president appoints as its civilian chief and whether he keeps an eye on it. Similarly, when the bureaucracy finally gets around to using its existing statutory authority to regulate industrial farmers who foul rivers with animal waste, it will be because some chief executive has ordered it to.</p>
        <p>The global issues are of course less amenable to Washington's influence, but these problems cannot begin to be solved without presidential involvement. Put simply, the less-developed world, including China, will not reduce emissions of the gases that contribute to global warming unless the industrialized nations do. The industrialized nations, meanwhile, cannot move forward without the active participation of the United States, the world's biggest producer of those gases. But Congress has refused to force industry to clean up emissions. Nor has it offered industry any incentives to do so.  Though Mr. Clinton helped negotiate the Kyoto agreement on global warming in 1997, he chose not to spend further political capital on the issue.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Gore has taken a more assertive approach than Gov. George W. Bush on all of these questions. Mr. Gore helped devise the administration's aggressive regulatory strategies under the clean air and water laws and fortified Mr. Clinton's resolve to oppose Republican efforts to weaken those laws. He can also be expected to continue Mr. Clinton's efforts to guard and expand the public lands. In Texas, Mr. Bush has pursued a cooperative approach emphasizing voluntary solutions to environmental problems, and has said that as president he would turn over ''significant'' authority to local governments. While he supports the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, he has criticized important administration initiatives on wilderness protection and has promised to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration.</p>
        <p>Global warming, of course, is Mr. Gore's signature environmental issue, and he is likely to give it a kind of prominence that Mr. Clinton did not. He has also unveiled an ambitious and fairly detailed menu of subsidies and market incentives aimed at helping industry achieve dramatic reductions in greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush agrees that global warming is a problem, but so far he has given no details of what he would do about it. The candidates' positions on warming reflect the overall pattern of the campaign to date on environmental matters. Mr. Bush has expressed general concern for these issues, and on Friday singled out the preservation of tropical forests as a priority in his diplomacy with Latin America. But Mr. Gore has outlined more detailed remedies and conveyed a more muscular attitude about enforcement.</p>
