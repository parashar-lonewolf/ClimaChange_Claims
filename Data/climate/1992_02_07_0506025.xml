        <p>CREATING free markets in Russia and other poor countries may do more to slow global warming than any measures that rich countries are likely to adopt in the 1990's, a World Bank study has found.</p>
        <p>The study is helping to forge a consensus among economists in advance of a 100-nation conference on global warning, scheduled for Rio de Janeiro in June. Third-world economic reform, not foreign aid for pollution-abatement programs, should be the top priority, they say.</p>
        <p>"To a large extent, environmental problems are the consequence of policies that are misguided on narrow economic grounds," said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist of the World Bank. "In the next decade or so, third-world countries should do things that are in their economic interest anyway," said William Cline, an economist at the Institute for International Economics.</p>
        <p>Energy subsidies, economists say, are a prime example of misguided policies with large environmental as well as economic costs.</p>
        <p>For years, many poor countries have been practically giving away oil, coal and natural gas to domestic buyers in hopes of fostering industry and keeping living costs low for urban workers.</p>
        <p>Eliminating energy subsidies would improve trade balances, shrink government budget deficits and reduce wasteful energy consumption. But it would also cut emissions of carbon, the substance whose buildup, scientists fear, could eventually destroy the ozone layer, resulting in higher average temperatures and harmful climate changes around the world.</p>
        <p>If Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union -- which accounted for two-thirds of the huge $232 billion in total world subsidies -- let fossil-fuel prices rise to the world market level, carbon emissions would decline roughly 6 percent globally, estimates Anwar Shah and Bjorn Larsen, both World Bank economists.</p>
        <p>And if all developing nations, including China, which accounts for about 20 percent of worldwide carbon emissions from coal use, eliminated their energy subsidies, the authors say, global carbon emissions would fall by 10 percent.</p>
        <p>To achieve that big a reduction in worldwide emissions, they say, the world's rich countries would have to adopt a $40-a-ton carbon tax or its equivalent. That kind of Draconian action is extremely unlikely in the near future. "Trying to tax the coal industry out of business is just not in the cards," said Thomas Schelling, a University of Maryland economist and the departing president of the American Economics Association.</p>
        <p>In any case, third-world countries are under extreme pressure to improve the performance of their economies.</p>
        <p>Mexico and Venezuela recently tripled subsidized domestic gasoline prices, steps that are likely to reduce urban air pollution even as they ease a major burden on government budgets.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 2, Russia quadrupled domestic fossil-fuel prices. "What they've already done will lead to a 10 percent decline in Soviet carbon emissions and a 2 percent reduction in global emissions," Mr. Shah said.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists play down the environmental signficance of economic reforms. "Freeing energy prices doesn't promptly produce energy savings because the infrastructure and technology aren't there," said Amory Lovins, director of research at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental research organization.</p>
        <p>But others agree with the economists. "Removing energy subsidies in the ex-Soviet Union would be a major contribution to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions," said Lester Brown, director of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group.</p>
        <p>As an indication of how powerful the effect of freeing prices might be, Mr. Brown points to the large impact of the lifting of fertilizer price controls in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980's. In three years, he said, Soviet fertilizer use plunged 28 percent and world use fell nearly 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, economists like Mr. Summers and Mr. Schelling think that economic development is, in itself, a powerful antidote to environmental degradation.</p>
        <p>A recent study by two Princeton University economists, Alan B. Krueger and Gene M. Grossman, supports that view. Based on a sample of several dozen countries, the economists conclude that pollution rises with each dollar of per capita gross domestic product up to $4,000. But as countries get richer, the study shows, per-capita pollution declines. The reasons: more efficient production methods, a shift toward cleaner industries and more effective government regulation.</p>
        <p>Russia and Mexico, as it happens, which have per capita incomes of about $4,000, may be among the countries right on that threshold.</p>
