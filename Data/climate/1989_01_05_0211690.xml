        <p>LEAD: The Energy Department estimated today that it could cost $53 billion to $92 billion to clean up radioactive and chemical pollution at plants used to manufacture nuclear bombs and at other military and civilian installations under the department's control.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department estimated today that it could cost $53 billion to $92 billion to clean up radioactive and chemical pollution at plants used to manufacture nuclear bombs and at other military and civilian installations under the department's control.</p>
        <p>It was the Government's first estimate of the full cleanup cost. The report expanded on an Energy Department study last July that said the cleanup of pollution caused just by production of nuclear weapons would cost $40 billion to $70 billion over the next 60 years.</p>
        <p>The figures released today do not include the cost of day-to-day compliance with the department's own internal safety and environmental policies. The report projected that cost at $1.8 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The new 40-page report was immediately criticized by Senator John Glenn, the lawmaker who requested the study. He said in a statement that ''it is clear'' the Energy Department study had underestimated the cleanup costs. Facing the Challenge</p>
        <p>The Ohio Democrat, who is chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said the department had a history of underestimating the costs of other projects.</p>
        <p>While criticizing the estimates cited in the report, Senator Glenn complimented the Energy Department for ''finally facing up to one of the most challenging and serious environmental, safety and health problems our nation now confronts.''</p>
        <p>The department has the responsibility of overseeing the complicated and extraordinarily expensive process of cleaning up the nation's nuclear bomb factories, which have been crippled by recently disclosed safety problems and management disputes, and other energy complexes across the country.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the department, Gail Bradshaw, disputed Senator Glenn's assertion that the department had underestimated cleanup costs. ''I think we've certainly made an attempt to reach the best estimates we can based on the best information we have,'' she said. #17 Plants are Involved The report last July studied the cost of controlling air, soil and water pollution at 17 plants that have been used to produce and test nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>That study found that the most expensive cleanups and maintenance programs would be required at the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash., where costs could reach $46.5 billion, and the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., where costs could be $9.3 billion.</p>
        <p>The new report, which was made public by Senator Glenn, went further by including cleanup costs at more than a dozen Federal energy laboratories, including the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island; two uranium enrichment sites, and at eight centers used to study or produce fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Senator Glenn said the ''acid test of our Government's commitment to cleaning up these facilities does not lie in this report but in the amount of money that is actually budgeted and spent for cleanup.'' Rhetoric Doesn't Count</p>
        <p>''Campaign rhetoric, promises and good intentions will not do the job,'' he said. ''The ball is now squarely in the court of the Reagan and Bush administrations.''</p>
        <p>Congressional officials say they have been told by the Energy Department that the Reagan Administration will request $1.3 billion in the budget it will submit to Congress Monday for maintenance and cleanup of energy installations.</p>
        <p>That budget request would not come close to the $1.8 billion that today's Energy Department report said would be required just for day-to-day compliance with departmental policies for safety and environmental protection. Sierra Club Disappointed</p>
        <p>''There's insufficient money in the Administration's budget request to manage these facilities, let alone begin a significant cleanup effort,'' said Shira Flax, Washington representative of the Sierra Club, an environmental organization. ''Good intentions do not substitute for political will.''</p>
        <p>Among the Energy Department units cited in today's report but not included in the July study were: the Ames Energy Research Laboratory at Ames, Iowa; the Argonne National Laboratory at Argonne, Ill.; the Continous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Newport News, Va., and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory at Batavia, Ill.</p>
        <p>Also included were the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute at Albuquerque, N.M.; the Laboratory for Energy-Related Health Research at Davis, Calif.; the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at Berkeley, Calif.; the Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, both at Oak Ridge, Tenn.; the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory at Princeton, N.J., and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California.</p>
