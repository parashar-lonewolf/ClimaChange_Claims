        <p>THE influence of El Nino, the quasi-periodic warming of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that is one of the world's most powerful weather makers, may be even more far-reaching and more responsible for the last decade's climatic extremes than has been thought.</p>
        <p>Warm sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific, and especially those associated with El Nino, are known to set off chains of atmospheric events that dictate the weather in many parts of the world, including North America. But it has generally been assumed that once the sea temperatures around the Equator return to normal, after one to three years, El Nino's influence is over.</p>
        <p>Now, a study based on satellite tracking of large-scale movements of warm ocean water initiated by El Nino in 1982-83, the strongest such event in this century, suggests that it may still be exercising its climatic powers. The study found that a characteristically large wave of eastward-moving warm water associated with the 1982-83 El Nino glanced off the American land mass and rebounded northwestward across the Pacific, carrying large amounts of heat with it and raising the temperatures of parts of the Pacific even today.</p>
        <p>The study, by Dr. Gregg A. Jacobs, an oceanographer at the Naval Research Laboratory at the Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Miss., and six colleagues, is reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Since the amount and location of warm water in the Pacific have much to do with the births and wanderings of storm systems, the finding could complicate the already daunting task of climatologists who are attempting to understand the causes of the last decade's unusual run of extreme weather around the world.</p>
        <p>"This is opening up a whole new can of worms," said Dr. Daniel J. Leathers, a climatologist at the University of Delaware in Newark who has studied the link between Pacific sea-surface temperatures and weather patterns in North America. The lingering effects of the 1982-83 warming caused by El Nino have been superimposed not only on two later and less intense El Ninos, in 1986-87 and 1991-93, but also on all other fluctuations in Pacific temperature in the last 11 years. El Nino appears every two to seven years. El Nino's Long Reach</p>
        <p>The oceans, and especially the Pacific, exert a powerful effect on world climate through the sheer mass transport of heat and the evaporation of water. The water vapor thus produced condenses to form storm clouds, releasing latent heat into the atmosphere in the process. This provides the atmosphere's largest single heat source, and the higher the ocean temperature in a given location, the greater the production of water vapor, clouds and atmospheric heat. The climate system's complex internal linkages, only partly understood by scientists, determine how the clouds and heat are distributed around the globe.</p>
        <p>In a vivid demonstration of El Nino's long reach, scientists reported last month that the comings and goings of the phenomenon are reliable predictors of rainfall and corn yields in southern Africa.</p>
        <p>El Nino starts when, through causes not well understood by scientists, prevailing easterly winds slacken at the Equator, allowing a broad but subtle wave of warm water from the western Pacific to flow eastward toward South America.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jacobs and his colleagues analyzed data from satellites that track these broad-scale oceanic waves. To their surprise, they found that the warm wave of 1982-83 in effect bounced off the American coasts and was propagated northwestward. Recently developed computer models of ocean waves confirmed the movement.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that the northwestward wave was of the same strength and extent as those seen in the tropics during El Nino events, and that it significantly raised sea-surface temperatures in the northwestern Pacific.</p>
        <p>"These changes may have influenced weather patterns over the North American continent during the past decade, and demonstrate that the oceanic effects of El Nino events can be extremely long-lived," the authors wrote in Nature. "Stated succinctly," they wrote, El Nino of 1982-83 "is not over: Its effects have moved from South America to the northwest across the Pacific Basin."</p>
        <p>North America, like much of the rest of the world, has experienced a striking run of extreme weather in the last decade. In just the last two years, there have been the cold summer in the Northeast in 1992, Hurricane Andrew, which struck South Florida in August of that year, the East Coast "storm of the century" in March 1993, the terrible flooding in the upper Midwest last summer, the persistent snows of the Northeast last winter and the Georgia floods and record-breaking summer temperatures of the Southwest this spring and summer.</p>
        <p>Scientists are at a loss to assign precise causes for all of this. Some suspect that global warming may play a role, though this has not been demonstrated. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which exerted a cooling effect on the planet by casting a sunlight-reflecting haze of sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere, is thought to have played a role in upsetting weather patterns, but, again, scientists have not pinned it down.</p>
        <p>El Nino, many climatologists believe, certainly has played a role, and the new findings add yet another problem for those seeking to understand how all these climatic factors interact to produce climatic changes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael J. McPhaden, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, in a Nature commentary, singled out the record-breaking rains and Mississippi-basin flooding of 1993 as having a possible connection to El Nino of 1982-83: "Was this flooding, the worst of the century in the central United States, a delayed effect of the strongest El Nino of the century?"</p>
        <p>The answer, he wrote, must await further studies, as must a broader description of the long-lived warm wave's climatic effects.</p>
        <p>Although some climatologists believe that what happens in the northern Pacific ocean has an important effect on climate in North America, others are skeptical. Many statistical studies have shown that events in the tropics "determine 70, 80, maybe even 90 percent" of climate in the United States, said Anthony Barnston, a senior analyst at the National Weather Service Climate Analysis Center at Camp Springs, Md.</p>
        <p>One big difficulty, Dr. Leathers said, "is that we still don't have a perfect handle on the relationship between events in the Pacific basin and weather" in the United States. It is likely to be a long time, he said, before scientists can even begin to say whether the persistent El Nino of 1982-83 was a cause of any of the last decade's unusual weather.</p>
        <p>But, he said, the new finding is "really a fascinating thing" that is "going to open up a lot of avenues of research on that possibility."</p>
