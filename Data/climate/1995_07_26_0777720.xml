        <p>THE pre-cut vegetables in plastic bags that are becoming popular in supermarket produce sections promise less drudgery, more flavor than canned or frozen alternatives, and plenty of vitamins.</p>
        <p>In most respects, they deliver. They may not be quite as nutritious as they seem, however.</p>
        <p>The Living Section purchased 14 packages of pre-cut vegetables and had them tested for their vitamin C contents and for bacteria, including those that can cause serious illness or even death.</p>
        <p>The good news is that while the total levels of bacteria were high in some of the products, there were no pathogens, the harmful bacteria that can cause illness. Nevertheless, these high levels could result in problems if the products are not kept chilled at all times and used quickly.</p>
        <p>The bad news is that the vitamin C levels were far below those that the packages promised.</p>
        <p>The market for pre-cut vegetables is exploding because people are constantly seeking ways to lighten the burden of cooking. The fastest-growing category of produce so far this year is the pre-cut vegetable, according to Information Resources Inc., a company in Chicago that monitors food sales.</p>
        <p>The Fresh-Cut Produce Association, a trade association that did not even exist a decade ago, says sales of prepared salads and coleslaw mixes were $89 million in 1989 and reached more than $600 million last year. Fresh-cut produce is expected to account for 25 percent of all produce five years from now, the association said.</p>
        <p>The pre-cut vegetables are more expensive than their whole, fresh counterparts: pre-cut red cabbage typically sells for $2.22 a pound, while a whole head of cabbage sells for $1.19 a pound.</p>
        <p>The processing is fairly simple. After they are cut, the vegetables are washed in a chlorine solution to kill harmful bacteria and rinsed in plain water (that's why many package labels say it is unnecessary to wash the contents again).</p>
        <p>Then the vegetables are put into packaging that has a controlled atmosphere, a technique long used by apple growers. The atmosphere inside the package is regulated by reducing the amount of oxygen and increasing the carbon dioxide, which slows down the process of decay. The processors usually allow 12 to 14 days from the time the vegetables are packaged to their use-by dates.  Certified Analytical Group of Plainview, L.I., tested 12 packages for The Living Section on their use-by dates and two after their use-by dates. It found high total levels of bacteria in 12 of the 14 packages, but none of the bacteria were harmful. Such high levels are not likely to exist in uncooked vegetables that have not been cut up.</p>
        <p>The high levels of harmless bacteria mean the contents must be handled with great care. If, for example, some form of protein, like grilled chicken, is combined with pre-cut vegetables, the resulting mixture should not be kept at room temperature for more than 20 minutes. High bacteria levels are an indication that harmful bacteria may also be present at low levels, and the combination of warm temperatures and protein could encourage those harmful bacteria to grow and cause food poisoning.</p>
        <p>The laboratory tested for three pathogens that can cause serious illness, even death: E. coli, shigella and listeria. None were found.</p>
        <p>While bacteria levels were not alarming, there was considerable deterioration in the vitamin C levels of most of the products. Vitamin C was selected for analysis because it is water soluble and likely to disappear over time. Vitamins (including vitamin A) that are oil soluble are not lost.</p>
        <p>For their nutritional labels, the food companies use the vitamin quantities provided by the Federal Government. The amount of vitamin C listed on the labels is the amount found in the uncut product. But over time, especially in cut-up food, the vitamin C dissipates.</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration was surprised by the results of The Living Section's tests.</p>
        <p>"Our guidelines say the nutrients on the nutrition label should be in the product throughout its shelf life," said F. Edward Scarbrough, director of the Office of Nutrition and Food Sciences at the Food and Drug Administration. So technically, the packages are in violation of the law.</p>
        <p>"We need to go back and take a look at this part of the market, because it is taking off," Dr. Scarbrough said.</p>
        <p>Most of the packages are stamped with a "best if used by" date. But in one store, a considerable number of the packages were a week beyond it, and in another, two weeks beyond. Of the 14 packages purchased, 2 were beyond the expiration date.</p>
        <p>The heightened interest in cut-up vegetables coincides with consumer perception of fresh vegetables as better tasting. "It's happening because the American consumer perceives fresh as better than processed," said Aaron Brody, the managing director of Rubbright-Brody Inc., in Eagan, Minn., a consulting company for the food and packaging industries.</p>
        <p>"Sure, it's expensive," Dr. Brody continued, "but so is precooked spaghetti, so is pizza home delivery -- and there's no waste."</p>
        <p>Pre-cut vegetables follow in a long line of convenience foods: frozen meals, carryout and partly prepared supermarket ingredients like marinated meats, and cut-up fruits and vegetables from the salad bar. The packaging has taken the salad bar one step further. The food industry has learned that one way to get shoppers back to cooking is to do most of the work for them, especially the time-consuming tasks of trimming and chopping.</p>
        <p>Twenty years ago, consumers were demanding that supermarkets take the plastic wrap off produce. They got their way and took advantage of the opportunity, choosing what was ready to eat and leaving behind the unripe, the overripe and the damaged.</p>
        <p>Now, shoppers have changed their minds: they want the vegetables wrapped up again. But only after they have been cut and chopped, washed and rinsed. But they should be able to trust that the nutrition information on the label reflects what's in the package.  How to Choose The Best Cuts</p>
        <p>CONSUMERS should check the use-by date on any package of cut-up vegetables and look carefully at the contents of the bag.  On some packages, it isn't easy to see the date; on others, there is no date. Products that do not carry a use-by date should not be purchased. The fresher the product, the higher the level of vitamin C. The same, of course, is true for fresh whole vegetables.</p>
        <p>Shoppers should also pay attention to the way the product is displayed.  Pre-cut food needs even more loving care and attention than fresh whole produce. Cold temperatures are essential to preserving its quality.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Fresh Produce Processors recommends that the packages be kept in refrigerated cases the way chilled fresh orange juice is, but markets do not always follow this advice. Only one of the five stores in New York City at which the pre-cut vegetables were purchased for The Living Section's test kept the packages refrigerated. In three of the other stores, they were kept with the regular produce; in the fourth, they were arranged near some ice, but not directly on it.  Bacteria Often High; Vitamin C Down</p>
        <p>IN testing 14 packages of pre-cut vegetables, Certified Analytical Group found that many had high, although not dangerous, levels of bacteria and significant losses of vitamin C.</p>
        <p>ANDY BOY BROCCOLI, CARROTS AND CAULIFLOWER MEDLEY claimed to have 70 percent of the required vitamin C, but it actually had 16 percent. Its total bacteria count, 350,000, was low.</p>
        <p>ANDY BOY SZECHUAN BROCCOLI claimed to have 60 percent of required vitamin C; it had 30 percent. Total bacteria count: 2.8 million (high).</p>
        <p>B &amp; W WATERCRESS claimed to have 22 percent of required vitamin C; it had 6 percent. Total bacteria count: 2.9 million (high).</p>
        <p>DOLE CAESAR SALAD claimed to have 4 percent of required vitamin C; it had 8 percent. Total bacteria count: 260,000 (low).</p>
        <p>Two packages of DOLE CLASSIC COLESLAW , which claimed to have 50 percent of the required vitamin C, were tested. One, tested on the use-by date, had 20 percent of the required vitamin C; the other, tested five days after the use-by date, had 13 percent. Total bacteria counts in both packages: 2.9 million (high).</p>
        <p>DOLE HERB RANCH claimed to have 8 percent of required vitamin C; it had 2 percent. Total bacteria count: 1.9 million (high).</p>
        <p>DOLE SHREDDED RED CABBAGE claimed to have 80 percent of required vitamin C; it actually had 33 percent. Total bacteria count: 2.9 million (high).</p>
        <p>TKO ORGANICS BABY ASIAN MIX claimed to have 20 percent of vitamin C; it had 13 percent. Total bacteria count: 2.3 million (high).</p>
        <p>TKO ORGANICS BABY SPRING MIX claimed to have 8 percent of required vitamin C; it had 2 percent. Total bacteria count: 2.1 million (high).</p>
        <p>VERDELLI SPINACH claimed to have 25 percent of vitamin C; it had 4 percent. Total bacteria count: 2.8 million (high).</p>
        <p>These three products had no nutrition information and, therefore, no claims for vitamin C:</p>
        <p>ANDY BOY GOURMET SALAD Total bacteria count: 1.2 million (high).</p>
        <p>GOURMET GREENS TENDER BABY LETTUCE Total bacteria count: 2.1 million (high).</p>
        <p>GRIMMWAY FARMS BABY CARROTS , which was tested 13 days after the use-by date, had a total bacteria count of 1.8 million (high). MARIAN BURROS</p>
