        <p>On the bad days, a milky twilight settles over the city at noon, tall buildings become ghostly shadows and people hurry along the streets with surgical masks covering their mouths and noses.</p>
        <p>Newspapers are filled with instructions: stay indoors, drink plenty of fluids, wash often, stop smoking.  There is a whiff of wood smoke in the sluggish air.</p>
        <p>Indeed, vast forest fires are burning out of control. But they are hundreds of miles away in the jungles of Indonesia, mostly on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
        <p>In one of the most widespread man-made disasters the region has known, smoke from the fires has  blanketed a broad swath of Southeast Asia this month. A choking haze is dimming the sun in Singapore, the Philippines, Brunei and southern Thailand as well as Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
        <p>Flights have been canceled around the region, the busy shipping lanes of the Strait of Malacca have been disrupted by low visibility, and millions of people are coughing and wheezing. It is impossible to say how many people have been made sick by the smoke; Indonesia has traced two deaths directly to it, however.</p>
        <p>The fires are mostly intentionally set. Hundreds of Indonesian and Malaysian companies -- mostly large agricultural concerns, and some with high-placed Government connections -- are using fire as a cheap and illegal means of land-clearing.</p>
        <p>What is happening in Southeast Asia is different in kind both from the smogs of an earlier time in the industrialized nations of the northern hemisphere and from the forest fires of North America, which seldom have much impact on big population centers. In the deliberate burning of rain forest, it resembles the land-clearing fires that have ravaged large portions of the Amazon, but the pall from those has affected mostly rural areas.</p>
        <p>In Malaysia and Indonesia, by contrast, urban pollution is combining with smoke from the forest fires and being compounded by yet a third element: El Nino, the powerful ocean current that from time to time upsets weather patterns around the world.</p>
        <p>El Nino has returned this year in one of its most intense incarnations of the 20th century, and one of its early effects has been a drought in Indonesia that experts expect to spread throughout the region, including Australia. Some scientists suggest that the dryness has made it more likely that spontaneously occurring wildfires might be heightening the misery in Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
        <p>Worst-hit so far is the Malaysian state of Sarawak, in northwestern Borneo, where a state of emergency has been declared and schools and businesses have closed as visibility has shrunk to arm's length. If the air does not clear soon, Government officials say they may begin evacuating some of the state's 1.9 million residents.</p>
        <p>In urban areas, the haze is a combination of smoke from the fires and emissions from factories and vehicles that have become an increasing problem as cities grow in this rapidly developing region.</p>
        <p>Even without the wildfires, Kuala Lumpur's air quality has been deteriorating as it modernizes, like that of other cities in the region including Bangkok and Jakarta.</p>
        <p>Gurmit Singh, who heads an environmental lobbying group here, said the current disaster is a reminder that unchecked development carries a cost. ''This has been getting worse and worse for more than 10 years, and this is the worst in memory,'' said Mr. Singh, coughing with what he said was a dry throat.</p>
        <p>The immediate problem is widespread illegal burning of vast tracts of jungle by agricultural development companies as a cheap way of clearing land. A secondary problem is created by fires set by slash-and-burn farmers, who often travel deep into virgin jungle along roads cut by loggers. The burning began with the onset of the dry season in June and by August Indonesia's neighbors began to feel its effects, as they have for the last half-dozen years.</p>
        <p>After the worst previous year, in 1994, Indonesia banned forest burning, but its new law has been largely ignored. Now both Indonesia and Malaysia are seeking to identify and prosecute more than 100 companies that are believed to be the worst offenders.</p>
        <p>Once they are started, the fires have proven remarkably difficult to bring under control, and President Suharto if Indonesia has tendered his ''most sincere apologies'' to his neighbors.</p>
        <p>An extended dry season caused by the warm ocean currents of El Nino has compounded the problem in several ways. It makes the fires easier to start and harder to put out. And it is delaying the onset -- perhaps for several months -- of the autumn monsoon rains that are the only sure way of dousing the wildfires. Indeed, officials say the hot weather is causing new fires in the peat bogs and barren tracts of logged land in Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
        <p>The sustained air pollution here in Malaysia is well beyond the experience of even the smoggiest cities in the United States, environmental officials here said.</p>
        <p>It is, instead, reminiscent of the soot-laden pea-soup fogs that London experienced up through the 1950's, when coal-burning was prevalent there. The worst of the smog seasons in Britain, in 1952, was blamed for 4,000 deaths, and prompted passage of a British Clean Air Act in 1956.</p>
        <p>A United States Government scientist familiar with the Malaysian situation said the smog-like haze there was not quite so deadly as the infamous killer fog of 1952, but that it nevertheless compared with some of the worst London fogs of that era. In any case, said the scientist, ''this is very bad.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, warnings are issued when the Pollution Standard Index -- a standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency that measures carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, dust, ash, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide -- rises above 100. Here in Kuala Lumpur, the index has hovered near 200 for weeks and has approached 300, a range that is considered ''very unhealthy,'' according to the Malaysian Government. In Sarawak the index climbed to 839 on Tuesday -- far above the level of 500, at which people are advised to stay inside with doors and windows closed.</p>
        <p>In Singapore the index reached a record level of 226 on Thursday. People there reported that opera-goers inside the air-conditioned Victoria Concert Hall that night could smell the thick smoke.</p>
        <p>''You get a headache and you feel very sleepy in class,'' said Khavita Kaur, a Malaysian high school student who wore a surgical mask below her white Islamic head scarf.  ''And you can smell the smoke when you breathe, and your eyes smart.''</p>
        <p>Indonesian television today quoted experts as saying that breathing the haze in badly affected areas was as dangerous as smoking 80 cigarettes a day.</p>
        <p>The persistent smog has begun to take a political toll here in a country already battered by an economic downturn. Reports about the haze have overshadowed newspaper accounts of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's denunciations of Western currency traders last week.</p>
        <p>And in an unusual public protest, 100 demonstrators marched in a central square of the capital on Sunday, chanting, ''Immediate action! Immediate action!''</p>
        <p>On the same day, Mr. Mahathir  announced that he was sending 1,200 firefighters to Indonesia to help battle the wildfires.</p>
        <p>For many people here, none of these measures is enough; their impulse is to flee.</p>
        <p>Shazman, a waiter who like many Malaysians uses only one name, said he had sent his two small children away from the smoggy city to live with their grandparents.</p>
        <p>And on weekends, he said, he escapes to the beach. But he conceded that this relief was an illusion.  The beaches are smoggy too.</p>
