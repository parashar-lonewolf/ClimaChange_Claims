        <p>For This Week: Caution when clearing out seasonal debris of leaves, twigs and weeds from under shrubbery. Too good a job exposes shallow roots of azaleas, rhododendrons, yews and other shrubs; leave some fallen leaves to decompose naturally as mulch. Check all outdoor wiring before fastening lights to the shrubbery.</p>
        <p>Swimming Pool</p>
        <p>Q. We do not use our swimming pool and unless it is kept clean, it is becoming an eyesore. Could it be made into a big water garden, a sort of lily pond with goldfish? D.S., Seattle, Wash.</p>
        <p>A.  No! A swimming pool is a swimming pool. A garden pool is a garden pool. The construction, maintenance and use of either is different and we do not believe that the one can be made into the other. Can the swimming pool be taken out and a smaller garden pool put in its place? There are many nurseries and books available for details on the construction, plants to grow and upkeep of garden pools. Humidity</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>Are there any house plants which affect humidity in the environment, either raise or lower it? S.S., Pawling, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. No. House plants need humidity and lack of it is one of the reasons why house plants fail to thrive. Most homes are dry and often there is need to plug in electric humidifiers especially where many plants are grown. This question may have been spawned by recent research done for NASA by a now-retired environmental engineer who reported that certain plants remove some pollutants from a room. However, the research did not include any studies on humidity. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air and with the aid of sunlight manufacture oxygen, which is released through plant pores called somata. Gardenia</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>When and how often should a gardenia plant be fed? I bought it at Easter and it was blooming, but it has not bloomed since. I keep it moist, in a bright not sunny location with a night temperature around 65 degrees. H.F.K., State College, Pa.</p>
        <p>A. A gardenia plant is not ever-blooming. If it flowered for the Easter season and if it is well taken care of for the rest of the year, it should bloom again at Easter time. This is the cycle that has been established. Fertilizer is not the answer; too much fertilizer often results in soil contamination, root burn and stimulation of leaf growth and sacrifice of bloom. Gardenia is not the easiest plant to grow. It thrives in a humid, sunny, cool atmosphere and requires acid soil. Most house plants are going into a rest period now and need little stimulation. Keep the gardenia cool -- 60 degrees at night is fine -- and keep the soil moist. Acid-type fertilizer can be applied in late winter to support the formation of flower buds and new growth. Mealybugs/Jade Plant</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I have two large jade plants that are taken outdoors every summer. They were infested with mealybugs but I got rid of them with a hose. But now that the plants are indoors again, I find one of them is infested again. The jade plant is too large to swab each mealybug with rubbing alcohol. What can we do? A.K., Williamsville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Touching individual mealybugs with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol is an onerous task indeed, but truly the best way to get rid of the insects. The deed will have to be repeated every few days to control unseen mealybugs, nymphs and hatchlings. If the mealybugs are not destroyed, the sticky sap they exude will ruin floors and carpets underneath the plants. Household sprays might be used as an alternative but check the label carefully as jade plants are susceptible to injury by certain spray ingredients.</p>
        <p>Address questions to Garden News, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Those of general interest will be published.</p>
