        <p>A soon-to-be- released government report shows a slight increase in the fuel economy of family vehicles in the 2000 model year. But the rise is mostly thanks to a loophole that gives carmakers extra mileage credit for vehicles that can run on ethanol, even though virtually no one uses that fuel.</p>
        <p>Ethanol is sold by only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal standards for average fuel economy.</p>

        <p>A soon-to-be- released government report shows a slight increase in the fuel economy of family vehicles in the 2000 model year. But the rise is mostly thanks to a loophole that gives carmakers extra mileage credit for vehicles that can run on ethanol, even though virtually no one uses that fuel.</p>
        <p>Ethanol is sold by only 108 of the nation's 178,000 service stations. Nonetheless, General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler are producing roughly 750,000 dual-fuel minivans, small pickup trucks and cars this year at an extra cost of up to $300 each. These vehicles are counted by the government as getting roughly triple the gas mileage that they actually achieve, allowing manufacturers to sell more full-sized sport utilities and pickups while still meeting federal standards for average fuel economy.</p>
        <p>The government report, produced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, calculated that the average fuel economy for all new family vehicles sold in the 2000 model year would be 24.7 miles per gallon, after including the special treatment of dual-fuel vehicles. That is up slightly from 24.5 in the 1999 model year and the same as in the 1998 model year, but still well below a peak of 26.2 miles per gallon in the 1987 model year.</p>
        <p>Without the benefit from the special treatment of ethanol, the overall number would be up very slightly from 1999, when many dual-fuel vehicles were also sold, and down from 1998, when automakers were just starting to build the dual-fuel vehicles.</p>
        <p>The growing popularity of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far less fuel efficient than cars has lowered the average fuel economy of the nation's vehicles in recent years. Automakers have made the big vehicles a bit more fuel efficient for this model year. But there are so many of them being sold that they have dragged down the average.</p>
        <p>Fuel economy has become a political issue again this year because of rising gasoline prices, the possibility of shortages of certain types of gasoline in the Midwest this summer and growing criticisms of large family vehicles by environmentalists and safety advocates.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination earlier this year, has used his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to order Congress's General Accounting Office to perform a broad review of American fuel-economy policies.</p>
        <p>At Senator McCain's request, the review is focused on the safety, environmental and energy conservation issues raised by the fuel-economy standards for sport utilities and other so-called light trucks -- standards that are more lenient than those applied to cars. Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Committee, said today that the report should be finished by August.</p>
        <p>The 12-year-old law that gives special treatment to automobiles that can burn ethanol or gasoline also requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to prepare an extensive report of the legislation's effectiveness by the end of the government's current fiscal year, on Sept. 30. The law will make the fuel-economy calculations for dual-fuel vehicles less favorable for automakers in 2004, and manufacturers have already begun lobbying for an extension of that deadline. An auto executive who insisted on anonymity said that the industry was counting on support for an extension of the law from the farm lobby and from politicians who might want to impress voters in Iowa, which holds the first presidential caucuses.</p>
        <p>Samuel Leonard, General Motors' policy director for fuel economy and air pollution, said the fuel-economy credits for dual-fuel vehicles were needed as an incentive for automakers to build vehicles that could burn ethanol, a type of alcohol made from corn, sugar cane or even waste paper. For many years, automakers refused to build vehicles for which alternative fuels were not available while the oil industry refused to distribute fuels that few vehicles could burn. The fuel-economy credits could break the standoff, Mr. Leonard said.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists have long been skeptical of ethanol, mainly because there have been conflicting studies on whether it takes more fossil fuels to grow corn and turn it into ethanol than would be burned by gasoline-powered vehicles. Oil companies do not like to sell ethanol because it is so corrosive that it cannot be shipped in steel pipelines, requiring costly trucks, barges, and rail cars instead, said John Felmy, the director of policy and statistics at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>There have also been predictions of a coming ethanol shortage. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed the elimination of a popular gasoline additive, MTBE, which accounts for almost 3 percent of the volume of gasoline, and the use of ethanol instead. The ethanol industry says it can increase production.</p>
        <p>The average fuel economy of new cars has inched up to 28.4 miles per gallon from 28.3 in the 1999 model year, the report said. But the average for light trucks -- sport utilities, pickup trucks and vans -- jumped to 21.2 miles per gallon from 20.7 a year earlier. Almost all of the automobiles being produced with the capacity to burn ethanol are minivans and small pickup trucks, like Ford Rangers with 3-liter engines and Dodge and Chrysler minivans with 3.3-liter engines, as automakers have struggled to comply with federal standards.</p>
        <p>Safety agency officials estimated that labeling vehicles as capable of burning ethanol or gasoline had allowed Ford and DaimlerChrysler to increase the calculated average fuel economy of their sport utility vehicles and other so-called light trucks by about 0.8 mile per gallon in the 2000 model year. The benefit for G.M. is 0.4 mile per gallon in the current model year. G.M. has indicated that it plans to step up production.</p>
        <p>The government's rules require each automaker to produce cars with a so-called corporate average fuel economy of at least 27.5 miles per gallon and light trucks with an average fuel economy of at least 20.7 miles per gallon. Gasoline prices have recently increased but over the last decade, adjusted for inflation, they have been among the lowest ever, and this has helped create demand for light trucks with poor gas mileage.</p>
        <p>Auto executives have called repeatedly for Congress to repeal the corporate average fuel economy rules (known as CAFE) and replace them with higher gasoline taxes, but there has been no enthusiasm in Washington for such a move. ''A philosophy of CAFE that doesn't have a corollary of fuel policy doesn't work,'' said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, in an interview earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The giant Ford Excursion sport utility vehicle and a growing number of full-size pickup trucks are not included in the fuel-economy averages at all, because they exceed the maximum weight that regulators set in the 1970's for consideration as a family vehicle. G.M. and Ford told regulators at the time that they could not envision selling family vehicles weighing as much as their current models do.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain's review and the safety agency's report on dual-fuel vehicles in September are unlikely to result in legislative action this year. The Republican majority in the House approved a transportation budget two weeks ago that for the sixth year in a row, bans the spending of federal money to revise federal fuel-economy rules. House Democrats organized an effort to remove the ban but then backed away from introducing the necessary amendment, fearing an election-year split between environmentalists, who favor stricter standards, and labor unions, which worry that American automakers depend on big gas guzzlers for their profits.</p>
        <p>The Senate is tentatively scheduled to vote in two weeks on a nonbinding resolution calling for an end to the ban. Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, a state with no auto assembly plants and high gasoline prices, said that he hoped to do better than last year, when the Senate defeated a similar resolution, 55 to 40.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced we'll get more votes than last year, and we've got a 50-50 chance of winning it,'' Senator Gorton said.</p>
