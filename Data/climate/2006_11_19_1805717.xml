        <p>SEAN ROCHA</p>
        <p>During his extensive travels, the writer Sean Rocha carries one lightweight (but essential) tool: Clairefontaine notebooks (far right). ''It's how French school kids learn how to write cursive, so it has super-super-small lines,'' he says. ''They're also stitch-bound, which means that no matter how much you bend them, the pages never fall out. I buy them in Paris by the dozen.'' For this issue, Rocha -- also a photographer who has visited Sarajevo, Madrid and Paris (center) for a recent project -- brought his notebooks along to Tunisia (Page 130), a country that has managed a relatively seamless merger of tradition and modernity. A former columnist for the Cairo Times, he is currently working on a novel.</p>

        <p>SEAN ROCHA</p>
        <p>During his extensive travels, the writer Sean Rocha carries one lightweight (but essential) tool: Clairefontaine notebooks (far right). ''It's how French school kids learn how to write cursive, so it has super-super-small lines,'' he says. ''They're also stitch-bound, which means that no matter how much you bend them, the pages never fall out. I buy them in Paris by the dozen.'' For this issue, Rocha -- also a photographer who has visited Sarajevo, Madrid and Paris (center) for a recent project -- brought his notebooks along to Tunisia (Page 130), a country that has managed a relatively seamless merger of tradition and modernity. A former columnist for the Cairo Times, he is currently working on a novel.</p>
        <p>MARK HEALY</p>
        <p>When Mark Healy went to the island of Vieques to report on the evolution of the Caribbean's best-kept secret (Page 136), he accidentally left behind one important thing at airport security: his headphones. On the beach, he says, ''There were two records I was looking forward to listening to -- the new Bob Dylan and the new M. Ward.'' A little absent-mindedness can be forgiven, though: Healy, a former editor at GQ, was busy preparing for his new gig as the editor in chief of Penthouse, which he started last month. So what's it like to take over the reins of the notorious men's magazine? ''I think people were a little surprised, but no one was appalled. At least not to my face.''</p>
        <p>MEGAN CAPONETTO</p>
        <p>The prop stylist Megan Caponetto knew early on that she wasn't like the other girls. ''I was the kid in the basement gluing rocks together,'' she says. And look where it's taken her. Working with steel, Caponetto built the 10-foot-tall T for this issue (Page 121), which she then transported to the Cook Inlet in Alaska to be photographed. Not that everything went smoothly. ''A gust of wind came by and blew it over, and it smashed. So I had to rebuild it.'' Caponetto has also designed sets for The New York Times Magazine, and her work has appeared in Men's Health and Best Life (far right).</p>
        <p>DARCY FREY</p>
        <p>At first glance, the life of a writer seems pretty charmed. Not so, protests Darcy Frey, who tackles the terrain of Tasmania on Page 122. ''I'm stuck at my desk all day long, and in fact that was one of the reasons why the story was so appealing,'' he says. ''It was a chance to reverse my daily life.'' Lately, Frey has also been escaping routine by reporting on an Arctic-based ornithologist for a new book on global warming. (Frey jokes that he hopes to publish before it's too late.) But even that did not prepare him for the challenges he encountered in Tasmania: ''It's such a convoluted, almost impenetrable landscape, that you need to get very large-scale topographic maps in order to navigate. They're wonderful to have and look back on.'' Frey's first book, ''The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams'' (Touchstone, 1994), was based on his National Magazine Award-winning 1993 article in Harper's Magazine.</p>
        <p>WALTER NIEDERMAYR</p>
        <p>Given his penchant for large, almost abstract images of landscapes, the Italian photographer Walter Niedermayr was a natural choice to shoot the Swiss mountain resort of St. Moritz. The striking results are on Page 154. Those hungry for more of Niedermayr's work (far right) should check out his monograph, ''TAV'' (Walther KÃ¶nig), which documents a temporary factory in Europe. He is also working with the architectural firm Sanaa on a show opening in February 2007 at the deSingel arts center in Antwerp, Belgium. For one considered a master of his medium, Niedermayr can be reticent when discussing the nature of photography. ''It can reveal the original subject,'' he says, ''but it can't claim to be the truth.''</p>
