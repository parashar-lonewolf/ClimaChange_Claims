        <p>At one of Washington's newest museums, the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences, science makes a fashion statement. In one of the most popular exhibits, visitors swab their cheek to get a cell sample, then perform a few simple steps that let them take home their very own DNA necklaces.</p>
        <p>But the Koshland has a more serious purpose, too: exploring scientific issues behind national public policy decisions. With huge plasma and LCD screens, computer-based interactive learning stations, and numerous models and maps, it offers a high-tech, hands-on look at global warming, DNA and criminal forensics. Unlike many science museums that aim their message at children, the Koshland takes an adult approach.</p>

        <p>At one of Washington's newest museums, the Marian Koshland Science Museum of the National Academy of Sciences, science makes a fashion statement. In one of the most popular exhibits, visitors swab their cheek to get a cell sample, then perform a few simple steps that let them take home their very own DNA necklaces.</p>
        <p>But the Koshland has a more serious purpose, too: exploring scientific issues behind national public policy decisions. With huge plasma and LCD screens, computer-based interactive learning stations, and numerous models and maps, it offers a high-tech, hands-on look at global warming, DNA and criminal forensics. Unlike many science museums that aim their message at children, the Koshland takes an adult approach.</p>
        <p>Since the museum opened in April, it has attracted more than 15,000 visitors, mainly between the ages of 22 and 45, said Patrice Legro, the museum's director, a demographic that she says reflects the sophistication of the exhibits. One such example is an interactive global climate map -- mobile plasma screens that glide across a timeline of the past century. The exhibit shows local temperature changes throughout the world since 1900 and extrapolates through 2100.</p>
        <p>On weekends, a varying schedule of demonstrations allows visitors to examine their own pores using a digital microscope, for example, or simulate the effects of burning fossil fuels just by breathing.</p>
        <p>The museum, at Sixth and E Streets NW near the National Mall, is open daily except Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with the last admission at 5 p.m.; admission, $5. Information: (888) 567-4526; www.koshland-science-museum.org.</p>
