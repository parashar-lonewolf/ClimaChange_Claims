        <p>Scent of a Violet</p>
        <p>Q.  The lawn at our house near Philadelphia is infested with purple violets, but our children like picking them so I do not really mind. My problem is that they have no fragrance. Is there something wrong with the soil?</p>
        <p>A.  It is the species, not the soil, that determines perfume. Your children's pet flowers are probably meadow violet, Viola papilionacea, a common weed in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, or the closely related dooryard violet, V. sororia. Neither is fragrant compared with the perfume champs: V. odorata, also known as English or sweet violet, and the Parma violet, which is unknown in the wild and probably a variety of the English kind.</p>

        <p>Scent of a Violet</p>
        <p>Q.  The lawn at our house near Philadelphia is infested with purple violets, but our children like picking them so I do not really mind. My problem is that they have no fragrance. Is there something wrong with the soil?</p>
        <p>A.  It is the species, not the soil, that determines perfume. Your children's pet flowers are probably meadow violet, Viola papilionacea, a common weed in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, or the closely related dooryard violet, V. sororia. Neither is fragrant compared with the perfume champs: V. odorata, also known as English or sweet violet, and the Parma violet, which is unknown in the wild and probably a variety of the English kind.</p>
        <p>Parma violets are double, intensely fragrant and quite large (as violets go), which has made them romantic favorites for more than a century. Regrettably, they cannot survive winters in the North unless they are inside a cool greenhouse.</p>
        <p>Odoratas are sturdier. Experts differ on exactly how sturdy, but you should be able to grow them near Philadelphia, which is in Zone 7, especially if you have a protected spot. The ideal location would be sheltered but sunny and thus relatively warm in winter, with strong sun in spring and protection from midsummer heat -- in other words, near a south-facing wall, under deciduous shrubs or trees.</p>
        <p>Odoratas with the strongest perfume include rich purple Lianne and deep pink Mme. Armandine Pages. You will get both great scent and long stems with the pale lavender-blue Princess of Wales, which was once the most commonly planted cutting violet, but be warned that it is vulnerable to spider mites.</p>
        <p>Parma violets and a large selection of odoratas are sold by Canyon Creek Nursery, (530) 533-2166 or www.canyoncreeknursery.com; odoratas are also sold by Perennial Pleasures Nursery, (802) 472-5104 or www.antiqueplants.com.</p>
        <p>Mulch Matters</p>
        <p>Q.  I garden on a terrace in Manhattan, using pots filled with a mixture of topsoil and vermiculite or perlite. After a few years, the soil gets very acidic and I have to add lime to correct it. Is this because I mulch every winter with pine bark chips or shreds? If so, is there an alternative?</p>
        <p>A.  You could mulch with shredded coconut fiber or (for a cutting-edge look) something synthetic like bubble wrap. But most of the acid is probably coming from acid rain and fertilizer residue. You can flush out a lot of it if you water copiously with distilled water, letting the pots drain, then water and drain again.</p>
        <p>Vermiculite can be alkaline, so using more of it may help add balance, but be careful not to use more than about one part in four. It holds more water than perlite does and can make soil soggy.</p>
        <p>Waiting for Gladioluses</p>
        <p>Q.  My garden is on the Rhode Island coast, and I am sure the soil won't freeze again. Can I plant gladioluses now, in order to get early blooms?</p>
        <p>A.  It is still too soon; warmth-loving plants like gladioluses tend to rot in cold, wet ground. And when they do not die, they sulk, growing so slowly you will not gain much by pushing the season.</p>
        <p>For the earliest flowers, wait another week or two, then start the plants indoors, each in its own small, deep pot. By the time the shoots pop up, the weather will be warm enough for them to enjoy the days outside, and by the time they need transplanting, the ground should be ready.</p>
