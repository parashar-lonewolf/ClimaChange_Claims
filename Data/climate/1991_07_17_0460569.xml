        <p>On the eve of their potentially pivotal meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the heads of the seven leading industrialized democracies voiced support today for his reform efforts, agreed to special status for Moscow in the International Monetary Fund and promised that their chairman would meet each year with the current Soviet leader.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Gorbachev arrived in London, reportedly with fresh economic proposals in his briefcase, Western leaders were still divided on just how far they were willing to go to help the Soviet Union, short of immediate large-scale infusions of cash, which they have all ruled out as impractical.</p>
        <p>The very fact of Mr. Gorbachev's coming in search of help from his erstwhile adversaries has made this a unique meeting, something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Moscow's Main Backer: Germany</p>
        <p>Germany, which has been the Soviet Union's main supporter during the summit conference here, kept pushing for more than technical aid.</p>
        <p>The Germans were backed by France and Italy, but others were less enthusiastic, and a senior British official said the United States was "behaving in a most obstinate way, making it hard to assemble a package."</p>
        <p>What has been agreed to so far, said Gianni De Michelis, the Italian Foreign Minister, "is not enough" to match so momentous an occasion. He insisted at a briefing tonight that "we must launch some new signal" of commitment to Soviet well-being and, by implication, to Mr. Gorbachev's political survival.  Few Specifics From Baker</p>
        <p>Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d responded that Mr. Gorbachev "will not leave empty-handed," but he offered few specifics other than promising expert advice and small grants from the West to help the Soviet Union reform its archaic food distribution system, attract investments in oil and gas and convert its defense industries to civilian use.</p>
        <p>In their annual political declaration, the seven leaders set out a number of proposals designed to foster "a peaceful, just, democratic and prosperous world." Most of the proposals grew out of the war in the Persian Gulf and reflected the successful use of the United Nations, once seemingly moribund, as a vehicle for joint international action.  [ Excerpts, page A10. ]</p>
        <p>The seven called for a stronger peacekeeping role for the United Nations as well as improved United Nations relief services and urged the establishment of an international register of arms sales, but stopped short of advocating even a temporary ban on such sales in troubled areas. The group also backed United States efforts to promote a Middle East peace conference and to insure that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq cannot develop nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>"We are going to make sure, one way or another, that Iraq does not become -- does not even create the danger of becoming -- a nuclear power," said Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, in presenting the group's declaration. Asked whether that meant his country would join the United States in military action if needed, he answered, "Yes, it does mean that."</p>
        <p>At their meeting this afternoon, the leaders took up environmental questions, with Prime Minister John Major of Britain pressing Mr. Bush hard to set targets for reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial pollution, which the President has so far been unwilling to do. Mr. Major also called, amid some skepticism, for all the leaders to agree to attend next year's United Nations summit conference on the environment.  Sparring Over Trade</p>
        <p>The seven nations -- France, Italy, Canada, Japan, Britain, Germany and the United States -- also continued to spar over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Negotiations to expand and strengthen GATT have been stalled for years, and no more than a plea for redoubled efforts to get an agreement in the next 12 months is likely to emerge from here.</p>
        <p>After the final formal session of the summit conference on Wednesday, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will sit down for lunch together, and American officials hope that they will be able to agree on a date for a superpower summit meeting in Moscow later this month or early in August. That will depend in part on whether Secretary of State Baker and Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, can find a way at their talks, also on Wednesday, to resolve the last technical issue barring a strategic arms reduction treaty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker cautioned that there was no guarantee that a deal could be concluded here this week.</p>
        <p>Praising Mr. Gorbachev's goals of political and economic change, the document issued by the seven leaders said, "Our support for the process of fundamental reform in the Soviet Union remains as strong as ever."</p>
        <p>In a 23-page letter sent last week to the conferees, Mr. Gorbachev said he was "pinning high hopes on the upcoming meeting in London." He said he feared that without Western aid, the bleak Soviet economic outlook could lead to "major social conflicts and pose a threat to democratic reform."  Gorbachev's Plans Criticized</p>
        <p>But the plans for introducing a market economy outlined in the letter have been criticized as too nebulous to justify Western aid by several of the governments represented here. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the co-author of a more ambitious reform program, said in Moscow that he had refused to accompany Mr. Gorbachev to protest what he termed the "imprecise nature" of the plans.</p>
        <p>Leonid M. Zamyatin, the Soviet Ambassador in London, said Mr. Gorbachev would "add many things" to his written text once he sat down for three hours of conversation with the seven leaders on Wednesday. The diplomat added, "He will answer their questions, and he will ask some of his own."</p>
        <p>Membership for Moscow in the International Monetary Fund, of a limited character still to be worked out, and access to larger loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were among the gestures to the Soviet Union that the leaders reportedly discussed in detail today. Dieter Vogel, the German spokesman, said that only the United States and Japan had argued against increasing the Soviet borrowing quota from the European bank.</p>
        <p>"There is still disagreement about how to follow up" with direct financial support, the German Finance Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said late this afternoon. The Germans want to set up a working group within the 24-nation Organization for European Cooperation and Development in Paris to coordinate support for the Soviet Union, but the United States opposes that on the grounds that it would create pressure for assistance before that was wise.  Dispute Over Fund Membership</p>
        <p>The United States was also reported by the Europeans to oppose promising the Soviet Union now that it would soon be given full membership in the monetary fund. With evident exasperation, Mr. De Michelis said tonight that he and his continental European colleagues could not understand why the United States insisted on denying full membership to the Soviet Union when "107 other countries already are in."</p>
        <p>In proposing a broader role for the United Nations, the seven leaders said the world organization "showed during the gulf crisis that it could fulfill its role of acting to restore international peace" and argued that "the international community must now build on this new spirit of cooperation not only in the Middle East, but wherever danger and conflict threaten."</p>
        <p>The conferees pledged themselves to make "preventive diplomacy a top priority" within the United Nations and urged the appointment of a high-level official at the organization to make its relief operations more effective.</p>
        <p>In the postwar Middle East, the seven nations declared, sanctions should be maintained against Iraq not only until it had met the terms of United Nations resolutions, but also until "the people of Iraq as well as their neighbors can live without fear of intimidation, repression or attack." That seemed to imply that the sanctions would last until President Hussein had been ousted.  Putting Pressure on Israel</p>
        <p>With Mr. Baker planning to return to the Middle East later this week on his fifth trip since the war ended, the leaders stepped up the pressure on Israel, urging it to join Syria in agreeing to peace talks. They also said that the Arab boycott of businesses trading with Israel should end and called for the end of Israeli settlements in occupied territories.</p>
        <p>The proposal for an international arms register was included in a separate statement, reflecting the difficulty in reaching agreement. France, which has historically resisted turning the Group of Seven into anything even vaguely bureaucratic or institutional, held out until Mr. Major agreed to drop any role for the group in setting up or monitoring the register. Instead, the group supported a United Nations register of all arms sales to "alert the international community to an attempt by a state to build up holdings of conventional weapons beyond a reasonable level." Another Iraq must be avoided, members said.</p>
        <p>But the problems with such a register would be numerous. Cheating would not be difficult for secretive and often duplicitous arms dealers, and no means of enforcing notification to the register were specified. Moreover, "a reasonable level" of armaments would be a highly subjective judgment. Argument Over the Environment</p>
        <p>Some of the hottest exchanges reported by officials present at the closed sessions today dealt with the environment. Mr. Bush has already come under attack in Britain from Michael Heseltine, the Environment Minister, for resisting stricter curbs on carbon dioxide emissions, and today Laurens Binkhorst, the European Commmunity's Director General for the Environment, said the United States, "which emits twice as much CO 2per capita as anyone except the Eastern European countries," needed to rethink its position in the next few months.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration, and especially John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, have expressed deep suspicions about the contention, accepted by the European governments, that carbon dioxide is the principal factor in causing global warming. Hoping to avoid being branded anti-environment, the United States has circulated brochures here listing its accomplishments in the last year.</p>
