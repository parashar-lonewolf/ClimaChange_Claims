        <p>America faces a crucial choice that will determine whether the Federal court system continues to serve its historic function or slowly deteriorates into a vast faceless bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Today in Washington, the long-range planning committee of the U.S. Judiciary Conference -- the policy-making arm of the Federal Judiciary -- will begin hearings on setting limits on the number of Federal judges. Ultimately, the decision will rest with Congress.</p>
        <p>The choice is between keeping the number of all Federal judges below the approaching total of 1,000 or permitting that total to grow to several thousand, as will inevitably occur piecemeal unless concerted action is taken to hold the system to its present size.</p>
        <p>Those who favor the limit of 1,000 have only one objective: to preserve for 21st century America an effective Federal judiciary that can perform its tasks.</p>
        <p>Why do some judges fear further growth? Certainly not, as some charge, to preserve our personal prestige. Our concern is for the fate of the Federal court system long after our careers and lives are over.</p>
        <p>We oppose an expanded judiciary because further growth will damage the institution and ultimately undermine the need to have a Federal judicial branch at all. We fear the following consequences:</p>
        <p>* The inevitable drop in quality of judges. When filling a vacancy is no longer a major event in the region served by the court, the political process produces too many mediocre appointments. Qualified candidates abound, but the standards for appointments diminish as public scrutiny is reduced.</p>
        <p>* The deterioration of the decision process. Experience shows that as the judiciary grows, caseloads are permitted to grow even faster. And when caseloads mount, Federal courts adopt shortcuts. Federal appellate courts used to hear oral argument and issue opinions in all cases. Today more than half of all appeals are decided without oral argument and published opinions. If there is no limit on growth, that trend will continue.</p>
        <p>* The inefficiency of large appellate courts. Federal appellate judges are assigned to cases in panels of three. In a nine-member court, all the judges know one another and can work together smoothly and efficiently. If an appellate court had 50 judges, this efficient collegiality would be impossible. Some Federal appellate courts have 13 judges and are growing. The Ninth Circuit, with 28 judges to hear cases from California and other Western states, is the largest and not coincidentally the slowest.</p>
        <p>* The fragmenting of Federal law. Unchecked growth in the judiciary will mean either appellate courts of 40 or even 50 judges, or the division of the country into perhaps 50 judicial circuits where there are now 13. Whether the number of jurisdictions increases or the number of judges per court does, the effect will be to diminish the coherence of Federal law.</p>
        <p>* The growing bureaucracy that weakens the tradition of independent judging. Thirty years ago, an appellate judge had one law clerk, and each appellate court had a small central staff. Today each judge has three law clerks, and central staffs number in the dozens. If growth continues, bureaucracy will burgeon.</p>
        <p>In short, an expanded Federal judiciary will soon approach the size, quality and operation of one of the large state court systems. Lawyers and citizens who prefer going to Federal court will soon find that the advantages of having a Federal court system have disappeared.</p>
        <p>The answer is not attractive, but it is far better than boundless growth. We must maintain and reinforce our tradition of relying primarily on state court systems to handle most civil and criminal cases and use Federal courts only for matters of special importance.</p>
        <p>About 97 percent of all civil cases are handled by state courts. A small shifting of cases from Federal to state courts, increasing the state load by just 1 percentage point, would cause no change in the basic nature or functioning of state courts. But such a transfer would move 70,000 cases out of the Federal courts and reduce their volume by 30 percent, enabling these courts to preserve their proper role.</p>
        <p>Which cases should be shifted? Clearly the thousands of automobile accidents now in Federal courts just because the drivers live in different states. Routine drug prosecutions all belong in state courts. On the other hand, constitutional rights cases should remain in Federal courts. The proper division of jurisdiction is a matter for reasonable debate. Not having that debate will prove disastrous.</p>
        <p>Unlike, say, Federal tax collection, litigation is not an inherently Federal activity that must be handled by a national institution. A growing country inevitably needs more Internal Revenue Service agents. It does not inevitably need more Federal judges. Litigation is primarily a state court activity. State courts have full authority to enforce Federal civil law, and most Federal crimes are also state crimes.</p>
        <p>Like global warming, the ever-growing Federal bench poses a problem that we may not recognize until it is too late. I hope Americans in 2030 will not ask, "How could those in charge back in the 1990's have let the Federal judiciary grow so large that it is no longer worth having?"  Jon O.
