        <p>LEAD: Experts on automobiles say technologies are readily available to make cars go much farther on a gallon of gasoline, reducing the demand for oil and therefore lessening the impact of events like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But a renewed taste for cars with muscle is devouring gains in fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Experts on automobiles say technologies are readily available to make cars go much farther on a gallon of gasoline, reducing the demand for oil and therefore lessening the impact of events like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. But a renewed taste for cars with muscle is devouring gains in fuel economy.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, Americans have shown little interest. Instead they have been choosing new cars that are heavier, faster and on average less fuel-efficient than those bought in earlier years, for the first time since the oil shock of 1973.</p>
        <p>Auto makers have already made substantial gains in cutting fuel consumption by making cars lighter and smaller and developing more efficient engines, and they argue that Americans can best reduce energy consumption by switching to smaller cars with less performance.</p>
        <p>'All the Low-Hanging Fruit'</p>
        <p>''We've picked all the low-hanging fruit when it comes to fuel efficiency,'' said Albert J. Slechter, the technical director of Federal affairs at the Chrysler Corporation.</p>
        <p>But experts outside the auto makers point to innovations that are already in use on some models that if more widely applied could improve the picture even if Americans do not move to smaller cars.</p>
        <p>A recent study concluded that applying 17 existing technologies more broadly would raise average mileage to 43.8 miles per gallon from 28.3 in 1987 if size and performance of cars were unchanged.</p>
        <p>While this would also raise the cost of the car, the efficiency savings would more than offset this; for every 53 cents invested, one gallon of gasoline, which costs considerably more, would be saved.</p>
        <p>The analysis, by Marc. R. Ledbetter, an automotive expert at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit group in Washington, and Marc Ross, of the University of Michigan Department of Physics, assumes that the mix of cars, including size and acceleration, will be the same as in 1987.</p>
        <p>Among the improvements suggested by the study were these:</p>
        <p>* Using engines with four valves per cylinder instead of the standard two. Having two valves to let in the fuel-air mixture and two for exhaust reduces friction in the gases passing through the cylinder, adding horsepower at high speed and enabling the use of a smaller engine. The fuel savings: about 6.8 percent.</p>
        <p>* Electronically controlled shifting in an automatic transmission. This would pick a gear to maximize fuel economy rather than power, in most cases lowering engine speed. Savings: 8 percent.</p>
        <p>* Intake valve control. The timing of the opening and closing of intake valves can be varied depending on engine speed. Savings: 6 percent.</p>
        <p>* Overhead cam. The cam is a rotating shaft that controls valve opening and closing, and in most cars it is located under the parts it controls. An overhead cam has less mass and takes less energy to turn, reducing energy requirements, among other advantages. Savings: 6 percent.</p>
        <p>* Front-wheel drive. Eliminating the drive shaft and rear axles allows a redesign to save space and cut weight. Savings: 10 percent.</p>
        <p>* Aerodynamic changes to cut wind resistance. Savings: 4.6 percent. Limited Prospects?  Car company executives say many of these technologies are already being used on most new cars, so the prospects for further savings are limited. And some innovations, they say, will hurt performance and could interfere with another goal for new cars, reducing air pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ledbetter responded that some gains from the new technologies have been offset by the increased popularity of more powerful engines.</p>
        <p>The nation could also improve fuel economy without sacrificing car size if auto makers used lighter - but costlier - materials. A 10 percent weight reduction in a 3,000-pound car will save 6.6 percent in fuel, experts say. Floyd E. Allen, executive engineer of power-train engineering at Chrysler, said cars could be lighter if aluminum, magnesium and plastic were used to replace steel.</p>
        <p>''But frequently the cost-benefit ratio is difficult to satisfy,'' with gasoline relatively cheap, he said. The average car uses 500 gallons a year, so a 10 percent savings at the current gasoline price would come to about $60 a year. Over the life of the car, saving that amount would justify hundreds of dollars in extra expense.</p>
        <p>Reaction in the Showroom</p>
        <p>But ''it doesn't necessarily make sense to the guy in the showroom, at a dollar a gallon and there's no threat of oil shortages on the horizon,'' Mr. Allen said. ''The reaction is going to be, 'My God, the price went up several hundred dollars.' ''</p>
        <p>Indeed, gasoline is still so inexpensive that fuel economy is not a major goal for most drivers or car companies. ''If you tell me that gasoline will be at $2 a gallon in three years, I would say we'd all be searching for ways for better fuel efficiency, and spending money to find tenths of a mile per gallon,'' Mr. Slechter said. ''But that kind of mentality doesn't exist right now.''</p>
        <p>In the months before the Iraqi invasion two weeks ago, ''gasoline was at the lowest price in recorded history,'' said James D. Johnston, the chief lobbyist in Washington for the General Motors Corporation, referring to the inflation-adjusted cost of gasoline needed to travel a mile. ''That's not a lot of incentive to conserve.''</p>
        <p>With average fuel economy up by about 50 percent since the first oil shock in 1973, the cost of the gasoline needed to drive a mile is the lowest in at least 40 years, experts say.</p>
        <p>Better Acceleration</p>
        <p>The recent increase in gasoline prices is not expected to make much difference, unless it rekindles fear in consumers about future increases.</p>
        <p>With gasoline so inexpensive, buyers have turned their attention to other characteristics, like better acceleration, and the car companies have responded.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency found that 1983 midsized models took about 14.5 seconds to go from zero to 60 miles an hour; the 1990's models take under 12 seconds. Some of the better performance comes from better engineering, but the auto makers have also added power by building bigger engines, which burn more fuel.</p>
        <p>Another factor is the changing mix of vehicles. Small pickups and small vans, which represented only a tiny fragment of sales in 1978, now have nearly 20 percent of the market, the agency said. As a group, they are far less efficient than the passenger cars that many of them replace.</p>
        <p>Declining Fuel Efficiency</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, then, Government figures show the 1990 model-year cars with an average efficiency of 27.8 miles per gallon, compared with 28.6 in 1988. (The calculations take into account how many of each model are sold.) The actual decline in mileage is probably even larger than the figures suggest, experts say, because of traffic congestion. The agency's ''combined'' figure assumes 55 percent of the miles are on the highway and 45 percent are in the city, but as roads get more crowded, experts say, the formula probably overstates the amount of driving done in highway conditions.</p>
        <p>But if fuel efficiency in automobiles is still a low priority for most drivers, it remains a top priority for those concerned about energy conservation at times of uncertain supplies. The American vehicle fleet, a 32 billion-horsepower herd, is by far the biggest user of oil in this country, consuming about 7.2 million barrels a day - coincidentally, about the amount that the United States imports.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists' Concern</p>
        <p>The decline in average mileage also worries environmentalists. ''If this backslide continues, problems with nationwide fuel consumption will increase and global warming trends will worsen at a pace faster than is generally being assumed,'' according to an E.P.A. report in January. Carbon dioxide and other gases in car exhaust are thought to trap heat in the earth's atmosphere, contributing to climate change; the more fuel consumed, the worse the problem.</p>
        <p>After the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, the Government sought to mandate that by 1985 each manufacturer's product line would have an average performance of 27.5 miles per gallon. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company did not meet the standard, and they successfully petitioned the Department of Transportation to delay implementation of the standard. Chrysler met the standard by making heavy investments in plants to build smaller cars, but today the company does not count its compliance as shrewd.</p>
        <p>''The market demand continued to go more and more toward luxury, power and what have you,'' said Mr. Slechter of Chrysler. Now, the three American manufacturers' fuel efficiency is nearly equal.</p>
        <p>Less-Efficient Imports</p>
        <p>Even the efficiency of Asian cars sold in this country is declining, from about 35 miles per gallon in 1988 to about 31 miles per gallon now, as consumer tastes move toward more powerful models. European imports show an even steeper decline, beginning in 1982.</p>
        <p>Many energy experts would like to have the Government respond by setting higher energy efficiency standards for cars, as it has for such consumer equipment as refrigerators.</p>
        <p>The auto companies vigorously dissent. At Ford, David L. Kulp, the manager of fuel economy planning and compliance, called for ''a cohesive policy,'' including giving consumers information on the importance of fuel efficiency and helping municipalities take steps to reduce congestion.</p>
        <p>But Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, has proposed legislation raising average fuel economy 20 percent by 1995. By 2001, the average for new cars would have to be 40 miles per gallon. The bill would also set a statutory standard for light trucks for the first time.</p>
        <p>Gradual Savings</p>
        <p>The measure was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year by a vote of 14-4, and is on the Senate calendar.</p>
        <p>Even without mileage improvements, Americans could save oil merely by buying the most efficient model in its class. The Environmental Protection Agency reports that if every buyer of a 1990-model car of a given size - say, compact, or midsized - had instead bought the most fuel-efficient model of that class, average fuel efficiency would have been 32.5 miles per gallon, instead of the 27.5 miles per gallon actually achieved.</p>
