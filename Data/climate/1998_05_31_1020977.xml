        <p>WHEN many new residents arrived in Connecticut they thought they were getting away from the noise and pollution of the Big City and that they would be enjoying rural landscapes and picturesque towns. One would be able to throw open a window to take in a deep breath of fresh air. Ah were it but true; unfortunately the state has some of the smoggiest, most unhealthful air in the  entire country.</p>
        <p>''There's so little pristine quality left here,'' lamented Dr. Thomas Godar, a doctor with the American Lung Association in Hartford who is bracing for a rash of warm-weather health alerts. ''Until we clean up our air, we can't fully enjoy the outdoors in the summer.''</p>
        <p>As the state tracks ground-level ozone concentrations at its dozen monitoring stations scattered from Greenwich to Stafford, and long-suffering residents can expect far more health-warning announcements this summer than last. If weather and other conditions resemble 1997, there could be twice as many ozone alerts as last year's total of 12, according to Carmine DiBattista, head of the Bureau of Air Management of the state's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>It's not that air quality is expected to be any worse, he explained. It's because the Federal Government, acting on a mass of new medical evidence, has just ''raised the bar.''</p>
        <p>Starting in 1998, health standards for ozone, a lung irritant also known as smog, have been made more stringent than those in effect up to now. Since April 1 when the state began ozone monitoring, there had already been two smog-alert days as of last Wednesday. Unhealthful conditions were recorded in Greenwich, Westport, Danbury and Torrington on May 16, when the temperature reached 90 degrees, and in Torrington on May 20, when the temperature was in the low 80's. Under the less rigorous standards, smog alerts did not usually occur until mid-June.</p>
        <p>The new ozone standards are at the center of a campaign at the Federal and state level almost 30 years after passage of the Clean Air Act. The drive, led by Connecticut and seven other Northeastern states, targets ozone-causing pollution, mainly from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and South, that sweeps into this region. To help combat ozone, the Environmental Protection Agency disclosed in April that it is considering even tougher emission controls on new cars.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. has also embarked on a parallel anti-pollution drive, taking aim at fine particulate matter or soot -- which is considered as serious a health threat as ozone and is responsible for haze in the atmosphere. The E.P.A. last year announced first-time health-safety criteria for these microscopic particles and has begun setting up a nationwide monitoring system to measure the extent of the problem.</p>
        <p>Connecticut, for its part, acted to curb power-plant pollution as part of the just-passed utility-deregulation bill, which was  signed into law by Gov. John G. Rowland at the end of April. A future provision of the law will set strict emissions standards for out-of-state and Connecticut power plants selling electricity in the state.</p>
        <p>Despite the multi-pronged clean-air campaign, there is a long way to go. It will take until 2007 to 2010, on the basis of E.P.A. projections, for Connecticut and the rest of the nation to breathe air that meets Federal ozone standards. And reducing airborne soot will take even longer, until 2015 at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Even if Connecticut were to shut down all industry next week and halt all vehicular traffic within its borders, according to Mr. DiBattista, the state would still not comply with the new E.P.A. requirements. ''The problem is power-plant pollution that comes mainly from the Midwest and South,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Prevailing easterly wind patterns, he explained, not only push ozone components and soot across Connecticut's borders from New York and New Jersey, but also from Pennsylvania and states as far away as Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia.</p>
        <p>Even though Connecticut ozone levels have been reduced by approximately half since 1970, the state still officially ranks among the three or four most smog-ridden areas in the entire nation, behind such industrial regions as Los Angeles, New York and Houston. In the 1970's and 80's, health-warning advisories based on the older, less exacting ozone-danger standard, averaged above 35 days during the summer season, twice reaching 60 days. By the 1990's, the average had fallen to 12, but even this number reflects the fact that the state is still far out of E.P.A. ozone compliance.</p>
        <p>Ozone exceedance figures for 1997, compiled by the state's Department of Environmental Protection, list the highest number of ozone ''hits'' in the state for Westport, Stratford and Madison, with six each. Danbury and Groton had four apiece, Greenwich three, and East Hartford, Middletown, New Haven, Bridgeport and Stafford, all had two. Torrington was the unofficial clean-air champion of monitoring sites, registering zero. Overlapping alerts in the various locations accounted for the state total of 12.</p>
        <p>Ground-level ozone is the prime ingredient of smog. The term smog, which meant a combination of smoke and fog, is now used by environment officials to refer to ozone -- even though the gas is invisible. Ozone is formed when pollutants -- mainly from power plants, factories and automobiles -- combine in the presence of sunlight -- usually when temperatures reach the high 80's. (Ground-level ozone is distinct from  the beneficial, stratospheric variety that shields the earth against ultra-violet rays.)</p>
        <p>Scientists point out that ozone's invisibility can mislead people into thinking the air is pure just because the sky is sunny and blue. Only when accompanied by a pall of haze from heavy concentrations of fine particulate matter does ozone acquire a ''marker.'' Beyond the pockets of  haze over some of Connecticut's largest population centers, the entire state might resemble Los Angeles in the summer if mountains blocked the outward air flow as they do in California.</p>
        <p>The smog buildup means that Connecticut residents such as Bridget and Monica Kelly -- 12-year-old twins who both have asthma -- feel acute discomfort when they shoot baskets on the driveway of their Stratford home during July and August. Barbara Wasko, 67, of Bridgeport, who has a lung disorder, complained, ''I have trouble even walking on those smoggy days -- I have to stay inside.''</p>
        <p>For Renee Idone, 38, of Roxbury, who has competed in several Boston  marathons, a 10-mile run is extra taxing on high-ozone days. ''The air can seem so fresh and clean -- yet I know it's really not healthy to be outdoors,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Richard Straub, of the American Lung Association of Connecticut, said those most vulnerable to elevated levels of ozone and particulate matter are children and elderly people, particularly those with asthma, emphysema or other cardio-pulmonary conditions. He added that there are an estimated 181,000 asthma sufferers in the state and the number is  accelerating in the state and nationwide.</p>
        <p>Even healthy individuals, including outdoor workers, swimmers and youngsters who spend a lot of time in the summer sun, can experience irritant effects from smog, according to Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist with the state's Department of Public Health in Hartford. ''If people inhale smog and soot they can temporarily diminish lung capacity and have trouble breathing properly. But prolonged exposure can permanently impair or prematurely age anybody's lungs,'' he added. High levels of ozone not only harm people but  can also affect crops and vegetation, stunt trees and contribute to algae in lakes.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of scientific studies since the 1980's, according to the E.P.A., have underscored the serious health impacts of polluted air in the United States and have given added momentum to the current anti-pollution campaign.</p>
        <p>The national effort got underway last year when Connecticut and seven other Northeastern states took the lead after decades of being on the receiving end of upwind dirty air from the Midwest and South. They embarked on legal action under the 1990 Clean Air Act to curb dirty coal-burning electric power plants in Midwest and Southern states.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. was asked to mandate that these states order such plants to sharply reduce emissions that drift to the Northeast. These high-polluting utilities, many of them built decades ago in the Ohio River valley, were, in effect, grandfathered. They were not required under the 1970 Clean Air Act to adhere to the same emission limits as modern and cleaner electric utilities built after the 1970s.</p>
        <p>''Up to now those states, ironically, have been in ozone compliance,'' observed Jason Grumet, director of the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, representing the environmental agencies of the New England states and New York and  New Jersey. ''Their pollution immediately gets dumped across their borders by the prevailing winds. And if your state had acceptable air quality, you were in compliance. You didn't have to worry about reducing your pollution.''</p>
        <p>But no more. The Northeast states' initiative resulted in an agreement with the E.P.A. -- announced in February -- that would require all 22 Eastern states, including Connecticut, to put controls in place by 2003 for reducing ozone-causing nitrogen oxide emissions. Each state would be assigned a pollution-reduction budget.</p>
        <p>States such as Ohio and Kentucky, with many coal-burning power plants, would not be exempt from emission reductions even if their own air quality was considered in compliance.</p>
        <p>Some of the nation's filthiest power plants and other pollution sources  in the Midwest and South would be required to scale back up to 85 percent. Connecticut and the other Northeast states, however, which have already substantially cut smog-causing emissions in the last few years, would not have to make such severe reductions.</p>
        <p>The significance of the E.P.A. proposal, Mr. DiBattista says, is that ''it would give Connecticut a level playing field in fighting smog.''</p>
        <p>By 2010, in this scenario, the resultant air quality in Connecticut and other Northeast states would comply with the E.P.A.'s safe-ozone requirements -- based on the assumption that, besides the power-plant cleanup, the bulk of the nation's auto fleet would be phased out and replaced by cleaner-burning vehicles. If the timetables are met, Connecticut could say goodbye to summer ozone alerts.</p>
        <p>Experts in the field of air-quality control say it has taken this long to clean up the nation's air because the bright hopes and resolve of the 1970 Clean Air Act kept colliding with economic and political realities. In addition to frequent resistance and repeated delays in meeting compliance dates, there was a period of indifference in Washington. Moreover, before 1990 the focus was on reducing sulphur dioxide emissions to fight acid rain.</p>
        <p>Overarching all these hurdles were two other harsh realities. Even though dirty air respects no borders, the authority to implement federally mandated cleanup programs resides within each state, making cooperative regional efforts difficult. And dealing with air-quality issues poses significant technical challenges.</p>
        <p>A few days ago, as Renee Idone left her Roxbury home for her usual l0-mile run, she said, ''Why should we have to wait so many more years to clean up pollution. Doesn't everybody want to breathe clean air?''</p>
