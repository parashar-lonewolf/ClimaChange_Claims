        <p>THE discovery of a 4,000-year-old mummified man in a glacier in Austria late last month is the most complete Bronze Age find in Europe and may also provide new insight into ancient weather conditions, scientists say.</p>
        <p>The body was first sighted on Sept. 19 by German mountain climbers at 10,500 feet on the Similaun glacier in the southwestern Austrian province of Tirol near the Italian border.

        <p>THE discovery of a 4,000-year-old mummified man in a glacier in Austria late last month is the most complete Bronze Age find in Europe and may also provide new insight into ancient weather conditions, scientists say.</p>
        <p>The body was first sighted on Sept. 19 by German mountain climbers at 10,500 feet on the Similaun glacier in the southwestern Austrian province of Tirol near the Italian border. Its estimated age, a rough estimate at this point, is based on the ax found at its side. The ax is of a well-known type that appears exclusively from the Early Bronze age, which in Europe started about 2000 B.C.</p>
        <p>"It's a very important find," said Chris Stringer, who heads the Human Origins Project at the Museum of Natural History in London and has seen pictures of the withered corpse. "This kind of preservation is very rare. There are some from peat bogs but those are not anywhere near this age. The British example, Lindow Man, is 2,000 years old. This is double that."</p>
        <p>Scientists who study glaciers say the ice that encased the man, who died hunched over on his knees on solid rock, is the oldest ever found in the Alps.</p>
        <p>"The man surely hadn't melted out in 4,000 years or otherwise he would have disintegrated within weeks," said Gernot Patzelt, a professor at the Institute for Alpine Research at the University of Innsbruck, who has explored the site. "That means that for the first time in 4,000 years, this area is ice-free. You can deduce from that that the climactic conditions now are similar to the time 4,000 years ago."</p>
        <p>Scientists believe that the last time the Alpine glaciers were as small as they are now was 700 years ago, when the climate was also similar to that now. What they still do not know is whether the glaciers' retreat is simply part of the earth's natural cycle of warming and cooling or whether it has been speeded by the feared greenhouse effect, the climate warming induced by a buildup of polluting gases in the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>"But the fact that this area was ice-free 4,000 years ago is proof that even without the man-made greenhouse effect, the climate was as warm as now," Mr. Patzelt said.</p>
        <p>It is not yet understood why the body did not melt out during the last warm period. But the reason may lie in its location away from the sun at the bottom of a five-foot-wide, nine-foot-deep trench that runs through rock for about 150 feet and is still mostly filled with ice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patzelt said the man's body remained exactly where he died because the ice in the trench was trapped and was not pulled along with the glacier on the rock above. Normally the bodies of people who die on glaciers are carried along in the ice as it grows down mountains. Under pressure of the ice, the corpses are transformed into a waxy-like material.</p>
        <p>Five more bodies of mountain climbers who died in the last 50 years have emerged from the glaciers in Austria this summer, which means that much ice has melted, said Rainer Henn, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Innsbruck.  Authenticity of Find</p>
        <p>Archeologists who have examined the mummified body say they are convinced it is genuine.</p>
        <p>"There's no question of its authenticity," said Markus Egg of the Romisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum in Mainz, Germany, after examining the body.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patzelt said he had examined maps going back to 1817 and all showed that the area was covered with glacier until this summer. He believes this eliminates the possibility that someone could recently have planted the body, which was found encased in ice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henn said that for the body to have been mummified, it must first have dried out nearly completely before being covered with snow not more than a month after death.</p>
        <p>Archeologists say study of the man and his equipment is expected to reveal a great deal about the life of Bronze Age humans in South Central Europe. The exact age of the find will not be known until radiocarbon dating tests are made, the results of which will not be available for at least three months.  Gaps in Knowledge</p>
        <p>"We know very little about these people," said Konrad Spindler, the prehistorian at the University of Innsbruck who has led the early investigation. "All we have are some bones, tools and a few remains of houses."</p>
        <p>The mummified body was dug out of the ice by forensic doctors who at first believed it was 500 years old. Discovered beside it were a bronze ax with a wooden shaft, a flintstone knife, flint lighter and kindling in a small pouch. Scientists examining the site a few days later discovered a leather quiver, reinforced with wood, which was filled with 14 arrows. According to X-rays of the quiver, some of the arrows have arrowheads of bone and some have wooden points, which were probably used to hunt fowl. X-rays of a small leather bag also revealed a sort of repair kit for the arrows, including replacement arrowheads made of flintstone and what is believed to be a putty that may be made of pitch.  Prepared for Cold</p>
        <p>The clothes of the man, who is estimated to have been 25 to 35 years old, have disintegrated almost completely, but it appears that they were mostly of leather and fur and that he wore leather boots with a lining of hay for warmth, a stone necklace and a birchbark case around his waist.</p>
        <p>"He knew exactly what he would encounter, be it cold, ice or snow," Mr. Spindler said.</p>
        <p>The man is also tattooed on the inside of his knee with a small cross and on his back above the kidneys with six two-inch-long straight lines lying one on top of the other.</p>
        <p>Mr. Egg, who examined the body, believes that the man was either hunting or looking for minerals like copper, which were plentiful in the Alps.</p>
        <p>"In the Bronze Age people came from what is now Italy and Bavaria to look for copper in the Alps and the area became more thickly settled," Mr. Egg said. But he said the settlements were in valleys and the man was most likely several days' hike from home.</p>
        <p>The man has no wounds, and it is not clear why he died, though it appears from his position in the trench that he may have been seeking shelter. If he was hunting, Mr. Egg said, he would not have been alone, but weather conditions change within minutes in the Alps and he could have become lost. The area is a five-hour hike from the nearest valley but is not terribly demanding terrain.  Autopsy May Be Performed</p>
        <p>An autopsy will probably be done, Mr. Spindler said, and may reveal what the man had last eaten and his cause of death as well as information on his diet and general health.</p>
        <p>"Also if the DNA is well-preserved, we could say how he relates to a number of genetic lines in Europe," Mr. Stringer said. "If the individual has well-preserved tissue, red blood cells, we should be able to get out extensive information from that as well."</p>
        <p>Jean-Pierre Mohen, the director of France's National Museum of Antiquities in St. Germain-en-Laye, said the discovery might encourage more exploration in areas where glaciers are retreating.</p>
        <p>"There is now the possibility of finding in these glaciers, which are getting smaller and smaller, things we've never even looked for before," Mr. Mohen said. "It's all new research."</p>
