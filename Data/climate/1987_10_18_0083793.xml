        <p>LEAD: Officials of Rutgers University are making ambitious plans to develop new technologies for food production and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>Officials of Rutgers University are making ambitious plans to develop new technologies for food production and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>Using the Agricultural Experiment Station at Cook College in New Brunswick as a base, they plan to create three centers to do research and development in food technology, in agricultural molecular biology and in marine and coastal sciences.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, officials announced the formation of a 41-member committee of business leaders, government officials and agricultural experts to help raise $100 million needed to revamp the experiment station.</p>
        <p>The Committee for the Advancement of Agricultural Research and Technology, as the group is known, will try to help university officials make the experiment station the premier agricultural and environmental research center in the nation.</p>
        <p>The committee plans to have a financing proposal ready for the Governor and Legislature by next March.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey can no longer afford to be second best in developing the people and ideas we need to meet the challenges we face,'' said Edward J. Bloustein, the president of Rutgers, at a news conference on Wednesday at the New Jersey Bell Telephone Building here. Five-Year Master Plan</p>
        <p>''The preservation of production agriculture, the development of plant biotechnology, the protection of our coastline, our air and water, the strengthening of our burgeoning food processing and packaging industries, the elimination of toxic and hazardous wastes - these are the issues that require research, education and extension at a truly world class level.''</p>
        <p>The five-year master plan includes a major plant-life sciences complex, a natural resources-environmental and soil sciences building, a complete greenhouse complex with 53,000 square feet of growing area, an animal care center and two renovated buildings to handle nutrition programs and expansion of programs in biochemistry.</p>
        <p>Officials hope new technologies will be developed to create new varieties of disease-resistant crops that are less reliant on fertilizers and pesticides, are more tolerant of drought, salt, frost and acid rain and capable of providing higher nutritional values.</p>
        <p>They also hope to improve genetic capacity, disease resistance and reproductive efficiency in animals and to modify microorganisms so they can destroy toxic and hazardous wastes. Challenge of Changing Conditions</p>
        <p>Other avenues to be explored include the development of alternative energy sources from agricultural byproducts and the development of more accurate and speedy methods to detect toxins, drugs and pesticide residues in plants and animals.</p>
        <p>''Our future directions, like those of our past, will be largely determined by the societal problems brought to us for solution,'' said Dr. Stephen J. Kleinschuster, executive director of the 107-year-old land-grant experiment station. ''In this regard it is important to note that the messages we are getting today are changing dramatically.''</p>
        <p>He said that New Jersey and the rest of the world is being challenged by changing conditions that include a shrinking land base for food production, outmoded land-use techniques, an alarming decline in the quality of land and water resources, problems with waste management and cycles of drought and flooding.</p>
        <p>The committee will be headed by Nicholas G. Marotta, president of National Starch and Chemical Corporation, of Bridgewater, N.J., and Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., president of Forbes Inc.</p>
        <p>''We are both convinced that it is the interest of every citizen and resident in the region to strengthen the overall economy, to protect and improve the environment, and to ensure the quality and safety of the food chain for the future well-being of our people,'' Mr. Marotta said.</p>
        <p>In his remarks, Mr. Forbes noted the outstanding success of the land grant colleges in providing academic research to enhance food production.</p>
        <p>''We must apply today the discoveries of the biological revolution of our own time to the agricultural and environmental problems of the next century,'' he said, adding that ''New Jersey's success here will truly be humanity's success as well.''</p>
