        <p>LEAD: When the Reagan Administration announced an increase in funds last week for research into acid rain, the approving voices in Canada were quickly drowned out.</p>
        <p>When the Reagan Administration announced an increase in funds last week for research into acid rain, the approving voices in Canada were quickly drowned out.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, confronting the lowest public opinion ratings of any government since polls were instituted here 40 years ago - a Gallup Poll approval rating of 24 percent - expressed ''satisfaction'' that the United States had committed itself to ''significant movement'' on an issue that has become a major political concern here.</p>
        <p>But outside the Government there was a widespread view that Mr. Mulroney had been maneuvered into applauding an initiative that will do little to meet Canada's demand for a mandated reduction in sulfur emissions from United States industrial plants.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is the name given to airborne pollution, largely sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, given off by the burning of fossil fuels and changed chemically as it travels through the atmosphere. It falls to earth as acidic rain, snow or dry particles and has been found to damage plants, fish and wildlife. Two Leaders to Meet</p>
        <p>Canada estimates that United States emissions are responsible for 50 percent of the sulfate deposits falling on Canada each year, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to the country's lakes and forests. The issue is expected to be a major topic when Mr. Mulroney and Mr. Reagan meet in Ottawa on April 5 and 6.</p>
        <p>The Toronto Star, a newspaper with a reputation for prickliness on issues involving Canada's relations with the United States, showed its attitude with a cartoon that showed Mr. Reagan on the telephone to Mr. Mulroney.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry, kid, it's a piece of cake,'' the cartoon showed Mr. Reagan saying. ''I'll throw together a few old broken promises, toss in a little spare change, and you can play up the 'significant movement' angle.''</p>
        <p>The newspaper noted that Mr. Reagan's announcement amounted to a reaffirmation of an undertaking given to Mr. Mulroney at a Washington meeting last March, not a new move. At the meeting, Mr. Reagan accepted the recommendations of a joint study group that urged a $5 billion, five-year program to develop and test commercial technologies that would cut cross-boundary flows of acid rain, primarily by reducing sulfate emissions from coal-burning power plants.</p>
        <p>The commitment in Washington was for the United States Government to finance half of the program, private industry the other half. But in the budget submitted to Congress by President Reagan in January, the appropriation for the acid rain program was $350 million over five years, far short of the target. There was an outcry in Canada, with Mr. Mulroney accusing Mr. Reagan of breaking a promise.</p>
        <p>By pledging last week to seek a total of $2.5 billion over five years, Mr. Reagan in effect returned to the original United States commitment. But all that this appears to have accomplished in Canada is to ease some of the tensions that were building ahead of the Reagan-Mulroney meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney seemed to acknowledge that the issue has been put off, not resolved, when he said that the increase in United States financing had put the two nations back on track for ''our ultimate objective,'' an agreement on legally enforceable limits on chemical emissions in the United States. Mr. Reagan has so far resisted such limits, saying that the issue is ''complex'' and requires more study.</p>
        <p>Among officials at Environment Canada, the ministry that deals with pollution issues, the preference for research over restraints is portrayed as a tactic to spare United States industry the costs of a cleanup campaign.</p>
        <p>Canada estimates that 3.2 million tons of sulfur emissions from United States plants cross the border and fall on Canada each year, mainly on Ontario and Quebec. The Canadians would like to see these cut to two million tons by 1994. Canada's own cross-border emissions, which fall mainly on New England, were estimated at 1.5 million tons in 1980, and are planned to fall to 800,000 tons under the 1985 federal-provincial accord.</p>
