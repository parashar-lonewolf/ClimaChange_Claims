        <p>If global warming materializes as the threat many scientists predict, the world's ability to head it off may well be determined by China. The United States is currently the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made contributor to global warming. But rapid economic growth and heavy reliance on dirty fuel may soon propel China toward that unenviable distinction.</p>
        <p>China's pell-mell industrialization is powered largely by huge reserves of coal, the dirtiest of fuels in carbon emissions. Three-quarters of China's energy needs, from factories to home heating, are now met by burning coal. The result is all too palpable, as I found on a visit to several provinces late this summer. Noxious fumes sting the eyes of city dwellers, haze obscures the views, and acid rain falls as far as Japan in one direction and southwest China in another. More worrisome for the rest of the world, China's smokestacks spew tons of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing the buildup of heat-trapping gases.</p>
        <p>China already ranks third in carbon dioxide emissions, behind the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, and when Soviet emissions are split among the newly independent republics, China may well be second. Emissions will almost certainly climb higher as China's economy expands and its population grows bigger and richer. Chinese consumers will inevitably seek a higher standard of living, with more cars, more refrigerators, more home heating, more consumer goods, all requiring more energy to produce and operate.</p>
        <p>Chinese energy and environmental officials expect coal consumption to rise from the current level of 1.1 billion tons a year to more than 1.4 billion tons by the year 2000 -- and carbon emissions are expected to rise sharply as a consequence. One American projection even suggests that China could pass the U.S. in carbon emissions by the year 2025, though China's own projections suggest the U.S. will still lead the pack.</p>
        <p>The outlook would be even worse had China not done an exemplary job of controlling its energy appetite despite furious economic expansion. The Chinese have made astonishing gains in industrial efficiency over the past decade, thereby holding energy growth to half the rate of economic growth. But most analysts think the easy part has been accomplished and that further gains will be much harder.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials, though not fully convinced of the global warming threat, recognize the need to head it off. Qu Geping, the Government's top environmental official, said in an interview that even before global warming is fully proved all countries should take steps to control carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>In a wide-ranging effort to boost its economy and clean its environment, China is already taking steps that will have the beneficial side effect of reducing carbon emissions. Such programs include a big hydroelectric project in the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River that will produce power without emitting carbon dioxide; a tree-planting program that has increased forest coverage for the first time in years; the building of large generating plants for greater efficiency, and experiments with cleaner approaches to home heating. Zha Keming, Vice Minister of Electric Power, believes that nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide, could become the chief energy source 50 years from now.</p>
        <p>Global warming, if it occurs, could harm China itself, an added reason for curbing emissions. But China's leaders do not appear to give the threat high priority. They point out, correctly, that industrialized nations emit far more carbon dioxide per capita than China and have done so for a very long time. Those nations, they imply, should bear the brunt of cleaning up the mess. And when Chinese officials are asked what environmental problems are most acute, they invariably cite urban air pollution, population growth, clean water or soil erosion. No one cites the distant prospect of global warming.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that the nations of the world will need to enlist China if they ever unite to head off global warming. That could pose some very hard questions for the West, such as whether to subsidize China's conversion to cleaner fuels and more efficient factories, or whether to allow Western companies to meet emissions goals through investments in China. But without forceful action, whatever progress is made elsewhere in curbing carbon emissions could be undercut by an enormous increase in emissions from China. PHILIP M. BOFFEY</p>
