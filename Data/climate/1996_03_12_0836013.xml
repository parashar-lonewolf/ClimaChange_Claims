        <p>A STRANGE, debilitating malady has killed hundreds of moose in southwest Sweden over the last decade, and acid raid was the catalyst for a complex chain  of events leading to the disease, a Swedish scientist says.

        <p>A STRANGE, debilitating malady has killed hundreds of moose in southwest Sweden over the last decade, and acid raid was the catalyst for a complex chain  of events leading to the disease, a Swedish scientist says. This appears to be the first instance in which acidification has been linked to mortality in a warm-blooded wild animal.</p>
        <p>The scientist, Dr. Adrian Frank of the Center for Metal Biology in Uppsala, said that the disease was not directly caused by acid rain but by the spreading  of lime to counteract the effects of acidification on the environment. The lime  appears to have caused a toxic imbalance in concentrations of the chemical elements copper and molybdenum in the animals' livers, he said.</p>
        <p>Wetlands, lakes, fields, pastures and to a lesser extent forest areas of this acidified region have been limed since the beginning of the 1980's," Dr. Frank said. The spreading of lime was intensified in the second half of the decade, when the disease began occurring in the moose, he noted. And because the plants the moose usually eat, like blueberry bushes, have been decimated by years of acid rain, the animals altered their browsing habits.</p>
        <p>"Moose frequently browse on cultivated pastures and fields of oat and rape, all of which are heavily limed by farmers," Dr. Frank said.</p>
        <p>When the pH level of the soil decreases because of atmospheric fallout of sulfuric and nitric acid, metals such as cadmium, zinc and manganese are mobilized in the upper soil and their ingestion by animals grazing on plants increases, Dr. Frank said. Molybdenum, however, becomes less soluble in an acidic environment. Raising the soil's pH or alkalinity by liming reverses the chemical behavior of cadmium and other metals, and the availability of molybdenum in plants increases.</p>
        <p>Dr. Frank, a chemist, said that excessive molybdenum in relation to the amount of copper in a ruminant's diet can lead to copper deficiency and death. The animals are emaciated, their hair is discolored, their immune systems are impaired, and they suffer from osteoporosis, ulcers, diarrhea, convulsions, blindness and sudden heart failure.</p>
        <p>More than 1,500 moose have died from the disease since the mid-1980's in Alvsborg County northeast of Gothenburg, one of the most acidified areas in Sweden. Power plants and factories in Europe emit sulfur dioxide that falls as acid precipitation.</p>
        <p>In a paper to be published by the American Chemical Society, Dr. Frank touts  the moose as "a useful, fast and sensitive monitor of environmental change." The moose is found in northern areas around the world. And since moose eat a great variety of plants, they can provide information about changes in levels of both  essential and nonessential metals within five years.</p>
        <p>"Too low or too high a concentration of essential elements, and too high a concentration of toxic elements in the bedrock or soil can become a direct risk  for animal health," he said.</p>
        <p>In 1982, Dr. Frank collected samples of the liver and kidneys from 4,360 moose shot by hunters throughout Sweden. The tissues were analyzed for 14 elements. By 1994, the copper content in moose livers from Alvsborg had declined by 50 percent, but levels of molybdenum had increased by 20 to 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Significant decreases in concentrations of other metals in moose livers were  also noted, especially chromium, which declined to the detection limit. "In the  kidneys, reductions in cadmium, magnesium and manganese indicated severe metabolic disturbances," Dr. Frank reported. Both chromium deficiency and a disturbance of trace element metabolism as a result of liming could be contributing to the moose deaths, he said.</p>
        <p>"People responsible for liming should pay attention to the effects of liming  on the bioavailability of elements for plants and animals," Dr. Frank said.</p>
        <p>Sweden's Environmental Protection Agency, however, rejected Dr. Frank's call  for an urgent nationwide investigation of the possible hazards of liming on wildlife and limited its study to small experiments in some counties, he said. The scientist noted that some Swedish biologists believe a virus or overpopulation could be causing the moose disease.</p>
