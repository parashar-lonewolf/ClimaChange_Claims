        <p>TEACH-INS in the '60s -- campus convocations dedicated to steeping students in issues like the Vietnam war, politics and the draft -- were generally scruffy and partisan affairs, all work shirts, black armbands and black coffee. But there is a whiff of upscale cheese dip upon entering room C5 in Weston High School, where a sign announces ''Iraq and You: A Meeting About the War,'' a teach-in sponsored by the Young Democrats.</p>
        <p>Volunteers are setting out cookies, crackers and fruit platters for the roomful of students and faculty members who have stayed after school to parse Shiites, Sunnis and the ongoing troop surge. The draw: Ned Lamont, the Greenwich Democrat whose vocal criticism of the Iraq war led to his upset victory in his party's primary against Senator Joe Lieberman, forcing Mr. Lieberman to run as an independent to hold onto his seat.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Lamont is another freshly minted citizen-candidate, Jim Himes, also a Harvard-educated Greenwich Democrat. Mr. Himes, 42, a former vice president at Goldman, Sachs, has announced his intent to challenge Representative Chris Shays, New England's only Republican representative and a longtime supporter of the Bush administration's war policies, in 2008. Mr. Himes gets the teach-in rolling: ''We have one card to play now -- timing and terms of withdrawal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamont nods agreement. Following his loss to Senator Lieberman, he taught a course he called ''Political Entrepreneurship'' at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. And among his graduate students were a number of veterans recently returned from Iraq.</p>
        <p>''I guess because Joe and I spent so much time fussing about the war, they kind of identified me with that and signed up for the course,'' Mr. Lamont says. ''I had Chris Shays up there. And we had a great debate. One student kept saying 'General Petraeus says this  ' Finally another guy raises his hand and says, 'I was General Petraeus's chief of staff. Let me tell you exactly what he thinks.' ''</p>
        <p>It is unlikely that any of these fresh-faced Young Democrats will achieve such military rank, or even enlist. ''After all,'' Mr. Himes notes, ''this is the prosperous Fourth District, where a good percentage of young people go on to college.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, these students seem fully engaged with the war's issues, lobbing sharp, detailed questions at both men regarding the Iraq Study Group, withdrawal strategies and, yes, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq.</p>
        <p>They have been marshaled here by a ponytailed, politically active senior named Conor Pfeifer who last year campaigned, alongside his mother, Devon, for Mr. Lamont. Conor first heard about student teach-ins at a recent antiwar meeting he attended in Westport. He was the only teenager there. And right now, he has a question that has been bothering him since: ''Why do you suppose there are so few young people involved in politics these days?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Himes fields it: ''Young people don't vote, and that's a terrible tragedy. People with the most stake in our future are the least likely to defend it. This would be a different country if young people had turned out in the last election.''</p>
        <p>Young voices were raised, often in anger and desperation at those '60s teach-ins. Apathy was not an option for young men then, Mr. Himes notes. He asks, ''What did we have during the Vietnam war that we don't have now?''</p>
        <p>Hands shoot up. Yes, the draft. Compulsory war service and its anxieties do not loom here. But Mr. Lamont says he has seen another kind of deep concern beginning to stir in other recent visits to Connecticut schools: ''These kids are really informed. I just did another meeting up in Stonington with seventh and eighth graders. They asked about Darfur and global warming. They're looking ahead 30 years and not just a couple of election cycles. They were really passionate. They make you think.''</p>
        <p>The little darlings can also put you on the spot. Both Mr. Himes and Mr. Lamont are asked for their candid assessments of the declared Democratic contenders for President. ''I find Barack inspirational and above politics,'' Mr. Lamont says of Senator Barack Obama. Does he think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would have a chance against a male Republican? ''Hillary would win. She's been an extraordinary public servant. Is she polarizing? Yeah. People will come out with the long knives.''</p>
        <p>He says he knows all about negative campaign assaults, having been called ''Ned Who?'' and worse. No, he does not regret butting heads with career politicians and their hidebound operatives, and he urges the students: ''Stay civically involved. We need more citizen legislators, more veterans, teachers and businessmen in office.''</p>
        <p>But despite this grass-roots homily, he falls back on a time-tested pol's parry when a determined Young Dem lobs a live one: ''Hillary or Barack -- which would you endorse?''</p>
        <p>''Umm  I'm not going to answer that  exactly.'' Thanking his audience, he heads for the snacks.</p>
