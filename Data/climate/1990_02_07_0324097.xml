        <p>LEAD: In the most thorough presentation of his economic views since he took office, President Bush today embraced the mainstream Republican philosophy of reliance on private initiatives and market forces. But his first Economic Report to Congress did not have the ideological edge of those submitted by Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>In the most thorough presentation of his economic views since he took office, President Bush today embraced the mainstream Republican philosophy of reliance on private initiatives and market forces. But his first Economic Report to Congress did not have the ideological edge of those submitted by Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>For example, where Mr. Reagan insisted uniformly on less Government participation in economic and business affairs, Mr. Bush advocated greater Federal involvement in such areas as child care, education, basic research and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>''In some cases,'' the President declared, ''well-designed regulation can serve the public interest.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, where the Reagan reports were often sharply critical of the Federal Reserve, blaming the central bank for whatever woes the economy was facing at the time, Mr. Bush endorsed the Fed's policies.</p>
        <p>'Inflation Must Be Controlled'</p>
        <p>''I strongly support the Federal Reserve's goal of noninflationary growth and share with them the conviction that inflation must be controlled and reduced in a predictable fashion,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The President predicted ''strong, sustained economic growth'' in the years ahead but said the economy's ''potential'' must be ''more often fully utilized than in previous decades.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's Economic Report and the accompanying report by his Council of Economic Advisers, both of which are required by law, broke no new ground in terms of policy proposals. But the documents provided the economic rationale behind many of the policies detailed last month in the President's budget and State of the Union Message.</p>
        <p>Cautious on Promises</p>
        <p>Perhaps seeking to justify his Administration's lack of bold new initiatives, Mr. Bush said, ''The American people are ill served by promises that cannot be kept.''</p>
        <p>His ''primary goal,'' the President said, ''is to achieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economic growth.''</p>
        <p>To that end, he set forth five ambitious, if general, principles that he said guided his economic policies: to achieve a budget surplus so that Government borrowing can be reduced; to support a monetary policy that insures maximum economic growth while reducing inflation; to reform the tax, legal and regulatory systems; to design regulations that do not impede market forces, and to promote freer trade worldwide.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who was primarily responsible for preparing today's report, said Mr. Bush ''stays actively informed about the economy.''</p>
        <p>The President, Mr. Boskin said, was particularly concerned that the report emphasize the view that a strong economy and an improved environment are not conflicting goals.</p>
        <p>In his report, Mr. Bush called strengthening the Clean Air Act ''one of my top legislative priorities.''</p>
        <p>The President did not mention in his report the caution he expressed on Monday, in a speech to an international environmental group, when he warned against steps to counteract global warming if such steps might damage the economy. But his economic advisers discussed the reasoning behind the President's position, saying that important scientific uncertainties needed to be resolved before costly moves were made to produce small reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boskin is an Administration insider who advised Mr. Bush on economic matters during the 1988 election campaign and is influential now in policy making. That is in sharp contrast with the role of economic advisers in the previous Administration. During the Reagan years, the economic advisers were often scorned and almost always ignored.</p>
        <p>The other members of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, who re participated in writing the report, are John B. Taylor, also of Stanford, and Richard L. Schmalensee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Accent on the Positive</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush emphasized the positive characteristics of the economy of the 1980's - strong overall growth, an increase in employment and steady inflation rates. He did not mention an aspect his Democratic opponents have seized on - the shift in the tax burden away from the wealthy and toward the middle class.</p>
        <p>He said he was committed to the low income tax rates and broadened tax base enacted in the last decade, but he said a reduction in the capital gains tax rate was one of his ''highest legislative priorities.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of a capital gains tax cut believe such a cut violates the fundamental principles of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.</p>
        <p>Among the other points in Mr. Bush's report and the more detailed one prepared by his economic advisers are these:</p>
        <p>* The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law should be extended as an end in itself, rather than a measure of last resort.</p>
        <p>* The Government no longer needs to worry about whether enough jobs are available for workers but must shift its focus to whether there will be enough skilled workers to fill the available jobs in this decade.</p>
        <p>* Industrial policy and protectionism are detrimental to economic growth and should be avoided.</p>
        <p>* A ''fundamental reassessment'' should be made of financial regulations to take account of new banking and market practices.</p>
        <p>Would Extend Gramm-Rudman</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his economists stressed the Administration's proposal to extend the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, requiring annual targets for spending and revenues, through the end of the decade so that an overall budget surplus could be attained and a start made on cutting the Government's $3 trillion debt. The law now would expire in 1993.</p>
        <p>In the past, the law has been viewed as an unpleasant alternative to invoke when Congress and the President could not agree on budget terms. In his report today, Mr. Bush did not mention working with Congress on the budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boskin said this was the first time to his knowledge that a President in his Economic Report had specifically advocated a budget surplus. Mr. Bush said it would turn the Government into ''a saver, providing funds for capital formation and economic growth by reducing the national debt.''</p>
        <p>The Administration maintains that if its policies are followed and economic growth continues, the budget can be balanced by 1996. Many economists believe that view is overly optimistic.</p>
        <p>The policy of achieving a surplus is not a new one for the Administration, but the President and other officials have begun to emphasize it as a counterweight to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's plan to cut Social Security taxes.</p>
        <p>Stress on Skilled Workers</p>
        <p>The report's chapter called ''Human Resources in the 1990's'' highlights how demographic and economic changes in this decade will lead to the need for more skilled workers. ''These developments,'' Mr. Bush said, ''will shift attention away from worries about the supply of jobs that have haunted us since the 1930's and toward new concerns about the supply of workers and skills.''</p>
        <p>That would mean bringing more disadvantaged Americans ''into the economic mainstream,'' the President said. His economists' report suggested it might also mean changes in immigration laws to favor skilled workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush reaffirmed his strong opposition to industrial policy, in which the Government would use tax laws and regulations to help some industries over others. ''Second-guessing the market is the way to raise Government spending and taxes, not living standards,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the same vein, he said he would ''continue to resist calls for protection and managed trade'' and declared, ''Increased global competition is an opportunity for the United States and the world, not a threat.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats advocate industrial policy and trade restrictions to reverse what they see as a competitive disadvantage the United States faces, especially in dealing with Japan.</p>
