        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he hoped former Vice President Al Gore would run for president in 2008, saying ''I think it would be good for the country.''</p>
        <p>The mayor made the comments to reporters after a news conference kicking off the Tribeca Film Festival, as the two men took the stage and teased each other over speculation about their respective presidential ambitions.</p>
        <p>The former vice president was on hand to highlight the roughly 60 films in the festival that focus on environmental issues. Mr. Gore, whose profile has been raised in recent months by his starring role in the Oscar-winning documentary on global warming, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' praised Mr. Bloomberg for several environmental proposals he released earlier this week, saying they included some ''gutsy moves.''</p>
