        <p>For the first time, an energy technology called a fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house, another sign that the innovation is on the verge of breakthrough as an economical alternative to traditional energy sources.</p>
        <p>The idea of fuel cells, which convert liquid fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction rather than combustion, has been around for more than 100 years. But until recently, fuel cells were so expensive that they were was practical only for specialized use on space missions. But the cells being tested now are powerful, flexible and reliable. And although they are still expensive, confidence that new designs can be mass-produced at reasonable costs is growing.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, a team of engineers will cut the electricity from the local utility to a brick ranch-style house in Latham, N.Y., and switch on a device that looks more like a home central air-conditioning unit than the small chemical plant it really is.</p>
        <p>Developments in the past few weeks include the first commercial sale of a fuel cell for remote power (to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, for a traffic warning sign) and the first street-ready car powered by a fuel cell (built by students at Humboldt State University in California). A former nuclear weapons scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico is experimenting with a tiny cell that converts methanol into enough current to run a laptop computer or a cellular telephone. And in April, Ford put $420 million into Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell company in Vancouver, British Columbia, in which Daimler-Benz already has a major investment.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Energy Department, which is helping to pay for the test in Latham, near Albany, say they have high hopes that within a few years thousands of homes will be drawing electric power from fuel cells, cutting pollution and fuel consumption.</p>
        <p>''In the last year, we've seen significant breakthroughs,'' said Federico F. Pena, the Energy Secretary, in a telephone interview. ''We're going to see fuel cells in homes, cars and other uses much sooner than we had predicted.''</p>
        <p>Concerning the Latham project, Dan W. Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy, said, ''The launch of a fuel-cell powered house is up there with the introduction of the electric refrigerator, the room air-conditioner and the fluorescent light.''</p>
        <p>''The big difference is that the fuel cell could turn the house into a full-time energy producer instead of a consumer of electricity,'' Mr. Reicher said.</p>
        <p>What has made experts more optimistic is the progress scientists have made in tinkering with the fuel cell's gossamer-thin membranes, which look like plastic food wrap or aluminum foil. The membranes are crucial in facilitating a basic chemical reaction -- the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to make water --  into the basis of an energy revolution. W.L. Gore &amp; Company has taken its signature product, Gore-Tex, and put it into the membranes of fuel cells, including the one in Latham, in a way that many researchers say has great promise.</p>
        <p>Jonathan H. Leonard, the program supervisor for fuel cells at California's South Coast Air Quality Management District, one of many government agencies eagerly watching the research, said, ''Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is a simple process that takes electricity. Combining them to make water and electricity, well, you don't get much simpler than that. I don't think there are many doubters.''</p>
        <p>Certainly not Michael M. Walsh, a mechanical engineer who is a consultant to Plug Power, the company running the Latham test. Mr. Walsh lives in the Plug Power-owned house five days a week with, among other devices, a stereo, a personal computer and a clock radio that wakes him in the morning. They will operate the same, whatever the electricity source, he said, and people inside the house ''won't know whether we are running on the grid or not.''</p>
        <p>But for all the breakthroughs, fuel cells are too expensive for everyday use. Car companies, which would probably be the biggest users of a cost-effective fuel cell, say the cost is roughly 100 times more per horsepower than an internal combustion engine. Chrysler, for example, figures that each car-sized fuel-cell stack it buys costs $170,000. And running houses on fuel cells is substantially more expensive than relying on power from conventional utility  plants.</p>
        <p>Plug Power will not say what its prototype cost, arguing that the figure is about as relevant as the cost of producing the first automobile of a model year; it is astronomical but allows the production of thousands more units at lower cost. Plug Power predicts that it can commercialize fuel cells for houses by 2000, at a cost of $3,000 to $5,000 each. Detroit Edison, a part-owner of Plug Power, plans to purchase 30,000 to 50,000 units.</p>
        <p>A New Jersey company, H-Power, also hopes for mass sales. In March the company made what it described as the first unsubsidized, fully commercial sale of a fuel cell, for a trailer-mounted highway sign, the kind that commonly warns of construction ahead. The company will supply 65 of them for $759,000.</p>
        <p>''It's an arms-length sale, with no subsidies, with a warranty, and all the aspects of a commercial sale,'' said Arthur Kaufman, an executive at H-Power.</p>
        <p>In another application of fuel cells, Robert G. Hockaday, a researcher on leave from Los Alamos National Laboratory, bombarded a thin plastic film with neutron radiation to form pores where the hydrogen-oxygen reaction can take place. He predicted he could keep a cellular phone on standby for more than a month on two ounces of methanol. But he does not yet have a prototype that generates enough power in a small enough volume.</p>
        <p>A big part of the expense is that fuel cells are hand-assembled, mostly by Ph.D.'s, because there is still no mass market. That, in turn, is because the components still cost too much, but elements of the equation are changing, thanks to work being done in various laboratories. One step has been to reduce the amount of platinum, a catalyst in the chemical process, to one-fifth of former levels.</p>
        <p>Another, accomplished by the Gore company, has been to strengthen the gel-like heart of the system. The heart, in the fuel cell used in Latham and in those being explored for cars, is a proton exchange membrane. Anything positively charged, like the proton that is the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, jumps from one side of the membrane to the other.</p>
        <p>When a hydrogen atom, consisting of one proton and one electron, is pressed against the membrane, the proton goes through and the electron does not. That creates a positive charge on one side of the membrane and a negative charge on the other; wire them together, and electricity flows.</p>
        <p>DuPont's membrane, sold under the trade name Nafion, does not readily transport the hydrogen ions from one side to the other until it is wet. It takes time for the water that is produced to suffuse the membrane and, once it is wet, the membrane loses two-thirds of its strength. Because fuel cells are typically arranged in ''stacks,'' with layers of membranes, fixing a flaw is difficult.</p>
        <p>But fuel cell experts say Gore has taken a step to solve the problems of cost, fragility and start-up time. Embedding Gore-Tex, the material it sells to textile mills for use in windbreakers and caps, produces a membrane that is 20 microns, about half as thick as predecessors. It is cheaper to buy, gets wet faster, and lets protons slide through more quickly, but it is also stronger.</p>
        <p>There are other areas for improvement. Currently, a square centimeter of membrane produces about half a watt of power. Raising the power would reduce the number of layers, the number of plates and the number of wiring connections.</p>
        <p>The consensus among fuel cell experts is that with growing activity and the promise of mass production, the problems can be solved. People who worked on the membrane and on the problem of platinum, which is used to provide sites where the hydrogen-oxygen reaction can occur, are moving on to other troublesome components, said John B. O'Sullivan, the manager of research on distributed generation at the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>''My concern is no longer, can we make this stuff work,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. ''It's, can we make it work cheaply enough.''</p>
