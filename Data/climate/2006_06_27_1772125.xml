        <p>BILLIONS TO HELP FIGHT DISEASE -- Warren E. Buffett's $31 billion gift to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will help the foundation pursue its goal of curing the globe's 20 leading fatal diseases, Mr. Gates said, along with improving education. [A1.]</p>
        <p>SHARED VIEWS OF TWO BILLIONAIRES -- Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both have a disdain for inherited wealth and share the view that the capitalist system that has enriched them is not capable alone of addressing the root causes of poverty. [C1.]</p>
        <p>GAME MAKER IS SUBPOENAED -- The video game publisher Take-Two Interactive said that it had received a grand jury subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney's office, seeking information about a range of its business practices dating back to 2001 and its inclusion of sexually explicit material in one of its games. A company spokesman said the district attorney had not told Take-Two whether it or any of its executives or directors were the focus of the inquiry. [C1.]</p>
        <p>HEART DEVICES RECALLED -- Boston Scientific said that it was recalling 23,000 heart pacemakers and defibrillators and recommended that 27,000 patients who already have the devices in their chests consult their doctors. Market Place. [C1.]</p>
        <p>PART OF VIOXX PAPER RETRACTED -- The simmering controversy over data from the 2004 clinical trial that caused Merck to stop selling Vioxx bubbled up again, as the New England Journal of Medicine retracted part of a paper it had published about the trial. [C13.]</p>
        <p>FINDINGS ON FOOD AND DRUG LAW -- A 15-month inquiry by a top House Democrat has found that enforcement of food and drug laws declined sharply during the first five years of the Bush administration. [A15.]</p>
        <p>EMISSIONS CASE ACCEPTED -- The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal government is required to control vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas that has been linked to global warming. [A14.]</p>
        <p>35,000 TO LEAVE G.M. -- In an employee exodus that is one of the biggest ever, about 48,000 workers at General Motors and Delphi accepted early retirement or buyout offers. [C1.]</p>
        <p>ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY EFFORT -- In the face of government pressure, a group of Internet companies is undertaking an effort to help combat child pornography online. [C3.]</p>
        <p>SALES OF NEW HOMES INCREASE -- Sales of new homes rose in May, surprising economists who had been forecasting that housing would slow because of rising loan rates. [C3.]</p>
        <p>STEEL INDUSTRY AD CAMPAIGN -- The steel industry has inaugurated an advertising campaign to reposition itself as a vibrant and crucial part of the American economy. [C10.]</p>
        <p>JUSTICES TO HEAR PHONE CASE -- The Supreme Court said that it would consider a lawsuit that accuses the nation's largest telephone companies of violating federal antitrust law by conspiring to carve up local markets to preserve their monopolies. [C3.]</p>
        <p>CHANGE AT THE TOP AT KRAFT -- Amid lackluster earnings growth and a stagnant share price, the directors of Kraft Food ousted the chief executive, Roger K. Deromedi, left, who had been at Kraft for 28 years and its head since 2001. He will be succeeded by Irene B. Rosenfeld, who will become one of 12 women leading a Fortune 500 company. Analysts say that Kraft has lagged some rivals in introducing successful products. [C3.]</p>
        <p>NEWSPAPER DEAL APPROVED -- Shareholders of Knight Ridder, the newspaper company, voted overwhelmingly to sell the company to McClatchy. [C10.]</p>
        <p>MINING DEAL MAY NOT BE FINAL -- The $40 billion deal by the copper miner Phelps Dodge to acquire Inco and Falconbridge, two major nickel producers in Canada, could yet be upset by another bid, analysts say. [C11.]</p>
        <p>BIAS AGAINST RUSSIA SEEN -- The Russian oligarch Aleksei Mordashov lost the battle for the steel company Arcelor for one reason, Russian politicians say: Russophobia. [C11.]</p>
