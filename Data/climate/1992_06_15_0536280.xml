        <p>Closing the largest gathering of national leaders in history, the United Nations Secretary General told Earth Summit participants today that "the road from Rio" must translate 12 days of debate into action.</p>
        <p>"The route is now marked out," Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a blunt farewell to an audience that included several of the 118 heads of state and government who had journeyed here. "Today we have agreed to hold to present levels the pollution we are guilty of. One day we will have to do better -- clean up the planet."</p>

        <p>Closing the largest gathering of national leaders in history, the United Nations Secretary General told Earth Summit participants today that "the road from Rio" must translate 12 days of debate into action.</p>
        <p>"The route is now marked out," Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in a blunt farewell to an audience that included several of the 118 heads of state and government who had journeyed here. "Today we have agreed to hold to present levels the pollution we are guilty of. One day we will have to do better -- clean up the planet."</p>
        <p>"The function of the United Nations is not to mask general inaction with verbiage, speeches, reports and programs," he said.</p>
        <p>As the summit meeting's 35,000 participants streamed out of Rio, talk was of the start of a new era, similar to one that began 20 years ago in Stockholm with the last world meeting on the environment. A Point of Transition</p>
        <p>"Five years from now we will look back on Rio and see it was a point of transition on how we deal with global environmental issues," predicted Walter V. Reid, vice president for programs of the World Resources Institute, a Washington group.</p>
        <p>President Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil, the host country, said the Earth Summit consecrated a concept that human development and protection of the earth's environment are inextricably intertwined.</p>
        <p>"Much more than 12 days ago, the world today is aware that the questions of environment and development cannot be treated separately," said Mr. Collor to applause from delegates.</p>
        <p>Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's Prime Minister, said: "Five hundred years ago men set out to discover the size of the earth. At this meeting we discovered its limits." Two Treaties Signed</p>
        <p>The gathering also marked the distance that the environment has traveled as a political issue since Stockholm.</p>
        <p>"In 1972, I had no idea what ecology meant, no idea what endangered species meant," recalled Marco Azambuja, a veteran Brazilian diplomat who took part in both conferences. "This time, no head of state could afford not to attend the conference. No one could afford to wreck it. No one could afford not be a player."</p>
        <p>In the most tangible achievements of Rio's conference, 153 nations signed two treaties here, one on global warming, the other on protecting the world's plant and animal species. By contrast, only 14 nations signed the Vienna Convention on limiting ozone-depleting chemicals when it was first presented in 1985.</p>
        <p>Today, delegates approved by consensus three nonbinding documents: a statement to guide forestry practices, a declaration of principles on environmental policy and Agenda 21, an 800-page blueprint for environmental action through the 21st century in a number of areas, including pollution, poverty, population and waste management.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting was marked by a rise in North-South tensions over money.</p>
        <p>Maurice Strong, the conference organizer, estimated today that donor nations announced $6 billion to $7 billion in aid to third world environmental projects here. But environmentalists estimated that the new part of this aid was only $2 billion. U.S. Is Isolated</p>
        <p>The summit was also marked by the isolation of the United States, the only nation that has publicly refused to sign the biodiversity treaty.</p>
        <p>"I'm president of the U.S., not President of the world," President Bush was quoted today in Jornal do Brasil, a local daily that obtained a brief interview with Mr. Bush before he left Rio on Saturday afternoon. "It is leadership to stand up against the tide. I can't do what everyone else does."</p>
        <p>For a summit meeting billed by some as "the last chance to save the planet," a torrent of criticism was inevitable.</p>
        <p>Scaling Sugar Loaf mountain, members of the Greenpeace movement draped Rio's landmark on Saturday with a large banner denouncing the Earth Summit for having "sold out" the planet.</p>
        <p>A group representing 37 small island nations protested as toothless the treaty to slow global warming. Island nations fear that rising global temperatures will melt polar icecaps, causing ocean waters to rise and flood low-lying islands.</p>
        <p>"The text lacks explicit, specific and meaningful commitments by developed countries to stabilize and then reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide," read the declaration adopted by the Alliance of Small Island States. An Environmental Gap</p>
        <p>Homero Aridjis, president of a Mexican environmental group, Grupo de los Cien, protested that the 20 miles that separated the Earth Summit from its private counterpart, the Global Forum, symbolized "an environmental gap between political power and civil power."</p>
        <p>But some of the strongest criticisms came today from Mr. Strong, the conference's Canadian organizer.</p>
        <p>"As a conference, Rio was clearly a great success, but whether or not it succeeds in its purpose of setting the planet on a new track remains to be seen," said Mr. Strong, who helped to organize the Stockholm conference. "I sat at a podium in Stockholm 20 years ago. I heard most of the same things. Most were not translated into action."</p>
        <p>Saying he was "really disappointed we don't have targets and timetables" for reduction of gases believed to cause global warming, Mr. Strong added, "People can't allow their leaders to forget what they promised here."</p>
        <p>"As a bureaucrat, I don't always use the hottest words to describe things, but now we have to push like hell to make sure implementation takes place," he told the rear guard of 8,000 reporters who had been accredited to the summit.  THE EARTH SUMMIT</p>
