        <p>''Supernatural,'' on WB, is genuinely scary. But there are half a dozen other new dramas designed to make viewers run from the room screaming, including two about aliens from outer space, and at least one sea monster. There is even a remodeled ''Night Stalker.''</p>
        <p>Could it be a symptom of our times? In an era plagued with man-made perils like global warming and biological terrorism, when even natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina seem compounded by human failings, perhaps we seek the comfort of a higher scapegoat-- supernatural forces beyond our control and not our fault.</p>

        <p>''Supernatural,'' on WB, is genuinely scary. But there are half a dozen other new dramas designed to make viewers run from the room screaming, including two about aliens from outer space, and at least one sea monster. There is even a remodeled ''Night Stalker.''</p>
        <p>Could it be a symptom of our times? In an era plagued with man-made perils like global warming and biological terrorism, when even natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina seem compounded by human failings, perhaps we seek the comfort of a higher scapegoat-- supernatural forces beyond our control and not our fault.</p>
        <p>Nah. It's got to be because of ''Lost.'' The ABC series about plane-crash survivors stuck on a haunted island was a huge success last season, and now every other network wants to follow suit. ABC is even hoping to find another ''Lost'' with ''Invasion,'' a series about E.B.E.'s (''extraterrestrial biological entities'') who disrupt life in Florida.</p>
        <p>The scariest part of all these unexplained phenomena lurks behind the camera: there is nothing quite as alarming as the fear of failure. Television has always sought security in imitation; in this relentlessly competitive market of infinite digital cable and on-demand viewing, executives are as panicked as teenage campers in ''Friday the 13th'': at the first sight of salvation, they run for the escape hatch in terrorized droves.</p>
        <p>Network jitters would also explain ''Bones,'' a new Fox drama that has its premiere tonight. It too clings to proven formulas. A crime drama about a tough, beautiful anthropologist who helps the FBI solve homicides, ''Bones'' attaches the girl power of ''Grey's Anatomy'' to the high-tech forensics of ''CSI.'' It's not nearly as snappy as the Fox drama that follows, ''House,'' but it does give a woman the last word.</p>
        <p>And the first: in the opening scene, the anthropologist's best friend flashes her pink lace bustier at an inattentive airport official to obtain arrival information. Just imagine what she would do for a pillow on Delta Air Lines.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. is useless at solving the kind of crimes committed on ''Supernatural,'' at least until Quantico starts training paranormal pathologists. The premiere episode begins, very spookily, with the grotesque, inexplicable death of a young mother, and flashes forward to 2005 and her two grown sons, who have been raised by their grief-demented father to work as vigilante ghostbusters. (Their tools are a lot lower-tech than the proton gun, however: mostly handguns and sawed-off shotguns.)</p>
        <p>The first half-hour of the pilot is quite effective: the camera angles, spooky music and jumpy sequences (whenever a character appears, it is sudden and startling) are as frightening as those found in any horror movie, with an added twist of suspense. Theatergoers can usually tell just from the previews whether they are paying to see Freddy Krueger or something closer to ''The Sixth Sense.'' Horror is still a relatively rare genre on television, and viewers can never be quite sure how far a network and its censors will go.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, ''Supernatural'' shows its true colors too quickly. The trouble with ghost stories is that no matter how sophisticated the special effects, the depiction of numinous creatures is almost always pretty silly. Halfway through the pilot, ''Supernatural'' stops building suspense and turns predictable. The drama reverts to a WB family drama about the bonds between two mismatched brothers and their father. Sam (Jared Padalecki of ''Gilmore Girls'') wants to go to law school and lead a normal life. His older brother, Dean (Jensen Ackles of ''Smallville), is still a phantom-hunter and a ne'er-do-well scamp. (When a Southern sheriff warns him he is in a heap of trouble, he replies, ''Misdemeanor trouble or 'squeal like a pig' trouble?'')</p>
        <p>The stars are appealing WB veterans, but it is hard to believe that subsequent episodes will carry the same edge as the premiere. ''Supernatural'' is not ''The Sixth Sense,'' it's ''Ghostbusters' Creek.''</p>
        <p>''Bones'' also tries to be unsettling -- lots of decomposed bodies and severed, rotting skulls. Emily Deschanel (''Boogeyman'') plays Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic anthropologist with a pretty face and a tough-as-nails demeanor. When a stranger gets too close to her at the airport, she kickboxes him to the floor and pummels him with sarcasm. She works with a team of flaky, brilliant colleagues, including the loose-blouse best friend, Angela (Michaela Conlin).</p>
        <p>Temperance has sexual tension with her contact at the F.B.I. special agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz of ''Angel''), a former Army sniper who is the brawn to her brains. Tired of being left behind in the lab, Temperance demands to be Seeley's full partner in the field. He assents by saying, ''We're Scully and Mulder.''</p>
        <p>He is referring to the partners on ''The X-Files,'' but the allusion itself was a television tell. Characters on television increasingly reference old shows in a knowing way: on ''Supernatural,'' Sam and a classmate joke about not growing up like the Bradys or the Huxtables. Such winking self-consciousness is a trend, a way of adding modern edge to old-fashioned dramas and sitcoms.</p>
        <p>But it could also be a more primitive rite, like African tribesmen who eat the heart of valiant enemies in the hope of ingesting their courage, new shows nibble on the remains of old hits -- ''May their ratings be ours.''</p>
        <p>And that is creepy.</p>
