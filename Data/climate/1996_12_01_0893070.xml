        <p>The Clinton Administration's new proposal to tighten national air quality standards for smog and soot may offer an opportunity for some regions of the country that have struggled for years to bring their cities into compliance with the existing clean-air goals.</p>
        <p>The hotly debated new standards, proposed on Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, would establish a new definition of healthful air and reduce the allowable levels of pollution from ozone and fine chemical particles, two main ingredients of smog.</p>
        <p>The strict new rules might seem to spell more regulatory trouble for many states, including New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, whose urban air fails to meet even the current health standards.</p>
        <p>But not every city's smog is all homegrown. In New York and other big cities from the Great Lakes to New England, much of it wafts in on the winds from other states.</p>
        <p>For that reason, some air quality experts say the new rules may help clean up the downwind areas by controlling pollution from the smokestacks of distant factories and power plants. Those plants now escape strict controls because the air in their areas is clean enough to meet existing standards.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, the new standards will end up giving the Northeast some leverage to get at the problems coming in from the Midwest,'' said Nancy H. Sutley, a senior aide to the E.P.A. Administrator, Carol M. Browner.</p>
        <p>Ohio, for example, where all but a few towns already comply with the current ozone standard, would suddenly find much of the state out of compliance with the new standard. The new pollution controls that Ohio and similar states might have to adopt would be a big help in making the air more breathable in the Northeast, including the New York metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Controls on power plants in the nation's cleaner areas are likely to play a big role in any new strategy aimed at curtailing the ozone that drifts across the eastern half of the nation, damaging people's lungs along the way. Other steps could include the wider use of cleaner-burning gasoline and less-polluting cars.</p>
        <p>The idea that upwind states ought to do more to help protect the environment in cities hundreds of miles away is not new. Northeastern states banded together a few years ago and agreed to require the use of reformulated gasoline throughout their area  as one way to address the problem of regional ozone movement.</p>
        <p>For similar reasons, the E.P.A. has also controlled power plant emissions that can cause acid rain at great distances.</p>
        <p>But until now, it has proved much more difficult to expand the geographical reach of the Clean Air Act to control the longer-range ozone transport, as the problem of wind-borne smog is known.</p>
        <p>Trying to allocate the responsibility for reducing air pollution ''has put the E.P.A. in the Solomon position: they have to divide the baby,'' said David Hawkins, an air quality specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>''This is not a scientific problem,'' he said. ''It is a profound political question. How much should Ohio contribute to protect the air quality in New York?''</p>
        <p>Robert Shinn, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that the E.P.A.'s proposal to toughen the ozone standard would definitely help Northeastern states by putting more pressure on other states to do more, even if they had already met the current standards.</p>
        <p>''Without getting a handle on transport,'' Mr. Shinn said, ''New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will have difficulty meeting these standards.''</p>
        <p>In any case, he said, the new proposal to limit ozone in the air to 80 parts per billion, averaged over an eight-hour period, would be better for people's health than the existing standard of 120 parts per billion, averaged over a one-hour period. In other words, the states that already meet the current standard would be protecting the health of their own residents, not just doing a favor for someone else, when they moved to meet the new standard.</p>
        <p>But the governors of the states that meet the current standards are complaining about the E.P.A.'s search for tighter pollution controls.</p>
        <p>Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, for example, objected to the expected recommendations from an ad hoc panel known as the Ozone Transport Assessment Group to control ozone emissions in states like Arkansas for the benefit of faraway cities.</p>
        <p>''Placing the same pollution control requirements on Arkansas as are required in Chicago or New York does not make sense, and these policies would likely be met with widespread resistance here,'' he warned in a letter to Ms. Browner on Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials hope that when state governments take a broader, regional view of the pollution problems, their support for the agency's proposal will grow. That is important because industry critics of the rules have been drumming up opposition among state and local officials on the grounds that the tougher standards would be impossible to meet at any reasonable cost and that many states had already done everything feasible to control smog.</p>
        <p>That is not necessarily so, say experts who have been working on a plan to control ozone regionally.</p>
        <p>For example, the E.P.A. estimates that 85 percent of the counties east of the Mississippi River that meet the current ozone standard but would violate the new standard would be able to comply if they adopted new controls on electric utilities that are already being considered.</p>
        <p>The ozone transport group is considering calling for a national cap on the emissions of nitrogen oxides, which are gases from power plants that turn into ozone in the sunshine. Utilities would buy and sell the rights to emit this kind of pollution, an approach that has already worked well to help control the gases that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>By taking steps like switching fuels and putting catalytic cleanup devices in power plants, some experts said, it might be possible to cut nitrogen oxides by 70 percent, using technologies that are common in the Northeast but not in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>The ozone transport group is a partnership of the E.P.A., the Environmental Council of the States and the governments of 37 states east of the Rocky Mountains and the District of Columbia. Many industry and environmental groups are also joining in its work. Its first report is expected in March.</p>
