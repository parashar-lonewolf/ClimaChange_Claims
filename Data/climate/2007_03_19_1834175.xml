        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-7</p>
        <p>As Afghanistan Struggles, One More Threat: AIDS  H.I.V. and AIDS have quietly arrived in Afghanistan. It remains almost completely underground, as the government struggles with the help of American and NATO forces to rebuild the country. Surveys tell of 69 confirmed cases, but health officials warn that the incidence is certainly much higher. A1</p>
        <p>Zimbabwe Blocks Critics' Travel  Zimbabwe's crackdown on the nation's political opposition expanded to block foreign travel by leading government critics. Nelson Chamisa, the spokesman for the largest faction of the party, was severely beaten while en route to Harare's airport for a flight to Brussels, a party official, William Bango, told news services in Harare. A5</p>
        <p>Mideast Policy Shows Fissures  The first fractures surfaced in the Israeli and American approaches to the new Palestinian unity government, with Israel's cabinet voting overwhelmingly to boycott it, while the United States Consulate refused to rule out contacts with some individual Palestinian ministers. A7</p>
        <p>Police Officials Held in Mexico  Three high-ranking state police commanders and a former police chief were being held for questioning in the attempted killing of the Tabasco state secretary of public security, after hundreds of soldiers and federal agents raided the police headquarters the day before.  A5</p>
        <p>End of North Korea Impasse  The United States and North Korea have resolved a standoff over North Korean funds frozen in a bank account in Macao, clearing the way for talks to focus on putting in place a nuclear disarmament accord, Chinese and American officials said. A5</p>
        <p>Iraqi Official's Home Raided  Iraqi security forces seized a large cache of weapons, detained a man with a sniper rifle and found four cars with traces of explosives during a raid on the home of a prominent Sunni Arab lawmaker this month, a senior Iraqi military spokesman said.  A6</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A8-13</p>
        <p>Accounting by Shriners Raises Concerns  An examination of the 135-year-old fraternal organization, the Shriners, yields a picture of lax accounting procedures and oversight under which money earmarked for the Shriners Hospitals for Children instead financed temple activities.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Senator Wants Aides to Testify  Senator Patrick J. Leahy, leading the inquiry into the dismissal of federal prosecutors, insisted that Karl Rove and other top aides to President Bush must testify publicly and under oath, setting up a confrontation between Congress and the White House over the fate of Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Lawsuit Centers on Adoption  Olive F. Watson, a granddaughter of Thomas J. Watson, the founder of I.B.M., is involved in a lawsuit with her former same-sex partner, whom she adopted under Maine law. Her partner sued for part of a multimillion dollar inheritance after the couple separated, saying she was technically a grandchild of Mr. Watson.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Uproar Over Unpaid Utility Bills  Memphis Light, Gas and Water allowed a member of theMemphis city council to forgo paying thousands of dollars in overdue bills without having his power cut, and kept a list of local politicians used to prevent discontinuing their service if they failed to pay their utility bills. The situation has infuriated a city where nearly a quarter are poor and the local utility is publicly owned.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Towns Put Climate on Agenda  One-hundred-eighty of New Hampshire's 234 cities and towns are voting on a resolution asking the federal government to address climate change. Organizers also hope to use the effort to force presidential candidates to address climate change issues during the state's primary.</p>
        <p>A8</p>
        <p>Early Warnings of F.B.I. Lapses  Before the Federal Bureau of Investigation publicly admitted that it had ignored its rules when demanding telephone and financial records about private citizens, a top official in the program warned the bureau about widespread lapses in 2005, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>A10</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION  B1-5</p>
        <p>Atlantic City Rethinks Image as Revenues Fall  Faced with competition from new casinos in Pennsylvania and slot machines at Yonkers Raceway in New York, Atlantic City casino operators, who have seen a fall in revenue for the year's first two months, are wagering large sums that they can transform the low-rent gambling factory into a world-class entertainment destination. A1</p>
        <p>Robber Has Novel Defense  Juan Medina, a man imprisoned at Rikers Island, claims he was working as an undercover operative and committed robbery with the full knowledge and cooperation of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. The D.E.A., while admitting he was a paid confidential informant, has not come to his aid, and is helping prosecute him on charges of burglary, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon. B1</p>
        <p>ARTS E1-8</p>

Staple  The New York public radio station WNYC is teaming up with the distributor Public Radio International to produce a national morning radio program that will compete with National Public Radio's long-running ''Morning Edition.'' The program is intended to expand the public radio audience by focusing on a younger, more multicultural listener than public radio typically draws.  E3</p>
