        <p>FDA approves a new breath test for diagnosing bacterial infection of stomach that is linked to peptic ulcers; Meretek UBT Breath Test will be available to doctors late next month (M)</p>

        <p>ALTHOUGH doctors have learned in recent years that most peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection of the stomach, the infection has been hard to detect. The only sure method has required an invasive procedure, endoscopy, in which a tube is passed down the patient's throat and into the stomach to remove a piece of tissue for analysis.</p>
        <p>A new test, approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 18, makes the diagnosis far more easily, by just analyzing a sample of the patient's breath. Called the Meretek UBT Breath Test, it will be available to doctors late next month. Patients will be able to take the test in a doctor's office, receive results within a day or two and, if the bacteria are present, take a combination of antibiotics for two weeks to get rid of the infection and let the ulcer heal. Then, the test can be repeated to make sure the bacteria have been eliminated.</p>

        <p>ALTHOUGH doctors have learned in recent years that most peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection of the stomach, the infection has been hard to detect. The only sure method has required an invasive procedure, endoscopy, in which a tube is passed down the patient's throat and into the stomach to remove a piece of tissue for analysis.</p>
        <p>A new test, approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 18, makes the diagnosis far more easily, by just analyzing a sample of the patient's breath. Called the Meretek UBT Breath Test, it will be available to doctors late next month. Patients will be able to take the test in a doctor's office, receive results within a day or two and, if the bacteria are present, take a combination of antibiotics for two weeks to get rid of the infection and let the ulcer heal. Then, the test can be repeated to make sure the bacteria have been eliminated.</p>
        <p>''This is a long-awaited diagnostic test,'' said Dr. Frank Hamilton, chief of digestive diseases at the Division of Digestive Diseases and Nutrition at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ''It's very safe and effective.''</p>
        <p>Doctors in the past, hoping to avoid endoscopy, sometimes treated ulcer patients with antibiotics without knowing whether or not the bacteria were present, Dr. Hamilton said. ''Now we can say you either have the infection or you don't, and the patient doesn't take unnecessary medications,'' he said. Because the breath test will cost only about 20 percent of the $800 to $1,500 charged for endoscopy, Dr. Hamilton said, ''In the long run it should reduce the cost of managing patients with ulcer disease.''</p>
        <p>The test detects the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori. That organism was first recognized as a cause of peptic ulcers in the early 1980's. Later research showed it to be the major cause, though some are caused by aspirin and other anti-inflammatory drugs. Before the role of H. pylori was understood, doctors attributed most ulcers to stress, diet and oversecretion of acids in the stomach. Medications designed to protect the stomach from acid did heal ulcers, but they often recurred.</p>
        <p>In people who have ulcers and H. pylori infection, eliminating the bacteria with antibiotics lets the ulcer heal and reduces the recurrence rate as well. In 1994, the National Institutes of Health recommended that all ulcer patients with H. pylori infection be given antibiotic treatment.</p>
        <p>Although a blood test can pick up evidence of H. pylori infection, it cannot distinguish a past infection from an active one, meaning that some who are no longer infected will get false positive results and may be given antibiotics needlessly.</p>
        <p>In addition to being offered to ulcer patients, the breath test will probably also be used in people who do not have ulcers but who suffer from chronic gastritis, which can cause indigestion, abdominal pain, gassiness, nausea and other stomach problems. Those who test positive for H. pylori may also be given antibiotic treatment, though there has been disagreement among doctors as to whether they need treatment. Doctors who favor it cite the concerns that gastritis can lead to ulcers and that H. pylori and ulcers have been linked to stomach cancer. But stomach cancer is uncommon in this country. Even so, Dr. Hamilton said, ''I think the wave is moving towards treating gastritis.''</p>
        <p>H. pylori is a common bacterium, thought to infect the stomachs of 35 percent of all American adults, with the likelihood of infection increasing with age. But only about 10 percent of Americans ever develop peptic ulcers, and scientists do not know why the organisms apparently cause illness only in some people. The bacteria travel from one person to the next by the fecal-oral route, which generally means they are spread by unwashed hands.</p>
        <p>The breath test is manufactured by Meretek Inc., a privately held firm based in Nashville. The test depends on the unusual ability of H. pylori to rapidly break down urea, a naturally occurring substance. Patients drink a solution of urea that has been manufactured to contain carbon atoms that are heavier than normal. If H. pylori is present in their stomachs, the organism will quickly break down the urea, and the heavy carbon atoms can be detected in the carbon dioxide that the patients exhale.</p>
