        <p>As someone who hails from the coast of Massachusetts, I was disappointed to see ''An Ill Wind Off Cape Cod,'' by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Op-Ed, Dec. 16). This can't be the same man who has been calling for renewable energy, including wind farms.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the only thing Mr. Kennedy has in common with those who oppose the Cape Wind project is the ''not in my backyard'' syndrome. Many are wealthy property owners who think that a wind farm five miles off the coast will interfere with their views.</p>

        <p>As someone who hails from the coast of Massachusetts, I was disappointed to see ''An Ill Wind Off Cape Cod,'' by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Op-Ed, Dec. 16). This can't be the same man who has been calling for renewable energy, including wind farms.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the only thing Mr. Kennedy has in common with those who oppose the Cape Wind project is the ''not in my backyard'' syndrome. Many are wealthy property owners who think that a wind farm five miles off the coast will interfere with their views.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy's resistance to the wind farm is out of step with the environmental community and efforts to fight global warming.</p>
        <p>He said the wind farm could kill thousands of birds. But for every 10,000 bird fatalities, less than one is caused by wind turbines, a far smaller threat than global warming, which could threaten up to 35 percent of all species with extinction by 2050.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Cape Wind will help prevent situations like the oil spill in Buzzards Bay that killed hundreds of seabirds, contaminated the beaches and closed shellfish beds for a year.</p>
        <p>Offshore wind is an important step in fighting global-warming pollution and will begin a new era of clean energy in America. Cape Wind is the right project at the right time in the right place.</p>
