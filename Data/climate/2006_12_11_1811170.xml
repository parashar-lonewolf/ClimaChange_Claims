        <p>Utah officials hope that the state's image can be best defined by its vast public lands and unspoiled forests, lakes and mountains.</p>
        <p>But some here fear that a recent change in the name of the city's professional basketball arena may create for Utah new and far less savory associations with corruption and nuclear waste.</p>
        <p>Since the arena's opening in 1991 as the home of the Utah Jazz, it was called the Delta Center, for Delta Air Lines, which struck the original deal for naming rights with Larry H. Miller, the team's owner. But in November, a hazardous waste services company based here, EnergySolutions, outbid bankrupt Delta to win a 10-year naming-rights contract.</p>
        <p>The winning bid, the price of which neither side would disclose, has created the EnergySolutions Arena.</p>
        <p>Steve Creamer, the company's president, is looking to overcome the negative publicity that the company, known until 10 months ago as Envirocare of Utah, has received over its operation of a large nuclear waste facility in the Utah desert.</p>
        <p>EnergySolutions was formed in February by the merger of three companies, including Envirocare, which set up the nuclear waste facility on public land in 1988 with the approval of Larry F. Anderson, then director of the Utah Division of Radiation Control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson was later convicted on federal bribery charges of taking cash and a condominium in the resort town of Park City from Envirocare's founder and former owner, Khosrow B. Semnani. Mr. Semnani pleaded guilty to a charge of tax evasion.</p>
        <p>The state has granted EnergySolutions a license to double the size of the low-level nuclear waste site, to about two square miles, though the approval is not final, in part because the Legislature and the governor also must have a say. But an antinuclear group, the Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah, or Heal Utah, has sued the state to revoke the license, and that is also delaying the expansion. The alliance also opposes the company's plan to expand the nuclear waste facility to a height of about eight stories.</p>
        <p>On her way into a recent Jazz game, Leslie Birkett, a 42-year-old advertising executive from Kearns, said she had heard the nicknames for the arena: HazzMat Center, Half-Life Arena, Radium Stadium, the Tox Box.</p>
        <p>''Utah already has enough strikes against it,'' Ms. Birkett said. ''This is the last thing we need.''</p>
        <p>More disgusted was Tom Kessler, 66, a hard-core fan wearing a leather Jazz jacket. ''Utah's always been the 'stick-it' state; whatever you don't want in your state, stick it here,'' said Mr. Kessler, an executive with a medical device company. ''We're not tree huggers, but these guys lend credence to bringing all this stuff to Utah. It's bogus.''</p>
        <p>But another Jazz fan, Weston Anderson, 21, of West Valley City, felt differently. He first learned about the company when he passed people carrying signs at a pregame protest sponsored by Heal Utah, Mr. Anderson said. The arena's new name does not roll off the tongue, he said, ''but I don't have a problem with that line of business because I believe in the free market.''</p>
        <p>The alliance has called on Mr. Miller to rescind the naming-rights deal, and on consumers to boycott his other businesses, which include car dealerships, movie theaters, a television station and an auto racetrack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller issued a statement saying he was proud of his association with EnergySolutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Creamer has said his company is vital to Utah's future, has brought dozens of talented scientists and engineers to the state, and hopes to become a worldwide business for transporting, processing, storing and disposing of radioactive materials.</p>
        <p>The company recently won a federal grant to study sites that might be used for reprocessing nuclear fuel, a recycling process in which plutonium is extracted from spent fuel and mixed with uranium to make new fuel.</p>
        <p>But this year, the company had a setback with the Utah government. Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. vetoed legislation that would have made it easier for the state to approve proposals for new or expanded nuclear waste sites.</p>
        <p>In a letter to state legislators, Mr. Huntsman said the bill would have weakened the governor's authority ''to protect Utah's image and environment.'' His administration has invested in strengthening Utah's image as a welcoming place for tourists, especially those attracted to outdoor activities in the state's mountains and forests. Part of that push has been a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, ''Utah: Life Elevated,'' featuring the state's landmarks and landscapes.</p>
        <p>EnergySolutions also has embarked on a media campaign, emphasizing the company's environmental cleanups nationwide and the safety of its operations.</p>
        <p>Kedrick Black, a 26-year-old electrical engineer and Jazz fan, said he learned about the company from its advertisements. ''It's a good company,'' Mr. Black said. ''Yes, they handle nuclear waste, but they're making it safer.''</p>
        <p>Vanessa Pierce, executive director of Heal Utah, does not see it quite that way. EnergySolutions' advertisements ''make it look like they're curing cancer and building golf courses'' and solving global warming, Ms. Pierce said. She accused the company of trying to mislead the public by promoting a wholesome image to gain support for the waste site expansion.</p>
        <p>At the protest outside the arena, Louis Borgenicht, 64, a Salt Lake City pediatrician, told those gathered that EnergySolutions officials ''are part of the problem, not, as they claim, part of the solution.''</p>
