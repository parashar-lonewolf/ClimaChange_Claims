        <p>A bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles has stalled in the California State Assembly, the latest legislative setback for environmental groups.</p>
        <p>If passed, the measure would be the first to restrict automotive emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases thought by many scientists to be linked to global warming. The bill directs the California Air Resources Board to develop a plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by January 2005, to be put into effect for the 2009 model year.</p>
        <p>The bill has met with staunch opposition from the auto industry, which is concerned that it could be used as a template by other states.</p>
        <p>''It's ultimately going to cost consumers more if this passes,'' said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. ''The way you do this is to make cars lighter, smaller and less powerful, and that's not what California consumers want.''</p>
        <p>The bill was passed by the Assembly in January, but it was sent back after the Senate added amendments. This time, an advertising campaign by the auto industry has helped derail the proposal.</p>
        <p>''We're a couple votes shy,'' said Julia Levin, California policy coordinator for the Union of Concerned Scientists. ''The auto companies have definitely managed to peel off a few votes.''</p>
        <p>The bill does not offer specific goals on how far state regulators should go in cutting emissions, nor does it propose ways to do it. Instead, it tells the air resources board to come up with a plan for the ''maximum feasible reduction'' in emissions.</p>
        <p>That open-ended mandate has led the auto industry, in advertisements, to suggest a number of possible outcomes. One ad, headlined ''Who Decides What You Drive?'' said the measure could result in higher gasoline taxes, lower speed limits, surcharges for sport utility vehicles and even fees for every mile driven.</p>
        <p>Proponents say that less severe steps are likely, like requiring automakers to make improvements by using more fuel-efficient technologies or measures to expand public transportation.</p>
        <p>John Dutra, a Democratic assemblyman from Fremont, outside San Francisco, said he voted for the bill the first time but was opposed this time. He said he had expected the Senate to add an amendment requiring approval by the Legislature of any plan the air resources board developed. ''I don't think that decision should be made by a five-member appointed body,'' Mr. Dutra said, adding, ''It's a decision that could have a serious economic impact.''</p>
        <p>Fremont is home to a large assembly plant that is a joint venture of Toyota and General Motors.</p>
        <p>Fran Pavley, the sponsor of the proposal and a Democrat whose Southern California district includes Malibu, said the bill did give lawmakers a year to review the proposal but did not require a vote to approve it.</p>
        <p>Referring to the air resources board, she said, ''We put that gap in there to shine the light on A.R.B. and say 'we're going to pay attention to these regulations and make sure they're cost-effective and achievable.' ''</p>
