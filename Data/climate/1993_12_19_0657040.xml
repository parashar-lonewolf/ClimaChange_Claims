        <p>Responding to lawsuits by New York State and three environmental groups, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rules that would further reduce acid rain by depriving electric utilities of some of the allowances permitting them to emit pollutants.</p>
        <p>The new regulations, proposed without fanfare last month, have been denounced by the utility industry. Utility companies say the rules are being issued so late that there is no way of making them a part of the utilities' planning for an acid-rain cleanup that by law must begin in 1995.</p>
        <p>One of the industry's opponents, Timothy J. Burke, executive director of the Adirondack Council, called the rules "a major victory" and said they would cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, by a cumulative total of two million tons over five years, 1995 through 1999. The council was one of the parties bringing suit, because the Adirondacks are believed to be one of the areas most vulnerable to damage to woods and lakes from acid rain.</p>
        <p>But the Environmental Protection Agency gave a more modest estimate of the effects of its proposed regulations. The agency said that if the rules are adopted, as is expected early next year after a period of public comment, sulfur dioxide emissions would be cut by about a million tons over that five-year period.</p>
        <p>That would mean a total five-year reduction of 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide under the overall Government-mandated program to attack acid rain. That compares with a reduction of 14 million tons if the program proceeded under earlier rules, issued by the environmental agency at the beginning of this year. Flexibility Rules at Issue</p>
        <p>It was those earlier rules, laying out how the utilities must achieve the acid-rain goals mandated by the Clean Air Act of 1990, that brought suits against the agency by the Adirondack Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>At issue in the dispute was how flexible utilities could be in reaching a goal set by the law -- cutting the current annual level of 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions in half starting in the year 2000. One way was allowances: a utility that did not pollute as much as the law allowed could sell its excess rights to a utility that polluted above the legal cap.</p>
        <p>The law also allowed utilities to earn extra pollution credits, a scheme tied to the two phases of the cleanup program. Phase 1, from 1995 to 1999, required the companies to reduce pollution emitted by about 110 plants, generally the largest and dirtiest.Phase 2, beginning in 2000, required them to clean up the hundreds of others. But under the law, the utilities could earn credits by cleaning up Phase 2 plants early and could use those credits to reduce their Phase 1 obligations.</p>
        <p>The problem, as environmentalists saw it, was that the law set a base year of 1985. That meant that companies that had cleaned up Phase 2 plants as much as five years before the Clean Air Act was passed, in some cases because state governments had required them to do so, could claim credits for those cleanups so that they could delay reducing sulfur dioxide at their Phase 1 plants. New Base Year</p>
        <p>The effect, the environmentalists said, was to transform a provision aimed at flexibility into a loophole that allowed the companies to do less work and emit more pollution in Phase 1.</p>
        <p>The new regulations proposed by the environmental agency last month would address that issue by preventing the utilities from claiming any Phase 2 credits for cleanups that were performed before 1991, the year after Congress enacted the law.</p>
        <p>In attacking the new rules, spokesmen for the electric power industry described them as not only too late but also unfair.</p>
        <p>Norman W. Fichthorn, a lawyer for the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a Washington-based trade association, said some utilities "saw the handwriting on the wall" in the late 1980's and took the environmentally responsible step of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions then, before they were required to do so. They should not be punished, he said, through denial of credits for those cleanups.</p>
        <p>One of the companies that would have fewer allowances as a result of the change is American Electric Power, an investor-owned utility based in Ohio, that stands to lose credits whose current market value totals about $2 million a year. John M. McManus, the company's director of acid rain compliance, complained that "after going through an extensive process" that led to the first set of regulations, "the E.P.A. decided on their own that they would come out with a revision." The old rules, he said, should stand.  Uncertainty Is Increased</p>
        <p>In addition, utility spokesmen said rules changes like these only added to industry uncertainty that was already discouraging the pollution-credit trading that Congress intended to promote. The utility industry, by nature generally conservative, has been skittish about buying and selling in a market where it has no experience, and as a result this market has been slow to develop.</p>
        <p>"The E.P.A. has changed its mind once already," said Mary K. O'Toole, system environmental engineer at Commonwealth Edison in Chicago. "If there was hesitancy to trade before, it's going to be increased now."</p>
        <p>Still, none of the several utility executives interviewed foresaw major financial damage as a result of the change. Indeed, some companies -- those that continue to earn extra credits -- would presumably benefit, since the price of allowances would rise as the supply was reduced.</p>
        <p>In the thin trading thus far, the current market price for the right to emit a ton of sulfur dioxide is about $180, less than half what some utility executives had predicted.</p>
