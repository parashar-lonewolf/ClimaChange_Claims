        <p>LEAD: Darting back to Earth between two storms, the space shuttle Atlantis landed safely here this morning after sending the Galileo spacecraft on a six-year journey to Jupiter.</p>
        <p>Darting back to Earth between two storms, the space shuttle Atlantis landed safely here this morning after sending the Galileo spacecraft on a six-year journey to Jupiter.</p>
        <p>The shuttle, with five astronauts aboard, left a trail of sonic booms as it crossed the California coastline at Malibu, flew inland, made a right turn and landed on a dirt runway in the Mojave Desert at 9:32 A.M.</p>
        <p>''Congratulations, Atlantis, on an outstanding mission,'' said Ken Cameron, an astronaut in Houston who was in radio contact with the shuttle as it landed, his voice broadcast by loudspeakers at the runway. ''You've extended the shuttle's reach to the outer planets.''</p>
        <p>''Roger, it's nice to be home,'' replied the shuttle commander, Capt. Donald E. Williams of the Navy.</p>
        <p>An estimated 20,000 people were on hand, many of them high school students who whooped and yelled as the shuttle came into view. Lands Between Storms</p>
        <p>The astronuats spent 4 days, 23 hours and 42 minutes in space, two orbits of 90 minutes each fewer than planned. Mission controllers ordered the crew to come back early to avoid high winds forecast for later this morning and Tuesday, when a storm front is expected to move into southern California.</p>
        <p>Another storm moved out of the region in the predawn hours, leaving seven miles of visibility and light winds on Runway 23, where the shuttle landed. Had head winds exceeded 27 miles per hour or crosswinds gone above 15 m.p.h., the shuttle would have had to land at least a day later.</p>
        <p>Dr. William B. Lenoir, acting associate administrator for space flight at NASA, said that because of the worries over high winds, the astronauts did not conduct the usual tests of the braking and steering systems on landing. The shuttle stood up to the heat and pressure of re-entry, he said.</p>
        <p>The landing was the 30th by a shuttle and the fifth by Atlantis.</p>
        <p>The shuttle lifted off Wednesday afternoon into a clear sky after two postponements last week. On the fifth orbit, the crew released the $1.5 billion Galileo spacecraft, backed away and watched an hour later as Galileo's rocket boosted the craft out of Earth orbit. The craft will orbit Jupiter and release a probe into its atmosphere. A Million Miles Away</p>
        <p>Galileo has completed about one million miles of its 2.5 billion-mile journey to Jupiter, said Dr. Neal Ausman, the mission director of the Galileo program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, who drove to Edwards for the landing.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the laboratory tested Galileo's 12 thrusters today by firing each one briefly, Dr. Ausman said. ''We're exercising all the plumbing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ausman said that although laboratory officials were ''pleased that we had a good ride, we're pleased that we're not going to be dependent on the space shuttle as the alternative way to space.''</p>
        <p>After a spacecraft designed to explore Mars is launched by the shuttle next year, he said, future missions to explore the solar system will use unmanned rockets.</p>
        <p>The Galileo mission was delayed several times over the last seven years because of conflicts in shuttle scheduling and the Challenger disaster in January 1986.</p>
        <p>After launching Galileo, the crew measured the Earth's ozone layer, observed nighttime lightning strikes, recorded how molecules and ice crystals form in the absence of gravity and studied the effects of weightlessness on plant growth hormones. Also on the Atlantis crew were Comdr. Michael J. McCulley of the Navy; Dr. Shannon W. Lucid, a biochemist; Dr. Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, a physicist; and Dr. Ellen S. Baker, a physician.</p>
