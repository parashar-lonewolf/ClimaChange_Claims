        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would like to comment on issues you raise in ''Brazil Burns the Future'' (editorial, Dec. 28).</p>
        <p>The Brazilian people and Government were shocked and deeply saddened by the assassination of Francisco Mendes Filho, a leading trade unionist and environmentalist in the state of Acre. High-ranking officials from the Ministry of Justice, Federal Police Department and local police are conducting investigations, which have already resulted in the arrest of four men, and it is expected that other suspects will soon be put under arrest.</p>
        <p>Brazil does not want to burn its future. Brazil has an enormous potential to be developed. We Brazilians hope to make our development aspirations compatible with preservation of our natural heritage. Since the 1970's, and mainly during the present decade, a deep awareness of our ecological problems has arisen. We acknowledge, however, that our national agencies lack sufficient means and work under very difficult conditions.</p>
        <p>The new Brazilian Constitution dedicates a chapter to preserving the environment. Last October, President Jose Sarney began a program to promote environmental education, reclaim ecosystems affected by human action and protect indigenous populations and other people involved in exploiting natural resources.</p>
        <p>Brazil is fully aware of the importance of preserving the environment and of the global implications of ecological problems, including the nuclear threat and the threats caused by chlorofluorocarbons, carbon dioxide, and radioactive and toxic wastes. Unfortunately, in Brazil, especially in the Amazon region, political will is not enough. The environmental challenge demands huge technical and financial resources to be properly dealt with. If this is true for well-to-do countries, one can imagine the immensity of the challenge for Brazil and most other countries. We welcome positive suggestions and expertise from the international scientific community and environmental organizations.</p>
        <p>If the dramatic fires of last year in the Amazon region drew worldwide attention, let us not forget that environmental problems are not limited to what is happening to tropical forests. The greenhouse effect, global warming and climate changes are of concern to all, especially those who lack technological and financial resources, and for centuries have been absorbing the pollution brought on by the industrialized centers. Only one major country is responsible for approximately 20 percent of the global greenhouse effect. The same applies in the case of the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>Let us also not forget that there are many complicated features to Amazon deforestation, such as the traditional Indian burnings (''coivara''), agro-industrial projects, spontaneous fires, industrial projects and new human settlements.</p>
        <p>Brazil is a developing country with enormous infrastructure problems. It is enduring a serious economic situation that jeopardizes its social and economic development prospects, as is true of other tropical developing countries. This, I am certain, has a very negative world impact. Let us not burn our common future but build together a lasting world environment.  MARCILIO MARQUES MOREIRA  Ambassador of Brazil  Washington, Jan. 10, 1989</p>
