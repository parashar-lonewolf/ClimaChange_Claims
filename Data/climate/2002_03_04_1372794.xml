        <p>Up and down the East Coast, scientific evidence is revealing the extent and severity of what could be the deepest drought of the past 100 years. Forest fires in Maine, usually snuffed by snow, burn to the ground. The Potomac River has dipped to historic lows. New England is experiencing one of its driest winters since records started being kept. The United States Drought Monitor, a joint project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and various academic partners, has classified the entire coast from Georgia to Maine as in ''severe'' or ''extreme'' drought conditions. A good spring rain will not solve this problem.</p>
        <p>Hints that the East would be unusually dry began appearing many months ago in rainfall and streamflow reports. Yet water managers and policymakers failed to move quickly enough to conserve water and improve water efficiency. Even now, efforts to prepare the public for the drought have mostly been limited to warnings and calls for voluntary restraint.</p>

        <p>Up and down the East Coast, scientific evidence is revealing the extent and severity of what could be the deepest drought of the past 100 years. Forest fires in Maine, usually snuffed by snow, burn to the ground. The Potomac River has dipped to historic lows. New England is experiencing one of its driest winters since records started being kept. The United States Drought Monitor, a joint project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and various academic partners, has classified the entire coast from Georgia to Maine as in ''severe'' or ''extreme'' drought conditions. A good spring rain will not solve this problem.</p>
        <p>Hints that the East would be unusually dry began appearing many months ago in rainfall and streamflow reports. Yet water managers and policymakers failed to move quickly enough to conserve water and improve water efficiency. Even now, efforts to prepare the public for the drought have mostly been limited to warnings and calls for voluntary restraint.</p>
        <p>And the East Coast is not alone --  central North America, from Mexico across the Great Plains and into the Canadian prairies, is experiencing droughts. Tensions have been growing since 1998 between Texas and Mexico over low flows in the Rio Grande. Farmers in southern Oregon went to battle with the government and the environmental community last summer over water shortages in the Klamath River basin.</p>
        <p>Droughts are a natural part of our climate system. They occur in different regions every year in the United States, costing us an average of $6 billion, principally from lost agricultural production, reduced hydropower generation and the effects of forest fires. California suffered a six-year drought from 1987 to 1992, causing widespread harm to ecosystems. The Dust Bowl in the 1930's eventually affected three-quarters of the nation and led to mass movements of refugees.</p>
        <p>We know how to reduce the effect of droughts. But we rarely act before conditions deteriorate to a crisis. As John Steinbeck wrote in ''East of Eden'': ''And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.''</p>
        <p>We can no longer afford to forget about the dry years. We must begin to reduce our wasteful use of water. There are two choices: become more efficient and productive in our water use or cut back on things we want to do. We know how to use water more productively. Water-efficiency efforts in California, Israel and New York City have shown that a combination of education programs and voluntary limits can quickly reduce short-term needs for water by 10 percent or even 20 percent.</p>
        <p>But experience also shows that responding to severe droughts with voluntary efforts alone is not enough. In the longer term, there must be actions at both the local and federal levels. Permanent reductions in demand will have to come from local pricing policies that encourage more productive use of limited water resources, new federal standards for more efficient technologies and the elimination of subsidies that promote waste. For example, new types of washing machines, toilets and garden irrigation systems can permanently reduce the amount of water we use in our homes by 30 percent or more. Reducing federal subsidies for low-valued, high-water-using crops can encourage farmers to shift to more water-efficient crops and irrigation methods.</p>
        <p>There is more bad news. The evidence is growing that this year's drought could be merely a taste of the future. Last week, the NOAA released evidence showing that the past three months were the warmest on record for the entire United States. For the planet as a whole, January 2002 was warmer than any January in 123 years. A report prepared for President Bush and Congress last year found that extremes of weather created by global warming could have severe consequences for the nation's water resources.</p>
        <p>We are already seeing strong evidence that humans are influencing the climate. In addition to rising temperatures, rainfall and snowmelt patterns are changing, glaciers are receding, and the flows of our rivers and streams are being altered. Is the current drought also a result of climate change?</p>
        <p>We don't know for sure. But we do know that unless effective policies are put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which now seems unlikely, climate change will be unavoidable. We have no choice now but to try to anticipate and minimize the consequences. Let's treat the current drought as a dry run for what may become an even drier one.</p>
