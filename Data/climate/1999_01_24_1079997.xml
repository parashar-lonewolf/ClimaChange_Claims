        <p>LAST November, the TriBeCa Ecomat, a cleaner that shunned a potentially carcinogenic solvent used by most dry-cleaning companies, closed its doors. It was a quiet death for a shop that had had a noisy birth.</p>
        <p>In June 1997, the outlet had opened to the cheers of Harvey Keitel, the actor, and his neighbors at 39 North Moore Street. They had fought for more than a year to evict a traditional dry cleaner from the ground floor of their building. And at the beginning, many people scurried to try the new ''green'' cleaner.</p>
        <p>But when the shop, which used a water-and-detergent method called wet cleaning, started shrinking clothes, patrons quickly lost confidence. Traditional cleaners argue that water will ruin some clothes and that it is simply too labor-intensive for many fabrics. But environmental advocates say that management problems and not problems of the alternative cleaning method led to the demise of the Ecomat.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, the woes of the TriBeCa shop are not unique. Ecomat is the major operator of ''green'' dry cleaners in the city. Of its five shops here -- it also has three outside the city -- two have closed and two are open but up for sale. The stock price of Ecomat, which is based in Mamaroneck, N.Y., was $4.12 at its 12-month high; recently it has been trading for just a few cents..</p>
        <p>Troy Morano, Ecomat's director of operations, acknowledged particular problems with the TriBeCa store, but said that the company was reorganizing and that wet-cleaning technology had improved.</p>
        <p>In any event, state and local officials now hope to help Ecomat and other entrepreneurs give a lift to the nascent green dry-cleaning industry in New York City. Empire State Development, a state agency, will award $200,000 in federally financed grants to existing dry cleaners to help buy washing machines that use alternatives to perchloroethylene, or perc, the suspected carcinogen and the most common dry-cleaning solvent. The grants will be awarded to between 20 and 30 cleaners and will pay for 20 percent of the cost of a new machine, up to $10,000. Last week, the agency began a series of workshops to explain how to apply for the grants by the April 30 deadline.</p>
        <p>Grant recipients can buy computer-controlled wet-cleaning equipment, but officials also want to award grants for three new methods that use hydrocarbons, glycol ether or carbon dioxide instead of perc. The agency will also help the cleaners obtain loans for the rest of the machines' cost.</p>
        <p>A new wet-cleaning machine starts at $18,000; a hydrocarbon one costs $50,000.</p>
        <p>''This will help jump-start the use of alternative technology,'' said a spokeswoman for Empire State Development, Maura Z. Gallucci. Cleaners who win the grants must open their shops and records to state officials, who hope to learn if the new methods cut pollution, satisfy customers and make economic sense to cleaners.</p>
        <p>Perc is a powerful degreaser, which makes it popular with cleaners. But studies of humans and animals have linked perc -- one of the pollutants at the heart of the legal battle in Jonathan Harr's book ''A Civil Action'' -- to cancer and neurological damage. Dry-cleaning workers are at the greatest risk from perc, but studies have also shown increased risks to people who live above dry-cleaning establishments, like Mr. Keitel and his neighbors.</p>
        <p>The situation is particularly troubling for New York City, which has 933 dry-cleaning shops operating inside residential buildings, according to the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Chicago, the American city with the second-highest number of dry cleaners situated in apartment buildings, has only 75, said David DeRosa, who leads Greenpeace's Toxic Campaign Dry Cleaning Project.</p>
        <p>But there are problems as well with alternatives to perc, said Bill Seitz, the executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association. City officials have not yet approved glycol ether or hydrocarbon machines, and may require cleaners using them to install expensive safety equipment, he said. The carbon-dioxide machines will not need such safety measures, but they raise practicality issues. The ones made by Micell Technologies cost $150,000 and weigh 10 tons, and only a limited number of them will be available this year.</p>
        <p>Wet-cleaning machines require no special environmental permits and are available now. Wayne Edelman, president of Meurice Garment Care, which has two Manhattan locations, cleans up to 30 percent of the clothes at his shop with wet-cleaning methods in the summer, when customers bring in less wool. Many stains, like sweat, wine and food, come out best with wet cleaning, he said, but cleaning wool and some other fabrics with water is too difficult.</p>
        <p>''Wet cleaning is a great tool,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''But it's just like a plumber who comes to fix your sink. He has more than just a screwdriver in his tool box.'' For this reason, he believes that wet-clean-only shops will have difficulty succeeding.</p>
        <p>Robert Morrison, who led the fight at the North Moore Street building, argues that perc is as dangerous to people's health as lead paint or asbestos. Mr. Morrison said he would rather have shrunken clothes than cancer. Nevertheless, after Ecomat shrank some of his clothes, he returned to a traditional dry cleaner.</p>
        <p>Although it has yet to turn a profit, the Ecomat outlet in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has a damage claim rate of 2 percent, below the industry standard of 4 percent, said Aaron Shiffman, director of economic development for the Fifth Avenue Committee, a nonprofit community development group that runs the store on a franchise from Ecomat. The store turns away just 2 percent of customer clothes as uncleanable by its methods, Mr. Shiffman said.</p>
        <p>''We take a little longer, but your garment won't shrink,'' Mr. Shiffman said.</p>
        <p>State rules on the use of perc, including a requirement that many shops install vapor barriers, have prompted some traditional dry cleaners to look at the alternatives, state officials said. But if the regulations are the stick, the grant program is the carrot.</p>
        <p>''This project isn't just about giving grants,'' said Tria Case, director of Empire State Development's Office of Environmental Business Services. ''It's about figuring out what the alternatives are and figuring out how they work and getting them through the regulatory process.''</p>
        <p>NEW YORKERS &amp; CO.  Correction:  January 31, 1999, Sunday  An article last Sunday about dry cleaners who use solvents other than perchloroethylene, a suspected carcinogen, misstated the application deadline for finanical aid for cleaners to buy machines that use alternatives. It is April 1, not April 30.</p>
