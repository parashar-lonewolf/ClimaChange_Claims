        <p>LEAD: President Reagan overrode opposition from senior Navy officers and told Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today that he would approve a Canadian purchase of nuclear submarines using American reactor technology.</p>
        <p>President Reagan overrode opposition from senior Navy officers and told Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today that he would approve a Canadian purchase of nuclear submarines using American reactor technology.</p>
        <p>The President assured Mr. Mulroney that he would also recommend to Congress that it approve the transfer of the sensitive nuclear technology.</p>
        <p>The United States has been wary of sharing its nuclear technology with other nations, and previously had allowed only Britain to use the reactor technology. To Acquire 10 to 12 Subs</p>
        <p>Canada is planning to acquire 10 to 12 nuclear submarines to patrol its territorial waters beneath the Arctic ice cap. It is considering the British Trafalgar-class sub as well as French vessels.</p>
        <p>If it decides on the British submarine, which employs American technology in its reactor system, consideration by both Congress and the President would be required. This is necessary under the agreement that covered the original sale to Britain of the technology for the Trafalgar-class subs.</p>
        <p>The nuclear submarine issue was only one of many matters, including trade policy and the environment, discussed by the two leaders as Mr. Mulroney's visit to Washington began today. About half of a meeting this morning was spent discussing acid rain, which the Canadians regard as the sorest issue between the two countries. Opposition in Navy to Deal</p>
        <p>Senior United States Navy officials have expressed opposition to a Canadian-British submarine deal. They have voiced concerns that the United States could be blamed for a nuclear accident aboard a submarine with an inexperienced Canadian crew. They also have expressed the belief that Canada's limited defense budget should be spent elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In Canada, senior officials have dismissed Washington's publicly expressed concerns, including the desire to avoid accidents aboard Canadian submarines, as a pretext. They contend that the reason for the United States Navy's opposition to the Canadian plan is that the Canadian submarines could locate American nuclear submarines that regularly use the channels and passages that thread through Canada's Arctic archipelago, on missions that currently go unreported to Canada.</p>
        <p>For two decades, Canada has been increasingly concerned about challenges to its sovereignty in the Arctic, but it has been unable to persuade the United States to acknowledge Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage, the main waterway through the archipelago, or to agree to notify Canada of American submarine activity in the region. The Canadians say this policy is short-sighted because it could invite penetration of the area by Soviet subs seeking polar routes to missile-firing stations within reach of American targets.</p>
        <p>In addition to the naval officers, some members of Congress have also expressed doubts about the wisdom of the submarine technology transfer. Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, a state where nuclear submarines are constructed, said in a statement today, ''My own private discussions among our senior military reveals a skepticism which will be explored extensively.'' He said he planned to call hearings on the issue.</p>
        <p>But after today's meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mulroney, a senior Administration official said: ''After a careful review of the views of his senior advisers, the President has determined that if the Canadians selected the Trafalgar design, the interests of the United States are best served by agreeing to the British request. We have so informed both the British and Canadian Governments.''</p>
        <p>In their discussions on acid rain, Mr. Mulroney urged President Reagan and Congress to act to reduce the problem, which he said was ''despoiling'' both countries. Members of Congress responded enthusiastically to the proposal, but the President reportedly gave Mr. Mulroney little encouragement.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is pollution from coal and oil burned by power plants, factories and vehicles, chiefly oxides of sulfur and nitrogen that are transformed chemically as they travel through the atmosphere and settle on the surface of the earth as acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles. The Canadian Government has repeatedly complained that acid rain originating in the United States is destroying its eastern lakes and forests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mulroney told Mr. Reagan today that an agreement between the two countries to end the destruction caused by acid rain was ''inevitable'' and that ''it was not a question of whether but when, and the sooner the better,'' senior Canadian officials reported.</p>
        <p>The President said he would ''reflect'' on Canada's proposal for an agreement between the two countries to limit the pollution that causes acid rain, the Canadian officials reported.</p>
        <p>But they also said that in response to Mr. Mulroney's plea, the President repeated the ''predictable American view'' that the United States had already made progress in reducing such pollution, that it is committing money to develop technology to enable coal to burn cleanly and that the scientific evidence of the damage caused by acid rain is not clear.</p>
        <p>While not completely slamming the door on a plan to control acid rain, the President left the Canadians with little hope he would act on this issue.</p>
        <p>While he did not specifically appeal to Congress over the President's head, Mr. Mulroney made a strong plea in his speech to a joint meeting of the House and Senate today for United States action to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, a chief component of acid rain, by 50 percent. His exhortation was vigorously applauded.</p>
        <p>Legislation to amend the Clean Air Act, including provisions to reduce acid rain, is pending in Congress.</p>
        <p>In his speech to Congress today, Mr. Mulroney called acid rain ''a rapidly escalating ecological tragedy,'' in the United States as well as in Canada.</p>
