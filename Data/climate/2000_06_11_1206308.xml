        <p>In the future, as today, a newt will lose a power struggle with a predator -- a lizard, say. The lizard will make off with a newt leg, but the rest of the newt will stay behind. There's a bit of blood, but belly to the ground, the newt will retreat to a damp spot under a rock. Several weeks will pass, during which the newt will make its living barely hindered by an incrementally growing stump. In six weeks, the lizard conflict will be nothing but a bad memory: the newt will be walking and swimming with a new limb indistinguishable from the original.</p>
        <p>In the future, man -- severed from limb -- will do just the same. In the new paradigm, a traveler who loses his arm in a power struggle with, say, his jetpack, will be rushed to a hospital to have his wound cleaned. But instead of pulling mature skin over the amputation plane, doctors will bathe the area with growth factors. In newts, growth factors are derived from nerves. Humans lack this combination of molecules, but researchers will, by this point, have produced a human homologue to the newt's special juice.</p>
        <p>Triggered by these molecules, cells near the wound will begin to form a blastema of unspecialized but highly proliferative cells. These cells will, in turn, form something akin to a limb bud, the nascent limb that first protrudes from the flanks of a developing embryo. The bud will elongate until it forms a flattened paddle, which will eventually form nubs that grow into a thumb and four fingers -- complete with fingernails and fingerprints. ''It's only a question of time,'' says Bjorn Olsen, a professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School. ''A vertebrate is a vertebrate. Obviously, newts have something that we have lost.''</p>
        <p>That something, lost far back along our evolutionary line, is the ability for cells in a severed limb to de-differentiate -- to go backward in their development to the point where they resemble progenitor cells and can start growing again. It's these cells that, under the guidance of genetic switches and the coaxing of proteins, called growth factors, turn themselves into bone, muscle, nerves, veins and fat tissue. A great deal of the bioengineering know-how that will set this process in motion is well in hand. An interdisciplinary army of geneticists, bioengineers, chemical engineers, physicists, materials scientists, physicians and molecular and cell biologists are, right now, growing tissue from progenitor cells derived from animal embryos or from blood or bone marrow. Technicians place undifferentiated cells on a biodegradable scaffold -- a collagen polymer, for example -- that's coated with the appropriate growth factors. The scaffold is then set inside a bioreactor, a growth chamber equipped with stirrers and sensors that disposes of the cells' waste products and douses them with the appropriate amounts of nutrients and gases, like oxygen and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''The cells know exactly what to do, if they're placed in the right conditions,'' says Anthony Atala, a surgeon at Children's Hospital in Boston. ''They have all the genetic information; they just need the signals to grow.''</p>
        <p>Regenerating a limb could be, in the next decade or two, a mere assembly job of coordinated parts -- muscles, bone, skin -- grown in vitro, seeded upon scaffolds and stimulated by growth factors. But such methods will seem crude in comparison with what the genomic revolution will eventually make possible. Because the programming instructions for growing a human body reside in every human cell, in the form of 46 chromosomes that contain roughly 100,000 genes, most cells, properly stimulated, could set the regrowth of a limb in motion. (Humans can already replace the distal tips of their fingers, a phenomenon documented mostly in children.) Scientists will first have to parse the sequence of gene activation and protein expression that triggers tissue growth from progenitor cells. The next step will be identifying the switches that coordinate limb development. Knowing when, and in what order, to pull the levers will allow humans to recapitulate development.</p>
        <p>Just how futuristic is limb regeneration in humans? ''Things are going so fast,'' says David Gardiner, a research biologist at the University of California at Irvine. ''First we have to find the key, and then we'll find the ignition. But I believe we're going to see ignition in 30 years. We will do this in our lifetime.''</p>
        <p>If you lose a limb and elect to grow a new one, how long will the finished product take? It's difficult to say. Broken bone separated by a millimeter gap closes up in one day. Bone that's not growing toward itself grows more slowly. But researchers may eventually be able to turbocharge growth factors to speed up the process. In one type of salamander, the cells that initiate regeneration get flipped within 48 hours of amputation, and the complete limb takes only five to six weeks to regenerate. The original limb took three years to reach adult size. While all vertebrate arms are similar, it's very unlikely that regrowth ratios would be.</p>
        <p>Olsen of Harvard says: ''I'd wait five years to grow a new hand of my own. I think it's definitely worth it.''</p>
