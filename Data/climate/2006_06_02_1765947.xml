        <p>WHEN Heidi and Sam Bailey stumbled on a waterfront lot at Shavehead Lake in Cassopolis, Mich., last July, they knew it would be a perfect spot for their second home. It was two hours from their primary residence in Chicago, where Mr. Bailey works as a commodities broker, and the kind of place that they could bring their two young daughters to relax in old blue jeans.</p>
        <p>But in building their lake house, now in its final days of construction, the Baileys also used old blue jeans for insulation. They also used soy-based cellulose for the exterior walls, low-flow toilets and recycled concrete and drywall. It was all part of an effort to make their vacation retreat as green as possible, with eco-friendly features that were missing from their Lincoln Park home in the city.</p>
        <p>''I kept reading about environmental issues and seeing buildings go up and Dumpsters being filled with junk -- and part of it might have been a little bit of guilt that we were building a second home,'' said Ms. Bailey, 36. ''So I said, O.K., if we're going to do this, we have to do it right and make as little impact as possible.''</p>
        <p>Vacation homes have been sprouting throughout North America for 150 years or more. Now, these sprouts are becoming increasingly green, as a combination of good intentions, guilt and the quest for bragging rights spur owners of second homes to go green. Deterred by costs or logistics from retrofitting their primary homes, many are instead funneling their newfound eco-consciousness into their retreats. The shades of green range from using recycled materials in mountain hideaways to planning beach homes that sell power back to the electric company.</p>
        <p>''We're getting people doing million-dollar houses with composting toilets,'' said John Abrams of South Mountain Company in Martha's Vineyard, which designs and builds solar-paneled and salvaged-lumber second homes on an island that is sometimes better known for its sprawling energy-suckers. There is no such thing, Mr. Abrams said, as a ''sustainable'' second home, since owners use fuel to get there, and houses cannot be constructed entirely out of recycled materials.</p>
        <p>''But it's great to now have people who approach us and say, 'We want a zero-energy home,' '' he added.</p>
        <p>John Beldock, the founder and chief executive of EcoBroker.com, said that in three years, his group, which trains real estate agents in energy and environmental issues, has more than tripled, and is now in 31 states, with many potential second-home owners hoping to find a place that will idle efficiently in their absence. ''They want it to be an asset rather than a liability,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And for those who want to build, it's becoming, on many fronts, easier than ever to find a contractor who is ecologically minded. The National Association of Home Builders has announced that by the end of next year, at least half of all builders in the United States will be calling themselves green. A new, standardized rating system from the United States Green Building Council helps them verify the claim.</p>
        <p>''THERE'S just all this awareness right now -- global warming, the conflict in the Middle East, rising oil and gas prices,'' said Jay Hall, acting program manager for the Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Homes program, known as LEED, now in its pilot phase. ''People are realizing, 'Maybe I need to be a little bit more environmentally conscious.' It's happening with hybrid vehicles, and there's a spinoff effect in homes.''</p>
        <p>David and Lynn Eikenberry spend their weekdays in a 1918 brick colonial in Andover, Mass., and most weekends and vacations in what was intended to be a four-car garage in Kirby, Vt., near the Burke Mountain ski area. When its owner heard about a pending windmill project that might spoil his view, he sold it, allowing the Eikenberrys to convert it to a vacation home.</p>
        <p>''We did an addition in Andover and we didn't do it green; we felt like there were some bad choices,'' said Mr. Eikenberry, 46. ''So this time we felt, like, you know, do the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Working with Danny Sagan, a Montpelier, Vt., designer and architecture professor, the Eikenberrys transformed the shell of the garage into a passive solar home (one that maximizes absorption of the sun's heat in winter and minimizes it in summer) with radiant heating, formaldehyde-free foam insulation and plywood walls. Even in the bitter-cold winters of northeastern Vermont, Mr. Sagan said, the Eikenberrys, who have a 10-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter, can stay serene in Kirby. ''If the power goes out,'' he said, ''the pipes are not going to freeze in because the house cools down really slowly.''</p>
        <p>On a recent Sunday morning, when Wally, a coon hound, knocked a mug of hot chocolate onto the floor of their new home, Ms. Eikenberry, 44, just laughed. ''We went with concrete floors because for heat and biomass they're much better than wood,'' she said. ''But they're also completely indestructible for the dogs and the kids.''</p>
        <p>The house is surrounded by 37 acres of fields where two nearby farmers regularly harvest hay. Eventually, Ms. Eikenberry said, a windmill of her own might grace the yard, but not much else will.</p>
        <p>John Messerschmidt and his wife, Helena Starcevic, planted clover behind their second home in High Falls, N.Y., near New Paltz, as one of the many ecologically oriented renovations they've undertaken over the past year and a half. It's a stopgap, he said, until they can move out of New York City and build a home that generates its own electric power.</p>
        <p>''Here in Manhattan, we have no control over the heating or the insulation or the windows in our apartment,'' said Mr. Messerschmidt, 46. ''And I can't afford to buy a hybrid car. So we use organic cleaning products and eat organically, and in High Falls, we're trying to be as green as possible -- do the best that we can with what we've got.''</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Messerschmidt works in the construction industry, he said, he has learned firsthand about making more ecologically conscious choices during the last few years. Others are turning to the Internet for resources -- the Eikenberrys, for example, discovered Mr. Sagan through Co-op America's Green Pages. Kimberly Garner searched online for recycled materials to outfit a new retreat in Silverton, Colo.</p>
        <p>Ms. Garner, who admitted she was ''oblivious'' to environmental issues when growing up in north Florida, said that she was determined to be off the grid, use recycled products and keep the house smaller than 25 by 25 feet.</p>
        <p>The size of second green homes can be a thorny subject. Clients often want to build big, Mr. Abrams said. But as Richard Faesy, the project manager for the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, pointed out, a not-so-big house is more environmentally responsible. ''The house size determines not only how much material goes into it, but also how big a hole you dig and how much energy you use over time,'' said Mr. Faesy, who oversees the LEED pilot program for New York and New England.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faesy and other environmentalists scoff at the idea of an environmentally friendly vacation house. ''The greenest second home is one that is never built,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Homeowners, too, have some mixed feelings about taking actions that undermine their environmental commitment. Greg Cantori, a Maryland-based foundation director, purchased 75-acre Frost Island off Nova Scotia and is planning a 450-square-foot home with solar and wind power, a graywater system -- which recovers waste water from sinks and drains for other use -- and a compost toilet. Still, though, the small house and green materials require some fouling of nature. ''We'll likely use an outboard engine, a generator, power tools and even a borrowed ATV for the hauling,'' Mr. Cantori said, calling such methods ''evil.''</p>
        <p>But even green second homes can cause headaches. Last January, while Ms. Garner was away, a storm in Silverton drained her solar batteries, and the back-up generator failed. ''There were icicles coming out of the faucet, and the toilet bowls were like little skating rinks,'' Ms. Garner said. ''It's a high-maintenance house.''</p>
        <p>Building green typically adds 5 to 10 percent to the total price tag, according to Monica Marsicek, the publisher of Ecological Home Ideas. But as the practice becomes more mainstream and competitive, she said, that premium should decline.</p>
        <p>For now, many people who have the money to own a second home and an awareness of environmental issues seem willing to spend the extra dollars. ''For those clients who do feel a little awkward about it, doing it sustainably helps offset some of the potential stigma or paradox quality,'' said Nathan Good, an architect in Salem, Ore., who designed an energy-neutral second home in Cannon Beach, Ore., that has become a nationwide model of green building. .</p>
        <p>New owners of green second homes share their ecologically friendly techniques with friends, pointing out photovoltaic systems or straw-bale walls, in a mix of environmental education and one-upmanship. ''It's the keeping up with the Joneses,'' Mr. Faesy said. ''Just like having the latest, greatest S.U.V. or VCR or flat-screen TV.''</p>
        <p>When friends come up to visit in Vermont, they are enchanted by the green living concepts in one of the greenest of states, the Eikenberrys said. But an S.U.V.? Please.</p>
        <p>''We still have never owned one,'' Ms. Eikenberry said. ''We drive up here in a Subaru. You make choices all along the way, and anything you do right is better than not doing it.''</p>
