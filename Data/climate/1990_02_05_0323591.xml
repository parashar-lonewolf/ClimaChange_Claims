        <p>LEAD: The horrors of nuclear war are hard to exaggerate. That hasn't stopped proponents of the ''nuclear winter'' theory, who announced in 1983 that the soot from a large nuclear war would blot out sunlight and create weeks of icy darkness. The result could be ''global environmental changes sufficient to cause the extinction of a major fraction of the plant and animal species on the Earth,'' wrote a group of eminent biologists in Science magazine.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The horrors of nuclear war are hard to exaggerate.

        <p>The horrors of nuclear war are hard to exaggerate. That hasn't stopped proponents of the ''nuclear winter'' theory, who announced in 1983 that the soot from a large nuclear war would blot out sunlight and create weeks of icy darkness. The result could be ''global environmental changes sufficient to cause the extinction of a major fraction of the plant and animal species on the Earth,'' wrote a group of eminent biologists in Science magazine. ''In that event, the possibility of the extinction of Homo sapiens cannot be excluded.''</p>
        <p>Predicting the extinction of humankind is incautious, as Paul Ehrlich, Peter Raven, Carl Sagan, George Woodwell, Thomas Eisner, Stephen Gould, Robert May, Ernst Mayr and others would probably now acknowledge. New calculations suggest something less apocalyptic. Far from chilling the continents to 40 degrees centigrade below freezing, temperatures, according to recent estimates, wouldn't even drop to freezing. A nuclear chill, maybe, but hardly winter.</p>
        <p>These new calculations don't make the world safe for a nuclear exchange: the primary effects of nuclear war were quite terrifying enough before the forecasts of nuclear winter. But they raise anew the old question of how far to believe even eminent experts who warn of doomsday unless society heeds their prescriptions.</p>
        <p>The nuclear winter episode bears directly on present discussion of the greenhouse effect - the feared warming of the world's climate by pollutant gases. Here are some lessons relevant to both issues:</p>
        <p>Beware scientists grinding axes. Despite the impersonal style of articles in scientific journals, the authors still have passions and pet policies that may affect the conclusions. The proponents of the nuclear winter hypothesis also advocated reduction of nuclear weapons. It turns out they did not err on the side of minimizing the effects of nuclear winter. Environmentalists who warn of greenhouse warming know they have to guard against similar predilections.</p>
        <p>Don't expect instant answers. The status of nuclear winter has evolved considerably. Discussion of the greenhouse effect is gradually becoming more sophisticated. Testing and debating ideas takes time.  Don't dismiss iconoclasts. Science is rife with defenders of established theories. The proponents of nuclear winter deserve substantial credit for spotting an effect that every expert had overlooked for 40 years. Though their first estimates turned out to be far too large, they've turned out to be right in principle. Those who say the greenhouse warming has already begun are also valuable voices, even though the point is far from proved.</p>
        <p>Remember the limits of computer models. Forecasts of both nuclear winter and the greenhouse effect depend on computer models. But these don't predict even the present climate perfectly, let alone future climates deranged by nuclear soot or greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>The rise and fall of the nuclear winter notion does not discredit climate modeling or the idea of a greenhouse effect. To the contrary, it shows a creative and skeptical process of inquiry at work. But computer models are unlikely to give final answers. Hence there's no reason to delay embarking now on steps against greenhouse warming worth taking in their own right, like conserving energy, phasing out chemicals that destroy the ozone layer and protecting tropical forests.</p>
