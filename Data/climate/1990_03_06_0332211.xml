        <p>LEAD: Governors Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Jim Florio of New Jersey today criticized the clean air bill offered as a compromise last week by Senate leaders and the Bush Administration, saying it would impede their ability to fight air pollution.</p>
        <p>Governors Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Jim Florio of New Jersey today criticized the clean air bill offered as a compromise last week by Senate leaders and the Bush Administration, saying it would impede their ability to fight air pollution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo said in a statement that the compromise had valuable provisions but that amendments would be needed ''to attain our goal: assuring every American citizen healthy air to breathe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio expressed similar concerns in a letter to the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. Mr. Mitchell was a chief architect of the compromise, which was reached after a month of negotiations with the White House.</p>
        <p>The legislation would amend the Clean Air Act of 1970 to deal with unsolved air pollution problems, including acid rain, urban smog and toxic airborne chemicals. Senate leaders, giving ground to White House demands for a less costly effort, agreed to less stringent standards and a slower cleanup schedule. That concession angered some environmentalists and lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Stiffer Controls Are Urged</p>
        <p>Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said the bill proposed insufficient controls on tailpipe emissions, which are a major contributor to smog; on small factories and shops that also create smog, and on toxic chemicals in the air. Mr. Lautenberg said he would introduce amendments to strengthen these and other provisions.</p>
        <p>The associations of state and local officers who administer the Federal air pollution law also criticized the agreement today and called for changes that would strengthen their authority to crack down on polluters. ''If we are to be successful in providing our citizens with healthful air,'' they told Senator Mitchell in a letter, ''we must have strong regulatory tools with which to work; this agreement falls short of providing us with those tools.''</p>
        <p>James M. Lents, the president of the local air pollution control group, said the proposed compromise could lead to ''a new economic war between the states.'' Without a provision requiring the Federal Government to step in when states or cities are not complying with the law, he said, the way would be cleared for polluting industries to ''shop around from state to state to find those areas promising the least regulation.''</p>
