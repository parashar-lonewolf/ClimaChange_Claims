        <p>In a lab at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Arthromitus bacteria, fungi, slime molds and the fossilized remains of 2-billion-year-old microorganisms surround the biologist Lynn Margulis. It's lunch time and she slides a petri dish aside to unpack a container of homemade soup. Here in germ microbe, a setting that would make the Future Homemakers of America flee in horror, Margulis, 44, calmly halves bagels with a knife that she has wiped on her black slacks. "There are no TB cultures here, no pathogens," she shrugs. No, but there are four-inch-long flying cockroaches in terrariums, the carcass of a  Madagascan fire millipede above the microwave oven and several cubic inches of termites, whose hindguts Margulis will later slice up to study under a microscope.</p>
        <p>These hindguts, it turns out, contain millions of bacteria and larger microbes, without which termites could not digest wood. Margulis has staked her  career on her belief that it was no random mutation in the termite's genes that  drove the creature to this evolutionary point, but was instead a symbiotic affiliation with cellulose-digesting microbes and bacteria. Her symbiogenetic theory of cell evolution, which explains this transformation, may be the closest thing we have to a paradigmatic shift in our time.</p>
        <p>Most scientists would be content with spurring one revolution, but Margulis was onto something new before her symbiogenetic theory was out of its infancy. The notion that living organisms were profoundly connected she would soon write  large with the Gaia hypothesis, which holds that the earth is a self-regulating  entity that maintains the terrestrial and atmospheric conditions that make life possible. Originally viewed as wildly unscientific, the idea has, over the  20 years that Margulis has helped nurture and tweak it, slowly lost some of its  heretical edge and even gained support in certain quarters -- if not as a falsifiable theory then as an innovative lens through which to view the natural  world. In their models of global ozone change, the recent Nobel laureates F. Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina and Paul Crutzen inadvertently expanded on Gaian  ideas. And now that Washington has even begun to accept global warming as fact,  more and more scientists are peering through the same Gaian lens.</p>
        <p>Margulis's preeminence in her field is now assured. "She's one of the most original and creative biologists of our time," says Niles Eldredge, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History. If she weren't so busy researching whether microbes form the basis of our sense organs, she might even  be enjoying a last laugh.</p>
        <p>In the cool groves of academia, Margulis is a hot-head, provocative and prone to hyperbole. She is a self-confessed misanthrope, a woman to whom the human species "reeks of arrogance fraught with ignorance." All religion is delusional. Human flesh is not sacred. She can barely disguise her contempt for some of her  critics, who are blind, she says, to 80 percent of our planet's history, the more than 2.5 billion years that preceded the appearance of animals. When she's on a roll, it's easy to wonder if the force of Margulis's personality may  have been more threatening to her critics than the force of her ideas.</p>
        <p>Margulis grew up in Chicago, the daughter of "scientific idiots" -- a lawyer  and a "glamorous housewife." At 14, she began studying science and philosophy at the University of Chicago. At 16, Margulis met the young Carl Sagan and married  him two years later. She became a microbe freak. ("Laminated, brightly striped sediment underlaid by gelatinous mud especially moves me as I contemplate the efficiency and animation of its microbial inhabitants," she once wrote, seriously.) At the University of Wisconsin, Margulis's genetics professors tried to discourage her from studying the genes that resided outside cell nuclei, in the cytoplasm. She didn't listen.</p>
        <p>With a master's degree in zoology and genetics, Margulis moved with Sagan to  the University of California at Berkeley, where she completed her Ph.D. in genetics. The couple then moved to Boston, where she continued her research while caring for their two children and teaching full time at Boston University. Sagan, avidly pursuing his own career, was less than helpful to Margulis. In 1963, she divorced him. "As a 16-year-old, I learned a great deal from him," she says. "In marriage, I had nothing but hindrance from him."</p>
        <p>In 1965, she married Thomas (Nick) Margulis, a chemist, and had two more children. Margulis's new husband was far more supportive than Sagan, but her work often took precedence over domestic responsibilities. Her marriage foundered after she accepted a fellowship in California. In 1978, she left her second husband.</p>
        <p>Margulis's pace has always been frenetic. Outside the lab, she operates a writing factory devoted to the appreciation of microbes: she churns out scientific articles (130 and counting), book chapters, slide sets, films, videos, posters, booklets and reviews. She just published book No. 16, "What Is  Life?" Aimed at a general audience, the book, written with her 36-year-old son,  Dorion Sagan, traces the history of life from bacteria through lichens, to primates and around again to microbes, which form the center of Margulis's intellectual universe.</p>
        <p>Margulis also reads prodigiously, and has more than a passing familiarity with a vast range of scientific literature. To a student who mentions an interest in phosphates, which are found in fecal matter, she barks out, " 'The Biogeochemistry of Vertebrate Excretion': read it!" During a typical meeting, she will hop up 10 times to pull books and journal articles off her shelves, offering proof, illustrations, quotes. Didactic and slightly maddening, it's a mechanism that probably evolved over years of constant professional attack.</p>
        <p>Early one morning, Margulis squeezes between rows of plants in the university's greenhouse. From a cycad, a tall, long-leafed plant, she collects a root that she'll inspect under the microscope. She stops to poke at what appears to be a layer of dried slime in a tray. This slime is Margulis's white rat, a microbial mat from Baja California. The layers of microbes are continually eating, breathing, having sex, fermenting and releasing gases into the atmosphere -- an ecology that Margulis understands intimately.</p>
        <p>It was Margulis's expertise in the metabolism of microbes that led her, in the mid-70's, to the British atmospheric chemist James E. Lovelock. After measuring atmospheric gases for years, Lovelock suspected that living organisms  had a greater affect on the atmosphere than was recognized. Margulis concurred.  Before the evolution of plants and animals, bacteria and larger microbes dominated the earth, each interacting with the atmosphere's gases. Lovelock and  Margulis proposed that the earth's biota still runs the show, regulating the terrestrial and atmospheric conditions that make the planet habitable -- neither too hot nor too cold, the oceans neither too salty nor too acidic. The chance of all this happening coincidentally, Lovelock believed, was just about nil. He decided to call their hypothesis Gaia, for the ancient Greek goddess of the Earth.</p>
        <p>Certainly, organisms do affect the environment: vertebrates build up mineral  deposits, like guano; microbes wear down rocks and produce soil; mammals exude methane. But Margulis and Lovelock also proposed that plankton act as a living thermostat, helping to regulate global temperature; that bogs and peat lands, as they grow and shrink, affect glaciers as the organisms within them release and absorb greenhouse gases; and that colonies of bacteria and other microbes in tidal mud flats process enough salt to help keep ocean salinity fairly constant.</p>
        <p>From day one, the world's response to the Gaia hypothesis, as presented in its developers' papers, was mixed. Lovelock's personification of Earth attracted new-agers and goddess worshipers. But this was not the company Margulis wanted to keep, and she warned Lovelock against deifying Mother Earth. In one of the more unlikely alliances in the history of the environmental movement, "deep ecologists" and world-class polluters championed Lovelock: the former saluted the Gaian tenet that humans were no more or no less important than other organisms, and the latter made hay from the idea that Gaia could look after herself, come global warming or acid rain. Mainstream environmentalists, says Lee R. Kump, from the Earth System Science Center at Penn State, "thought he was handing the world a license to pollute." Lovelock, in turn, deplored environmentalists who insisted the planet was fragile, a victim of man's excesses.</p>
        <p>An outspoken advocate of population control and biodiversity, Margulis nonetheless insists that Gaia can take care of herself. "Gaia is a tough bitch," she says. "People think the earth is going to die and they have to save it. That's ridiculous. If you rid the earth of flowering plants, people would die, period. But the earth was without flowering plants for almost all of its history. There's no doubt that Gaia can compensate for our output of greenhouse  gases, but the environment that's left will not be happy for any people." It will, however, be happy for microbes.</p>
        <p>TWENTY YEARS AGO, GRANT MONEY to study the more complicated aspects of Gaian  science did not flow. (Margulis receives most of her financial support now from  NASA, always interested in how life on other planets could be recognized.) Scientists who had applauded Margulis's work on the origin of eukaryotic cells,  or cells with a nucleus, called the Gaia hypothesis heretical, or a fantasy. "This has hurt her reputation," says W. Ford Doolittle, director of the Program  in Evolutionary Biology at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. "Lynn is a freethinker, vocal and forceful, but sometimes she is wrong. Gaia is a philosophy, not science."</p>
        <p>Opponents condemned the theory for being teleological, for asserting that natural phenomena are determined by an overall design or have an ultimate purpose. Gaia's arch antagonist, the Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins, dismisses the hypothesis because, among other reasons, it presumes that bacteria produce gases that benefit the world. "That can't happen in a Darwinian world," he says. "Those individual bacteria who don't put themselves to the trouble of manufacturing this gas for the good of the world will do better" -- that is, they will outreproduce their public-spirited colleagues, and the gene for producing that gas would disappear. Still, the majority of scientists remained silent on Gaia. Perhaps they were reserving judgment, afraid to challenge Margulis. She had been proved right once before.</p>
        <p>Margulis began investigating the origin of eukaryotic cells more than 30 years ago. Everyone knew the nucleus contained DNA, but Margulis, taking a cue from scientists of the early 1900's, focused on the stray genes outside the nucleus, in the cytoplasm. She boldly interpreted these as remnants of ancient bacteria, smaller cells that at one time cohabited within larger microbes. She imagined a scene like this: 1.4 billion years ago -- about the time that oxygen  became abundant in the atmosphere -- one fast-swimming, oxygen-breathing bacterium invaded another microbe that was still making its living the old-fashioned way, without oxygen. The host failed to destroy the invader, a truce was declared and over time the cells became dependent on each other. The effect was synergistic: the host gave the invader a continuous source of food, and the invader gave the host greater swimming speed and a way to survive in the brave new world of oxygen. To support the theory that complex cells were collections of smaller organisms, Margulis drew on examples from throughout the  cellular world.</p>
        <p>Margulis's findings may seem like a minor illumination of an obscure corner of history. In fact, she had solved one of evolution's greatest mysteries, the progression from prokaryotic cells, without a nucleus, to eukaryotic cells. "Lynn's theory was the signal event in cell biology," Doolittle says. "She made  a major contribution." Instead of the standard tree of life, with branches reaching outward, Margulis drew a tree with widely separated branches growing back onto one another, forming a phylogenetic web.</p>
        <p>At first, the establishment scorned such ideas. Fifteen times she submitted her findings to academic journals and 15 times they rejected her. She applied for grants from the National Science Foundation and was rebuffed. But she continued collecting data, reworked her paper and, in 1967, published her theory in The Journal of Theoretical Biology. The response was thunderous silence.</p>
        <p>Margulis's work wasn't so much resisted as ignored. "What people do when they don't like the idea is they don't confront it head on, because then they'd have  to learn something," she says. "My work more than didn't fit in. It crossed willy-nilly the boundaries that people had spent their lives building up. It hits some 30 subfields of biology, even geology."</p>
        <p>Margulis differed from many of her colleagues in pinpointing the engine of evolution. Biologists agree today that natural selection works on variations that offer organisms a survival advantage, but Margulis holds that the most significant source of variation is not only mutation but mergers. Random mutations, she says, may change appearances, but there's no indication -- in the fossil record, in the field or in laboratory experiments -- that they alone create new species. The acquisition of symbiotic organisms, however, is a source of evolutionary novelty, and she is happy to produce a living example.</p>
        <p>Margulis examines her inch-long root, which resembles an anemic piece of ginger, under the microscope. "Look at this," she says, indicating specks of a blue-green bacteria. "Those dots are cyanobacteria." These bacteria weren't present in the cycad's seeds. But within 24 hours of germination, cyanobacteria  appeared inside the newly sprouted root.</p>
        <p>"They'd argue that a series of mutations made this organ, and I'd argue that  that's not enough." The cyanobacteria in the plant, she adds, are more similar to the cyanobacteria in the soil than they are to any other aspect of the plant  tissue, demonstrating, as Margulis says, "that symbiogenesis, rather than the accumulation of mutations, is the documented mechanism of major evolutionary change."</p>
        <p>DESPITE THE Indifference of academia, Margulis persisted. In 1970, she expanded her original paper into a book, "The Origin of Eukaryotic Cells." Years passed, during which data supporting the theory of symbiogenesis accumulated. Eventually, the scientific community had to take note. In 1979, Margulis won a Guggenheim. In 1981, she rewrote the book and renamed it "Symbiosis in Cell Evolution." It is a classic of 20th-century biology.</p>
        <p>In 1983, Margulis was invited to join the prestigious National Academy of Sciences. The victory was a triumph of intellect and tenacity, the sweeter for being so hard won. But Margulis's reputation was hardly burnished. Symbiogenesis was becoming accepted doctrine, but why was she messing with that crackpot idea, Gaia?</p>
        <p>Because it had merit. In response to critics, Lovelock devised complicated mathematical equations, "autocatalytic" models and theories that involved "nonequilibrium thermodynamics" to explain how self-regulation could have been jump-started. No theory answered all the questions, but gradually the emphasis moved away from a Gaian proof per se and toward specific investigations. A cottage industry of scientists arose testing organic feedback mechanisms -- processes in which two elements of a system affect each other simultaneously. "If there are feedback loops involved, the potential for self-regulation exists," Kump, from Penn State, says. "In systems theory and electronics, this is not a radical idea. But you don't often come across this in the traditional literature of biology: they think this is a far-out process."</p>
        <p>One area of scrutiny is the plankton-cloud relationship. Scientists had long  known that plankton exude dimethylsulfide, or DMS, which diffuses into the atmosphere. But in 1987, Robert J. Charlson, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues proposed that DMS, when  exposed to air, forms sulfate particles around which water condenses. The clouds cool the earth. More recently, others showed a correlation between DMS levels and the brightness of clouds over the Southern Hemisphere. Still, no one has shown that plankton and marine clouds work in concert to keep temperatures stable. It may take years to quantify the relationship between plankton, atmospheric conditions, temperature and the amount of light that clouds reflect  but, as Margulis likes to say, the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution haven't been proved yet either.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Margulis and Lovelock have denied the claim that the earth acts purposefully; they now say that the earth's living organisms maintain relatively constant surface conditions. Earth-systems scientists have reformulated many other planks in the Gaian platform, publishing more than 100 papers related to the subject in the last decade. Researchers are currently investigating how soil microbes, as they break down rocks, affect climate by either removing from or releasing into the air large amounts of carbon dioxide;  how the gases released by algae may have affected the formation and melting of glaciers, and the effect of forest fires on atmospheric oxygen levels.</p>
        <p>"Gaia's biggest impact is to get people who are willing to listen to think about earth-systems problems from a slightly different perspective," Kump says.  Doolittle concurs: "Political and environmental issues are the most important we face, so anything that spurs research is good." He adds, ineluctably, "It's too  bad Gaia can't attract more mainstream people."</p>
        <p>TODAY, MARGULIS CONTINUES TO work on symbiogenesis, trying to prove that spirochetes (spiral-shaped, highly motile bacteria) are the ancestors of undulipodia, whiplike structures that give locomotion to sperm and to cilia, which clean and lubricate our lungs and trachea. Undulipodia have been shown to  be the basis of sensory perception in animals. The rod-and-cone light receptors  of mammalian eyes, the kinocilium of the inner ear, even the antennules of lobsters inarguably share aspects of the same detailed structure as undulipodia. Margulis has an intuitive sense that these cellular structures were once free-living spirochetes.</p>
        <p>Her most daring claim is that the axons and dendrites that allow communication between brain cells are also descendants of spirochetes. Perception, thought, speculation and memory, she proposes, may be large-scale manifestations of bacterial remnants trying to grow, feed and reproduce in our brains. "All I ask is that we compare human consciousness with spirochete ecology," she says.</p>
        <p>So far, this hypothesis has attracted only critics, but Margulis remains undeterred. "The data is starting to come in now," she says confidently. "It's the same as in the 70's. At first they'll pooh-pooh it, then they'll question the data, then they'll accept it."</p>
        <p>Margulis has said that the only way behavior in science changes is when "certain people die and differently behaving people take their place." She has a point: Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift wasn't accepted until after  his death, when plate tectonics were discovered. The same may happen with the Gaia hypothesis, her debunking of neo-Darwinism and her spirochete theory.</p>
        <p>"I haven't convinced everybody, and I know it will be a while," she says with insouciance. "There will be tweakings, certain modifications as we learn more, but it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. I know it's right."</p>
