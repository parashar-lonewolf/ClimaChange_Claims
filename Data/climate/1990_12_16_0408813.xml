        <p>Back in the 1960's, when the space program started testing rocket motors in a big tract of swamp near here, many people felt proud and patriotic about the loud noises and smoke plumes in their woods.</p>
        <p>Those kinds of feelings for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are now rare. What once was a symbol of America's scientific superiority has lost prestige everywhere due to some spectacular failings, and along this stretch of the Gulf Coast the space agency is now commonly viewed with fear and distrust.</p>
        <p>The dispute here is over a plan by the agency to test a new rocket motor for the space shuttle. Despite repeated assurances from NASA, many residents fear that the tests, each of which will release 350 tons of chemicals into the woods about 12 miles from Main Street, will pollute the environment and endanger the public.  'Nothing but Moonshine'</p>
        <p>Unlike the liquid-fuel motors that have been tested here in the past and that produce exhaust made up of water vapor, the new one uses solid fuel and produces an exhaust composed of hydrogen chloride gas, particles of aluminum compounds and other chemicals.</p>
        <p>"When NASA first came in, there was nothing much but moonshine in Hancock County, and it was really great for us to feel like we had something to do with sending Americans to the moon," said Dr. Bert Chevis, a local physician.</p>
        <p>"That was when the space program was like a young, top-of-the-line surgeon," he said. "Well, it's gotten to be like an old doctor that's forgetful and doing things upside down all the time."</p>
        <p>In recent months apprehension over pollution from the rocket exhaust has suddenly produced long petitions and loud protests at public meetings.</p>
        <p>Next week state officials are to start considering whether the John C. Stennis Space Center, named for the state's Senator from 1947 to 1989, should receive the environmental permits it needs to start construction at the testing site so that the first rockets can be fired on schedule in 1994.  Fight May Go to Court</p>
        <p>This application process is likely to become a major stumbling block for the shuttle program because angry citizens have vowed to take their fight to the courts, if necessary.</p>
        <p>Support for the program comes primarily from the business community in the area, which has an unemployment level that is consistently above the national average, which was 5.9 percent in November. Fred Sullivan, president of Darkat Inc., a management consulting company that helps small businesses applying for NASA contracts, said, "We feel the environmental question has been answered, and as far as the economy is concerned, we dare not turn our backs on this opportunity."</p>
        <p>But Lisa Cowand, a member of the Hancock County Board of Supervisors, said the promise of an economic contribution by the space complex had not helped the agency's position here. "The rocket might mean some new jobs in the short term," she said. "But, if they build it, no businesses are ever going to want to move down here again, and we'll end up the losers in the long term."</p>
        <p>The space agency's plan calls for the new motors to be fired while anchored to the ground in a horizontal position. Seven such tests would be conducted in the first two years of the program and two a year after that.</p>
        <p>The exhaust from the 1.2 million pounds of fuel in each firing would shoot from the device's nozzles at a temperature of 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit and at a speed of 5,500 miles an hour. The space agency says a ramp would deflect the exhaust upward and that air currents would carry it away before it could seriously harm any people or wildlife.  Concerns About Exhaust</p>
        <p>Opponents of the test argue that in certain kinds of weather the exhaust would remain close enough to the ground to endanger thousands of people close by and to pose risks as far away as New Orleans, 50 miles southwest of Bay St. Louis. They argue that hydrogen chloride gas in the exhaust will come down as acid rain, bringing with it particles of aluminum compounds that can increase the risk of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>The space agency disputes those assertions.</p>
        <p>Although pollution is the main point of the dispute, NASA's problems with its Hancock County neighbors reflect a broader distrust of the space agency that was brought about by the 1986 Challenger disaster and a number of subsequent mishaps, including the computer malfunctions and plumbing problems in the latest shuttle mission. Also this week a Federal advisory panel issued a report calling for drastic changes in the agency's approach to space exploration. A central recommendation of the panel is that NASA rely less on shuttles and more on unmanned rockets.</p>
        <p>"We don't believe that NASA knows what they're doing," said Robert Esher, head of environmental research at a Mississippi State University research unit located at the Stennis Space Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esher has played a leading role in arousing public opposition by providing an expert view that challenges NASA on the scientific aspects of the environmental dispute. But he has also been relentlessly attacking NASA's integrity.</p>
        <p>"They've done all they could to keep the truth from coming out," he said at a public hearing last week on the NASA permits. The hearing drew 750 people from this town of 7,000.  'Falling Apart'</p>
        <p>The shuttle, he said, "is falling apart." And in his toughest assertion, he said, "I think when we look back in history at the Challenger disaster, we know what NASA is like. NASA knew three years before that those rings were leaking." The 1986 Challenger explosion, which killed seven astronauts, was linked to the failure of rings designed to prevent hot exhaust gases from escaping.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Esher was finished, the crowd gave him a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>The extent of the skepticism in the auditorium was evident when Thomas Sones, 16 years old, the president of the student government at the Hancock County High School, added his voice to the opposition. The school, about two miles from the proposed test complex, would be among the first structures affected if the fumes did not behave as NASA predicts.</p>
        <p>"Personally I think there's a lot of hiding," he said.</p>
        <p>As the hearing ended, Roy Estess, director of the space center, wearily defended his agency. "We have an expert test team we believe is the best in the free world," he said. "We're proud of what we do. We don't back away from it at all. It's based on the best engineering judgment our country has to offer."</p>
        <p>The Advanced Solid Rocket Motor, or ASRM, as the device to be tested is known, is the third version of a motor that has been launching the shuttle since it first flew in 1981, and it resembles the others in many ways. Tests in Utah</p>
        <p>NASA has plans to use the new solid-fuel rocket motor on the shuttle for 30 years. Although the advisory panel report this week suggested that the shuttle program be curtailed in favor of unmanned rockets, the new shuttle motor would likely play a role in whatever launching system might replace the shuttle because developing all-new technology could severely delay the space program.</p>
        <p>The two previous versions of the shuttle engine were manufactured and tested in a part of Utah that is mostly desert and is relatively remote. And much of the debate here centers on whether the Mississippi coast is an inherently more dangerous place to conduct such tests.</p>
        <p>In addition, some local residents assert that NASA revealed one of its basic flaws by even considering this place for the tests.</p>
        <p>When Congress considered plans for the new motor in 1987, Representative Jamie L. Whitten, Democrat of Mississippi, suggested that it be built -- but not necessarily tested -- at an abandoned nuclear power plant in his district about 300 miles northeast of here. NASA saw the wisdom of this recommendation from Mr. Whitten, who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and has great influence on the agency's budget.</p>
        <p>After the decision was made to build the motors in northeastern Mississippi, NASA considered several testing sites, and eventually chose to test the motors here because of concerns about the cost and difficulty of transporting the huge motors large distances, said Rebecca McCaleb, environmental projects officer at the Stennis Space Center.</p>
