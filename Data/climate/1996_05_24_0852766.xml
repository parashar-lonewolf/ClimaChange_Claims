        <p>Less than half of American adults understand that the Earth orbits the Sun yearly, according to a basic science survey. Nevertheless, there is enthusiasm for research, except in some fields like genetic engineering and nuclear power that are viewed with suspicion.</p>
        <p>Only about 25 percent of American adults got passing grades in a National Science Foundation survey of what people know about basic science and economics. Even fewer of those surveyed felt they were well informed about the technical subjects.</p>
        <p>The survey of 2,006 randomly selected adults was carried out last October by the Chicago Academy of Sciences for the science foundation. Conducted in random  telephone interviews, the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>The worst showing came when those surveyed were asked to define scientific terms. Only about 9 percent knew what a molecule was, and only 21 percent could  define D.N.A., the genetic material. But even more fundamental questions stumped many: less than half knew that the Earth orbits the Sun annually.</p>
        <p>In a test of environmental understanding, one-third of Americans surveyed understood the effects of a thinning of the ozone layer, 14 percent could identify locations of ozone holes and only 5 percent could give a scientific explanation of acid rain.</p>
        <p>Even money questions stumped most Americans. A 10-point quiz on economics showed that only 22 percent could correctly answer seven or more of the questions.</p>
        <p>"Only 10 percent feel very well informed about science and technology, and studies show that only a small segment of the population has a strong grasp of basic scientific ideas," according to a report released today by the foundation.</p>
        <p>On a 10-part quiz testing scientific understanding, only 27 percent of the American adults surveyed could answer seven or more questions.</p>
        <p>Despite a fundamental lack of understanding, the survey found that 72 percent of American adults believed science research was worthwhile. The survey, however, found many Americans fearful of some aspects of science like nuclear power and genetic engineering.</p>
