        <p>I KNOW there are people with bad childhood memories about peas.</p>
        <p>Some grown-up stood over them saying ''Eat your peas,'' as they stared into a little mound of cold mush.</p>
        <p>But I grew up eating peas fresh from the field, steamed for only a few minutes and served in a little bowl, topped with butter. Like corn, peas are full of natural sugars, which begin turning to starch as soon as they are pulled from the vine, so they should be rushed to the steamer or boiling pot, or eaten raw.</p>
        <p>I used to graze on them in the field, popping open the pods and admiring how neatly the peas were lined up inside the pleasantly waxy shells. I learned, from greed, that the biggest peas in the fattest pods were starchy, not sweet; that the tiniest peas, inside flatter pods, were sweet, but lacking the almost nutty flavor of a perfectly ripe pea.</p>
        <p>St. Patrick's Day is traditional pea-planting time around southern New York and New Jersey, right on down to my garden in Maryland. Anywhere the soil is just becoming workable: crumbly, not wet, and cool but not cold to the fingers.</p>
        <p>Last weekend I planted my shelling peas -- Lincoln, the old-time heirloom some swear to be the sweetest pea in the world; Green Arrow, a prolific producer; and Wando, which is my fail-safe pea, because it is bred to tolerate both heat and cold.</p>
        <p>Peas, which are believed to have originated in Asia, generally thrive in cool weather. But on Saturday, as I stuck my spade into one of the raised beds of my kitchen garden, I was almost alarmed at how warm and loose and even dry the soil was. It was 75 degrees in the sun. The next day, it was 80 degrees.</p>
        <p>March, of course, is a variable month, but 80-degree days before the spring equinox (March 20 this year) make me nervous.</p>
        <p>''The ideal soil temperature for a pea to germinate is about 60 to 65 degrees,'' said H. Chris Wien, a professor of horticulture at Cornell University. ''Temperatures in the 80's and 90's are unfavorable.''</p>
        <p>Peas will actually germinate as soon as the soil warms to 50 degrees. And air temperatures in the 40's and 50's won't harm the seedlings.</p>
        <p>''They will just grow slowly, and take longer to reach flowering,'' Professor Wien said. But that's better than fast growth, spurred by hot weather, which produces weak vines and peas that turn too quickly to starch.</p>
        <p>The perfect spring, from a pea's point of view, is a long, cool April that extends right into May. But who knows what's in the cards this year. We all should keep daily garden journals, recording temperatures and the progress of crops, from planting to germination to harvest. That's the best way to understand, firsthand, how global warming, or anything else, is affecting plants in the garden.</p>
        <p>Apart from the right temperature, edible garden peas, which grow on vines that vary in height from two to seven feet, need some kind of fence or trellis for support. Unlike bean vines, which wind around a string or post, pea vines pull themselves up by tendrils, which need wires or netting or even branching sticks to grab hold of. Otherwise, the seedlings wave around like lost souls, growing slowly, until they flop over on the ground, crisscrossing one another in a tangle of leaves that cannot get enough light or air.</p>
        <p>I like to plant my Lincolns in a trench, about six inches wide and four inches deep, set about an inch apart. I cover them with an inch of soil, pat it down, and then raid my brush pile for some slender, leafless branches to sink into the soil, down the middle of the trench, to give the seedlings support, as soon as they develop their first tendrils. As the seedlings grow, I pull soil down around the stems, to keep the roots cool.</p>
        <p>Lincoln pea vines, with care, will grow to about four feet. I learned the trench method from the late James Crockett, whose 1977 book ''Crockett's Victory Garden'' is one of my most treasured garden possessions. I ignore his advice on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, but his methods of seed-starting, making compost and building a cold frame are timeless.</p>
        <p>This week, weather permitting, I hope to plant snow peas, the flat, edible pods so popular in Chinese dishes, and snap peas, which are a cross between a garden pea and a snow pea, and hardly ever make it to the table because you can't stop eating them right off the vine.</p>
        <p>My favorite snow pea is Mammoth Melting Sugar, known to reach 10 feet, if you give it a tall fence; my favorite snap pea is Sugar Snap, a seven-footer and an All-America Selections winner in 1979 that hasn't, in my opinion, been surpassed by more recent varieties like Super Sugar Snap, a tall climber, or Sugar Bon, a bush type that only reaches two feet.</p>
        <p>I'm going to experiment with two unusual edible podded varieties from Seed Savers Exchange (www.seedsavers.org; 563-382-5990): blue-podded Blauwschokkers, with two-tone violet flowers, from Holland, produces a great soup pea; and a golden sweet pea, found in a market in India, with bright yellow edible pods and two-tone purple flowers, can be eaten whole or shelled for soups.</p>
        <p>I plant these climbers in a double row, about six inches apart, on either side of a tall trellis.</p>
        <p>Sources for these edible peas include Burpee (www.burpee.com; 800-888-1447); Fedco (fedcoseeds.com; 207-873-7333) and Pinetree Garden Seeds (superseeds.com; 207-926-3400). Sweet peas, those fragrant flowering vines, need the same growing conditions as edible peas, so I plant them around the same time.</p>
        <p>I like to make tripods of locust saplings, or tall bamboo, set about the garden, with a few sweet pea seeds planted two inches from the base of each pole. These beautiful climbers come in just about every color: white, pink, rose, cherry red, wine red, sky blue, violet, as well as two-tones. I choose fragrant varieties, like the purple and deep blue Cupani, the crimson King Edward VII and the maroon Black Knight.</p>
        <p>Sources for sweet peas include the companies mentioned above, as well as Select Seeds (selectseeds.com; 800-684-0395); the tripods add vertical interest to the garden (or to big pots set on a terrace). All peas flower, but the sweet peas especially look like colorful butterflies fluttering over a patchwork of low-growing lettuces and herbs.</p>
        <p>Galvanized wire fencing, with four-inch square openings that make for easy picking, or chicken wire stapled onto posts make sturdy pea fences. I have also lashed bamboo or slender saplings together to make a fence with large square openings, which can be lifted and re-set as crops are rotated. Whatever the structure, tailor it to the height of the vines you are growing, with an extra foot for sinking into the ground.</p>
        <p>Peas, which are members of the legume family, are nitrogen-fixers. That means they are able to take in nitrogen from air pockets in the soil and convert it, with the help of bacteria or rhizobia clustered around their roots, into a usable form that fuels plant growth.</p>
        <p>That's why peas don't need extra nitrogen to flourish. And in rotating crops, I always follow nitrogen-guzzlers, like spinach or corn, with peas or beans, to add nitrogen to the soil.</p>
        <p>But it's not the nitrogen I grow them for. It's their almost indescribable flavor, halfway between corn and a fresh peanut. No one ever had to tell me to eat my peas.</p>
