        <p>With the environmental security of America and the world at risk, President Bush is playing a cynical political game. To support his claim that he is an environmentalist, he has apparently decided to attend the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development -- the so-called Earth summit -- in Rio de Janeiro next month. But Mr. Bush is no environmentalist.</p>
        <p>If he were, he would long ago have discarded his fears of the right wings of both parties. He would have had the vision to grasp the leadership of this international effort to control forces that present a greater threat to civilization than the cold war ever did.</p>

        <p>With the environmental security of America and the world at risk, President Bush is playing a cynical political game. To support his claim that he is an environmentalist, he has apparently decided to attend the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development -- the so-called Earth summit -- in Rio de Janeiro next month. But Mr. Bush is no environmentalist.</p>
        <p>If he were, he would long ago have discarded his fears of the right wings of both parties. He would have had the vision to grasp the leadership of this international effort to control forces that present a greater threat to civilization than the cold war ever did.</p>
        <p>Instead, by longstanding indifference, if not hostility, to the Rio meeting and a negative approach to many of its complex issues, the Administration has nearly sabotaged it.</p>
        <p>By holding off on accepting the Rio invitation for months, Mr. Bush discouraged other heads of state from coming, but not some close friends and keen competitors, including Japan, Britain, Germany and Canada. Their leaders understand what is at stake.</p>
        <p>The third world's demand for first world economic and technical help to meet the environmental crisis has brought on a super-crisis of its own. This is the quandary the summit faces, and only first world leadership can solve it. Mr. Bush, supported by his party and Congress and untroubled by the flaccid Democrats, is not providing that leadership.</p>
        <p>Whether he goes to the Rio meeting is now of less importance than the impact of Administration foot-dragging on the issues to be considered there. They include the advance of global warming and the linkage among poverty, population, destruction of forest resources and loss of species in the developing world. Combating these dangers requires major help from the first world.</p>
        <p>No better example of the Government's obtuseness on environmental and economic issues can be found than in its near-sabotaging of the "climate convention" intended for signature at Rio. This treaty would require industrial countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is the most profuse of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming: a catastrophe in the making that, unless checked, will raise sea levels, drown coastal areas and change agricultural production before the end of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Every major industrial nation has agreed to stabilize its carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels within eight years. Only the U.S. has refused to make a legally binding commitment to do so. President Bush has said such a treaty would "put a lot of Americans out of work."</p>
        <p>This is disinformation. The truth has finally leaked out: The Government has just admitted that measures it has taken and is willing to take to increase energy efficiency would come close to meeting the proposed emission goals. The gas industry points out that cutting emissions even 10 percent</p>
        <p>below</p>
        <p>1990 levels by the turn of the century would create more than 80,000 new jobs.</p>
        <p>But without a legally binding commitment to reach these easily attainable levels, promises to try to meet them are evasive at best and deceptive at worst. Politicians' promises are valueless. Commitments in law are something else. Mr. Bush will long since have been out of office by the year 2000, the treaty's deadline. By then, he will (or should) have gone down in history, second only to Ronald Reagan, as America's anti-environmental President.</p>
