        <p>Congress took a science class this month, and some experts would like to make it a regular part of the curriculum.</p>
        <p>''It's not that we are inattentive; it's just that we have the war on terrorism, the Iraq initiative, Social Security, the budget, the list goes on and on,'' said Representative Sherwood Boehlert, a New York Republican and head of the House Science Committee.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Mr. Boehlert said, ''everyone boasts that they are for science-based policy until the scientific consensus leads to an unwelcome conclusion, and then they want to go to Plan B.''</p>
        <p>So now, when scientific questions pervade legislation on issues like climate change and stem cell research, there is growing concern that Congressional misunderstanding can produce misguided policy.</p>
        <p>To fight such misunderstanding, Mr. Boehlert and others sponsored the Jan. 23 briefing, organized by the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Capitol Hill has briefings by the dozen every year in which industry, academic and activist groups address diverse topics related to science.</p>
        <p>Some criticize these briefings as little more than showboating. But Mr. Boehlert, like many others, thinks they are ''absolutely'' useful. And the briefing was unusual in that its subject was not avian flu, the budget for NASA or any other relatively narrow issue, but rather ''how science works.''</p>
        <p>And some on Capitol Hill, notably Representative Rush Holt, a New Jersey Democrat and a physicist, say Congress should address the lack of knowledge and understanding of science by establishing something similar to the Office of Technology Assessment, an agency that advised Congress until it was abolished after Republicans won control of the House in 1994. Prospects for that are uncertain.</p>
        <p>Not everyone thought defining science was even possible, in such a short session. ''It makes me extremely tired that they are going to do this again,'' said Sheila Jasanoff, a professor of science and technology studies at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who has written widely on how science policy is made. ''There is no easily graspable definition.''</p>
        <p>Robert Ferguson, who runs the Center for Science and Public Policy, which also presents briefings to Congress, argued that one of the speakers, Donald Kennedy, editor of the journal Science, had himself politicized the field in editorials on the dangers of climate change, marking him as having political motives.</p>
        <p>He sent critiques of Dr. Kennedy by e-mail to prospective members of the audience so they could ''decide if attending the event is worth your time.''</p>
        <p>But the briefing's subject apparently struck a chord. More than 100 committee staff members, Congressional aides and at least one senator, Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, crammed into a basement meeting room. With all of the seats filled, people leaned on walls, sat on the floor and spilled out into the hall.</p>
        <p>Dr. Eric Chivian, who directs the Harvard center, said he got the idea for the briefing while following the debate over intelligent design and noticing what he called widespread misunderstanding about science.</p>
        <p>''I suspected the same was true in the Congress,'' Dr. Chivian said, adding that he thought it would be useful to consider ''how science should advise policy makers in the most effective way.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Chivian invited Dr. Kennedy and Harvey V. Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm of the National Academy of Sciences, to speak.</p>
        <p>The worth of any scientific finding, Dr. Kennedy told the crowd, is not the prominence of the researchers responsible, the prestige of their institutions or the authority of their funding agencies, but whether other researchers achieve the same results.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kennedy did not refer explicitly to a scandal that is roiling science, and Science -- the discovery that highly praised cloning experiments in South Korea survived the magazine's peer review process to win publication, only to be declared fraudulent. But he said: ''Peer review is not a process that guarantees truth. If it were, no one would ever repeat experiments.''</p>
        <p>Replication, he said, ''is the ultimate test of truth in science.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Fineberg spoke of the way scientific knowledge was turned into information useful to society, a process that he said the National Academy encouraged through its regular production of reports on topics as diverse as national security and arsenic in drinking water.</p>
        <p>The academy's reports are influential, he said, because of its reputation for integrity, because of its avoidance of conflict of interest, because researchers who produce its findings are volunteers and because ''nothing is kept back.''</p>
        <p>Some of the attendees were participants in another effort to bring scientific expertise to the Hill, a fellowship program run by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the nation's largest scientific organization and the publisher of Science. The program places scientists with doctorates in Congressional offices and government agencies.</p>
        <p>The fellows pressed the speakers on their proper role in policy making, the difference between scientific assessments and value judgments, the difficulties of dealing with low-probability-high-consequence problems like bird flu, and the necessity of scientists' making themselves heard in matters of policy, something Dr. Fineberg called ''a civic obligation.''</p>
        <p>Chris Weaver, who has a doctorate in atmospheric science and is working as a program fellow at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the briefing was ''the kind of thing we should be having more of.''</p>
        <p>But outside of forums like the House Science Committee, whose ''excellent'' staff has grown in recent years, Mr. Boehlert said, conversations like this are few.</p>
        <p>''You'll find the odd congressman like Al Gore who will sit down with the boffins and say, explain it to me,'' said Daniel S. Greenberg, author of ''Science, Money and Politics'' (2001), and for many years the editor of the newsletter Science and Government Report. ''But if you look at the voting, it's mostly along party lines.'' He added, ''I don't think many congressmen could answer 10 basic questions'' about science.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt, who has a doctorate in physics and was assistant director of the plasma physics laboratory at Princeton when he ran for Congress in 1998, jokes that he and Representative Vernon J. Ehlers, a Michigan Republican and also a physicist, are a two-man bipartisan physics caucus.</p>
        <p>''Depending on how you count it, there's somewhere between a small handful and a large handful who have science backgrounds'' in Congress, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt has introduced legislation to establish what he calls the Center for Science and Technology Assessment. It would be a kind of successor to the O.T.A. and would be housed in the Government Accountability Office.</p>
        <p>''I think there is a widespread if not total recognition that we need better technological assessment and advice to Congress,'' Mr. Holt said. ''We are trying to find the right mechanism.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone agrees that such an agency would make a big difference. It is true that the Office of Technology Assessment is ''much mourned,'' Mr. Greenberg and others say.</p>
        <p>''If you could bring it back or establish something else to deal with these problems, it would be useful,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But he blames politics for what he sees as a Congressional failure to take good action on science issues. ''I don't think the worsening of the product of the Capitol -- and it certainly has gotten worse -- is attributable to the absence'' of the office, he said.</p>
        <p>Others say the National Academy of Sciences or the Congressional Research Service can provide information to lawmakers if they request it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boehlert said the prospects for Mr. Holt's proposal appeared dim. ''I am for it,'' he said, ''but in the present climate, when we are struggling to make ends meet, it's unlikely we are going to expand a support staff operation for the Congress. It's not a high priority.''</p>
        <p>That makes briefings like the one this month all the more important, Mr. Boehlert said, especially because scientists like Dr. Kennedy, a biologist by training, and Dr. Fineberg, a medical doctor, were on hand to make the case for science.</p>
        <p>After the briefing ended, attendees crowded around the speakers, peppering them with more questions and comments. One of the fellows had a suggestion for Dr. Chivian.</p>
        <p>''Do this again,'' she said, ''but next time get a larger room.''</p>
