        <p>SCOTLAND: SEEKING LOCKERBIE DELAY -- After surprise defense plans to produce more than 100 witnesses from abroad, prosecutors will ask the Scottish High Court to postpone the May 3 start of the trial of two Libyans in the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie that killed 270 people. The request will be heard tomorrow at a former Dutch military base where the case is to be tried under Scottish legal procedures. Prosecutors say that despite frequent requests, they were given no advance notice of the 119 witnesses.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: FIGHTING INFLATION -- Six zeroes will be removed from the Turkish lira at the end of next year or the beginning of 2002, the central bank governor, Gazi Ercel, announced. He said the move would be part of an effort to bring the 65 percent inflation rate down to single digits within two years. One dollar now buys nearly 600,000 lira.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: AUTOBAHN SLOWDOWN -- Environment Minister Jurgen Trittin called for stricter enforcement of speed limits on autobahns to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He also wants a speed limit imposed on the 25 percent of the network not now subject to any limit at all. Mr. Trittin's Green Party has long demanded a 60-m.p.h. limit, saying it was one way of meeting pollution goals set in the 1997 Kyoto accord on global warming.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: IMMUNITY PLEDGE -- Francisco Labastida, the governing party's presidential nominee, pledged that if elected he would strip cabinet members of immunity from criminal prosecution.

        <p>INDIA: DIVISION OVER DROUGHT -- All the major political parties met to discuss a drought that is affecting 50 million people in five states. Leaders of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the ruling coalition, called for a united front. But there was dissension, even from the party's main coalition partner, the Telugu Desam Party from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. One of its leaders complained that Andhra had not received enough help.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: BODY HANDOVER -- The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam handed over the bodies of 126 government soldiers killed in the rebels' successful drive to take the strategic military base at Elephant Pass, which connects the mainland to the Jaffna Peninsula, bringing the total death toll to 214.

The states of the Niger Delta, which produce almost all of the country's two million barrels of crude a day but have remained severely impoverished, have been clamoring for a greater share of the oil money.</p>
