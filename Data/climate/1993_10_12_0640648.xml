        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re two items in your Sept. 29 issue, the letter by David Stewart of Kenmore, Australia, on the ozone hole, and the "Biospherics" editorial.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Stewart asserts that Mount Erebus in the Antarctic regularly "spews thousands of tons of chlorine vapor" into the stratosphere. Any chlorine in a volcano has already combined with something: iron, copper, zinc, silica, any of the chemicals that are in the molten center of the earth, whence volcanic eruptions come. Such chlorine is fixed as chlorides, not free chlorine gas.</p>

        <p>Re two items in your Sept. 29 issue, the letter by David Stewart of Kenmore, Australia, on the ozone hole, and the "Biospherics" editorial.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Stewart asserts that Mount Erebus in the Antarctic regularly "spews thousands of tons of chlorine vapor" into the stratosphere. Any chlorine in a volcano has already combined with something: iron, copper, zinc, silica, any of the chemicals that are in the molten center of the earth, whence volcanic eruptions come. Such chlorine is fixed as chlorides, not free chlorine gas.</p>
        <p>Your editorial on Biosphere 2, the huge greenhouse in Arizona where four men and four women lived for two years, states: "A scrubber was used to remove lethal carbon dioxide." Carbon dioxide is not lethal, except that a sufficiently large concentration will smother. You probably mean carbon monoxide, which is also exhaled by humans and other breathing animals. Naturally, fresh oxygen had to be added. The Biosphere is much like a modern, nuclear submarine, which needs to surface only to replenish groceries.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere in a submarine is monitored with sophisticated equipment to assure that the concentrations of oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are at the proper level. The last two are removed by chemical absorption, using technology that has been well understood in the chemical industry for at least half a century. The oxygen in a nuclear submarine is maintained by electrolysis of deionized sea water. This process also yields hydrogen, which is pumped back into the ocean.</p>
        <p>If the blockheads who sponsored the Biosphere 2 neglected those items, it's a wonder that anyone emerged alive. FRANK VANCE  San Diego, Sept. 29, 1993 The writer is a retired energy conservation engineer.</p>
