        <p>LEAD: FOR years electric utilities have produced energy with little fear of much changing except how much the regulators allowed them to earn, and investors have counted mainly on a steady dividend. But the industry is rapidly changing. Analysts see investment opportunities among the bigger, more competitive utilities, but they caution that many of the smaller ones will not survive.</p>
        <p>FOR years electric utilities have produced energy with little fear of much changing except how much the regulators allowed them to earn, and investors have counted mainly on a steady dividend. But the industry is rapidly changing. Analysts see investment opportunities among the bigger, more competitive utilities, but they caution that many of the smaller ones will not survive.</p>
        <p>Essentially five forces are transforming the industry: a bigger cash flow for many utilities; deregulation; acid rain legislation; diversification, and increased competition.</p>
        <p>The industry, which has overcapacity in the power it can supply, has slowed plant construction, a trend expected to last for the next several years. As a result, it needs few new capital investments. ''Their cash flow is higher because they are not putting so much into asset investments because construction of new plants has fallen off dramatically,'' said Thomas Halligan, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps.</p>
        <p>Some utilities with large amounts of excess cash have bought unrelated businesses, to raise their return on equity. For example, Pinnacle West Capital, an Arizona utility, bought Merabank, a mortgage banker, and Florida Power and Light bought Colonial Penn, an insurance company. Both diversifications have been problematic, analysts say.</p>
        <p>''For the past 10 or 15 years, stopping basically in 1984, electric utilities were primarily construction finance companies,'' said Edward J. Tirello, Shearson Lehman Hutton's utility analyst. ''Now except for companies finishing up big projects, everyone has pretty much stopped building big power plants. They have become totally different. They have become big net cash generators.'' But that is not the whole story, he said. The smaller utilities are struggling with new competition that did not exist only six years ago while gearing up for the passage of acid rain legislation with an annual compliance price tag of $2 billion to $6 billion over 20 years.</p>
        <p>''Competition is the newest element,'' Mr. Tirello said. ''We feel the electric industry is going the way the gas industry did to some degree. We see equal access to transmission lines and nondiscriminatory wheeling of power. Needless to say, the industry is violently opposed to this.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts believe that some form of equal access to transmission lines is inevitable in the electric business, and this alone would mean an enormous change. It would effectively give the independent power producers, which serve both the utilities themselves and large manufacturers, a bigger edge in their competition with the established utilities.</p>
        <p>For example, an independent power producer might put up a generator that produces electricity relatively cheaply and, depending on how the transmission lines are regulated, be able to take the power to whatever buyer wants it over the existing transmission lines.</p>
        <p>Or an industrial company might have a co-generation unit and a manufacturing facility at different sites. If the company does not need all the power it produces at the co-generation facility, and the regional utility does not want to buy it, the utility might be forced to wheel that power to the company's other site for use there. This sort of controlled access already exists in Florida and Texas.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Tirello, each utility faces at least four competitors: the industrial concern that can choose to produce its own power; co-generation operations; alternative energy producers, and marketing subsidiaries that will buy power from the cheapest sources and then repackage it and resell it. Independent power producers will account for about 12 percent of the industry by the year 2000, according to Mr. Tirello.</p>
        <p>''In the long run, the electric utilities will no longer be a monopoly,'' Mr. Halligan said.</p>
        <p>For many smaller companies, these and other changes will mean they have to merge or sell themselves to remain competitive. A number of analysts say many utilities are resisting the pressure to meld into larger, more efficent energy producers, and as a result their days are numbered.</p>
        <p>''The idea of competition is sinking in very fast,'' said Daniele Seitz, an analyst with Smith Barney. ''They understand that the key to success is to trim costs and stay competitive.''</p>
        <p>But there are some utilities that will do well because they are playing the consolidation game as well as looking for other ways of staying ahead of the independents. Pacificorp, which merged with Utah Power, is recommended by a number of analysts because it has diversified well and has one of the lowest rates in the West. Southern California Edison is also favored.</p>
        <p>Among those with surplus power that will be attractive as the overcapacity shriks, Commonwealth Edison, Detroit Edison and Ohio Edison are favored by several analysts. Ms. Seitz of Smith Barney also favors the Southern Company.</p>
