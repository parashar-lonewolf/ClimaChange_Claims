        <p>China and the United States took steps today to protect the environment and to increase airline traffic between the two countries, but Prime Minister Zhu Rongji left little doubt that he considered those agreements a poor substitute for the big trade deal that he hoped to clinch as the centerpiece of his visit.</p>
        <p>He and other Chinese officials voiced deep disappointment at their inability to win United States backing for China's application to join the World Trade Organization. In a private meeting with members of Congress this morning at Blair House, Mr. Zhu vented his frustration that President Clinton ''did not dare'' to complete the trade accord, according to people who attended. The failure left Mr. Zhu to continue on his United States tour without the prize he had sought.</p>
        <p>In a dinner address tonight, Mr. Zhu continued voicing his displeasure over the way the Clinton Administration handled the trade negotiations. Mr. Zhu emphasized that even tonight, negotiators were still deep in discussions to hammer out an interim agreement that would allow the two sides to resume negotiations down the road.</p>
        <p>''Surely the American side realizes that the time has come to end negotiations which have already gone on for 13 years,'' Mr. Zhu told his audience at the Willard Hotel.  ''Surely the time has come to end these talks and move forward to open new channels of U.S.-China trade.''</p>
        <p>At the Blair House meeting this morning, members of Congress argued that China had regressed in its human rights performance since Mr. Clinton's state visit there last summer and pressed the Prime Minister to explain why. Some cited specific cases to illustrate their complaints.</p>
        <p>The agreements and the human rights confrontation came on the final day of Mr. Zhu's stay in Washington. He is to leave on Saturday morning for Denver, followed by stops in Chicago, New York and Boston. Chinese officials hope those stops on Mr. Zhu's trip will give him a chance to interact with ordinary Americans  and to escape the charged political climate in Washington.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the deadlock over trade talks on Thursday, the two sides were able to finish several accords today. Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright signed a pact that doubles, to 54 from 27, the number of weekly flights between the countries. By 2001, when the increase takes effect, each side will also have the right to add one airline company to the three on each side that now fly the trans-Pacific route.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhu and Vice President Al Gore spent much of the day presiding over a forum on the environment at the State Department. The two countries, the world's biggest producers of greenhouse gases thought by many experts to cause global warming, signed an accord that provides American financing for clean-air projects in China. They also witnessed the signing of a commercial agreement to build a natural gas pipeline in southern China.</p>
        <p>Though the environment is a special area of focus for Mr. Gore, it was Mr. Zhu, at least in the public session, who appeared more eager to discuss the details of the two countries' environmental policies. In contrast to Mr. Gore, who read some perfunctory opening remarks from notes, the Prime Minister discarded his prepared speech after a few minutes and spoke off-the-cuff, in some detail, about the seriousness of the country's pollution problems and his efforts to bring them under control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhu spoke frankly of ''the devastation of Mother Nature'' in China as a result of soil erosion, deforesta tion, and emissions from factories, cars and coal-burning furnaces, the country's main source of heat. He also called closer environmental cooperation one of the keys to reducing what the United States estimates is a $57 billion trade deficit with China.</p>
        <p>''I would even say that you could wipe out your large trade deficit, or turn the trade deficit into a surplus,'' he said, citing China's big appetite for technology and expertise to clean up air and water supplies. ''If that happens, I would be very happy.''</p>
        <p>In fact, today's agreements related to the environment will not make much of a dent in China's huge trade surplus, though Administration officials called them useful steps toward a broader environmental alliance that could lead to robust trade in the future. The highlight was a $100 million deal under which the United States Export-Import Bank will finance the export of United States clean-air technology to China, including projects to make more efficient use of energy and to reduce pollution from existing power sources.</p>
        <p>Though Administration officials had hoped that several companies that might benefit from such financing would announce commercial agreements today, no contracts were made public. Officials said they expect at least several United States companies to push forward with clean-air projects in China shortly.</p>
        <p>In a separate commercial deal, Enron and China National Petroleum Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding at the environmental forum for the joint development of a natural gas pipeline in south central China.</p>
        <p>China and the United States also took a first step toward setting up a United States-style emission trading regime in China. Polluters in America have the right to buy and sell emissions quotas, which some environmental experts have praised as a way of using the market to help solve pollution problems. China has so far resisted adopting that kind of mechanism, but Administration officials said Mr. Zhu was at least prepared to experiment with the idea.</p>
        <p>The breakfast meeting at Blair House, the guest house near the White House where heads of state often stay when visiting Washington, was attended by 15 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Mr. Zhu, true to his promise early in the week to allow critics free reign to voice their frustrations with China, did almost no talking during the session, people who attended it said. But in opening remarks he expressed distress over the failure to conclude talks over accession to the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Several members of Congress said they were surprised when Mr. Zhu, speaking through an interpreter, said he believed that Mr. Clinton lacked the ''courage'' to try to push the agreement through Congress now, given recent allegations of Chinese spying. The language was unusually blunt and undiplomatic, even though Mr. Zhu has shown several times that he will speak his mind.</p>
        <p>But at the conclusion of the session, Chinese officials approached several members of Congress offering what they called a more accurate translation. Mr. Zhu's words should have been translated as the verb ''dare to'' not the noun ''courage,'' they said, adding that the Prime Minister in no way intended to challenge Mr. Clinton directly.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Zhu's frustration was evident, some said.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure he expected the climate to be as difficult as it has been,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who attended the session and who supports China's entry into the trade organization. ''In the end he made a strong pitch for us to step up to the plate and get it done, though I am a little concerned that this will drift now because we missed the moment.''</p>
