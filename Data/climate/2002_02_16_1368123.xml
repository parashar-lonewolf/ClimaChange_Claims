        <p>NEW HAVEN, Feb. 15 Â— A former Yale University professor was sentenced today to 20 years in prison for sexually assaulting and making pornographic videotapes of a New Haven public school boy he once had mentored.</p>

        <p>A former Yale University professor was sentenced today to 20 years in prison for sexually assaulting and making pornographic videotapes of a New Haven public school boy he once had mentored.</p>
        <p>Antonio Lasaga, 52, an award-winning geochemist who taught at Yale for almost 15 years and was housemaster at one of the university's 12 residential colleges, is expected to serve 15 years of the sentence in a federal prison and 5 in a state prison. He pleaded no contest in State Superior Court here to the charges, which included two counts of risk of injury to a minor.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said the boy, now 16, was 6 when the abuse began, and that it continued for several years.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Lasaga was sentenced in federal court to 15 years in prison for receiving 150,000 pornographic images of children on his home and university computers. The state sentence will run concurrent with the federal term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lasaga pleaded guilty to two federal counts of possessing child pornography, charges that prosecutors said deserved a sentence of 20 years. Mr. Lasaga's lawyer, Diane Poulan, said she would appeal the federal sentence, which exceeds the recommended federal guidelines of 9 to 11 years.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Lasaga, Mr. Lasaga's former wife, and Peter Lasaga, the couple's 27-year-old son, read statements in federal and state court asking for a reduced sentence. They pointed to Mr. Lasaga's skills as a parent and his professional achievements, despite his impoverished childhood as a Cuban immigrant in the United States.</p>
        <p>Three Yale professors also spoke up for Mr. Lasaga, with one describing him as ''Nobel Prize material.'' Mr. Lasaga received the Mineralogical Society of America's award of the year in 1986 and has consulted on such issues as global warming.</p>
        <p>In court today, Mr. Lasaga was largely silent. His lawyer described him as ''obsessed'' with the victim he molested, and said Mr. Lasaga believed whatever trauma the boy was suffering was due to the ''forced separation'' that resulted from Mr. Lasaga's prosecution.</p>
        <p>The victim, however, has filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Lasaga.</p>
        <p>As part of the two sentences, Mr. Lasaga must participate in a sex offender treatment program, register upon his release from prison with a sex offender registry, have no contact with the victim and stay off the Internet.</p>
