        <p>As Memorial Day arrives and the children are let out of school, attention turns to the coveted summer getaway. But the hottest travel destinations are swarming with tourists. Getting away from the crowds has become a mission impossible. And that's not the only price society is paying for the explosion in world travel.</p>
        <p>There is the sewage backup into the Mediterranean to consider and the desiccation of East African game parks because of heavy tourist traffic. Plan on venturing into the central valley of the Yosemite National Park in July or August? Your experience may be more akin to a stroll down Madison Avenue during lunch hour.</p>
        <p>The solution is simple, but hardly welcome: restricting access. Some United States national parks have already been forced to close temporarily during the day to allow crowds to thin. And such closures are likely to become more widespread.</p>
        <p>"It used to be that if one area was built up, you could always move on to somewhere else," said Martin Brackenbury, president of the International Federation of Tour Operators in London. "But increasingly we are not in a position to escape the mess we've created."</p>
        <p>The trend is playing into the hands of theme park owners. Disney World, for one, attracted more people than Britain last year. Last year, 28.5 million visited the park, making it the fourth-largest tourist destination after France, the United States and Spain. Many vacationers figure they can escape pollution, if not the crowds, yet get an enriching experience in Disney's ersatz foreign lands.</p>
        <p>The hotel industry has taken some pointers from Disney. To please -- and control -- the dense crowds, hoteliers and resort operators have learned how to simulate cultural experiences. A Calypso band evokes the spirit of the Caribbean, flamenco dancers give guests a taste of Spain. The gimmicks, used perhaps most heavily in the country of origin, lead some to question the authenticity of any travel.</p>
        <p>By at least one measure, tourism is the world's largest industry. While it is the third-largest household expenditure after food and housing in most industrial nations, it employs more people than any other single industrial sector, according to figures compiled by Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates.</p>
        <p>And it is growing fast. The industry, which includes spending on lodging, transportation and restaurants, has an infrastructure worth $3 trillion, estimates WEFA. In 1989, the latest year for which figures are available, the industry invested nearly $360 billion in new structures and capital equipment, up from $276 billion in 1987, according to WEFA.</p>
        <p>Today, the industry employs 112 million people, or one out of every 15 workers worldwide, and is expected to maintain a healthy 8.7 percent growth rate through 1992. The potential is clearly enormous, considering that only about 10 percent of all Americans hold passports.</p>
        <p>The growth is remarkable for an industry that is 40 years old. Before World War II, traveling for pleasure was the province of the rich, a characteristic that is still played up in advertisements. But improved standards of living and the ready availability of flights have enabled more people to indulge. "The growth in tourism is a function of increased disposable income and increased leisure time," said Paul Turk, an analyst at Avmark, an air travel consulting company in Washington.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, too many people are converging on too few places. More than 425 million people -- about 10 percent of the world's population -- traveled from one country to another in 1989, according to the World Tourist Organization of the United Nations. Mr. Brackenbury estimates that half the world's population will be traveling by the year 2000.</p>
        <p>That kind of traffic has helped defeat an essential purpose of travel. "Once tourists begin to show up, it immediately changes the character of the place and the original experience is gone," said Douglas Frechtling, associate professor of tourism at George Washington University. "From then on, it's just a matter of degree."</p>
        <p>For example, the south of France, which millions of tourists visit every summer, has adjusted after a few disastrous years, when its infrastructure sagged under the strain and sewage overflowed into the once-azure sea. Now, the problem is sewage discharged from a growing fleet of pleasure boats, Mr. Brackenbury said.</p>
        <p>The east coast of Spain, known affectionately as the Costa Concrete in honor of its tourist sprawl, has also cleaned up its act. Benidorm, long considered the overbuilt nadir of the Spanish tourist industry, has won several awards for the cleanliness of its beaches. Spain derives 25 percent of its export earnings from tourism, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, a consulting group in London.</p>
        <p>But the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea has never gotten over the publicity surrounding the sudden growth of brown algae in 1989. "It was like swimming in brown mucous, not exactly anyone's idea of holiday pleasure," said Mr. Brackenbury.</p>
        <p>The problems of pollution are most noticeable at places whose draw is their supposed pristine condition. The Grand Canyon has banned small planes from flying below the canyon rim, but the local airport is still the third busiest in Arizona, after Phoenix and Tucson. And at the height of the summer, about a quarter of a million people crowd onto the floor of the Yosemite Valley every day. Duncan Morrow of the National Park Service said he sees more parks closing for increased periods, waiting for their parking lots to empty.</p>
        <p>Overseas, the garbage tossed out in the foothills of the Himalayas by tourists has become legendary. And some of the East African game parks are being turned into dust bowls by the tourists ferried around in four-wheel drive vehicles. "You think you're seeing the animals in the wild, but by definition you're not because tourists are looking at them," said Dr. Frechtling.</p>
        <p>Circumstances like the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest, the depletion of the ozone layer and the oil spill in Alaska have driven home the fragile state of the world, sensitizing many to the adverse cultural, social and physical effects of tourism, he added.</p>
        <p>But even those places that have tried to control the growth of tourism, the demand to keep masses of people content in a confined area inevitably leads to an experience that is somewhat manufactured. So why not, the thinking goes, have an entirely manufactured experience. "In a sense, the Montmartre experience is in the eye of the beholder," said Dr. Frechtling.</p>
        <p>Disney argues that in offering a small slice of a foreign culture, it will whet people's appetites for travel. Yet spending two weeks in Maui hardly represents a close encounter with traditional Hawaiian culture.</p>
        <p>"The difference is that it's not in a compact area and not operated by one company," said Dr. Frechtling. "The trick is to manage large numbers of people while giving them a quality experience that they will treasure when they go home. Disney does that very well." AMERICANS ARE STAYING TOO CLOSE TO HOME</p>
        <p>The crowds at Yosemite might be worse than usual this summer. That is the natural conclusion to be drawn from a recent survey of Americans' travel plans.</p>
        <p>According to the study, released last week by the United States Travel Data Center, a Washington-based consulting firm, Americans will make almost as many trips this summer as the nearly 326 million trips 100 or more miles from home that they took last summer. The recession -- and, to a lesser extent, safety concerns lingering from the war in the Middle East -- will keep people closer to home this season and force them to cut corners in other ways. More people are driving instead of flying, taking shorter vacations and staying with friends and relatives rather than in hotels, concluded the study, which is based on interviews conducted with 4,500 Americans over three months.</p>
        <p>International travel fell during the war, helping push International Leisure Group, a giant British holiday tour company, as well as Eastern Airlines into bankruptcy. While the war victory initially spurred Americans' travel plans, the recession quickly cooled their interest, according to separate surveys by the consulting firm of D. K. Shifflet &amp; Associates in McLean, Va. In March, in the wake of the war, 76 percent of the 300 people interviewed said they planned to take at least one trip in the next six months, up sharply from 51 percent in February. But by April, that figure fell to 58 percent.</p>
        <p>"The economy has been, in terms of domestic travel, a far greater factor than the war," said Richard Hebert, a spokesman at the American Automobile Association. "Things got better in April, but the feeling is things didn't get better enough."</p>
        <p>In Hawaii, for example, incoming tourist traffic declined by 12 percent in April from a year ago, according to Gene Cotter of the Hawaii Visitors Bureau. That is a big deal for a state that earned 40 percent of its gross national product last year from its seven million tourists. "It's recession-related and war-related, but probably more on the recession side," Mr. Cotter said.</p>
