        <p>The executive arm of the European Union announced a new element in its strategy to wean the union off fossil fuels, promising more money for research into renewable energy sources and for the development of what it calls a ''hydrogen based'' economy. The European Commission's plan aims to link union transport and energy policies to advances in the use of hydrogen as a way of both storing and generating clean energy. The commission said it would bolster research into fuel cells that run on hydrogen, which is combined with oxygen in the air to produce electricity.</p>
