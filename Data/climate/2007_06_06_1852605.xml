        <p>Re ''Fighting the Tide, a Few Restaurants Tilt to Tap Water'' (May 30):</p>
        <p>In reading Marian Burros's article on the increasing deep-sixing of bottled mineral water in restaurants, I knew the foodies were at it again. Heaven help us.</p>
        <p>Let's all join in this myopic, righteous new furor and do whatever we can to add to the insanity. Taking this au courant Jean d'Arc vigor to a logical further degree in order to reduce our ghastly carbon footprint, we should not just do away with bottled water, we should demand that restaurants no longer purchase any foreign wine, beer, liquor, cheese and other foodstuffs, boutique or otherwise.</p>
        <p>But why stop there? Let's simply do away with any and all imports. Alice Waters and her disciples have awakened me and others to yet one more enlightenment. Thanks, Alice. I'm running to the faucet right now.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The insistence on drinking bottled water is mostly a status symbol. If people claim to be so concerned about the purity of the water they drink what is their rationale for using ice cubes and coffee or tea that are made with ordinary tap water?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I didn't think that going with filtered tap water was all that big a deal until I read your article. Barbette (barbette.com) here in Minneapolis has the smallest of notes on its menu saying that all water brought to the table has been filtered. Thank you for bringing it up, water is such an interesting thing, invisible to most because of its ubiquity, and we are well served to be reminded of it.</p>
