        <p>LEAD: WE have mown down, paved over and smoothed out so much of nature that we now think of the few bits and pieces left as delicate curiosities. We have forgotten nature's function.</p>
        <p>WE have mown down, paved over and smoothed out so much of nature that we now think of the few bits and pieces left as delicate curiosities. We have forgotten nature's function.</p>
        <p>The debate on whether to develop Sterling Forest turns on our understanding of the work done by this 20,000-acre stand of trees and wetlands along the New York-New Jersey border. This is not idle land waiting to be made productive by condominiums and cul-de-sacs. It works hard already.</p>
        <p>The future of Sterling Forest was the topic of testimony during recent Congressional hearings in Tuxedo, N.Y., on the preservation of open space in America. The hearing revealed that this country has lost 70 million to 100 million acres of open space since World War II, and it continues to disappear at the rate of 5,500 acres a day.</p>
        <p>The impact of this lost open space is not only esthetic. There is a tremendous practical impact - something we must realize if we are to appreciate the value of Sterling Forest and other vanishing lands.</p>
        <p>Sterling Forest protects northern New Jersey from the ravages of annual flooding. Water from the Sterling Forest watershed feeds the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers. Without Sterling Forest to absorb much of the annual rainfall, these rivers - already swollen by runoff from overdeveloped areas - would present an even greater threat.</p>
        <p>The effects of overdevelopment, and the consequent costs, are easily seen. Continued overbuilding in the Passaic River Basin now causes flooding so severe that the Army Corps of Engineers is designing an $879 million tunnel to carry floodwaters underground. Development of Sterling Forest would only worsen this problem and create others like it. The vegetation and wetlands of Sterling Forest also purify our water. Development would not only remove the natural filtration provided by Sterling Forest, but also contribute additionalcontamination to the water supply. Remember, both the Wanaque and Monksville Reservoirs are fed by the Sterling Forest watershed.</p>
        <p>Also, Sterling Forest helps clean our air - a full-time job for an area that regularly violates Federal clean- air requirements. Forests are the earth's lungs. At a time when the air is dirtier than it has ever been, and greenhouse gases are gathering in amounts large enough to cause increasing alarm, we are in no position to remove those lungs piece by piece.</p>
        <p>Finally, Sterling Forest provides citizens of New Jersey and New York an escape from the stress and pressures of urban living. It is home to a wide variety of plants and wildlife, a rare window to a natural world crowded out by urban sprawl. For years, families have taken advantage of the forest's natural beauty. It is an area for relaxation and contemplation. Its loss would substantially diminish the quality of life for us all.</p>
        <p>The fate of Sterling Forest lies largely in the hands of the State of New York. But there is still much we can do. Federal funds should be made available to purchase a substantial part of Sterling Forest. The National Park Service already owns several hundred acres of the forestestablishing a strong Federal interest in the area. Making Federal funds available would serve as an incentive to New York to purchase the balance of the land.</p>
        <p>The lessons we are learning through the Sterling Forest debate should not be lost. In New Jersey, 83 percent of the forests are privately owned. In our state's Highlands region, which includes the New Jersey portion of Sterling Forest, only about 10 percent of the area's 576,000 acres are guaranteed public open space.</p>
        <p>As a state, we need to address the problem of our shrinking open space, identify those areas immediately that we must preserve and work to set them aside. The intense pressures of urbanization should not be allowed to crowd open space out of our future. We need to maintain open space to preserve the quality of our air, our water, our rivers and our lives.</p>
