        <p>Congressional negotiations on a broad new energy policy began today with Republican leaders serving notice that they intended to write much of the proposal.</p>
        <p>Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, will be chairman of the discussions, which gained new prominence after the blackout on Aug. 14. Mr. Domenici said that he and Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, who is chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, would draft recommendations and submit them for consideration and that he wanted to avoid a repetition of the failed talks last year.</p>
        <p>''There were too many multiday meetings, too many offers and counteroffers, instead of conferees and the staff simply sitting down, rolling up our sleeves and working it out,'' Mr. Domenici said after gaveling the meeting to order.</p>
        <p>He added that he had had ''many conversations with Chairman Tauzin, and I believe there are no issues on which the two of us cannot reach agreement.''</p>
        <p>The prospect of perhaps just one other conference meeting to consider a plan written mainly out of sight immediately alarmed Democratic participants. They said they were worried that they would be cut out of shaping a measure that will touch on nearly every aspect of energy supply.</p>
        <p>''There is a grave danger in pursuing a course in which important work is conducted behind closed doors with limited and unknown participants and the appearance of partisanship,'' said Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House energy committee.</p>
        <p>Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the senior Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee who was co-chairman of the talks last year, when Democrats held the Senate majority, said it would be unfortunate if the lawmakers abandoned the approach of open negotiations.</p>
        <p>''People are going to want to know what we are doing in this bill to prevent future blackouts and future problems,'' Mr. Bingaman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin said that much of the work was done last year and that he and Mr. Domenici could build on those agreements to reach a deal before the end of the month.</p>
        <p>''About 70 percent of the work is already done,'' Mr. Tauzin said. ''It is just a matter of signing the papers. We are just two votes away from giving this nation some energy security for a change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin acknowledged that a handful of major obstacles remained to a compromise.</p>
        <p>Coming to terms will not be easy despite his cordial relationship with Mr. Domenici.</p>
        <p>Foremost among the obstacles is a push by President Bush and House Republicans to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. The Senate has rejected that plan, and Mr. Domenici has said he will not include the drilling in a final proposal unless he is certain he has the 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.</p>
        <p>Although the blackout has led to a consensus that the power industry should be subject to mandatory reliability rules, the House and Senate differ on how far to go in trying to create new transmission organizations or use government authority to obtain land for new transmission lines. In addition to the electricity provisions, there are conflicts over a variety of issues like standards on automobile mileage, global warming, hydropower and other energy sources.</p>
        <p>Citing those disputes, Democrats led by Mr. Dingell have been pressing to separate the electricity provisions from the rest of the bill and quickly move them forward. Republicans oppose that plan.</p>
        <p>''This is not a time to do piecemeal work on putting together a bill,'' said the House majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin said lawmakers advocating breaking up the bill did not want a major energy measure to pass. He said they should worry about repercussions.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who stands in the way of this one ought to get burned in the next election cycle,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The conference committee is a large group, with 45 House members and 13 senators.</p>
