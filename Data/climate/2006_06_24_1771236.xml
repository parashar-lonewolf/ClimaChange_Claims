        <p>Only the most rigid of ideologues would argue with the principal themes of ''Addicted to Oil: Thomas L.

        <p>Only the most rigid of ideologues would argue with the principal themes of ''Addicted to Oil: Thomas L. Friedman Reporting,'' the latest of an occasional series of television documentaries built around the work and personality of Mr. Friedman, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times:</p>
        <p>America's dependence on oil for transportation and consumer products is huge and dangerous. It limits military and foreign policy options, handcuffs the economy and generates a steady stream of revenue that helps finance Muslim terrorism.</p>
        <p>Pollution from the burning of fossil fuels is accelerating global climate changes that have already damaged the environment and could wreak havoc if left unaddressed.</p>
        <p>Inadequate government subsidies for the development of solar and wind power have slowed the emergence of alternative-energy technologies that don't rely on petroleum.</p>
        <p>Other countries are taking the challenge of shedding their oil dependency more seriously than the United States is, and they may enjoy huge economic advantages as a result.</p>
        <p>But while the one-hour program, which has its television premiere tonight on the Discovery Channel, deftly establishes these broad points, content problems emerge as the program fleshes them out.</p>
        <p>Sloppy production, for example, undermines part of a segment on global warming that was filmed mainly at the National Center for Atmospheric Research outside Boulder, Colo. A senior official at the center, William Collins, tells Mr. Friedman that if the ice in Greenland were to melt, it would mean a 25-foot rise in sea level worldwide.</p>
        <p>''What would that do to New York City?'' Mr. Friedman asks.</p>
        <p>''You would need a really high dike around New York City,'' Mr. Collins replies, as the picture on screen shifts to a computer-animation sequence -- credited to the National Environmental Trust, an advocacy group -- showing Lower Manhattan inundated by rising waters.</p>
        <p>But a visit to www.net.org/globalwarming/sea--level, the organization's Web site, reveals that this animated sequence actually depicts the projected effects of a storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane after 100 years of global warming has raised water levels around Manhattan by 2.2 feet.</p>
        <p>Lack of consistency is a problem as well. In a report on the development of cars that run on hydrogen gas, Mr. Friedman is careful to note that creating hydrogen fuel takes enormous amounts of electricity; generating it might well create more pollution than is saved by not burning gasoline in the cars.</p>
        <p>No such concern is evident, however, in an earlier segment on the substitution of plant-derived ethanol for gasoline. Although not as energy-consuming as the production of hydrogen, producing ethanol requires substantial amounts of energy at various stages of the process, but Mr. Friedman's narrative skips over the subject.</p>
        <p>Poor editorial choices also make some of the program's interview subjects appear foolish. An early segment, for example, focuses an approving eye on an unusual alliance among traditional political adversaries -- conservative Christians, environmentalists, foreign policy hawks -- over the issue of America's oil dependency.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Friedman, who is credited as series editor, and the producer-director Kenneth Levis illustrate this group's views partly with this jumbled comment from James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, about the United States' flawed energy policies: ''We're being even stupider than what Lenin described when he said, 'The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we hang them.' We're doing much worse than that. We're funding the rope for the hanging of ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Regular readers of Mr. Friedman's books and his columns in The Times are likely to enjoy his on-screen persona as the intellectual, fact-finding nerd. Indeed, Mr. Levis spoofs this image in an early segment, laying a bouncy disco soundtrack beneath film of Mr. Friedman's legs maneuvering through the Detroit Auto Show. It's an unmistakable homage to the famous opening scene of John Travolta walking the streets of Brooklyn in the 1977 film ''Saturday Night Fever.''</p>
        <p>Later, during the segment on hydrogen fuel cells, Mr. Friedman exclaims, ''You know, I've always wanted to say this, but -- Fill 'er up with hydrogen!'' It's hard to imagine any other television personality, journalist or not, who could deliver that line convincingly.</p>
