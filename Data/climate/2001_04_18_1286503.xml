        <p>Facing criticism that it cares more about promoting industry than protecting the environment, the Bush administration announced today that it would go forward with a regulation proposed by President Bill Clinton to require thousands of businesses to make public the details of their emissions of lead into the environment.</p>
        <p>The announcement, which could have been a routine event at the Environmental Protection Agency, was made in a relatively splashy fashion at the White House. It followed an announcement on Monday that the administration was leaving in place regulations expanding protections for wetlands. In both cases, the president himself issued statements applauding the decisions.</p>
        <p>With environmental groups threatening protests on Sunday, the 31st anniversary of Earth Day, Mr. Bush's spokesman emphasized today what he said were the positive steps the president had taken on the environment. These include putting money in his proposed budget to clean up the national parks and nearly doubling the money for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans said that until this week the administration had been ham-handed both in its environmental policy and in its announcements, and urged Vice President Dick Cheney in a meeting on April 4 to make better public presentations of their case.</p>
        <p>The announcement today -- supported by a broad array of environmental groups and opposed by small businesses -- allows a rule by the Clinton administration to take effect. It will require companies that handle as little as 100 pounds of lead a year to report to the Environmental Protection Agency how much is released into the air, soil and water. Until now, the reporting threshold had been at least 10,000 pounds a year.</p>
        <p>Officials estimated that the rule meant nearly 10,000 additional plants would have to report emissions.</p>
        <p>The new rules, which businesses are challenging in court, will do nothing directly to curb emissions and, some environmentalists pointed out, fulfilled Mr. Bush's view that regulations should not be too costly to business. But the details provided by the companies will be available to the public, and businesses say that setting up a way to provide the information will cost them.</p>
        <p>The announcement on the lead reporting rules was made by Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. administrator, who said public scrutiny had helped reduce emissions of other toxic substances. ''Information is power,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In response to a question at a news conference, Mrs. Whitman sought to correct what she said was a false impression that Mr. Bush favored industry over the environment. ''This president cares about these issues,'' she said. ''This administration has an extraordinarily good environmental record.''</p>
        <p>The administration is expected to continue such announcements for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>''There will be a series of new initiatives the president is launching,'' Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman, said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer disputed suggestions that the decision was an effort to blunt criticism from environmental groups, who are planning Earth Day demonstrations in Washington and in Quebec, where Mr. Bush will be discussing trade policies this weekend.</p>
        <p>The timing of this week's announcements was driven in part by the calendar. The administration had 60 days from the effective date of many rules approved in the final days of the Clinton administration to reject the rules or let them stand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer today denied that the recent announcements were being done for effect. ''The president is not concerned about his image,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''The president is concerned about results.''</p>
        <p>Still, the White House has clearly been stung by the reaction to many Bush decisions, which critics in the Democratic Party and leaders of private environmental groups contend place the health of the economy above that of the earth.</p>
        <p>These decisions include Mr. Bush's opposition to a treaty on global warming, his reversal of a campaign promise to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, his eagerness to drill for oil in Alaska, a decision to repeal tighter limits for arsenic in drinking water, his proposed budget cuts of 6.7 percent in environmental programs, his proposal to limit the ability of citizens to use lawsuits to protect endangered species, rolling back standards for air-conditioners even as he proclaims an energy crisis, and the lifting of a rule that limited chemical runoff from mines.</p>
        <p>Today, a Gallup poll showed that Americans favored environmental protection over energy drilling and  economic growth. It also showed that the public disapproved of the administration's decision not to adhere to the treaty on global warming. And a coalition of environmental groups is beginning a television advertising campaign on Wednesday denouncing the president's environmental policies and urging viewers to tell their legislators to restore money he proposes to cut from the budget for environmental programs.</p>
        <p>Last week, Laura Bush, the first lady, gave an interview to USA Today in which she described at length the eco-friendly aspects of the Bushes' new ranch house near Crawford, Tex., where the couple recycle their rainwater and household water for irrigation and use a geothermal heating and cooling system so efficient that they scrapped plans for solar energy panels.</p>
        <p>Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said of the administration: ''They know they're in political trouble on the environment, and they wanted to make a show about some positive action, so they came out today with modest forward action, not something bold and sweeping. The environmental community is still very skeptical and deeply concerned about the trajectory this administration is taking.''</p>
        <p>But it is not just the leaders of environmental groups to whom the White House is trying to appeal. Polls have shown repeatedly that the public places a high value on the environment and gives Mr. Bush low marks for his handling of it.</p>
        <p>''His weakest issue-rating has been on the environment,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster.</p>
        <p>A New York Times poll conducted last month showed Republicans more or less equally divided on Mr. Bush's handling of the environment. But Democrats, independents, women and suburbanites all lopsidedly favored protecting the environment over producing energy, regardless of the cost. Mr. Bush cannot afford to alienate independents, women and suburbanites, the majority of whom voted last year for Al Gore. The big states with important suburban voting blocs -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and California -- all went to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''Bush won states like West Virginia because of Al Gore's environmental extremism,'' Mr. Bolger said. But, he said, the president cannot continue to count on that same dynamic. ''It will be hard for Bush to win New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. Swing voters in the Northeast -- I'm not sure how important they are in terms of crass political calculations, but you don't want to be seen as anti-environment. You don't have to be as green as Al Gore, but there's a middle ground.''</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said that in the meeting of moderates with Mr. Cheney, the lawmakers told the vice president: ''The environment is the one area you aren't handling well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shays said Mr. Cheney agreed. ''They didn't argue with us,'' Mr. Shays said. ''What they are changing now is their presentation.''</p>
        <p>That matters to other Republicans for whom the environment is an increasingly important issue.</p>
        <p>Representative Clay E. Shaw Jr., a Florida Republican who squeaked into his 11th term last year with just 50 percent of the vote, said of Mr. Bush's handling of the environment: ''As a Monday-morning quarterback, you can certainly see that the message could have been softened, it could have been eased out. The president is going to have to continue to make these announcements to let it be known that he is evenhanded. It's just smart politics.''</p>
