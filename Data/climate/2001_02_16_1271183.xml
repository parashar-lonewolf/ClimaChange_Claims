        <p>The Bush administration is only slowly turning to climate issues and so is being left on the sidelines in international talks that could shape a treaty curtailing global warming, say government officials and executives involved in the discussions.</p>
        <p>At the administration's request, United Nations officials agreed on Monday to delay the next round of formal treaty negotiations, earlier  set for May, until June or July.</p>
        <p>But other meetings and informal international discussions that could significantly shape the final agreement are taking place weekly, and the treaty is expected to be a central topic at a meeting of environment ministers from the Group of 8 industrialized nations that begins in Trieste, Italy, on March 2.</p>
        <p>The State Department thanked the United Nations on Tuesday for agreeing to the delay in climate-treaty bargaining, and said it would ''shortly begin a review of its policy toward the international climate change negotiations.''</p>
        <p>But critics, who include industry executives and some environmental lobbyists, say the administration is betraying a lack of urgency. ''Damage is being done right now,'' said a Washington lobbyist for foreign oil exporters, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ''Although efforts have been made to alert the administration that there's a whole bunch of stuff going on, there doesn't seem to have been a disciplined effort to cope with that circumstance.''</p>
        <p>Oddly, it is not environmental campaigners who have expressed the most impatience, even though new scientific reports have shown the strongest link yet between recent warming and rising emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
        <p>Rather, the frustration is coming mainly from some Republican officials and representatives of energy-related businesses, who see huge costs resulting from the climate treaty, named the Kyoto Protocol for the Japanese city where its outlines were negotiated in 1997.</p>
        <p>These critics say the administration has essentially been mute in the face of day-to-day events including  informal planning sessions for this summer's negotiations that took place at the United Nations last week. An influential scientific advisory panel that issued the recent reports strengthening the tie between warming and emissions is also  releasing reports next Monday in Geneva and later this month in Accra, Ghana, and the final wording of such reports is often influenced by comments offered by governments.</p>
        <p>Some people who oppose the Kyoto agreement say the scientific reports, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body operating under United Nations auspices, are tending toward the sensational in hopes of energizing efforts to complete the treaty.</p>
        <p>One senator involved with the issue, Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who sees warming as a significant problem but has been critical of the treaty, said both the right and the left should give Bush administration officials more time.  ''Everyone should throttle down and back a little bit,'' he said in an interview. ''These guys are going to get their arms around this. They understand this is an important issue.''</p>
        <p>The Kyoto Protocol has been signed by more than 100 countries but has not been ratified by any industrialized nation. Its final adoption would require the United States and three dozen other industrialized countries to cut combined emissions of greenhouse gases by 2012 to 5 percent below their 1990 levels. The United States, which produces a fourth of the world's emissions with 5 percent of the world's population, stands to be affected most by any final agreement. Bargaining broke down in November at The Hague, where the European Union rejected a compromise on sticking points that was offered by the United States and several other participants.</p>
        <p>In a turnabout from a spate of recent criticism of President Bush on other conservation matters, some environmental groups are giving him more room this time around, saying the complaints from conservative corners may be intended to prompt him to discard quickly the years of work invested in the treaty.</p>
        <p>They do say they are irked that Mr. Bush, quick to create a high-level team to develop new sources of oil and other fossil fuels, has not made any announcements about how the country will deal with the emissions from burning those fuels.</p>
        <p>But with regard to the treaty, at least, no news is good news, said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Ms. Claussen and some other environmentalists point to several moves that imply the administration is going to take the treaty seriously. For example, Ian Bowles, the senior director for environmental affairs at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, has been retained for the time being by the Bush team.</p>
        <p>There is a decent chance, environmental groups say, that upon reflection Mr. Bush will see merits in taking a historically aggressive stance on a strategic issue -- in this case the global environment -- much as another Republican president, Richard M. Nixon, did when he went to China.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather that they be thoughtful about it before they make up their mind,'' Ms. Claussen said, ''rather than rush to judgment, particularly if it's the wrong judgment.''</p>
