        <p>Leaders Split by Politics But Bound by School Ties  The three Iraqi political leaders considered most likely to end up prime minister after nationwide elections this week were classmates at the Jesuit all-boys English-language school called Baghdad College, fortunate members of the elite families that governed Iraq until successive waves of revolution and terror swept it away.</p>

        <p>American and Iraqi forces raiding an Iraqi government detention center in Baghdad discovered more than 600 prisoners packed into a cramped space, 13 of them mistreated so badly they had to be taken to a hospital, a senior American official said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Chinese Officer Held in Deaths  The commander of paramilitary forces who opened fire on villagers protesting land seizures was detained by the authorities in connection with the shootings, an extraordinary response that suggested high-level concern over whether the crackdown was justified.</p>

        <p>Paris Suburb Symbolizes Riots  La Courneuve, a Paris suburb of 35,000 people of 80 nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, has become a symbol of France's failure to integrate millions of Arab and African immigrants -- many of them Muslims -- and their French-born children and grandchildren.</p>

        <p>Top Croat Suspect at the Hague  For the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague, taking custody of Ante Gotovina means the end of a four-year wait and the capture of one of its most-wanted suspects from the Balkan wars of the 1990's.</p>

        <p>Rights Unit Faults Sudan Leader  The United Nations should impose sanctions on top political and military leaders in Sudan and conduct an investigation of crimes against humanity committed in Darfur, Human Rights Watch said in a report that accuses senior officials, including President Omar al-Bashir, of playing major roles in making civilians the target of attacks.</p>

        <p>Quebec Party Courts Minorities  The Bloc Québécois party has put up a record nine candidates of Haitian, African, Middle Eastern and Chinese origin this year to appeal to minorities and win toss-up districts in the Jan. 23 election, with the larger goal of winning a third separatist referendum expected in the next few years.</p>

        <p>Runoff in Chile Election  With ballots counted in the first round of voting in Chile's presidential election, a candidate who describes her rise as unlikely because she is ''a woman, a Socialist, separated and agnostic'' and a conservative billionaire businessman have advanced to a decisive runoff.</p>

        <p>Finns Build Largest Reactor  With continued spikes in gas and fuel prices, fears about overdependence on foreign oil and the growing threat of global warming, Finland has decided to move ahead this year with the construction of the world's largest nuclear reactor, and a number of countries, including the United States, are freshening up proposals to build nuclear plants.</p>

        <p>A16-23</p>
        <p>A Clash Over Rebuilding Gulf Coast After Hurricane  There is a broad clash along the Gulf Coast over whether to rebuild hurricane-damaged areas much as they were, to rebuild at a higher price, with more robust foundations and buildings raised above ground, or to cede large swaths of land to nature. The debate features a cast that includes disaster victims, coastal engineers, mortgage lenders, the insurance industry, as well as local, state and federal officials.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Tackling Medicaid Costs  Members of Congress will soon plunge into battle over the future of Medicaid, as House and Senate negotiators try to resolve huge differences over legislation that would allow states to cut benefits and increase charges for millions of low-income people, including many children. Medicaid is a flash point in a larger budget bill on which Republican leaders say they plan to reach agreement by year's end.</p>
        <p>A21</p>
        <p>Disputes Over Abuse Ban  The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, predicted that Congress and the Bush administration would reach agreement this week over a proposal to ban torture of terrorism detainees, but those engaged in the negotiations said major differences remained.</p>
        <p>A19</p>
        <p>Reporter Talks About Leak  Viveca Novak, a reporter for Time magazine, said a lawyer for Karl Rove, the senior White House adviser, was surprised when she suggested to him in the first half of 2004 that Mr. Rove had probably been a source for the magazine's July 2003 article that discussed the C.I.A. officer at the heart of the leak case.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Virginia Governor Ponders Bid  Propelled by his popularity at home, Gov. Mark Warner of Virginia has launched a major foray onto the national stage, raising millions of dollars for his likely presidential bid and visiting states already being courted by potential 2008 contenders. The latest stop came in Florida this weekend at a state Democratic Party convention.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Still No Decision on Inmate  As fervor over the scheduled execution of Stanley Tookie Williams early Tuesday began to boil across California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declined for a third day to announce a decision on a petition to spare the life of Mr. Williams, a former gangster and now-famous death row inmate, and commute his sentence to life in prison.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>Administration Word of Choice  Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Al Qaeda's ultimate goal is the re-establishment of the caliphate, with calamitous consequences for the United States. Caliphate is the term for the seventh-century Islamic empire that spanned the Middle East, spread to Southwest Asia, North Africa and Spain, then ended with the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258.</p>

        <p>Two Men Are Charged With Officer's Murder  The two men arrested in the fatal shooting of a police officer in the Bronx were charged with murder as new details emerged that led investigators to believe that the men were trying to steal Valium from a dead man's apartment when the officer, Daniel Enchautegui, confronted them. The suspects, who were shot by Officer Enchautegui before he died, remained in stable condition, the police said.</p>

        <p>G.O.P. Looks for a Way Out  New York State Republican leaders were supposed to vote on their preferred candidates for 2006 at a meeting today in Albany. But the vote is now in doubt: some Republicans want only to plot strategy and emerge with a party intact.</p>

But the new dress code has boosted an already thriving specialty trade: The haberdashers and purveyors of fine dress shoes who cater to outsize professional athletes.</p>
