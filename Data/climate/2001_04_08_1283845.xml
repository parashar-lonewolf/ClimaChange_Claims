        <p>In February, Richard C. Atkinson, president of the University of California, proposed dropping the SAT I as a requirement for admissions  to the prestigious state system, sending shock waves through higher education. Mr. Atkinson, who said the test measures an ill-defined aptitude, was alarmed to discover youngsters being drilled on test-taking essentials like analogies. The SAT II's, which assess mastery in specific subjects, would still be required. The brainteasers below, from past tests, are reprinted from the College Entrance Examination Board guide ''Taking the SAT I'' (2000), followed by a sampler from the board's ''Real SAT II'' (1998) and ''Taking the SAT II'' (2000).</p>

        <p>QUIZ ANSWERS</p>
        <p>1. c. A tip from ''Taking the Sat I: Reasoning Test'': Look for similar relationships between pairs of words, not for words with similar meanings. Don't answer analogy questions by establishing relationships between one of the capitalized words and one of the words in the answer choices.</p>
        <p>2. b.</p>
        <p>3. b.</p>
        <p>4. b.</p>
        <p>5. c. A tip from the guide: Sentence completions cover a wide variety of subjects. Even if not familiar with the topic, you will find enough information to figure out the correct answer from the context of the sentence itself.</p>
        <p>6. c.</p>
        <p>7. e.</p>
        <p>8. 19.</p>
        <p>9. c.</p>
        <p>10. 1.8 or 9/5.</p>
        <p>11. e. A tip from the guide: Research shows that students who use a calculator on the math reasoning test do slightly better than students who do not. Consider using one whenever hand computations might result in an error.</p>
        <p>12. a.</p>
        <p>13. c.</p>
        <p>14. b.</p>
        <p>15. d. The guide ''Real SAT II: Subject Tests'' explains: (a) can be eliminated because irrigation in 1000 B.C.E. (''Before the Common Era'') would have been confined to the regions along the major rivers of the Middle East and Southwest Asia; (b) can be eliminated because Greek colonization was confined primarily to the eastern Mediterranean; (c) can be eliminated because Alexander the Great's empire did not extend into the western Mediterranean or northwest Europe; (d), the correct answer, outlines the greatest extent of Roman territory under the Emperor Trajan in the second century C.E. (''Common Era''); (e) can be eliminated because the Byzantine Empire was confined primarily to the eastern Mediterranean area.</p>
        <p>16. e.</p>
        <p>17. e.</p>
        <p>18. d.</p>
        <p>19. a. The guide explains: Although the special arrangement and perspective are generally East Asian and the title at the upper-left-hand corner is in Chinese characters, also used in Japan, there are a number of characteristics that identify the picture as Japanese. The dramatic subject matter, with Mount Fuji in the background, is Japanese. Woodblock prints depicting famous scenery, beautiful women, warriors and well-known theater subjects were popular in Japan from the 17th to the 19th centuries because they were widely affordable. This work is by the 19th-century artist Hokusai.</p>
