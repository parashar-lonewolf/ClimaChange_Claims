        <p>Relief is coming for moviegoers who hunger for independent-style movies but live far from the art-house theaters of New York and Los Angeles. This week, AMC, the nation's second-largest theater chain, will begin a program to devote 72 screens in 39 cities in North America -- cities small and large, from Atlanta to Chicago to Jacksonville, Fla., to Seattle -- to specialty movies usually seen in smaller, urban theaters. Among the movies to be shown in the coming months are ''A Prairie Home Companion,'' based on the work of Garrison Keillor; ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' a documentary about global warming; and ''Art School Confidential,'' a quirky comedy about art school from the director Terry Zwigoff.

''I think the whole idea here is to bring this type of product out into the mainstream,'' he said.</p>
