        <p>178 Nations, but Not U.S., Agree on Emissions Curbs  One hundred seventy-eight countries agreed in Bonn to require industrial countries to cut emissions of gases linked to global warming, a deal that rescued the preliminary accord, the Kyoto Protocol, by softening it. The United States stayed on the sideline. President Bush has repudiated Kyoto as ''fatally flawed'' for placing too much of the clean-up burden on industrial countries and for being too costly to the American economy.</p>

        <p>Pope's Plea on Embryos  John Paul II, speaking with President Bush at his side, condemned creation of human embryos for research as an evil akin to euthanasia and infanticide. Mr. Bush is weighing whether to allow federal financing for embryonic stem cell research.</p>

        <p>Bush Firm on Missile Shield  President Bush said that ''time is of the essence'' in new arms talks with Moscow and warned that he would move ahead with testing antimissile technology even if he did not reach an agreement on scrapping the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. His comments came a day after he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia agreed to ''consultations'' on nuclear weapons cuts and discussions on defensive technologies.</p>

        <p>Push to Ban Biological Arms  European nations and other major powers urged completion of a draft agreement to enforce the 1972 ban on biological weapons, a move at odds with the Bush administration, which concluded that the draft was flawed beyond repair.</p>

        <p>Transfer of Power in Jakarta  Megawati Sukarnoputri was sworn in as president in the most peaceful transfer of power in Indonesia's history, moments after the nation's top legislative body voted to cut short the fractious tenure of her predecessor, Abdurrahman Wahid, who refused to recognize the action.</p>

        <p>Bush Advisers Recommend Amnesty for Mexican Aliens  A cabinet-level panel has recommended that President Bush endorse a limited plan giving permanent legal status to some of the three million Mexicans thought to be living illegally in the United States. The plan, which would require Congressional approval, grew out of discussions between Mr. Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico.</p>

        <p>U.S. Lets Thai Boy Stay  Attorney General John Ashcroft gave ''humanitarian parole'' to a 4-year-old Thai boy with AIDS, Phanupong Khaisri, who was used as a decoy in a human-trafficking scheme, saying the United States should not deport him. The boy has been with a Los Angeles couple who want to adopt him. His grandparents are seeking custody and his return to Thailand.</p>

        <p>A Second Baptism  The Vatican has decided that Mormons must be rebaptized before converting to Catholicism, effectively treating Mormon converts as Mormons deal with Catholics who embrace Mormonism. The decision, following a similar move by the United Methodist Church a year ago, rubs against Mormon efforts to be clearly understood as a Christian church.</p>

        <p>Talking While Driving  About 3 percent of daytime drivers in the United States -- or about 500,000 -- are using hand-held cell phones at any given moment, the government said in its first on-the-street survey of phone use in vehicles.</p>

The three girls, ages 12, 13 and 16, drowned, but the boy, age 11, made it back to shore.</p>
