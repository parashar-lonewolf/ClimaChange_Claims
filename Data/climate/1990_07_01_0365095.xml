        <p>Got any old bourbon bottles around the house? Empty cigarette packs? Cheap perfume bottles? Any junk left over from the 50's and 60's? Throw it out, quick. Otherwise somebody is likely to convince you that the detritus of popular culture from these two decades is worth saving, worth cataloguing, worth - I hate even to use the word - collecting. And if once you start to think this way nostalgia will choke the ongoing stream of your life, like kudzu in a Southern waterway. The whole notion of junk will be challenged. You will never be able to clean a basement or an attic again. Do I exaggerate? Am I extreme in considering the idea of ''collectibles'' to be a hazard on the same order as global warming? I think not.</p>
        <p>Consider the opening lines of ''The Lyle Price Guide to Collectibles and Memorabilia'' (Perigee/Putnam, 1988): ''Hold on! Don't throw that away!'' As Snoopy (Ceramic Sitting Snoopy, hand-painted in Italy, $40-$60) or somebody in the comics likes to say - Aaaarrrgh!</p>
        <p>Of course collecting old trash is one thing. It may be objectionable and distasteful, requiring, according to the Lyle guide, that you ''dig in garbage dumps, haunt rummage sales'' and otherwise abase yourself. But it's avoidable. You don't have to go to the dump if you don't want to. A more recent vogue for collecting items from the immediate past is far more insidious. Witness ''The Official Price Guide to Collectibles of the 50's and 60's'' by Charles Jordan (Random House, 1987), a remarkable book that documents countless collectible items from these decades worth, oh, 25 cents and up. Trash from the 50's and 60's is harder to avoid. You may have piles of it already; you may now be tempted to keep it.</p>
        <p>The threat is relatively new. At one time, not so long ago, there were standards as to what was collected and what was thrown out. Fine old books, antique furniture, and paintings of the great masters were kept. At a slightly lower socioeconomic level prints of Brittany spaniels and duck decoys were in favor. Old cigarette packages, on the other hand, were thrown out. Of course, there were some gray areas. Some people threw out canceled stamps; other people collected them. But in general items to be collected had to have some inherent value. One collected them because they were beautiful or because they cost pots of money. Collecting smacked of class distinctions, which was the main reason people went in for it.</p>
        <p>This is not the case with collectibles, particularly with stuff from the 50's and 60's. Consider, once again, the Lyle guide: ''There is absolutely no limit to what is worth money. . . . One train ticket crumpled up on a station platform is worth nothing. Ten train tickets, neatly arranged in order, form the basis of . . .'' Oh, well, you can guess the rest, fame, fortune, honor of a sort.</p>
        <p>Sad, isn't it, to see all distinctions fall, to see the democracy of the marketplace (Eastern Europe - take note of your future), which produced Gomer Pyle, Vanna White and Froot Loops, triumph in yet another sphere? Or maybe, depending on one's cultural politics, it's encouraging in a sort of lunatic, populist way. It's the rise of the disenfranchised, after all, of latent collectors, long excluded from the pastime by lack of money or taste, having their hideous revenge. (TV Guide, issue No. 614, Jan. 2-8, 1965, with the Munsters on the cover, $7-$9.) Not that all items from the 50's and 60's are coarse. The Official Guide also includes collectibles that might almost be considered sublime - Eames chairs, baseball cards, women's leotards (certain women's leotards). Marilyn Monroe's leotard from ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' is worth more than $2,000 and one worn by Jane Russell more than $3,000.</p>
        <p>But these are the exceptions. Some of the more typical 50's and 60's items now being collected are: decorative bottles and other products from Avon, such as ''Best Friend,'' a blue, dog-shaped soap that sold for 59 cents in 1956 and now brings $55; special Jim Beam bottles, like the Man in Barrel, No. 1 ($445), or the Golden Chalice, executive series, ($73); cigarette packs from the good old days, before the whole idea of not smoking had been invented; Coca-Cola cans and ashtrays; anything having to do with Elvis or the Beatles; the famed Flying Nun lunch box from 1968 ($7 to $9); Snoopy things; Howdy Doody things, and James Dean masks. These last are very unusual items, ''life-size replicas of the actor's head, made with a plastic that looked and felt like actual flesh. The masks, though widely produced at the time, are a rarity today.'' Thank God.</p>
        <p>One of the characteristics of collectibles, in particular so-called memorabilia, from these recent decades, is that whereas in older, pre-post-modern times people would collect actual paintings, or fruit knives, or even old light bulbs, in which the object itself was what was of interest both then and now, with memorabilia the objects that are most popular and accessible only refer to the thing that was originally important. This is a kind of meta-collecting. Marilyn Monroe's clothes are one example. Posters for movies, empty cigarette packs and old copies of TV Guide are others. The music of the Beatles is not collectible - it is available everywhere. Ah, but how many people have old, authentic Beatles sweatshirts, or boots, or dolls, or lunch boxes, or better yet, wallpaper.</p>
        <p>Faced with the complete lack of interest in workmanship or esthetics involved in collecting an old copy of TV Guide or a photograph of Ronald Reagan (when he was an actor), one is forced to consider the possibility that the 50's and 60's collectibles are well, camp. But this can't be. Not all of them. Someone might indulge in an Elvis fetish for complex reasons of reverse snobbism, but nobody is moved by subtlety and irony to spend $60 on a G. I. Joe from 1964, (''hard plastic, blond molded hair'' ). No one belongs to the Ginny Doll Club and receives the Ginny Doll Club News as a clever comment on the tyranny of high culture.</p>
        <p>On the other hand it is simply too frightening to imagine that, as the collectors themselves claim, Ginny Dolls and G. I. Joes are collected because people like them. I prefer to think that the collectors have higher intentions. I imagine nostalgic collecting to be, in reality, a vast, altruistic enterprise in prospective archeology. After all, the Smithsonian Institution has a Barbie collection, intended presumably to show somebody from the future what disgusting times we lived in.</p>
        <p>But even the Smithsonian can't save every variety of Barbie, not every single one, not in addition to every G. I. Joe, Beatle coin purse, Minnie the Moo Sponge Puppet and Jayne Mansfield's bathing suit from the 1956 movie ''The Girl Can't Help It'' (I hope the people who buy these leotards and bathing suits don't do it so they can dress up in them). So the little people, the collectors of collectibles, have decided to pitch in and help. And thanks to them, the popular culture of the 50's and 60's, two decades that probably surpassed the entire Renaissance in the number of statuettes produced, is being selflessly preserved.</p>
        <p>Which brings up a minor objection to the subjects covered in Jordan's Official Price Guide. There seem to be strange gaps here. Does nobody collect those funny little buttons with the peace symbols on them? (There's supposed to be a peace symbol in this book, but I couldn't find it.) Or is it only Nixon buttons? Do we want to remember just the Beatles and Julie Andrews? What about old Grateful Dead paraphernalia? And how about R. Crumb comic books featuring Mr. Natural? Is there any possible monetary value attached to partly charred draft cards, redeemed from the fire at the last moment? Or is anything directly related to the Vietnam War by definition not collectible?</p>
        <p>I myself was alive during both of these decades, first as a child and then as a young man, and I'll admit that I have a soft spot for Sergeant Preston and his dog King (more for King, really), but I think if we're going to collect junk we need to have a truly broad scope. For instance, here are two items from my past that I would be interested in pricing, that I think more honestly reflect the gamut of experience of the 50's and 60's than the Eisenhower/Monkees/Elvis nexus of Jordan's guide. They are: one original, although slightly scratched, set of Davy Crockett records, 78l's, (''Born on a mountaintop in Tennessee . . .''), and one orange-and-black Princeton University S.D.S. button (school colors), ca. 1969. Anybody interested?</p>
