        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The spate of international agreements recently spurned by the Bush administration has now passed a disturbing threshold (front page, July 31): a vein of isolationism has clearly been tapped into.</p>
        <p>Prospective treaties to ban nuclear testing, reduce global warming, curtail small arms trafficking and prohibit biological weapons have been rejected, diluted or deferred by the Bush administration; soon the list will grow longer.</p>
        <p>But standing alone in so many important contexts connotes abdication of responsibility.</p>
        <p>Protestations by the administration that it is robustly pursuing national interests to the contrary, it is clear that the fundamental premise underlying its behavior is an antipathy toward anything that will bind the United States to bundles of international rules.</p>
        <p>In fact, international agreements are crucial tools for binding other countries to rules that reflect our own interests. Without a seat at the table, however, opportunities will continue to be squandered.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY STACEY  New York, July 31, 2001</p>
        <p>The writer is a president's fellow in international relations and a fellow of the Institute for European Studies at Columbia University.</p>
