        <p>Each winter the air here takes on the fragrance of sulfur, the acid fog becomes so dense that planes are often delayed, and the wilted leaves drop from the Chinese evergreen trees like portents of the early deaths that some here will suffer.</p>
        <p>Half a century ago, this mammoth city was China's wartime capital, a vast grassy basin whose surrounding mountains could keep the enemy out. But now the mountains lock in the soot, waste and chemicals that are by-products of China's industrial revolution.</p>
        <p>Over the last half-dozen years, people here began to notice strange changes: onions, potatoes and vegetables began to wither in the peasants' plots, unripe fruit fell off the trees, and nearly half of the Nanshan forest died from an insect that was attracted to sulfur-polluted leaves.</p>
        <p>Twenty miles away, in the relatively clean area of Beibei, the death rate from lung cancer is 20 people per 100,000 inhabitants per year. In the urban area of Chongqing, the death rate is 47 per 100,000. 'Air Is Very Depressing'</p>
        <p>"To live and breathe this air, day in and day out, is very depressing," Zheng Youbin, who has studied the city's pollution problems for the last decade, said in a rare outburst of emotion during a two-hour interview. "Our children get sick more easily here."</p>
        <p>Chongqing, like the rest of China, is suffering from industrial fallout, the polluted air, water and soil that are the underside of the economic boom that in other ways is sending living standards soaring. China's nearly 1.2 billion residents are paying a rising price for their rapid economic development, and the nation as a whole is facing fundamental long-term choices about how to keep the mess from getting worse.</p>
        <p>Yet almost all experts expect the pollution problems to grow. As Chinese trade their bicycles for motorcycles and cars, as they build new factories that produce wonderful new merchandise and hideous new pollutants, as they burn more coal and oil and electricity, the pressure on the environment will almost certainly grow worse.</p>
        <p>In 1991, acid rain alone is estimated to have caused $2.8 billion in damage to farm crops, forests and buildings across the nation, according to a report in the English-language China Daily. And factories are expected to pump an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide into the air, from 15.5 million tons in 1991 to more than 1.4 billion tons projected for the year 2000 if the pollution is not controlled.</p>
        <p>"They're going to have environmental problems of world-class proportions," a Western diplomat in Beijing said. Neighbors Are Affected</p>
        <p>Moreover, the problems will affect China's neighbors as well. Winds sometimes carry acid rain to Japan and Korea, and the country's gaseous emissions make China the fastest-growing major contributor to the greenhouse gases associated with global warming.</p>
        <p>Here in Chongqing, the fog and rain turns acidic because of smoke from the local sulfur-tainted coal, the major source of energy.</p>
        <p>Wang Gang, an official responsible for the environment of the 15 million residents in Chongqing and its surrounding rural areas, said: "It's about as bad as the vinegar we eat. The worst fog in London in the 1950's was when you couldn't see three or four meters. Chongqing is about the same. Even in the summer, we don't take walks."</p>
        <p>To be sure, China's environmental problems are probably not as bad as those of Mexico or of some areas in Eastern Europe. Much more than most developing countries, China has begun to grapple with the problems, and its regulatory and propaganda efforts have won it accolades from the United Nations. An Environmental Advantage</p>
        <p>Thanks to the Communist expertise in institutional supervision, the environmental bureaucracy in China stretches into small counties and even towns as it does in no other developing country. Moreover, the economic boom gives China the resources to pay for pollution abatement, as well as the option of sacrificing growth where necessary.</p>
        <p>Still, for now, economic development remains overwhelmingly the top priority. Chinese officials have repeatedly said they will not sacrifice economic progress for the sake of the environment.</p>
        <p>Already, China's construction boom has created strains on many kinds of natural resources. Most of China's mature forests are being chopped down, and clean water sources are increasingly polluted by industrial wastes.</p>
        <p>On cold wintry days, when coal-fired heat warms the offices and meeting rooms in buildings across the north, officials traveling from the sunnier south sometimes demand daily "pollution compensation" fees. Surgical Masks Common</p>
        <p>In many cities across the nation, particularly in the north, air pollution exceeds standards set by the World Health Organization, sometimes by five to six times. That is about seven to eight times as bad as the air quality in New York City, according to World Bank statistics. Citizens in many Chinese cities wear surgical masks when they go outside in the wintertime, to guard against the coal dust.</p>
        <p>The city of Benxi in Liaoning Province has such a national reputation for bad air pollution that when a surgeon in another city glimpsed the blackness of the lungs of a patient on whom he was operating, he guessed immediately -- and correctly -- that the patient was from Benxi.</p>
        <p>Last year, China was the world's largest consumer of coal, burning more than one billion tons to meet three-quarters of its energy needs.</p>
        <p>All over the nation now, factories and homes are burning coal, sending plumes of dirty and sometimes sulfur-contaminated smoke into the air. China is expected to burn even more coal in the coming years. Lung Disease Prevalent</p>
        <p>Recent statistics indicate that the leading cause of death in China is lung disease, according to the World Bank, which linked the disease to air pollution. The ailment, formally called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, occurs at a rate five times as high as in the United States, the World Bank said. The number of lung cancer deaths is also on the rise, although this is partly associated with smoking.</p>
        <p>China's water pollution is also provoking concern. The seven major rivers that flow through cities are choked with sewage, and the abundance of prawns and scallops in coastal waters has dropped markedly.</p>
        <p>In 1991, factories dumped 25 billion tons of industrial waste into the country's waterways, aggravating an already-strained water supply that leaves 85 percent of Chinese cities short of clean water. In the countryside, only one Chinese in seven has safe drinking water, the World Bank says.</p>
        <p>All this makes the job of Qu Geping, head of China's Environmental Protection Agency, a delicate task of lobbying for a cleaner environment without appearing to be an obstacle to growth. Partly because of growing awareness of the problems, Mr. Qu's influence is increasing, and he is believed to be close to Prime Minister Li Peng.</p>
        <p>Deng Nan, a daughter of China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, is also a senior official with a moderate interest in pollution problems, and experts say they believe she has played a role in the growing environmental consciousness of her father. Still, Mr. Qu does not have ministerial rank, and he has little clout in policy-making.</p>
        <p>"Of all the world's fast-developing nations, the hardest place to be a minister of environmental policy is in China," Mr. Qu said, after talking for an hour about China's environmental achievements. "I am worried. With the economy developing so fast, I don't know if our environmental protection can keep up." Need for More Spending</p>
        <p>China spends about 0.8 percent of its gross national product on improving the environment. The World Bank says that to control the current environmental deterioration, China would have to spend nearly 1.5 percent of its G.N.P., nearly the same percentage that some Western countries like the United States allocate.</p>
        <p>For now, local environmental officials rely on raising money on their own through pollution taxes and fines. Enterprises are allowed to pollute as long as they pay a tax to the local environmental agency if their waste exceeds centrally defined standards.</p>
        <p>In 1991, the total annual amount of such pollution taxes reached $350 million, and that figure is expected to rise.</p>
        <p>Fines are also imposed but are mostly tiny. As a result, local officials pin their hopes on money from overseas.</p>
        <p>"We are striving to get donations from overseas to help solve our environmental problems," said Xu Shubi, the deputy chief of Chongqing's Environmental Protection Bureau. "But we haven't found any donors yet."</p>
