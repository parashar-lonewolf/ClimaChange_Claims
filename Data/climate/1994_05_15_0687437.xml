        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Michael Silverstein completely missed what is happening in Washington and around the country to promote the environmental industry. A cluster of major policy initiatives to protect the global environment and promote this vital industry is in the final stage of development and many programs are already being implemented by the Clinton-Gore team.</p>
        <p>In the last 10 months, our organization, the Environmental Business Council of the United States, has worked closely with members of the Administration and Congress to increase Government interest and participation in the environmental industry, including a focus on improved competitiveness in foreign markets. One result of the initiative is, in part, a program announced in November 1993 by the Administration to develop a cooperative export program with the environmental industry.</p>
        <p>Beyond this initiative, the Administration has under development a comprehensive strategy to increase exports of environmental products and services and to develop innovative environmental technologies. Other important elements include:</p>
        <p>* A new national export policy developed by the Commerce Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and other agencies as members of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee announced in September 1993.</p>
        <p>* The E.P.A.'s environmental technologies initiative, which will aggressively promote new American technologies in a long-term, well-financed program.</p>
        <p>* A program coordinated by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to promote development of environmental technologies for sustainable development.</p>
        <p>* A reorganization of foreign aid programs, coordinated by the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, to emphasize environmentally sustainable development.</p>
        <p>* Military conversion financing for hazardous-waste site cleanups and for technology development.</p>
        <p>* Energy Department financing for technology in areas that include energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and transfer and commercialization of technologies developed in the Energy Department system.</p>
        <p>In addition, significant legislative initiatives to implement elements of the strategy and to support the development of environmental technology and business are pending in Congress with the support of the Administration. All these initiatives offer the potential to advance the environmental industry, created by the rigorous United States environmental laws, toward leadership in the global movement for sustainable development.</p>
        <p>The environmental industry has been challenged by the Clinton Administration to cooperate and improve its market opportunity. It can either participate or stand by and let the process proceed. A powerful partnership for global environmental protection and job creation is under way. DONALD L. CONNORS  Needham, Mass., April 26  1 The writer is president of the Environmental Business Council of the United States, a private trade group.</p>
