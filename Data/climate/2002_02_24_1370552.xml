        <p>With soil parched, reservoirs depleted and streams trickling at rates typical of a record summer heat wave, water managers for New York City and surrounding communities are scurrying to find new ways to increase supplies and cut demand.</p>
        <p>It is not that they are worried about getting through the East Coast's current dry spell, which technically began in 1998 and -- like all droughts -- will end eventually. In fact, many water officials and experts say the tough droughts in the 1960's and 1980's prompted conservation measures that have cut profligate water use.</p>
        <p>The new effort is aimed at a point down the line -- no one knows how far in the future -- when spreading development reduces the soil's storage capacity, and the growing population and economy boost demand so much that some places run dry.</p>
        <p>For some communities, chronic water shortages could lead to a politician's ultimate nightmare -- an immovable cap on economic growth.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a tough, dry season,'' said Bradley M. Campbell, the acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. But more important than getting through this year, he said, is changing practices so the metropolitan region can handle future, potentially larger, climate shifts comfortably. ''We need to change the way we do business in managing water resources,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Government hydrologists say a prolonged lack of precipitation and warm temperatures this winter are setting the metropolitan region up for a summer drought that could rival what is called the ''drought of record,'' which drained reservoirs and wells from 1963 to 1965. New York City and most New Jersey counties have been under a drought warning since late January.</p>
        <p>The Delaware River Basin Commission, which controls Delaware River water used by 20 million people, issued a drought emergency in December that reduces allotments for New York City and the four states sharing the supply.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, some private water suppliers have begun offering steep discounts to large users when water is plentiful, to encourage those that have storage capacity to fill up when water is abundant and cut water use.</p>
        <p>But much more must be done, said Mr. Campbell, whose agency is trying to get developers to change their approach to some projects -- to create parking lots with permeable material instead of asphalt, for example, allowing rain to percolate into the soil.</p>
        <p>The state also needs to clean up its galaxy of toxic waste sites, which continue to taint groundwater and keep that resource off limits for drinking, he said.</p>
        <p>Eventually, fundamental shifts in development patterns will probably be necessary, water policy experts in the region say.</p>
        <p>''What comes first, the water supply or the housing?'' said Gary N. Paulachok, the deputy Delaware River master, who is charged with making sure the users of of the river's water are honoring binding agreements to share it.</p>
        <p>''In a lot of cases,'' he said, ''we see housing developments go in and then the search is on for a water supply.''</p>
        <p>To stave off trouble, New York City is taking a fresh look at a range of ideas even as its engineers inspect equipment it last used in the drought emergency of 1989 to pump and treat water from the Hudson River 60 miles north of the city -- the source of last resort.</p>
        <p>It is considering buying small private water supplies south of its Delaware River reservoirs in the Catskills, which could help it meet its obligations under an interstate water compact. The city has to keep some water flowing in dry times to other users of the Delaware River in New Jersey and elsewhere downstream.</p>
        <p>By gaining control of other water sources feeding into the Delaware, the city could satisfy its water-sharing requirement without taking as much from reservoirs holding the city's supply.</p>
        <p>City officials have also started asking big commercial users of water to consider switching, where possible, to recycled wastewater for nondrinking purposes instead of using high-quality drinking water.</p>
        <p>''Ninety percent of the water we use does not go to human needs,'' said Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. The city is interested in pursuing anything that cuts the use of drinking water for other purposes, he said.</p>
        <p>The goal, city officials said, would be to install systems for reusing water for such purposes, the way car washes and laundries capture, filter and reuse water that would otherwise go down the drain. One large consumer cited by Mr. Sturcken is the airports. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey guzzles tens of thousand of gallons of water a day to wash planes at the regional airports it operates.</p>
        <p>To keep jobs and businesses coming to Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island without straining drinking water supplies, Mr. Sturcken said, the city is considering drawing undrinkable groundwater from wells in Brooklyn and Queens to supply, at a discount rate, to businesses needing water for manufacturing.</p>
        <p>And in a layer of porous rock deep beneath the boroughs, the city is also considering creating a reservoir, a giant underground bubble of water stored in the porous earth. In times of surplus, water would be pumped into this layer of porous rock, then pumped out when supplies are low, city officials said.</p>
        <p>New Jersey already has nine such reservoirs, called aquifer storage and recovery systems, and five more are planned or are being built, said R. David G. Pyne, a water engineer in Gainesville, Fla., who keeps track of water storage projects around the world and maintains a Web site on the technology, www.asrforum.com.</p>
        <p>Subterranean banking of water is most established in dry regions. Las Vegas has the largest aquifer storage system in the United States, pumping up to 100 million gallons a day into the ground. New York City's would equal that, if tests bear out its merits, Mr. Sturcken said.</p>
        <p>Another result of the region's steadily lengthening drought, which water experts say almost guarantees strict limits on use this summer in the New York metropolitan area, is intensifying tugs of war over shared supplies.</p>
        <p>Most notable is the growing grumbling over how best to share the Delaware River, which provides about half of New York City's water through aqueducts leading from the Catskills and also serves 12 million people downstream, some as far as Philadelphia and parts of Delaware.</p>
        <p>City environmental officials say they have been pressing the Delaware River Basin Commission to fulfill commitments to build new reservoirs downstream. Under the existing sharing scheme among New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, established after two battles before the United States Supreme Court, the city is obliged to dump water from its reservoirs to sustain a certain flow in the Delaware.</p>
        <p>Robert Tudor, the deputy executive director of the river basin commission, said that every option for averting shortages was being considered by communities sharing the water. In Pennsylvania, experts are assessing using old gravel pits and mines to bank excess water, he said.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania Legislature is also considering a bill that would create the first statewide system for conserving water and tracking all water use. The bill cites projections that parts of the state will run out of water in a few decades.</p>
        <p>Some private water experts say New York City would benefit greatly from adjusting prices for water to encourage conservation in dry times -- the same way transportation officials are now increasing tolls during periods of peak traffic to encourage people to shift driving patterns.</p>
        <p>James T. B. Tripp, a member of the New York City Water Board and general counsel for Environmental Defense, a private conservation group, said that raising rates a certain amount for each level of a drought warning or emergency would encourage landlords, homeowners and businesses to conserve.</p>
        <p>''People respond to prices,'' he said. ''It's a great way to deliver a message.''</p>
        <p>Even as water disputes intensify and conservation projects move ahead, no one is certain whether the future will be drier or wetter.</p>
        <p>Ever since the city, in the 1830's, put 4,000 laborers to work building distant dams and aquifers for its upstate supply, most decisions and investments made by the people who manage the water system and others nearby have been aimed at preventing problems a generation or more ahead.</p>
        <p>But now there are many indications that the climatic future will not resemble the past, that a global warming trend and other regional shifts measured in recent years hint of bigger, unpredictable, changes to come.</p>
        <p>Most climate experts expect global warming to have big impacts on water supplies around the world, altering storm and drought patterns, spawning more sudden downpours, and shrinking mountain snowpacks that provide long-term water storage for places like California and Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>But when the focus closes in on specific regions, the computer models render only a blurry vision. A recent study of the impact of climate change on water supplies in and around New York City by scientists at Columbia University said there would doubtless be changes.</p>
        <p>For example, the study said, warmer temperatures will result in more water loss through evaporation and will likely require the city to release more water into upstate streams in the summer to sustain native trout populations.</p>
        <p>But in a warmer world, would there generally be more or less water in the reservoirs? The scientists answered with a blunt maybe. ''Current global climate change models cannot forecast rainfall patterns with sufficient accuracy to indicate what will happen to precipitation in the New York City system watersheds,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>And that leaves the water managers for the city, New Jersey and communities small and large along the East Coast expressing growing concern as they log onto the Internet every day to check government maps of stream and river currents, where colored dots denote the strength of flows.</p>
        <p>For months, the region -- in fact the entire East Coast -- has been peppered with red dots, each indicating a new record low.</p>
        <p>The managers know chances are that spring rains will return, or a hurricane will sweep up the coast, or El Niño's slow awakening in the Pacific this year will nudge the jet stream and shake off the dry pattern.</p>
        <p>But even so, they say, the array of glowing red dots adds to the urgency of their search for ways to store, conserve or secure more water, because there is the chance that nature will not cooperate.</p>
        <p>''Is it good water management policy to depend on tropical storms to get us out of trouble?'' said Mr. Paulachok, the Delaware River water official. Last year, such a storm never came, setting up the situation that is intensifying now.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, all around the region, the ground is growing drier and streams are continuing to shrivel, according to federal officials.</p>
        <p>''In southeastern Pennsylvania, well drillers are working 24-7 to either drill new wells or deepen existing ones,'' Mr. Paulachok said. ''It could be a very, very difficult summer.''</p>
