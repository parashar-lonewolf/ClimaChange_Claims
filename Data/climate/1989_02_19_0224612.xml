        <p>LEAD:  In every life we have some trouble,  When you worry, you make it double.  Don't worry, be happy.</p>
        <p>In every life we have some trouble,  When you worry, you make it double.  Don't worry, be happy.</p>
        <p>BOBBY McFERRIN, 1988  What's the use of worrying  It was never worthwhile  So pack up your troubles in your old kit bag  And smile, smile, smile.</p>
        <p>GEORGE ASAF, 1915 IT seems popular music would have you believe that how I spend half my life is a dreadful waste of time. I don't buy it. If I ever stopped worrying, everything I ward off by worrying about would come to pass. My children would be unpopular, unhealthy losers. My husband would buy another sports car. Dan Quayle would be President.</p>
        <p>It is not that I enjoy the symptoms; the tense muscles, racing heart, upset stomach that accompany the anxiety of worrying (without burning up one lousy calorie), but I think I deserve at least partial credit for the world's maintaining its status quo.</p>
        <p>Studies show that 15 percent of the population are chronic worriers. We cover all bases with our uncontrollable stream of negative thoughts. We lie awake at night (prime worrying time) earning our doctorates in foreboding, anticipating a future of embarrassing mistakes, bungled first impressions and failure. As much as common sense might show that worrying never results in any solution, that in fact the only thing it produces is wrinkles and gray hair, we on the front lines believe in the importance of the work we do.</p>
        <p>My mother was a small-potatoes worrier. She worried about us catching cold, getting a stop sign on the corner, fitting into that new dress for next month's wedding. My neighbor is a more global worrier. She agonizes over the Shoreham power plant, the shrinking ozone layer, the national deficit. In the spring my sister worries about stepping barefoot on bugs in the garden. All year round my husband worries about death. My daughter worries that the Nazis could come back. And I worry about all these things by 10 in the morning.</p>
        <p>Although I detest being unproductive, in fact I go mad waiting at red lights, searching for car keys, opening junk mail, I never consider worrying a waste of time. I find moderate amounts comforting, giving me a fantasized measure of control over the uncontrollable. By generating a series of catastrophic hypothetical scenarios and envisioning their implications, I plot strategies to avoid or prepare for the dangers ahead. That's why I'm a good person to stand next to in a crisis. My pocketbook could rescue you from hunger (crackers), pain (aspirin), embarrassment (Tampax) and sloth (an extra pair of panty hose).</p>
        <p>I have to put productive worry time in for all those ignorant fools who don't. They tell me that as I lie on my deathbed, hastened not by overwork but overworry, I'll say I had a lot of trouble in my life, most of which never happened. I say let's see in the end. I'm busy either willing something good to happen or something terrible to be avoided.</p>
        <p>Since I seem to be one of the few around to see reality accurately, I allow happy people to go on believing in illusions, in falsely high opinions of themselves and their chances of survival. Let them give self-serving explanations for whatever happens.</p>
        <p>I know that my worrying has gotten my daughter into a college she loves. It prevented any serious power shortages last summer. It returned the crew of the latest shuttle safely. At this point worrying is my moral obligation. So even though there are those who say, ''Ain't no use putting up your umbrella till it rains,'' I say you should thank your lucky stars I do.</p>
        <p>Mothers have a unique corner of the worrying market. While men do worry about money and their health, they're mere amateurs in the art of unreasoning dread. Drugs and abductions, AIDS and drunken drivers, torment anxious mothers' nightmares. All other concerns pale as mothers play with worry beads, never free of ''Are they no longer contagious?'' ''Will they win?'' ''Do they get enough rest?'' ''Are they happy?''</p>
        <p>If not every answer is an unqualified yes, then what have we done (too little, too much) to ruin their lives? We start off life's journey thinking we're going to drive our children to their destination, but learn pretty soon we're merely accompanying them on the long, bumpy ride.</p>
        <p>To worry expertly requires special skills. You have to know exactly where to snip off your fears so they don't grow into a persistent vicious cycle. When you're so worried you're no longer sure what you're anxious about, you've overdone it.</p>
        <p>As a novice worrier, I worried all wrong. As a college student, I delayed taking my swimming test till the week before graduation. I could swim fine, but never learned to dive. No diploma could be issued before this simple test was passed. My dreams were filled with me, a college dropout with 128 credits, searching for a job. My fiance would demand his ring back, and rightly so, rejecting a life with a gutless wonder. My parents, humiliated beyond reason, would no longer love me.</p>
        <p>I dreamed longingly of the flower children in Haight-Ashbury and wondered what I'd look like barefoot with rose-colored granny glasses. I was a step away from living in Grand Central Station before I got it together, put on my bathing suit and plunged, eyes closed, into the pool.</p>
        <p>Now as a worry maven, I know how to ration my worry time. Psychologists suggest establishing a half hour worry period, same time, same place, each day. I am not that disciplined. As with surfing, timing is everything. Today I stop worrying when I find bits of teeth in my mouth, ground down from clenching my jaw. That's at least three hours before I picture Grand Central Station.</p>
        <p>So though some call worrying the ''rust of life,'' destroying its brightness, weakening its power; though some think my way of coping with uncertainty is like interest paid on trouble before it comes due, I know better. Let them sleep well, knowing that a chosen group of earth's creatures is busy staving off disaster and making their world a less traumatic place in which to live.</p>
