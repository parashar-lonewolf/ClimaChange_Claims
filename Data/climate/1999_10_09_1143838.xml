        <p>Imagine a Danish landscape: half-timbered houses sagging at midbeam, farmlands sloping toward the sea, crenelated church belfries with their masonry step notches marching up the sides.</p>
        <p>Nowadays that's an incomplete portrait. Bringing it up to date means making room for sleek, silvery towers with long-bladed propellers on top.</p>
        <p>Danes are putting windmills -- or wind turbines, as the modern versions are called -- all over their picturesque place. There are small private ones in backyards, larger ones in open fields and rows of giant industrial-strength ones standing single file in shallow offshore waters.</p>
        <p>The move to wind power makes particular sense for Denmark, an intensely ecology-minded country that is a low-lying assemblage of 407 islands and a large peninsula in one of the breeziest corners of the world.</p>
        <p>Shorn of its beards-and-sandals image, wind power has also become a big business for Denmark, which exports windmills to 35 countries and accounts for more than 50 percent of devices manufactured in the world.</p>
        <p>''When we decided 25 years ago that we wouldn't have nuclear power, we had to ask ourselves, 'What do we do now?' '' Soren Hermansen said as he walked through a pasture behind his house to show a visitor the windmill he and his neighbors own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hermansen, called an energy adviser on his business card, has returned to the island where he was born 40 years ago to help Samso fulfill its designation as the site for a 10-year Government project to power an entire community 100 percent on renewable energy. Samso beat out four other finalists by submitting a plan to live a decade from now on nothing but solar, wind and biomass energy from organic waste and agricultural surplus.</p>
        <p>The success of the venture turns on the participation of the island's 4,400 inhabitants, which by law must be voluntary. No problem in Denmark. Signs of concern with the environment are anywhere you look.</p>
        <p>Recycling centers across the country are full of glossy field-green deposit boxes with stenciled instructions on their sides identifying what you should put in them. To coax people out of their cars, the country has set up more than 6,000 miles of marked cycle routes, and in downtown Copenhagen there are distinctly colored public bicycles activated by putting coins in the handlebars.</p>
        <p>Products with red and white ''stats-kontrolleret ekologisk'' stickers take up more and more supermarket shelves, crowding out the space left for foods that don't carry the state's additive-free assurance.</p>
        <p>In 1971 Denmark became the first European country to create a Cabinet-level ministry exclusively for the environment. It now boasts that half of all waste is recycled and 80 percent of new paper is made from used paper. Businesses pay a tax on their carbon dioxide emissions, with the revenue going to conservation and efficiency plans.</p>
        <p>Magrethe Auken, 54, a Danish legislator, excitedly interrupted a conversation about ecology to point out the window to the parking lot below her office. ''Those spaces used to hold eight cars,'' she said, ''but now they've been freed up to hold 80 bicycles. Tell me another parliament in the world that would do that.''</p>
        <p>The country's largest public works project, the 9.5-mile, $2 billion link between Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmo due to open in July, was delayed for years by environmental concerns. There were doubts about its effect on water flow from the Baltic, and on the birds, frogs, ducks and seals that breed on a limestone island in the straits separating the two countries. At considerable added expense, an artificial landfill island was formed to enable builders to tunnel under the sea and not disturb the fragile watery environment.</p>
        <p>The Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen is focusing these days on bringing its heating and lighting systems under central control, converting its vehicles to electricity, turning its kitchen waste into feed for 1,400 pigs, monitoring the watering of its acres of flowers and clearing up its algae-choked lake.</p>
        <p>''When I go out to explain to people why moving to renewable energy is a good thing,'' Mr. Hermansen said, ''it helps to make the economic argument about saving oil costs, selling wind power and getting Government money. But there is a good feeling among Danes about self-sufficiency and the environment I can play on, too. Danes have a romantic attachment to the idea of leaving land unharmed.''</p>
        <p>Conservation in Denmark not only benefits from high levels of public support -- 80 percent of the country's windmills are owned by individuals or cooperatives -- but also profits from the individual ingenuity of people in places like Samso.</p>
        <p>Two of the earliest windmills on the island, still spinning away after 15 years, were built by a local plumber. A gardener, Kai Alexandersen, 69, proudly pointed out two solar panels on the roof of his toolshed and the nest of tubes and pumps carrying the gathered power to his house.</p>
        <p>How had he managed to create and install the elaborate system, he was asked. ''With these,'' he said, extending his weathered hands.</p>
        <p>Among the ways the project aims to achieve its goal: improving home insulation; centralizing community heating and focusing it on wood chip furnaces and straw-burning stoves; creating biogas from manure, organic waste and potato tops from the island's principal farm product, and gradually converting the island's fleet of cars and vans to electricity.  People who agree to take these steps get generous grants from the Government to help pay for them.</p>
        <p>Hopes of powering all the vehicles and ferryboats with ethanol were dashed when planners calculated that producing sufficient rapeseed oil for the task would use up all the agricultural land on the 17-mile-long island. Instead, Samso will deliver extra wind-generated energy to the national grid to compensate for the gasoline it burns.</p>
        <p>The wind business had its origins in Denmark in individual effort and community experience that have given the Danish model wide acceptance. Wind energy today covers 7 percent of Danish electricity consumption and will rise to 50 percent by 2030, according to the Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy.</p>
        <p>This flat land of farms, beech woods, heather-covered moors, no substantial hills and 5.3 million people on the exposed northern coast of Europe may be marginal to many of the world's endeavors. But in terms of wind power development, it is the hub of global activity.</p>
        <p>One person happy with Denmark's unaccustomed positioning at the center is Soren Krohn, managing director of the Danish Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association. ''The Danes,'' he said, ''were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time with the right concept.''</p>
