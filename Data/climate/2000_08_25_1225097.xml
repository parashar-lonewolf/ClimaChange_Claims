        <p>A government report to be released as soon as Friday reaches few conclusions about the effects of tightening federal fuel-economy regulations for automobiles, making it virtually certain that the regulations will not be changed by Congress before the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is the chairman of the Commerce Committee, ordered the report from the General Accounting Office of Congress late last spring, when high gasoline prices were prompting outrage among motorists. But while gasoline prices are rising again now as crude oil prices increase, enthusiasm for tighter rules has faded in Congress since a Senate compromise this summer called for the National Academy of Sciences to perform a more thorough yearlong review of the issue.</p>
        <p>A Commerce Committee aide who insisted on anonymity said that the committee was virtually certain not to hold a hearing this autumn on gas mileage standards, and would wait instead for the more complete report from the National Academy of Sciences. The committee is considering, however, a hearing this autumn on global warming, to which gasoline combustion by automobiles is a big contributor, the aide said.</p>
        <p>Senator McCain has been sent a memorandum about the General Accounting Office report but has not seen the document itself, and has not had time to discuss it with his staff, the aide added.</p>
        <p>Current fuel-economy regulations require each automaker to manufacture cars with an average gas mileage of 27.5 miles a gallon and light trucks -- a category encompassing sport utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks -- that get an average of 20.7 miles a gallon. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate have used the Transportation Department's annual budget to bar regulators since 1995 from raising either standard. But the more lenient standard for light trucks was the object of particular scrutiny in Congress earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The General Accounting Office report concludes that tighter standards would reduce gasoline consumption and emissions of gases that contribute to global warming, but would have an unclear effect on safety.</p>
        <p>Cars and light trucks account for one-sixth of the emissions of global-warming gases in the United States, which in turn accounts for a quarter of the world's emissions, the report found, adding that for the cars and light trucks alone, ''This amount exceeds the total greenhouse gas emissions of all but a few countries.''</p>
        <p>The more gasoline that an automobile burns, the more such gases it emits. Average gas mileage has fallen 8 percent in the United States since a peak of 25.9 miles a gallon in the 1988 model year, as many motorists have switched to light trucks from cars, the report said.</p>
        <p>The safety effects of raising standards would depend on how quickly new rules were phased in, the report noted. A rapid increase in standards might prompt automakers to build many small, lightweight, less-safe vehicles to improve their averages, while a slower increase might cause automakers to adopt more efficient technologies instead, it said.</p>
        <p>Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group, said that automakers want fuel-economy rules eliminated, not tightened.</p>
        <p>A separate study by Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, estimates that automakers avoided $10.2 billion in gas-guzzler taxes in the 1999 model year alone because light trucks are exempt from the tax. The tax penalizes cars based on the extent to which their fuel-economy falls below 22.5 miles a gallon, with fines of up to $7,700 for a few high-performance sports cars that get as poor mileage as the largest pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Friends of the Earth assumed that if the gas-guzzler tax were applied to light trucks, the tax would still be collected for vehicles getting less than 22.5 miles a gallon. Ms. Bergquist said that Friends of the Earth was wrong to ignore the difference in fuel-economy standards between cars and light trucks in calculating the taxes not paid. The auto industry opposes applying the tax to light trucks in any case, she said.</p>
