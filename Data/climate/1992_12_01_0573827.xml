        <p>SCIENTISTS' understanding of what causes the Earth's great ice ages has been confronted by a major challenge: a record of ancient temperatures that seems directly contradictory to established theory. The record comes from a deep crack in the Earth in Nevada, called Devils Hole, and consists of a core drilled from layers of minerals deposited on the walls of the crack over the last 560,000 years.</p>
        <p>A pattern of isotopes in the Devils Hole core yields both the date each deposit was laid down and the temperature at the time. Scientists analyzing the record found to their great surprise that the succession of cold periods differed significantly from the accepted chronology of ice ages, as reconstructed from records in sediments on the sea floor.</p>
        <p>The good news from Devils Hole, if true, is that the periods between ice ages last for about 20,000 years, not 10,000 years as now believed. This would mean that the Earth's present interglacial period, in which civilization developed, is only about midway through its course rather than approaching its end. When the ice does return, it will crush cities and wipe out human habitation in northern climes.</p>
        <p>But is the Devils Hole record misleading? It is just one record, and the prevailing theory rests on many lines of evidence. Glaciologists believe the comings and goings of the great continental glaciers are governed by a celestial dance of the Earth, to a grand rhythm over thousands of millennia, that exposes the planet to changing amounts of sunlight as the parameters of its orbit, tilt and rotation vary in periodic cycles.</p>
        <p>This belief is known as the Milankovitch theory, after the Serbian mathematician and astronomer who first proposed it. The timing of the ice ages, as predicted by astronomers from the Milankovitch theory and confirmed by ancient temperatures from sea floor sediments, is directly contradicted by the Devils Hole core, say scientists led by Dr. Isaac J. Winograd of the United State Geological Survey, whose team gouged the core from the rock face.</p>
        <p>Since the findings were published in the journal Science in October, they have caused something of an uproar among the keepers of the conventional wisdom. Not least, this is because the chronological record from Devils Hole is acknowledged by some Milankovitch adherents to be the best yet obtained, technically speaking. The furor focuses mostly on interpretation. In a flurry of faxes and telephone calls, leading glaciologists are anxiously comparing notes and thoughts in an attempt to shoot down the interpretation being placed on the findings by the Winograd group -- or to come to terms with it.</p>
        <p>"There is a genuine controversy here, and a jolly interesting one," said Dr. Nicholas Shackleton of Cambridge University in England. Dr. Shackleton, Dr. James D. Hays of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and Dr. John Imbrie of Brown University are the three glaciologists who in 1976 published a paper that in most people's view clinched the case for the Milankovitch theory.  Millennium After Millennium</p>
        <p>The theory holds that the timing of glacial cycles is controlled by periodic wobbles in the Earth's rotation, much as a spinning top wobbles when it slows down, combined with other periodic changes in the tilt of the planet's axis and the shape of its orbit. These changes, occurring over many millennia, alter the angles and distances from which the Sun's energy strikes the Earth. In periods when less sunlight shines on far northern latitudes, according to the theory, less snow melts in the summer. Millennium after millennium, the snow is compressed into ice from which the continental sheets are built. When the cycle comes around again and more sunlight falls in the North, the sheets begin to melt.</p>
        <p>It is a relatively simple matter for astronomers to calculate the orbital cycles on which the theory depends.  Confirmation of the theory was harder and came from temperature records contained in deep-sea sediments around the world.</p>
        <p>The proportion of oxygen isotopes in these sediments indicates the mass of the world's ice sheets when the sediments were laid down. The reason is that oxygen occurs in two forms, or isotopes, known as oxygen-16 and oxygen-18, of which the lighter oxygen-16 is quicker to evaporate.  Since rain and snow contain this evaporated oxygen-16, so also do ice caps and glaciers.</p>
        <p>During ice ages, so much oxygen-16 is locked up in ice that sea water becomes comparatively richer in oxygen-18. The proportion of oxygen-18 in the shells of foraminifera, tiny marine fossils trapped in sediments, can thus be taken as a measure of ice mass, with a relatively high oxygen-18 reading meaning an ice age was at its peak. The dates of the foraminifera at various levels in a sediment core can be calculated by methods depending on the rate of radioactive decay of various elements.  Deriving a Timetable</p>
        <p>From the foraminifera record, the Hays-Imbrie-Shackleton team worked out a timetable of the ice ages and found that it closely matched the one calculated by astronomers from Milankovitch cycles.</p>
        <p>This thesis has now been shaken by the evidence from the Devils Hole crack, an open fault about 425 feet deep located about 70 miles northwest of Las Vegas. The crack is mostly filled with water, and the mineral known as calcite was deposited on its walls over millennia by rainwater that percolated through the porous rock of the underground aquifer on either side of the crack. Dr. Winograd, with colleagues in the Geological Survey and at Utah State University, has determined ancient temperatures from the oxygen-16/oxygen-18 ratio in a 14-inch core drilled from the calcite crust on the wall. From the radioactive decay of certain isotopes of uranium, his team also inferred the dates of each layer of the core.</p>
        <p>The surprise finding of the Winograd team is that the previous interglacial period before now, which took place some time between 110,000 and 150,000 years ago, started several thousand years before the increase in northern latitude sunshine that, according to the Milankovitch theory, would cause the interglacial period to begin. Also startling was the discovery that the finding that the four interglacial periods before the present one all lasted about twice as long as indicated by the earlier oceanic measurements. An Inescapable Conclusion</p>
        <p>The Winograd group also found that a major glaciation came and went some 400,000 years ago at a time when sunshine was not supposed to have changed very much.</p>
        <p>To Dr. Winograd and his colleagues, the conclusion was inescapable: contrary to the Milankovitch theory, changes in solar radiation are not the major driver of the ice ages.  "We never expected our data would end up challenging an existing theory," says Dr. Winograd. But he now believes that nonperiodic interactions in the Earth's climate system are probably the chief force behind the onset and retreat of the ice ages. The key to the puzzle, in his view, is more likely to be found in the constantly churning interplay of heat and moisture among the atmosphere, the oceans and the ice sheets than in the heavens.</p>
        <p>The Winograd paper has evoked considerable attention. Dr. Wallace S. Broecker of Lamont-Doherty, a leading supporter of the Milankovitch theory, confessed to confusion. "The geochemist in me says that the Devils Hole chronology is the best we have," he wrote in the British journal Nature. "And the paleoclimatologist in me says that correlation between the accepted marine chronology and Milankovitch cycles is just too convincing to be put aside."</p>
        <p>Dr. Imbrie notes that the Devils Hole chronology roughly coincides with the oceanic record, and thus the Milankovitch cycles, for all except the 40,000-year interval starting a little more than 110,000 years ago, when the last interglacial period before today's began. Clearly, he said, if the Winograd chronology is right and the ocean chronology is wrong, "then the Milankovitch explanation can't be invoked" to explain this next-to-last deglaciation, and internal workings of the climate system might indeed be mostly responsible. Challenge Is Mounted</p>
        <p>But "that does not mean Milankovitch is not operating," he said, and he raised this question about the Winograd findings: "Can we take this one chronology, developed at one site and in such an unusual environment, at face value?" With that, he signaled an effort by several researchers, now under way, to challenge the interpretation of the Devils Hole record.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Dr. Imbrie said, a mountainous ice sheet changes the very climate around it by changing the course of jet streams, and thus of regional rainfall and temperature patterns. "When the maximum ice occurs," he posed, "is the temperature coldest in Nevada? Depending on the way the jet streams go, it could be earlier or later." Indeed, a wealth of data from a variety of sources, including radiocarbon dating and tree-ring analysis, has shown that local climates in North America varied greatly as the most recent ice age waxed and then waned.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard G. Fairbanks, a paleoclimatologist at Lamont-Doherty, says about half the change in the Devils Hole record can probably be accounted for by local factors and about half by global climatic factors as reflected in the oxygen isotopes of the ocean. When the local climatic fluctuations around Devils Hole are separated out statistically, he said, "you get a record that looks very similar, visually and statistically, to the glacial-interglacial climate records that we have from many different locations, and that contain the Milankovitch fingerprint. In the end, our conclusion is that their record is very strong support for the Milankovitch theory." Wary of Distortions</p>
        <p>Dr. Shackleton and others are examining the dating methods and the interpretation of the isotope findings with the aim of making published replies to the Winograd group. Some glaciologists say that the Winograd record might contain timing distortions imposed as the telltale isotopes seeped through the aquifer around Devils Hole. "There are a lot of tricky things about this flow pattern," said Dr. Broecker.</p>
        <p>Should the Winograd interpretation ultimately stand up, it would force paleoclimatologists to reconsider a number of aspects of the interglacial period in which we now live. Some scientists, noting that the period is nearing its end, have raised the prospect that global warming brought about by deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels might prolong it.  Now they may have to confront another possibility: that the natural interglacial period will last another 10,000 years and that global warming induced by humans will be superimposed on it.</p>
        <p>One practical consequence of this, says Dr. Winograd, could be a reassessment of some research priorities. For example, he says, much money is being spent to determine the possible effects of a new glaciation on buried nuclear wastes. Government policy presently requires that they be isolated from the biosphere for 10,000 years. But if the interglacial period is to last another 10,000 years, Dr. Winograd says, then more weight may have to be given in this research to the impact of a greenhouse world rather than a glacial one.</p>
        <p>But the jury is still out on the Winograd findings, says Dr. Imbrie: "We have had so little experience with dating climatic events in environments like those in this Nevada cavern that one must be cautious in accepting this dating at face value."</p>
        <p>Dr. Broecker says that in the end, "if I were to bet on the outcome, I'd bet heavily on Milankovitch. What we're all waiting for is some clever explanation" that would resolve the conflict.</p>
