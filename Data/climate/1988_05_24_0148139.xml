        <p>Picture Vice President Bush campaigning in California later this year. Silent, well-dressed witnesses carrying placards move to the front of the crowd at every stop. They carry silhouettes shaped like offshore oil platforms and long-armed cactuses. These images, and Dukakis television spots reinforcing them, reach millions of television viewers, reminding them that Mr. Bush has chosen not to oppose Lease Sale 91, the upcoming sale of northern California offshore drilling rights, and has stayed silent on the Southern California Desert Protection Bill pending before Congress.</p>
        <p>The outcome in November: Mr. Bush loses California, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis wins the Presidency and saves the California coast and desert early in his term.</p>
        <p>Why might this happen? Because Mr. Bush may well turn the race into a walk for Mr. Dukakis by handing him a clutch of conservation issues near and dear to the hearts and minds of California voters. Memories of Theodore Roosevelt and photos of Mr. Bush with fishing pole in hand will not be enough to reel in the environmental vote.</p>
        <p>A Bush defeat in California seems predictable because its voters have shown strong environmental concerns in repeated polls. In June 1986, a statewide survey found that 53 percent thought the issue of strictly limiting offshore oil drilling was ''extremely important'' or ''very important.''</p>
        <p>Last November, 63 percent of those questioned thought it was highly important to further control offshore oil drilling ''to assure better protection of the coastal environment.'' Thirty percent avowed that a Presidential candidate's position on offshore drilling would be a major factor in their voting decision.</p>
        <p>With one stroke of his pen on the Desert Protection Act, the next President could preserve 7.5 million acres without spending a penny on land acquisition. The Desert Protection Bill would save nearly 12,000 square miles already owned by the Government's Bureau of Land Management by reclassifying them: It would make Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Monuments into national parks, designate 4.5 million acres as wilderness and create a new national park. Not a bad way for a fiscally conservative President to launch his term of office.</p>
        <p>Polls have shown that a majority of desert residents and others questioned statewide favor protection of desert wilderness areas. Additional research for the Sierra Club showed even stronger responses - particularly for creating new wilderness areas where offroad vehicles and dirt bikes would be banned.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the southern desert and northern coast issues and their constituencies represent a bloc that no candidate can afford to alienate. Yet until now this is what Mr. Bush appears to be doing.</p>
        <p>After tacitly backing northern California offshore drilling, he recently stated, ''I do believe that you can have compatibility between esthetics, conservation and other environmental concerns and national energy requirements.''</p>
        <p>What he did not say is that even if the leases at issue were fully developed at the expense of some of the most beautiful coastline in America, the resulting oilfield would provide at most only a six-week supply of oil -less than 1.3 days per year over their projected 30 year life span. Moreover, as a recent spill in San Francisco Bay from a Shell Oil refinery has shown, accidents happen even when all the required safety and protective systems are in place.</p>
        <p>A large oil spill in a coastal area that is not widely accessible to cleanup measures would be a catastrophe that would take years to correct - if it could be undone at all. That makes the lease sale more than an issue of esthetics or national energy requirements.</p>
        <p>Strong stands on the sale and the desert bill could allow Mr. Bush to show his independence from the Reagan Administration and from hardline hole drillers of the oil and gas industry. This action would be particularly effective since the Vice President made much of his fortune in offshore oil and gas exploration. Opposing Lease Sale 91 would dramatically demonstrate his leadership and independence of mind. In so doing, he could begin to reclaim conservation and environmental protection issues from the Democrats, who have successfully cornered them as partisan political property.</p>
        <p>''I think for too long we've given the playing field away to the Democrats on the environment,'' Mr. Bush has said. ''I want to make the environment a Republican issue.'' Yet in the absence of strong stands on issues that touch the voters, Mr. Bush harks back to Ronald Reagan's hollow 1980 campaign statement, ''I am an environmentalist.'' Such platitudes will not wash in 1988.</p>
        <p>True conservatives in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt and John D. Rockefeller Jr. have struggled as a minority in their own party. Such staunch Republicans as Senators Robert T. Stafford of Vermont, John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut stand a lonely watch in the earlier tradition of the Republican Party by championing the health of the economy and the environment upon which it depends.</p>
        <p>With a few exceptions such as acid rain, Mr. Bush has to date followed President Reagan's lead on environmental policies. Mr. Reagan's appointments and his positions taken on countless issues have been consistently hostile to conservation and environmental protection.</p>
        <p>Like an old-time ranch hand, Mr. Reagan views the environment as a source of free wealth to be plundered rather than as a provider of free services to be protected. Mr. Bush can easily differentiate himself on California coastal and land issues from the cowboy politics of Mr. Reagan with minimal political risk or cost.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Bush could do this without endangering any of the traditional support that the Republicans count on to win. In California and elsewhere, the environmentally concerned vote is not a single interest or special interest but rather an interlocking group of voters who tend to be well-educated and very aware of how candidates stand on issues of concern to them.</p>
        <p>Precisely because Governor Dukakis already is on the record against Lease Sale 91, a Bush announcement of opposition would credit him with a sure save.</p>
        <p>Couple that with support for the Desert Protection Bill and Mr. Bush could convincingly counter Democratic attacks and say to the environmentally concerned voters, ''I'm one of you.''</p>
        <p>He can reclaim the conservationist heritage of earlier G.O.P. standard-bearers. Or he can choose cowboy politics, thus baring his weak flank and inviting his own branding as anti-environment, with all that implies.</p>
