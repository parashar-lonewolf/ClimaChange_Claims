        <p>Editorial says prospect of capitalizing on consumer anxieties about recent spike in gasoline prices has enticed Pres Bush and Sen John Kerry into useless finger-pointing; says their squabbling may drive debate toward short-term fixes and away from heart of matter, getting country to cut consumption while embarking on serious program of alternative fuels</p>

        <p>Though the recent spike in gasoline prices invites serious debate about America's long-term energy policy, President Bush and Senator John Kerry seem more interested in scoring quick political points. Mr. Kerry's campaign literature offers the makings of a broad energy strategy that would reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels -- and therefore on Persian Gulf oil. Yet the prospect of capitalizing on consumer anxieties has enticed the president and Mr. Kerry into useless finger-pointing.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Kerry said that the president had allowed gasoline prices to rise 12 percent, suggested that he could do a better job of ''jawboning'' countries like Saudi Arabia into producing more oil and promised to divert oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to increase market supplies and lower prices. On all three points, the senator implied that a president can influence short-term world oil prices, and thus prices at the pump. No president can, except at the margins, and Mr. Kerry knows that. As if to prove the point, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps about one-third of the world's oil, announced on Wednesday its intention to cut output by 4 percent.</p>

        <p>Though the recent spike in gasoline prices invites serious debate about America's long-term energy policy, President Bush and Senator John Kerry seem more interested in scoring quick political points. Mr. Kerry's campaign literature offers the makings of a broad energy strategy that would reduce the nation's reliance on fossil fuels -- and therefore on Persian Gulf oil. Yet the prospect of capitalizing on consumer anxieties has enticed the president and Mr. Kerry into useless finger-pointing.</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Kerry said that the president had allowed gasoline prices to rise 12 percent, suggested that he could do a better job of ''jawboning'' countries like Saudi Arabia into producing more oil and promised to divert oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to increase market supplies and lower prices. On all three points, the senator implied that a president can influence short-term world oil prices, and thus prices at the pump. No president can, except at the margins, and Mr. Kerry knows that. As if to prove the point, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which pumps about one-third of the world's oil, announced on Wednesday its intention to cut output by 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The administration promptly retaliated with a television commercial accusing Mr. Kerry of favoring a 50-cent rise in the gasoline tax that would cost the average family $657. The ad failed to mention that Mr. Kerry favored this a decade ago and only as part of a deficit-reduction plan.</p>
        <p>The sad part about this squabbling is that it drives the debate toward short-term fixes of dubious value and away from the heart of the matter, which is getting the country to cut consumption while embarking on a serious program of alternative fuels. Tweaking the petroleum reserve, jawboning foreign leaders, even increasing refining capacity -- none of these ideas have ever provided sustained protection against the volatility of world oil prices. A better approach would be to wean the nation from its profligate use of oil. In that context, a 50-cent gasoline tax is not a ridiculous idea; had such a tax been imposed a decade ago, consumption might well be less than it is now.</p>
        <p>The more reliable way to reduce consumption is to raise fuel economy standards. On this score, at least on paper, Mr. Kerry has much the better of the argument. Despite Mr. Bush's claim of having a comprehensive energy strategy, the administration and its allies on Capitol Hill have made sure to stuff just about everything but meaningful efficiency standards into their proposed legislation. Mr. Kerry's broad plan for ''energy independence'' offers greater hope, embracing as it does a proposal he co-sponsored two years ago with Senator John McCain that would increase fuel economy by 50 percent by 2015. At the moment, however, these bold targets reside safely and quietly on Mr. Kerry's campaign Web site. It would be useful if they could find their way into his stump speech.</p>
