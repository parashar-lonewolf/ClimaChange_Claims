        <p>LEAD: When President Bush was asked two weeks ago in Kennebunkport whether he might use the crisis in the Persian Gulf to ask Americans to curb their appetite for oil, he replied: ''I call upon Americans to conserve.'' In case anyone missed the stirring resonance of that remark, he addressed the same question again on Thursday, urging everyone to ''act responsibly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's attitude may mirror the public's own complacency. But that doesn't excuse it. The notion that the public should not in any way be inconvenienced by this crisis is naive and irresponsible. If Saddam Hussein is doing Americans any favor at all, it's to remind them that Washington desperately needs a coherent policy aimed at making the country more energy-efficient - beginning with higher energy taxes.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration has merely been nibbling around the edges of such a policy. In an interview last week, Energy Secretary James Watkins confessed that the Administration was not yet ready to address tough questions such as whether the Government should press for higher auto mileage standards, nuclear power, energy taxes and new oil exploration in environmentally sensitive areas. He suggested instead that drivers put more air in their cars' tires - a handy tip, but hardly a strategy.</p>
        <p>Congress also flounders. The Senate will shortly take up a bill that would mandate a 50 percent increase in fuel economy by the year 2001. Improving gas mileage would certainly help, and even Detroit concedes that modest gains are feasible. But the companies argue that as long as gas is cheap, consumers will demand bigger cars, and that to require Detroit (and Japan) to make only smaller cars would put them at war with their customers.</p>
        <p>How cheap is gasoline in America? Very. Adjusted for inflation, fuel prices just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were the lowest they'd been in 40 years. The result is that when buyers are asked what they most want in a car, fuel economy, once near the top of the list, is near the bottom.</p>
        <p>An energy tax adding, say, 25 to 50 cents to the price of a gallon of gasoline would provide therapy the country needs. The 1970's oil crises proved that higher prices promote energy efficiencies. The experience of other countries is also persuasive. Gasoline prices in most industrial nations are two to four times those in the U.S.; those nations' per capita fuel use is one-fourth to one-half what it is here.</p>
        <p>Such a tax would have other desirable consequences. It would help reduce the Federal budget deficit. It would curb air pollution, including the greenhouse gases that threaten to warm the earth's atmosphere. And it would make alternative fuels more competitive.</p>
        <p>Obviously, an energy tax can only be part of a more comprehensive strategy. But it's a good place to begin. Saddam Hussein has made the case for it. When will Mr. Bush?</p>
