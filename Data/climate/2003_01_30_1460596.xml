        <p>ROMPING giddily in the snow at the windmill farm he built here in central New York, Bill Moore bears little resemblance to the Yale-educated consultant he once was, working in Manhattan on the financing of nuclear power plants and other utilities.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Moore, 46, quit Wall Street several years ago to develop wind farms, his old finance colleagues chuckled at him and his tree-hugging obsession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore's company, Atlantic Renewable Energy, has developed five of the seven commercial wind farms operating in the Eastern United States, but they have had problems finding buyers in the energy market. He has spent the last three years trying to build the biggest windmill farm in the East, which has yet to break ground or attract investors. His former colleagues wondered if he was building windmills or just tilting at them.</p>
        <p>Then, this month, Gov. George E. Pataki issued a directive that a quarter of the state's electricity supply should come from so-called green sources, like wind or solar or hydroelectric power, within the next decade. This would require suppliers to buy a percentage of ''clean energy'' at a slightly higher price than conventionally produced energy.</p>
        <p>Now it seems as if Mr. Moore might have the last laugh.</p>
        <p>''No one knows we're up here doing this,'' he said. ''It's like we're in a vacuum sometimes. And that's fine. We have a good head start.''</p>
        <p>On a quiet, snowy hilltop in Madison, a town 40 miles southeast of Syracuse with about 2,800 residents, Mr. Moore walked among seven huge windmills and beamed like a happy father.</p>
        <p>''You can actually feel it sucking the energy out of the wind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Each 1.5-megawatt induction generator weighs 65 tons. Each has a three-blade rotor on a hollow cylinder. The sleek white windmills overhead, about 330 feet tall, emit a gentle, whooshing noise. These are made in Denmark and cost $1.8 million each to buy and install.</p>
        <p>The windmills have an other-worldly look, like something out of a science fiction movie.</p>
        <p>''They have an elemental quality,'' Mr. Moore said, staring up at a windmill as the wind spun its blades against the blue-gray sky. ''When the light hits it right, the white blades against the blue sky, the setting sun, it can take your breath away.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, but certainly not now. Mr. Moore has a calm, quiet speaking style, but when it comes to talking windmills he seems powered by the endless energy of the wind.</p>
        <p>The governor's order could bring investors and push power companies to buy the electricity, which costs a bit more than electricity produced by gas, oil, coal or nuclear power. ''It could really jump-start this whole industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He spoke while steering his Land Rover through Madison, a Mozart clarinet quintet on the radio. He braked for some snowmobilers.</p>
        <p>Madison County is a region dense with trailer parks and pickup trucks and backyard smokehouses stuffed with deer meat. In much of this region, industry has left and dairy farmers have come upon hard times. But the region still has its elevated plateaus and strong lake winds and a big demand for power.</p>
        <p>MR. MOORE grew up in Greenwich, Conn. As an undergraduate at Yale, he wrote his senior paper on wind and solar energy. He also got a master's in economics from Yale, specializing in financing environmental energy plants.</p>
        <p>On most weekends he flies back home to Maryland, to the old farmhouse he is renovating. Most of his weekdays are spent on the road, which has kept him a bachelor, he said. A couple years ago, his girlfriend gave up on him. He took 27 trips to Costa Rica in a year; she took her dogs and moved to Colorado. He has put 135,000 miles on his Land Rover in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore's romance with windmills began with an epiphany in 1997.</p>
        <p>''I was in Denmark and I walked up to a megawatt-scale generator and I knew I had to start building these.''</p>
        <p>He spends much of his time trying to get his largest project, called Tug Hill, in Lewis County, east of Lake Ontario, off the ground. The farm would have 160 windmills stretching across 10 miles. The challenge, he said, is winning the trust of local landowners, to lease space for the farms.</p>
        <p>''When I first started visiting farmers, we'd sit down and I'd start scribbling notes in my book,'' he recalled. ''I soon realized that you don't walk into a farmer's kitchen and start talking business. They want to talk for an hour, just for the conversation.''</p>
        <p>As for the aesthetic debate, Mr. Moore said, ''It's really in the eye of the beholder.''</p>
        <p>''There is certainly a visual impact,'' he said. ''But when you look at the side effects of producing power, the aesthetic issue is pretty far down the list.''</p>
        <p>The complaints come from the weekenders, who want quaintness, antiques and scenery.</p>
        <p>''It's my Starbucks rule,'' he said. ''If there's a coffee chain in town, you know those are the people who will be complaining.''</p>
