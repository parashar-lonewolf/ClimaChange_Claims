        <p>The tourism industry has worked hard in recent years to cast the Hudson River Valley as a ruddy-cheeked play land of nature, history, art and cute-as-a-button Victorian bed-and-breakfast hotels.</p>
        <p>But here in this old factory town 100 miles north of New York, you see the grittier truth: The Hudson Valley was also the nation's first industrial heartland.</p>
        <p>Before River Rouge and Pittsburgh steel, before Chicago had shoulders, the mills of the mighty Hudson roared and belched their fire. The lush 19th-century landscape paintings of the Hudson River School and the clattering engines of the steam age grew up side by side in places like this. Whether art and industry can coexist again on the modern river, many residents here say, is now the question.</p>
        <p>A proposal for a huge new cement plant, in a town where cement-making roots run deep -- but where art galleries and antiques shops drive the new economy -- has deeply divided Hudson along lines of class, culture and, to no small degree, aesthetics. Would the plant destroy the town's charm, and so too its emerging tourist economy, or would the return of big cement be a restoration, a sign that old heavy-industry Hudson is on its way back? What is the value of the town's most celebrated and frequently depicted artistic motif, the view of Mount Merino? And who derives the benefit from that view, the old families that built the town or the recent arrivals who have helped revive its fortunes?</p>
        <p>''I think it's the devil at work,'' said David Paulsen, 46, an Abstract Expressionist painter who moved here in 1994 from a loft in Brooklyn, partly for the natural beauty and partly because the rents were cheap. He said he would think about moving away again if the cement plant came to town.</p>
        <p>Jim Sherman, 26, a Hudson native, said that as far as he was concerned, the people who were threatening to leave Hudson probably should. He just wants a cement plant job, he said, as his father had before him and his grandfather before that.</p>
        <p>''I've already put in my application,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The plant, proposed by a Canadian company, St. Lawrence Cement, presents a complex bundle of costs and benefits. It would replace an old and antiquated cement factory across the river in Catskill, and produce much less of the types of air pollution blamed for acid rain and smog.</p>
        <p>But the new plant would be four times larger. It would bring cement making back into Hudson, but with a technology that has changed greatly since the last plant closed here in 1975; cement plants no longer need the armies of workers they once did. It would feature high-tech air scrubbers, but the resulting smokestack, rising 40 stories above the limestone quarry, would be visible for miles.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the economic arc of Hudson has been going entirely the other way: toward art and tourism. As recently as the early 1990's, residents say, the city's downtown was a sad and sometimes frightening place of boarded-up buildings and aimless men. When Claude Carone moved here from New York City in the early 1990's to pursue his painting career, a three-story building could still be had for only $20,000. He and two friends bought one such place to use for their studios. Now the main shopping strip, Warren Street, is clogged with shoppers and chic new restaurants.</p>
        <p>Art tourism has also thrived at Olana, the historic home of the artist Frederic Edwin Church, who built his mansion and landscaped grounds just a few miles south of here with the fortune he earned in the 1850's and 1860's from his gargantuan Hudson River School canvases. The home of Thomas Cole, who founded the Hudson River School and lived just across the river in Catskill, is being restored this summer as a museum and historic monument.</p>
        <p>But there are many places the new economy has not touched. On Columbia Street,  one block away from the thriving galleries, many houses remain run-down. Drugs and prostitution remain a problem, residents say.</p>
        <p>Jimmie C. Binford, a 57-year-old resident, was sitting outside on a recent sweltering afternoon having a beer with friends. He agreed that the plant would not do much for him personally, and probably would not add a lot of jobs to the community, either.(Most of the roughly 130 new jobs at the plant are expected to be taken by workers from the Catskill factory.) It might pollute and it might be noisy. But he supported it anyway, he said, for the future.</p>
        <p>''That plant is for the kids coming up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A Required Stop for Artists</p>
        <p>The view of Mount Merino, looking south from Hudson, became a required stop for any artist refining his or her skills in 19th-century landscape art. Mostly forgotten local painters like Henry Ary and the Parton brothers, Ernest and Arthur, lived only a few blocks from the place that became established as the ideal spot to set up an easel, just off Bay Road. Sanford Robinson Gifford grew up here and kept a studio even after he became famous down in New York City. The Merino view was painted on everything from pottery to furniture.</p>
        <p>But when Don Christensen began assembling a museum exhibition here earlier this year showing how artists depicted Merino over the centuries, he kept stumbling over an odd phenomenon. Many of the artists had lied.</p>
        <p>South Bay, once a languid curve of the Hudson that lapped up on the shores just below Mount Merino, was being filled in bit by bit in the 1800's: by railroad lines and foundries, by dredging spoils from the river and by other long-defunct industries of various sorts. Many painters, however, simply left that development out of the picture. They painted South Bay as though it were still a pristine Arcadian sanctuary, where cows could drift down to the water to drink.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christensen, a writer who opposes the cement plant -- he created the exhibition to remind people of the town's visual heritage -- said he found evidence from real-estate advertisements and railroad brochures suggesting that Merino's view was still a selling point in the town, even in the midst of its industrialization. But he still hasn't figured out what the artists were thinking.</p>
        <p>The relationship of the Hudson River School and the Industrial Revolution is a subject that others have puzzled over before. Arnold Pickman, an archaeologist from New York who was researching the cultural history of Mount Merino and South Bay several years ago under a contract with the Army Corps of Engineers, ultimately concluded that by minimizing the impact of industrialization, the artists were tacitly approving of it. ''They saw industrialization in harmony with nature,'' Mr. Pickman said. ''The conflict is not expressed in most of these paintings.''</p>
        <p>Officials at Scenic Hudson, a conservation group that opposes the cement plant, have argued on the other hand that omitting the evidence of Hudson's foundries and mills was an early environmentalist protest by the painters who -- in the spirit of Mr. Christensen's exhibit -- were showing people the landscapes being lost.</p>
        <p>Other historians dismiss both theories. Leo Marx, a professor emeritus of American cultural studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of the book, ''The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America,'' said that things in the 19th century weren't as clear-cut as they are now. Most artists were not environmentalists as we would use the term, or economic boosters either, he said.</p>
        <p>''Thomas Cole was terribly troubled by industrialization, but many other painters weren't,'' he said. Some were inspired by the ideas of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who asserted that the poet's role, or the painter's, was to reincorporate back into nature the sometimes messy trappings of human nature and so find a scene's inner beauty.</p>
        <p>''The artist sees beyond the surface ugliness,'' Professor Marx said. ''That's the point. That's why he can dispose very easily of the most disagreeable facts.''</p>
        <p>Surface ugliness is one of the signature traits of a cement plant, as even its supporters admit. Officials at St. Lawrence said that part of their mission since coming to town here in 1999 was to work on their own plan of visual accommodation, if not quite deception.</p>
        <p>A new design was incorporated to try to bunch the plant's structures together to minimize their apparent bulk. A planned railroad link that would have required high-rise silos right on the river's edge was abandoned. The Air Force was consulted about how it painted its planes to make them harder to see against the sky.</p>
        <p>''We really tried to look at it as a piece of art,'' said Bob Bristol, the president of the Saratoga Associates, a landscape, architecture and engineering firm that has worked with St. Lawrence Cement. ''What were the colors that would minimize its impact? How should it be coated? Should there be vegetation?''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, a seven-shade color scheme of blues, grays and whites, based on the local atmospheric conditions, was selected for the high-rise stack and pipe system, Mr. Bristol said. The company's engineer in charge of the project is the first to admit that it doesn't entirely do the job.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't hide it -- you can't do that -- but it does break it up a bit,'' said Phillip Lochbrunner, a vice president and a manager of the project.</p>
        <p>The Past Is Prologue</p>
        <p>The judge appointed to the St. Lawrence Cement plant case is expected to take months to consider the evidence before sending on her findings to the State Department of Environmental Conservation. Meanwhile, Hudson continues to evolve, and its past is still dictating the pattern.</p>
        <p>The continuing strength of the economy to the south in New York City has meant a boom in the demand for cement, and it has also meant more tourist visits and art purchases, and more people ready and able to buy weekend homes two and a half hours north of the city.</p>
        <p>More construction and renovation work locally -- building and restoring homes and businesses -- has in turn meant more manual labor jobs than could have been imagined a few years ago, to the point at which the existing factories are struggling to find workers. Kaz Inc., a maker of health-care products, now features a banner outside its brick walls: Now Hiring.</p>
        <p>And the presence of more working artists in the community has been a reminder that art, once common here and becoming so again, is also physical labor of a certain type, and that a lot of artists struggle hard to pay their bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paulsen, the Abstract Expressionist painter, said he worked construction to support himself. He has learned taping and plastering over the years, he said, along with framing, plumbing, basic wiring and putting up wallboard. And with the local building economy booming, he said, he has to turn away work to allow himself time to paint.</p>
        <p>''Anybody that can screw in a light bulb can get a job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Art's Footsteps</p>
        <p>The paintings of the Hudson River School are portraits of the Northeast, captured at a time when 19th-century America was re-examining its ideas about nature. The landscapes helped spur tourism and environmentalism.</p>
        <p>This is the fourth of 10 summer articles in which The New York Times returns to the places illuminated by Hudson River School artists. In the fifth article, seamen at the Coast Guard Station at Eaton's Neck on Long Island carry on a tradition of ocean rescue dating to the mid-19th century, and like the shimmering scene that John F. Kensett painted there on the beach, the elements are still timeless: youth, optimism, patriotism, and above all, the endless golden glow of high summer.</p>
