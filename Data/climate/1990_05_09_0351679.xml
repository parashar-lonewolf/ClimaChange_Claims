        <p>LEAD: The New Republic's cover story on Congress last week was entitled ''Capitol Hell.'' An issue of Business Week on the newsstands not long ago declared, ''Congress: It Doesn't Work. Let's Fix It.''</p>
        <p>The New Republic's cover story on Congress last week was entitled ''Capitol Hell.'' An issue of Business Week on the newsstands not long ago declared, ''Congress: It Doesn't Work. Let's Fix It.''</p>
        <p>About 60 percent of the public says it is time to limit the number of terms a member of Congress can serve, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll last month. About 40 percent in a January poll said half or more of the lawmakers on Capitol Hill were financially corrupt.</p>
        <p>It is not an easy time to be a defender of the institution. This is the lot of Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat who has quietly risen in the House by taking on the jobs that nobody wants, from shepherding Congressional raises to judging Congressional ethics.</p>
        <p>''I realize there are people who stay here too long, and I realize there are people who don't get to stay here as long as they should,'' Mr. Fazio said. ''I realize there are some people who shouldn't have ever gotten here. But the genius of this system is you have a mix of all these people - the good, the bad, the ugly. It's a mirror of the country.''</p>
        <p>Keeping Incumbents Incumbent</p>
        <p>A man of rumpled affability, Mr. Fazio (pronounced FAY-zee-oh) describes himself as a legislative animal, but he has acquired many other titles in recent years. He has been called the shop steward of the House, the mayor of Capitol Hill, the prince of perks, the Mr. Goodwrench of the House.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Legislative Appropriations Subcommittee, he presides over Congress's budget. As a seven-year member of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, otherwise known as the ethics committee, he was at the center of the investigation into Jim Wright, the former Speaker, and of every other tortuous case to come before that panel. (How long has he wanted to get off the ethics committee? ''Probably from the day I got on,'' he said, sighing.) He is a prime mover in the effort to protect and advance his party's interests in the 1991 redistricting, which Democrats hope will perpetuate their 36-year dominance of the House. And as vice chairman of the Democratic caucus, he plays an increasing role in defending his party to the public at large, including the 98 percent re-election rate for House incumbents that is at heart of the case against Congress.</p>
        <p>Care and Feeding of Congress</p>
        <p>Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, described Mr. Fazio as one of the Democrats' ''brightest and most effective partisans.'' Mr. Gingrich, who campaigns hard against the Democratic Congress as a body dedicated to its own perks and power, also called Mr. Fazio ''the watchdog of the incumbents' treasury.''</p>
        <p>''Fazio is the consigliere of the computer age,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''He's a nice, clean, pleasant machine politician.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich's digs help explain why these are not the kind of causes that most members rush to lead. The care and feeding of the institution wins points inside the House; Mr. Fazio's colleagues gush over him, particularly after he delivers them a raise. But it is not a crusade that wins many points in the world outside.</p>
        <p>''Vic works in the junkyard,'' said Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia. ''He's got to clean it up and make some order out of it. The guy has an amazing tolerance for punishment.''</p>
        <p>Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, ''If it's a job that no one else wants but has to be done, Vic is there to do it.''</p>
        <p>His efforts do not go unrewarded. He won a four-way race for the caucus vice chairman's job last year, which puts him on the leadership ladder. He has generally created a web of gratitude that serves a rising House member well.</p>
        <p>Mark Baughman, a Republican who is challenging Mr. Fazio in his Sacramento-area district, said, ''He represents the special interests and the interests of his liberal colleagues, and they take care of him with benefits to take home to his district.''</p>
        <p>Mastering 'the Process'</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio is a different breed from the legislator who shows up on the evening news making an impassioned speech about global warming. Often called the insider's insider, he has to struggle for colorful anecdotes about himself. ''Half of what you do around here you can't talk about, because you offend people,'' Mr. Fazio said.</p>
        <p>His strength comes from what is described reverentially on Capitol Hill as ''understanding the process.'' Even in an age when blow-dried media stars seem to reign supreme, those who understand the process quietly thrive.</p>
        <p>A California transplant who grew up in New Jersey, Mr. Fazio has been immersed in the process for a long time. He joined the California Assembly as a staff member in 1966 and later served three years in that body. He was elected to Congress in 1978. The pay-and-ethics package approved by the House in November was an example of Mr. Fazio's careful politics. An earlier attempt by the Democratic leadership to win a raise without a vote had collapsed in a public firestorm. This time it had broad bipartisan support, as well as pledges from both parties' campaign committees that nothing in the package would be used against the members in the 1990 elections.</p>
        <p>The package had enough reform in it to attract the support of Common Cause, the government watchdog group, and it had a hefty enough pay increase, nearly 40 percent over two years, to attract the support of the members who were losing outside income through the changes. It was, in short, thoroughly wired.</p>
        <p>Handshakes From the Weary</p>
        <p>After the measure passed, Mr. Fazio, who was co-chairman of the task force that produced it, stood in the Speaker's lobby just off the House floor, and member after member came up to shake his hand. Battered and bruised after a year of ethics wars, they were desperate to put the issue behind them, at least for a little while, and they were deeply grateful to Mr. Fazio for helping them do it. It was a moment that illuminated the clubby and anxious nature of the House, and how Mr. Fazio prospers in it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio has also bucked the reformers. Fred Wertheimer, the head of Common Cause, has been pushing for sweeping restrictions on the use of the Congressional mailing, or franking, privilege, including a ban on mass mailings in an election year. ''There's just no question that the frank is used for electioneering purposes, and heavily so,'' said Mr. Wertheimer.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fazio says such a ban would go too far and has pushed through much more modest restrictions. He said he saw himself as a little of the shop steward but also ''an accommodator of reality.'' Like the shop steward, he often seems to push for the best deal for his membership. But he also recognizes the increasingly angry public mood.</p>
        <p>One of the realities he must accommodate is rising discontent with Congress. He argues that the high re-election rates of recent years will begin to abate in the 1990's with the expected round of retirements and new seats.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, he is a vigorous opponent of limits on Congressional service, arguing that they would deprive the institution of some of its most valuable expertise. But he suggests a change of his own: extending House terms to four years. That would ease the pressure of the permanent campaign, he says, giving members time to learn and do the job, and making House elections more contested and momentous.</p>
        <p>Eye of the Beholder</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Fazio is willing to accommodate only so far; he bridles at Republicans who assert that Democrats protect their dominance of the House through gerrymandering and the use of incumbent perks.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe gerrymandering is something easily defined by courts or anybody else,'' he said. ''It's a political process. It's like obscenity. Some people see it and some people don't. It is often something that is a purely partisan attack on what is a purely partisan process, and no party is guilty or without guilt.''</p>
        <p>But even as he plays hardball politics, Mr. Fazio has the manner of the nonthreatening guy next door, noodging his neighbors to keep their fences mended and their lawns neat.</p>
        <p>''He's very disarming,'' said Edward Rollins, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, who worked with Mr. Fazio in the California Legislature. ''You never think of him as one of the Lee Atwaters, Lyn Nofzigers or Ed Rollinses. He's a very gentle man, but he's also very tough.''</p>
        <p>Like most incumbents, Mr. Fazio is comfortable in his district; four Republicans are vying to oppose him this year, but even some Republican analysts say he will be tough to dislodge in 1990. His duties make him one of the legendary College of Cardinals, the appropriations subcommittee chairmen who exercise vast power over the Federal budget. His district, he suggests, does well in the scramble for Federal dollars.</p>
        <p>''What else could anyone do if they wanted to say thank you to Vic Fazio?'' he said with a shrug. ''Help me, help my district. I don't have any way of quantifying it, but most of the reasonable things I ask for, eventually I've gotten.''</p>
        <p>When California was hit by an earthquake last year, his California colleagues turned to him to rush through a $2.8 billion relief package in five days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio likes to be thought of as an issues guy, and plays a leading role in areas like abortion rights. But he is, by his own description, a legislative animal, and he notes that legislators are always easy targets. ''We don't get things done in a big hurry,'' he said. ''We don't deal with the kind of immediacy that the media like.</p>
        <p>''It's a very slow, tortuous process of compromise that's never popular.'' The shop steward of the House is pleading its case.</p>
