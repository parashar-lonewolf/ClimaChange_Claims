        <p>LEAD: When John Warshow and Mathew Rubin met at a demonstration at the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Vernon nearly 10 years ago, they were bound together by their interest in alternative energy and by a chain locking them in protest to the power plant fence.</p>
        <p>When John Warshow and Mathew Rubin met at a demonstration at the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Vernon nearly 10 years ago, they were bound together by their interest in alternative energy and by a chain locking them in protest to the power plant fence.</p>
        <p>Today they are linked in a business venture they say combines their interest in renewable energy sources and environmental conservation.</p>
        <p>And, Mr. Warshow said with a mixture of astonishment and pride, ''We're making money at it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin, 46 years old, and Mr. Warshow, a cherubic-looking 31-year-old who chopped off the ponytail of his protest days in favor of a more businesslike cut, are equal partners in two companies that own and operate small hydroelectric dams in Springfield and in East Montpelier, and have started a third company to develop a hydroelectric project in Burlington. Along the way, they have have won praise from state conservationists for environmentally sound design and construction.</p>
        <p>Most recently, they have committed themselves to plans to help preserve an endangered plant species at their proposed Burlington site. 'Care in Construction'</p>
        <p>The two became partners in 1980, two years after Congress passed a law requiring utilities to buy power at fair market value from small plants using such ''renewable resources'' as wind and water. With $100,000, most of it borrowed, they drew up plans for a generating plant at an abandoned dam they had bought here in the state's capital. Before they started construction, a local utility offered to buy the property and the plans.</p>
        <p>With the profits from that sale and with more borrowed money, they were able to build Winooski Eight, a 860-kilowatt hydroelectric dam on the North Branch of the Winooski River in East Montpelier. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Warshow won praise in a letter from Leonard Wilson, State Secretary of Environmental Conservation, for their ''care in construction and design'' considering ''that hydroelectric development faces some of the hardest environmental hurdles any form of development must deal with in Vermont.'' The power plant, which opened in 1985, also drew praise from Senator Patrick J. Leahy.</p>
        <p>Now they have plans to build a 6,500-kilowatt hydroelectric dam on the Winooski in Burlington. And the two men are considered by environmental officials to have set an example for all hydroelectric developers with their voluntary steps, at a cost of about $100,000, to help preserve the cleft-leaf anemone, a rare plant that resembles parsley. It Grows Only Near Dam Site</p>
        <p>The species is common in the Rockies and in Alaska but is known to grow in Vermont only on the banks and on an island of the Winooski near the site of the generating project. The cleft-leaf anemone is expected to join an updated state list of endangered plants and animals this spring, according to Elizabeth Thompson, a state ecologist.</p>
        <p>But since the anemone is not now listed as endangered, she said, Mr. Warshow and Mr. Rubin were under no legal obligation to protect it.</p>
        <p>''We are committed to showing that you can develop alternative energy without wrecking the environment,'' said Mr. Warshow in an interview at his office here. ''Vermont has a very high environmental consciousness. That's the reason I live here.'' He is a native of Port Washington, L.I.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubin, a former broadcast engineer and energy consultant, said he believed the state had ''a right to hold developers to the highest standards.'' Site Change and Other Steps</p>
        <p>Working with Ms. Thompson, the partners developed a plan to mitigate any damage to the rare anemone. They decided to move the site of the $14.4 million generating plant upstream of the ledge where the anemone grows. That will cost about $55,000 in additional excavation and design costs.</p>
        <p>In addition, the developers offered the state a one-time payment of $40,000, for use in protecting endangered species, and an annual payment of $3,000 once the dam is producing electricity. Since about 10 percent of the anemone colony must be removed to make way for the project, the men have hired a botanist to collect seeds, that may be planted elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''We can make money and still do the right thing,'' Mr. Rubin said.</p>
