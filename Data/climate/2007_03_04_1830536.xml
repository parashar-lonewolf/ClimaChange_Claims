        <p>WARMING UP?</p>
        <p>The News -- ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' the film on global warming based on Al Gore's best-selling book and multimedia lecture tour, won the Oscar for best documentary feature.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The award led to chatter that the man who was nearly president might yet enter the 2008 race. But Mr. Gore, 58, said he had no ''plans to become a candidate for office again.'' His waistline may hold the clue. Newsday reported that the Clinton campaign is keeping tabs on his ample girth to see if he gets into fighting trim.</p>
        <p>STILL THE BOSS</p>
        <p>The News -- Richard M. Daley won his sixth term as mayor of Chicago and is on track to serve longer than his father, the ''boss'' of a legendary political machine.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Mr. Daley, 64, won with more than 71 percent of the vote and in all 50 of the city's wards despite a federal probe into his administration's hiring practices. If he serves his full term, he will surpass by one year the 21 years his father, Richard J. Daley, was in office. What grade would he give himself for managing the city of 2.8 million? ''You don't give grades. Grades are only given on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>LIVE FROM HAVANA</p>
        <p>The News -- Fidel Castro appeared on the nightly radio show of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and said he was doing ''very well.''</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- It was believed to be Mr. Castro's first live broadcast since he turned over power to his brother last July. Mr. Castro, 80, dropped from public view after undergoing emergency surgery for intestinal bleeding. His illness is a state secret. Sounding frail, Mr. Castro, who has ruled for 48 years, said, ''I feel I have more energy, more strength, more time to study.''</p>
        <p>FLYING HIGH</p>
        <p>The News -- An anonymous collector from Southern California paid $2.35 million for a nearly mint condition 1909 tobacco card of Honus Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- Wagner, the Flying Dutchman, was perhaps the greatest shortstop ever. He was National League batting champion eight times, with a .329 lifetime average. Despite being stocky and bowlegged, he stole 722 bases in a 21-year career that ended in 1917. The scrap of cardboard, ''has long been recognized as the most iconic, highly coveted and valuable object'' in sports memorabilia, said one expert.</p>
        <p>OUT THE DOOR</p>
        <p>The News -- The Secretary of the Army, Francis J. Harvey, resigned on Friday following revelations of shabby conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Behind the News -- The hospital had long been the very symbol of top medical care in the armed forces. But a series of disclosures in The Washington Post about living conditions, red tape delaying treatment and other problems challenged the notion that wounded soldiers received unparalleled care there. Mr. Harvey's resignation came hours after President Bush ordered an investigation.</p>
