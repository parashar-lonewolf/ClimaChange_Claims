        <p>IN a major peace dividend, the Navy has agreed to let civilian scientists use its multibillion-dollar fleet of nuclear attack submarines on a regular basis to study the Arctic Ocean, a vast body of water whose riddles have long eluded scientific scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Experts say detailed knowledge of polar ice and the Arctic depths is vital for understanding such things as climate change. For instance, such research could reveal if the predicted warming of the earth is under way and starting to melt the Arctic icecap, an icy wilderness considered one of the most sensitive and reliable indicators of global temperature change.</p>
        <p>For decades the top of the world was off limits to much civilian inquiry because nuclear-armed American and Soviet submarines prowled and tangled beneath the ice.</p>
        <p>Now, after a successful trial run of submarine sharing during a voyage in 1993, the Navy has agreed to let civilian scientists use its force of nuclear attack submarines for one Arctic expedition a year, with the first of the regular voyages set to begin early next month. Such vessels are designed to shadow and attack an enemy's submarines, unlike the separate class of submarines that carry long-range missiles with nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>Sailing out of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii with a 128-member Navy crew, the Cavalla, a Sturgeon-class attack submarine, is to carry scientists from the University of Alaska, the University of Texas, Oregon State University and Columbia University on a two-month expedition under the ice.</p>
        <p>"The submarine is a fantastic greyhound that can race around and find things you can't possibly keep track of any other way," said Dr. Garrett W. Brass, executive director of the United States Arctic Research Commission, a Federal body that advises the Government on Arctic studies. "This agreement is going to produce a fantastic increase in our ability to monitor the changes that are going on in the Arctic."</p>
        <p>The use of the nation's nuclear attack submarines for civilian research "is an amazing story," he said, adding: "I'm still surprised that it happened. This started out as a blind date with this girl to see if we got along. The good news is that we did."</p>
        <p>Dr. John E. Walsh, a meteorologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who specializes in Arctic studies, said the new program was potentially very important. "Subs can measure the thickness of sea ice, and that has been a notoriously hard thing to do over long distances," he said. "This program has the potential to get all kinds of data you can't get any other way."</p>
        <p>Dr. James E. Hansen, director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City and a prominent analyst of global warming, said the Arctic appeared to be up to three times as susceptible to temperature change as the earth in general. "What happens in the polar regions is important because of the climatic sensitivity," he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marcus Langseth, a geologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University who helped organize the 1993 trial run, said the sharing program promised insights not only into climate change but also into fisheries biology and the makeup of the earth's northernmost ocean.</p>
        <p>"We know very little about the floor of the Arctic, so from my perspective, I'm eager to go back," he said. "It's great stuff."</p>
        <p>The Arctic has long been recognized as unique and scientifically intriguing because of its thick ice. It is the only ocean on which a person can walk or land a big plane, and the only one for which studies of the watery depths are so difficult.</p>
        <p>The ocean has an average depth of 3,407 feet. Depending on the latitude and the season, the surface ice can measure up to 165 feet thick. The average thickness of polar ice during the summer months is believed to be a bit more than six feet.</p>
        <p>During the cold war, the Arctic got scant attention from civilian scientists because of security restrictions and poor equipment. Ice camps were periodically set up to take measurements. And icebreakers occasionally made forays across the frigid expanse. The Navy used its submarines for some Arctic studies but the data was classified secret.</p>
        <p>The move to let civilians use the nuclear attack submarines is but the latest peace dividend from the end of the cold war. The Navy is already sharing its $15 billion network of undersea microphones, built to track Soviet warships and submarines, for civilian studies of sea quakes, undersea volcanoes and whale migrations. Nuclear weapon laboratories are working to perfect the electric car. And the Air Force is using some early-warning satellites and ground-based telescopes to search for asteroids that threaten to strike the earth.</p>
        <p>A prominent advocate of such conversions has been Al Gore, first as a Senator and then as Vice President. He has been particularly interested in the Arctic because of its potential for delivering insights into the magnitude of global environmental change.</p>
        <p>The freeing of the Navy's attack subs comes as the force shrinks in response to lessening global threats. Norman Polmar, a naval expert and author in Alexandria, Va., said the fleet has 84 submarines, down from 95 or so in the late 1980's. It is to drop to 55, or perhaps lower, by the year 2000. Mr. Polmar estimated that the subs now in use cost $50 billion to $70 billion to build.</p>
        <p>"It's smart," he said of the sharing program. "It gets scientists more supportive of the Navy." The program is also widely seen as helping the Navy sharpen its Arctic edge.</p>
        <p>The ecological usefulness of attack subs was demonstrated even before the sharing program by such scientists as Dr. Alfred S. McLaren, a former attack submarine commander who succeeded in getting some secret Navy data declassified, including periodic measurements of Arctic ice thickness.</p>
        <p>The trial run of sharing began in August 1993 when the attack submarine Pargo sailed from its base in Groton, Conn., with five civilian scientists from Lamont-Doherty, the University of Alaska and the University of Washington.</p>
        <p>During the 38-day cruise, the scientists collected data on such things as water temperature, salinity, ocean depth, ice thickness, gravity anomalies and ice composition as seen by an upward-looking video camera. They also took more than 1,500 water samples for chemical and biological analysis back on land.</p>
        <p>"A remarkable variety and quantity of data were collected for disciplines ranging from atmospheric science to submarine geology," the scientists wrote in the winter 1993 issue of The Journal of the Marine Technology Society, a professional group based in Washington.</p>
        <p>After that trip, and after long negotiations, a handful of Federal agencies in June 1994 agreed to launch a joint program of annual excursions over an initial five-year period. Signatories included the Navy, the National Science Foundation, the United States Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>The agreement allows the Navy to cancel or shorten any cruise "if operationally required" and bars the public release of gathered data until the Navy has made sure it contains no secrets. The Navy agreed to pay for the ship time and the costs to civilian agencies of scientific research and any additional gear.</p>
        <p>The 300-foot-long Cavalla, which was commissioned in 1973, is expected to collect Arctic data for 45 days during its upcoming two-month cruise. The four civilian scientist on board will be accompanied by three scientists from the Arctic Submarine Laboratory of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, based in Newport, R.I. The planned route is classified secret, as is always the case with the subs.</p>
        <p>Jeff Gossett, a senior scientist at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory in San Diego, which is coordinating the Navy's participation, said that the Cavalla will carry a dozen experiments from as many civilian institutions, such as the University of Toronto. "The features on the floor of the Arctic are less well known than any other ocean in the world," he said.</p>
        <p>Their appetites whetted, Arctic scientists are hopeful that the Navy will renew the five-year agreement when it expires. They note that years and decades of comprehensive data on ice thickness are needed to make trustworthy analyses of climatic trends.</p>
        <p>Even better, Dr. Brass of the United States Arctic Research Commission said, the civilian scientific community was talking to the Navy about the possibility of getting full-time use of one of the Sturgeon-class attack submarines, some of which, he said, "are being retired with nearly a decade of service life left in them."</p>
        <p>With torpedo tubes removed, Dr. Brass said, 20 instead of 4 or 5 scientists could sail aboard a sub, working year-round.</p>
        <p>The extent and abundance of the gathered data, he said, "would make a big difference" in unlocking all kinds of oceanic secrets, in addition to those of the Arctic.</p>
