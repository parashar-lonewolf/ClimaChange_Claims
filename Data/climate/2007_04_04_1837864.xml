[C6.]</p>
        <p>DOUBLECLICK'S NEW VENTURE -- DoubleClick, which delivers marketing messages to Web sites and monitors how many clicks they get, plans to announce that it is setting up a Nasdaq-like exchange for the buying and selling of digital advertisements. Advertising. [C6.]</p>
        <p>HOUSING DATA HELP STOCKS SOAR -- Shares surged, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to a five-week high, as the housing market and consumers showed signs of resilience and falling oil prices gave investors an extra reason to rally. [C11.]</p>
        <p>OFFICES RESURGENT IN MANHATTAN -- The strength of Manhattan's commercial property market is causing developers to rethink plans to convert aging office buildings into residential condominiums. [C8.]</p>

        <p>TIGHTENING MORTGAGE REINS -- A growing number of New Yorkers, often with six-figure salaries and reasonably good credit, have begun to find that mortgages are harder to get as lenders try to stem losses from loans to the weakest, or subprime, borrowers.
