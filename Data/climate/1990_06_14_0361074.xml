        <p>LEAD: Strong winds pushed a growing oil slick toward the Texas Gulf Coast today as salvage workers aboard a burning Norwegian supertanker sprayed foam on a five-day-old fire for the first time, the Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>Strong winds pushed a growing oil slick toward the Texas Gulf Coast today as salvage workers aboard a burning Norwegian supertanker sprayed foam on a five-day-old fire for the first time, the Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>Two state agencies also gained approval from the Environmental Protection Agency today to conduct the first experiment using bacteria to combat an oil spill at sea.</p>
        <p>Coast Guard officers assessing the status of the tanker Mega Borg said conditions aboard the wreck were less dire today than at any time since fire broke out - a time now put at 11:30 P.M. Friday by attorneys for the ship's owners, A.S. Mosvolds Rederi and K.S. Mega Borg II. Retreating and Regrouping At 1 P.M. today, firefighters began to spray foam into the engine room, the heart of the fire, and quelled it. ''They were successful in knocking the flames down,'' said Capt. Thomas C. Greene, commander of the Coast Guard's marine safety office here. ''The only flames seen were in the vents. But at 3:45, the fire reflashed and they dropped back to regroup.''</p>
        <p>Spraying was suspended while more water was poured into the ship to cool the steel.</p>
        <p>At least three million gallons of oil has leaked from the tanker, and most is believed to have burned or evaporated, the Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>But 12,000 to 40,000 gallons of oil has formed into a slick more than 15 miles long. Pushed north and west today by winds of 20 knots, the slick could reach beaches on the Texas Gulf Coast on Friday, said Captain Greene.</p>
        <p>Today, the E.P.A. gave permission to a biotechnology company in Austin to spray naturally-occurring bacteria on the oil slick, in the first test of microbes to battle oil pollution in open water. The test of the bacteria had been sought by two Texas environmental agencies and Alpha Environmental Inc.</p>
        <p>A test of the bacteria conducted by the Texas Land Office and the Texas Water Commission last fall at the University of Texas found that the organisms consumed oil without harming fish or other aquatic organisms.</p>
        <p>In the first public statements by officers of the Mega Borg, the tanker's captain and chief engineer said today at an inquiry held here by the Norwegian Government that they had no idea what caused the ship to explode. The 36-year-old captain, C. M. Mahidhara, offered a vivid account of the enormous blast and the desperate efforts to get the crew off the ship.</p>
        <p>Testifying before a Norwegian board of inquiry that began here today, the officers said that following the blast several emergency and alarm systems failed to function and that the intense fire prevented them from taking other measures to save the ship.</p>
        <p>In a clear, unemotional voice Mr. Mahidhara described how he gave up two crewmen for dead in the engine compartment and ordered the room filled with carbon dioxide gas in a vain attempt to put out the blaze. ''My assessment was that I would risk more lives if I waited any longer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, officials of a wildlife refuge and elected officials of communities along the Gulf Coast spent the day tracking the movements of the slick.</p>
        <p>''I hope if it hits, it hits one of the barrier islands,'' said Kenneth Schwindt, assistant manager of the 110,000-acre Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, 140 miles southwest of Galveston and the center of breeding programs for endangered whooping cranes. ''If it gets into the internal bays and estuaries, that's when there could be trouble.''</p>
        <p>OOPS Inc., a New Orleans company, has been hired by the Mega Borg's owner to clean up the slick. OOPS (the acronym stands for O'Brien Oil Pollution Services) has been using a dozen skimming vessels and thousands of gallons of chemicals to disperse the oil. The strong winds today kicked up waves that hampered the skimmers.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups have criticized the use of the chemical dispersants because they have been shown to harm young fish and shellfish. A spokesman in Houston for Exxon Chemical America, the manufacturer of the dispersant, said the formulation was intended to have ''low toxicity.''</p>
        <p>The Texas General Land Office and the Texas Water Commission today said they were convinced that the use of oil-eating bacteria could prove to be a safe and novel method for battling oil slick. Captain Greene said he was prepared to approve the use of roughly 100 pounds of the bacteria on a small patch of oil in the Gulf. The state will submit a plan to Captain Greene on Thursday. The test could occur Thursday or Friday, he said.</p>
        <p>The bacteria have been collected in the last 20 years by Dr. Carl H. Oppenheimer, an occeanographer and microbiologist at the University of Texas in Austin. Dr. Oppenheimer said today that the microbes, contained in a corn starch powder, are all naturally-occurring and common.</p>
        <p>Last year, the E.P.A. approved the use of naturally-occurring bacteria on the rocky shoreline of Alaska after the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. The bacteria sharply reduced the oil in experimental areas.</p>
        <p>It is not known how well the microbes will perform in the open ocean, but the manufacturers, Alpha Environmental Inc., said that if the tests were successful they had thousands of pounds of microbes ready to use immediately.</p>
        <p>The Norwegian board of inquiry was called because the ship flew the Norwegian flag. The accident occured nearly 60 miles off shore in international waters, so the American authorities have no immediate jurisdiction.</p>
