        <p>CALVADOS is fine, apple juice palatable. But fermented cider I have always thought was a bad idea: cloying, heavy and as much joy to drink as maple syrup.</p>
        <p>I was wrong.</p>
        <p>At the Brasserie in midtown, there is a cider, Etienne Dupont 1999 Cidre Bouche Fermier, on tap. It is the first French cider refermented in the keg to be shipped to America. And it is like no other.</p>
        <p>It looks like cider. It's golden and, being unpasteurized and unfiltered, cloudy. It smells, as many wines do, of rubber and petroleum. In my mouth, it transforms into apples and plums, swimming in a thin, effervescent and deliciously yeasty liquid. It is light, sparkly and just acidic enough to keep your palate alert and wanting more.</p>
        <p>Most ciders are made with apples, apple concentrate and sugar. Dupont, which has produced Calvados since 1837, uses just apples. David Pollack of B. United International, the Chappaqua, N.Y., importer, says Dupont cider takes four months to ferment, as opposed to a few weeks for other ciders. Those extra months make the kind of difference a few years can with a tannic red wine. ''The longer that it takes,'' Mr. Pollack said, ''the more interesting flavors and aromas you get out of the cider.''</p>
        <p>Most ciders made in kegs are injected with carbon dioxide, but Dupont's is fermented a second time, in the keg, so that the bubbles are created naturally. ''You get a much finer bubble, a much smoother mouth feel,'' Mr. Pollack said.</p>
        <p>Smoother, yes. Like silk. It is tempting to regress and throw a kegger.</p>
        <p>For now, the Brasserie has dibs. Only five kegs have been allotted to New York. And the Brasserie has them all.</p>
        <p>Etienne Dupont 1999 Cidre Bouche Fermier is $8 for a 12-ounce glass ($10 for 25 ounces) at the Brasserie, 100 East 53rd Street (Park Avenue), (212) 751-4840.</p>
