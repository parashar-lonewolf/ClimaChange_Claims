        <p>The environmental proposals that the Clinton Administration is sending to Congress in its budget request for 2000 include new ways of delivering money to state and local governments to spend as they see fit, a sign that environmental power-sharing is taking a firmer hold than ever before.</p>
        <p>The Administration is seeking to spend $34 billion on environmental programs in the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, a 5 percent increase over the amount Congress approved for the current fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the White House is seeking expanded grants of conservation funds to states for purchasing ecologically sensitive lands; Federal payments to cities for controlling the air pollutants that cause global warming; tax credits to make it cheaper for local authorities to issue bonds for environmental purposes, and bigger Federal contributions to state revolving funds that pay for municipal water treatment.</p>
        <p>Some of the money is aimed at specific states for particular purposes, like a program announced this week that would help California, Oregon and Washington protect the habitat of endangered salmon.</p>
        <p>But if Congress agrees with these plans, the states and the cities would compete for most of the money and would largely control how it is spent.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that the pattern showed a heightened commitment to shifting more power over environmental programs away from Washington, meeting a goal long cherished by local officials and a policy frequently urged by Republicans in Congress. This approach also carries significant political advantages for the White House.</p>
        <p>Buried in the budget are ideas that include a new financing tool called ''better America bonds,'' which would use $700 million in Federal tax incentives to help generate $9.5 billion in bond authority over the next five years. States that borrowed this money at subsidized interest rates could choose to spend it to create parks, protect water quality and clean up the abandoned industrial sites known as ''brownfields.''</p>
        <p>''This is a big turning point,'' said Carol M. Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. She said it grew from the agency's past efforts to encourage local governments to clean up brownfields.</p>
        <p>''In the brownfields program, E.P.A. never wrote a single rule or regulation,'' Ms. Browner said. ''E.P.A. never said it is this property and that property that qualify. And in the better America bonds program, E.P.A. will allot the tax incentives, but E.P.A. will never make the decisions that it is this green space or that green space that qualifies.''</p>
        <p>The state role in environmental programs is not completely new.</p>
        <p>Over the years, as one Federal law after another set national environmental standards, the states have assumed much of the responsibility for carrying out the mandates under Federal supervision.</p>
        <p>That trend has been accelerating. By 1998, the E.P.A. had delegated responsibility to individual states for managing 757 environmental programs, an increase of 323, or nearly 75 percent, from five years earlier.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government provides only 20 percent of the money that the states spend on the environment, according to the Environmental Council of the States, which comprises the heads of state environmental agencies. But for a number of reasons, pragmatic and political, the Administration seems to be emphasizing the states' role in the new budget.</p>
        <p>First, it might help ease the strains between states and Federal authorities over environmental priorities, chiefly how strictly to enforce national environmental laws. This has been a source of friction.</p>
        <p>Second, it might help persuade Congress to increase overall environmental spending, an area of the budget in which the White House has fought bitterly year after year with appropriations committees controlled by Republicans.</p>
        <p>Third, it might make some specific Administration initiatives more palatable to opponents in Congress. An example is the program to fight global warming by controlling the waste gases that scientists say threaten to disrupt the planet's climate.</p>
        <p>Finally, expanding Federal spending in states, cities and counties from coast to coast is an obvious tool for Vice President Al Gore, the Administration's point man on matters environmental, to highlight his accomplishments as he runs for President.</p>
        <p>Several state officials said they were pleased by the trend, especially the emphasis on the state and local role in a $1 billion land conservation initiative at the center of the Administration's environmental budget.</p>
        <p>The initiative includes $150 million from the Federal land and water conservation fund for matching grants to states for land purchases; $50 million for planning to control urban sprawl; $80 million for acquiring land to protect endangered species; $50 million for conservation easements on privately owned forest land; $40 million for wooded urban areas; $50 million to help protect farmland from urban encroachment, and a few smaller initiatives.</p>
        <p>David Struhs, who left his job this week as Massachusetts's environmental commissioner to take a similar post in the new administration of Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, said that he believed the Administration was ''on the right track'' for both substantive and political reasons.</p>
        <p>''The one thing that the Clinton Administration does better than most is they make sure they have truth-tested these things in the public opinion polls before they roll them out,'' Mr. Struhs said.</p>
        <p>And he said the governors are hearing the same messages, especially on conservation of lands.</p>
        <p>''If you actually listen to and read the rhetoric of Al Gore on these issues and compare it to Gov. Paul Cellucci in Massachusetts and Gov. Jeb Bush in Florida, there are remarkable parallels in where they see environmental policy going,'' Mr. Struhs said.</p>
        <p>Other political figures, though, were more skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I am a little ambivalent when the Government creates what are sometimes irrational requirements for cities, then gives them a little money to help deal with them,'' said the Republican Mayor of Indianapolis, Stephen Goldsmith.</p>
        <p>Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, the Republican chairman of a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee that deals with environmental programs, said that he had always supported generous financing for the state's revolving funds, which pay for many clean air and water programs, but that he did not yet know enough about the Administration's new programs to endorse them.</p>
        <p>''This Administration, like the other administrations before it, has had a habit of creating a whole bunch of boutique programs each year, and taking a few dollars for this and a few dollars for that,'' Mr. Bond said. ''I have generally opposed creating more boutique programs until we can fund the ones that already exist.''</p>
        <p>Among the new programs is a ''clean air partnership fund'' that will provide $200 million to states and localities to reduce so-called greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants from automobiles and coal-powered electric plants.</p>
        <p>The money can be used to provide low-interest loans or matching grants, potentially increasing the amount of investment flowing from the relatively small Federal contribution.</p>
        <p>Similarly, $100 million sought for 2000 in new assistance to state, local and tribal governments would be matched dollar for dollar by local governments willing to spend the money to protect salmon habitat by buying conservation easements, planting trees along river banks and taking similar steps.</p>
        <p>''A year from now, a substantial part of the Northwest, including large urban areas near the Puget Sound, are going to be endangered salmon habitat,'' said George Frampton, the acting director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. ''Regulation alone, listing the salmon as endangered, isn't going to get the salmon restored to health. It is going to take a partnership of the counties, the mayors, companies like Boeing and Microsoft, and the Federal Government to address this problem.''</p>
