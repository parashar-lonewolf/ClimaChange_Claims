        <p>Frederick C. Cuny, an international relief expert who has been missing in Chechnya since April, was among 24 people awarded grants yesterday by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.</p>
        <p>Other fellows chosen for what is popularly called the genius program include the writers Sandra Cisneros and Octavia Butler, Virginia Hamilton, the first children's author to receive the fellowship, the artist Cindy Sherman, the composer and choreographer Meredith Monk, and a variety of scientists, historians and social scientists.</p>
        <p>The list of 9 men and 15 women includes people with interests in feminism, minorities and evolutionary biology. All except one are in their 40's or 50's.</p>
        <p>The program rewards creative people with unrestricted five-year grants of $30,000 to $75,000 a year. Despite the genius moniker attached to the program, MacArthur executives prefer to describe the fellows as hard-working experts who often push the boundaries of their fields in ways that others will follow.</p>
        <p>"These awards are a reminder of the importance of seeing as broadly as possible, of being willing to live outside of a comfort zone and of keeping your nerve endings open," said Catharine Stimpson, director of the awards program.</p>
        <p>The amount of the grant depends on age, with older recipients getting more money; all get free health insurance as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuny, 50, was sent to the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya by the Soros Foundation to assess the humanitarian needs there.  Russian forces have been trying to put down a secessionist movement in the region, and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance are unclear.</p>
        <p>"There are a number of people who do the work he did," said Aryeh Neier, president of the Soros Foundation, which is based in New York. "But he brought a particularly creative grasp of the technological factors, the humanitarian needs and the political context."</p>
        <p>Noting that Mr. Cuny was last heard from more than two months ago, Mr. Neier said he was still hopeful but also apprehensive, and said that F.B.I. had joined in the search.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Cuny is not found alive, the award will go unclaimed.</p>
        <p>With yesterday's group, MacArthur has named 458 people to its fellows program, which started in 1981. Of the previous recipients, 330 are men and 104 are women. The Chicago-based foundation, which has assets of about $3 billion, has put more than $140 million into the program, which is only one of many programs it finances.</p>
