        <p>A Senate committee vote on a major air pollution bill was postponed on Wednesday after the chairman determined that he lacked the votes to send the bill to the full Senate.</p>
        <p>Expressing hope that two more weeks of negotiations would lead to a compromise on the measure, the Clear Skies Act of 2005, Senator James M. Inhofe, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said: ''We're going to get together in a genuine effort to determine if there is a middle ground. This gives us the time to do that.''</p>
        <p>The panel had met to produce a final version of the bill before a vote that Mr. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, seemed intent on having. In a prepared opening statement, Mr. Inhofe said, ''Today represents the last opportunity to move this process forward,'' adding that a full Senate debate was unlikely if the committee did not vote to send the bill forward.</p>
        <p>But he never read his remarks as it became apparent that the bill would fail, a disappointment for the White House, which has lobbied extensively for its passage. After a 30-minute delay, while Republican committee members conferred to map a strategy, Mr. Inhofe returned to announce that the committee would try again on March 2 to bridge gaps over issues like caps for carbon dioxide and one state's right to sue another over windblown pollution.</p>
        <p>The thrust of the bill is to set new emissions standards for three major pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It does not include limits for carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The panel is largely split along party lines, and the fate of the bill is unclear. Nine of the 10 Republicans favor it, while all seven Democrats and an independent, Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, object to enough aspects of the bill not to support it. The 10th Republican, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, has favored a different approach.</p>
        <p>The delay was applauded by groups for and against the bill -- but for different reasons. Frank Maisano of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, a trade group, said it pointed to ''a serious effort to work on a comprehensive package.''</p>
        <p>Jeremy Symons of the National Wildlife Federation said: ''This is a major victory for the environment. It shows they don't have the votes.''</p>
