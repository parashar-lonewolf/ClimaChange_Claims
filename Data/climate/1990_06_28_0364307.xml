        <p>LEAD: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned representatives of more than 100 nations today that destruction of the earth's ozone layer was proceeding even faster than scientists had feared.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned representatives of more than 100 nations today that destruction of the earth's ozone layer was proceeding even faster than scientists had feared.</p>
        <p>As a result, she said, efforts to reduce ozone-destroying chemicals must be hastened.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher's speech opened an international meeting that is expected to result in an agreement on a worldwide end to the production of chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, which destroy the ozone layer, by 2000 and restrictions on the production of related chemicals.</p>
        <p>However, there is growing pressure to bring the ban into effect by 1997 and to make it more comprehensive than originally planned.</p>
        <p>The drive against ozone-destroying chemicals is moving much more rapidly than most diplomats had believed possible. The Montreal Protocol of 1987, endorsed by 23 countries, called for a 50 percent reduction of chlorofluorocarbons by 1999. That agreement has now been endorsed by 60 nations.</p>
        <p>The United States and Britain, the two largest producers of these chemicals, have already begun to reduce production sharply and turn to substitutes. Richard E. Benedick, who headed the United States delegation that negotiated the Montreal Protocol, said that progress in closed-door sessions here during the last two weeks astonished him. He is attending as an observer for the World Wildlife Fund while on leave from the State Department.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing something completely unprecedented in the history of diplomacy,'' he said in an interview. ''Politicians from every bloc and region of the world are setting aside politics to reach agreement on protecting the global environment. Governments are backing off hardened positions to get an agreement, and even the customary disagreements between North and South - the developed nations versus the developing nations - lack their usual edge.''</p>
        <p>The London meeting is seen by many scientists and national leaders as important not only because of its attack on the ozone problem but because it sets the stage for future international cooperation in meeting even harder environmental challenges, notably the need to reduce the production of atmospheric gases causing global warming.</p>
        <p>In her speech, Prime Minister Thatcher urged that the world community draw up a convention by 1992 on global climate changes.</p>
        <p>Ozone, a gas consisting of molecules in which three oxygen atoms are bound together, is poisonous to most living organisms. But its natural presence in the stratosphere serves as a shield against dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Scientists predict that the depletion of ozone now occurring could eventually lead to an epidemic of skin cancer and cataracts, as well as sharply reduced agricultural and marine food production.</p>
        <p>Although volcanic gases may contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer, most scientists now believe that the main culprits are manufactured chlorofluorocarbon compounds, or CFC's. These substances are widely used as refrigerants, foaming agents for plastic packaging, aerosol propellants and cleaning fluids.</p>
        <p>A chemically related family of compounds, the halons, are among the most effective fire-extinguishing chemicals ever devised.</p>
        <p>Scientists are not sure of all the complex events that occur when chlorofluorocarbons reach the stratosphere, but they agree that they play a role in destroying the ozone layer.</p>
        <p>The process is accelerating, Mrs. Thatcher said. Last week, she said, Joseph Farman of the British Antarctic Survey told her of evidence of a 6 percent reduction in the ozone layer in northern latitudes during winter.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thatcher, a chemist by training, added: ''His message was clear, and I quote: The rapid development of the Antarctic ozone hole took us by surprise. We should be warned by that experience that the Northern Hemisphere trends could also accelerate, this time affecting heavily populated areas of the world.''</p>
        <p>This report has lent impetus to efforts by Scandinavian nations, Australia and New Zealand to hasten a chlorofluorocarbon ban.</p>
