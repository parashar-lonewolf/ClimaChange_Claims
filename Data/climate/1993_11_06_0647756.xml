        <p>President Clinton's new plan to control global warming looks a lot more like something George Bush would dream up than like anything straight from the heart of Al Gore, the environmental conscience of the Administration. The plan relies heavily on voluntary actions, goes light on regulatory actions and remains silent on the enormously difficult problem of what to do to head off a big increase in greenhouse gas emissions after the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>Even so, the plan is a reasonable response to a distant crisis whose dimensions are uncertain. This is not an issue on which the President should spend much political or economic capital just yet.</p>
        <p>There is wide agreement that an accumulation in the atmosphere of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, will make the world warmer than it would otherwise be. But there's little agreement about the magnitude of the warming and what damage it would cause. And that, in turn, makes it difficult to know how much money and effort to expend now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>President Bush treated global warming as a secondary issue that required no strong governmental response. He strongly opposed setting any firm targets or timetables for reducing emissions, and almost singlehandedly blocked the setting of mandatory limits in the global climate treaty signed in Rio de Janeiro last year.</p>
        <p>The Bush program relied mainly on voluntary actions by industry, most of which were already under way. These efforts, the Bush Administration calculated, would bring the nation within hailing distance of 1990 emission levels by the year 2000, but would not quite reach that goal. Thereafter, the emissions would soar upward again.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has now greatly toughened the rhetoric while only moderately toughening the policies. He has called global warming "perhaps the biggest environmental threat to this planet," suggesting that he views the problem more seriously than did Mr. Bush. And he has pledged to bring emission levels in the year 2000 down to 1990 levels, thus imposing a mandate on himself that Mr. Bush declined to impose on the country.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton stopped short of proposing the corrective measures recommended by Mr. Gore in his book "Earth in the Balance," namely tougher mileage requirements for all cars and trucks sold in the U.S. and a carbon tax to discourage emissions. He, too, will rely heavily on voluntary actions by industry and individuals. Those would be backed up by new regulatory standards in a few areas, including residential appliances, electric transformers and landfill emissions.</p>
        <p>The Clinton program has drawn criticism from disappointed environmental groups. But it is a reasonable response given the uncertain nature of the peril and the strong political opposition to new taxes and tougher mileage standards. Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton is putting his own credibility behind the emissions-control effort. He has called for $1.9 billion in government spending, mostly redirected funds, by the year 2000. And his effort to enlist the aid of industry appears far more vigorous than Mr. Bush's.</p>
        <p>Administration experts calculate that the program is strong enough to reach the goal for the year 2000. A White House team will monitor progress and ratchet up the effort if necessary. Mr. Clinton still has to tell us how to cope with vehicular emissions and a sharp rise in overall emissions after the turn of the century. But for now he has made a sensible start on an emerging problem that bears close watching.</p>
