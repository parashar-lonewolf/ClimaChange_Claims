        <p>Hamas Leader Pledges Realism  The exiled political head of the radical Islamic group Hamas said in Damascus, Syria, that the group would adopt ''a very realistic approach'' toward governing the Palestinian Authority and would work with the Fatah president, Mahmoud Abbas, on an acceptable political program.</p>

        <p>While some Israelis are angry at Hamas's victory in the Palestinian elections last week, they look with some satisfaction at how starkly the results put into plain view Hamas's stand for the destruction of Israel.</p>

        <p>Gunmen, activists and police officers affiliated with the defeated Fatah movement staged angry protests, firing into the air outside the Palestinian presidential compound in Ramallah and marching on the Parliament buildings in Gaza and the West Bank in a renewed display of mounting political tensions.</p>

        <p>Behind Haiti's Crisis  Interviews and a review of government documents show that a democracy-building group close to the White House undercut the official United States policy in Haiti and the ambassador assigned to carry it out, contributing to Haiti's unrest and political crisis.</p>

        <p>Collapse Kills Dozens in Poland  A roof collapsed at an exhibition hall in Poland packed with hundreds of people, killing dozens, and officials said many more were trapped under the rubble in freezing conditions. As temperatures dropped to minus 5 degrees overnight, rescuers used floodlights to search for survivors.</p>

        <p>More Video of 4 Iraq Hostages  Four Western peace advocates abducted in November were shown in a videotape broadcast, and their captors renewed their threat to kill the hostages if all Iraqi prisoners were not set free. The video showed the four men looking gaunt and standing against a white wall.</p>

        <p>Claims of Censoring at NASA  The top climate scientist at NASA says the Bush administration has tried to stop him from speaking out since he gave a lecture calling for prompt reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming. The deputy assistant administrator for public affairs at the space agency said there was no such effort.</p>

        <p>Trove of Letters Tell Story  Mary Leslie Wolff is negotiating to donate her family's collection of personal correspondences, at least 75,000 documents dating to more than 200 years ago, to a historical society. The collection is one of the largest private family troves that has turned up in recent years, genealogy experts say.</p>

        <p>A Changing Nashville  Lawyers for the Brass Stables, the last strip club in the Nashville's historic entertainment district, say the club cannot comply with new city regulations, and may be forced to close. This is a source of both dismay and relief in Nashville, where a downtown renaissance is creating a new urban neighborhood around the alley.</p>

        <p>Gains for Wealthiest  New government data indicate that the concentration of corporate wealth among the highest-income Americans grew significantly in 2003, as a trend that began in 1991 accelerated in the first year that President Bush and Congress cut taxes on capital.</p>
