        <p>In what is described as a preview of some of the effects of global warming, Canadian researchers have documented a profound and pervasive disruption of ecosystems that they attribute to a rise in the temperature of northwestern Ontario in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>The study, being published today in the journal Science, found that from the late 1960's to the mid-1980's, the average annual temperature rose by about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit in a region of Ontario that has been set aside for longterm ecological research.</p>

        <p>In what is described as a preview of some of the effects of global warming, Canadian researchers have documented a profound and pervasive disruption of ecosystems that they attribute to a rise in the temperature of northwestern Ontario in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>The study, being published today in the journal Science, found that from the late 1960's to the mid-1980's, the average annual temperature rose by about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit in a region of Ontario that has been set aside for longterm ecological research.</p>
        <p>Scientists say they do not know whether the rise is part of a natural variation in climate or is a result of a climatic warming brought about by increasing levels of heat-trapping chemicals produced by human activity. The chemicals include carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons.</p>
        <p>The effect of the warming has hardly been wholly benign, contrary to what might be expected in northern climes, the study found. The researchers say the warmer temperatures have made droughts and forest fires more frequent, diminished soil moisture and disrupted the ability of the forests to renew themselves.  Other Harmful Effects</p>
        <p>They also discovered that the warmth has decreased the flow of water into the region's myriad freshwater lakes, changed their chemistry and warmed them so that the future of a wide variety of aquatic fauna is threatened. These include lake trout and supporting species that make up one of the world's most valuable fisheries.</p>
        <p>If forecasts of future worldwide warming are correct, the report said, the north-woods ecosystems "should be severely affected." Scientists generally expect the average global climate to warm by about 2 degrees by the year 2025 and by about 5.5 degrees by the end of the next century, if the current output of heat-trapping chemicals continues. By comparison, the average global temperature is about 9 degrees higher now than it was in the last ice age.</p>
        <p>But climate forecasters generally expect the warming to be greatest in northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with forecasts calling for average temperature increases of as much as 10 to 15 degrees and losses in soil moisture of more than 50 percent in northwestern Ontario in summer.</p>
        <p>The findings in Science were reported by a team of 10 researchers headed by Dr. David W. Schindler, an ecologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Other members of the team were associated with the Canadian Government's Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg, Manitoba.</p>
        <p>The study concentrated on a lake called simply Lake 239 and its watershed. This is one of many lakes set aside in the 1960's for long-term ecosystem studies in what is called the Experimental Lakes Area of northern Ontario. Since the late 1960's, the researchers have been collecting a wide variety of data for many purposes. Some Benign Effects</p>
        <p>"The record was not collected with the intention of analyzing climate and climatic effects," Dr. Schindler said.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, the study did find some benign effects: in the spring, ice disappears from the lakes about three weeks earlier than it did before. Snow has become sparser, with midwinter melting occurring in most years. And in one of the biggest effects, the warming stimulated a long-term increase of nitrogen, a powerful fertilizer, in the lakes. One result was an enrichment of microscopic plant life, with a proliferation of diverse algae species.</p>
        <p>But decreased rainfall and soil moisture also caused less water to run into the lakes. One effect was to increase the time it takes the lakes to replenish their waters to 20 years from 4 or 5, increasing the concentration of many chemicals in the lakes. Dr. Schindler said this meant that the lakes were far less able to flush out pollutants.</p>
        <p>Less water flowing into the lakes also means that fewer organic particles flow into them, the study found. This means that they are clearer, and that sunlight penetrates farther and warms them to a greater depth. At the same time, higher winds are allowed to develop because wide areas of forest have been denuded by forest fires.</p>
        <p>The winds, Dr. Schindler said, have driven cold, oxygen-rich layers of the lakes where lake trout and many other cold-water species seek summertime refuge deeper into the lake, squeezing, compressing and in some cases eliminating the refuges. Much more climatic warming would destroy the refuges altogether, the study says, leading to the destruction of the lake trout, which can survive only in cold water. Possible Disappearance of Trout</p>
        <p>Dr. Schindler noted that many large lakes 200 or so miles north of the study area were so shallow that they had no refuge layers. Cold-water fish there would be totally at the mercy of higher temperatures.</p>
        <p>Any significant further warming would probably mean the extermination of the lake trout and other cold-water species on which they depend, Dr. Schindler said. It is not clear that fisheries of comparable value or ecosystems of comparable diversity would be quickly re-established, the study said. Bass could replace trout, Dr. Schindler said, but they would have to be stocked.</p>
        <p>Noting that the effects of climatic change on fresh waters have been "largely disregarded" in efforts to deal with climate change, the report said, "they are already scarce in many regions of the world, and they are a key element in the maintenance of non-marine organisms, including man."</p>
