        <p>LEAD: Policy makers have started to join environmentalists in calling for more efficient use of energy as a way to cope with global warming and other threats to the environment.</p>
        <p>Policy makers have started to join environmentalists in calling for more efficient use of energy as a way to cope with global warming and other threats to the environment.</p>
        <p>Until now the Reagan Administration has given fairly low priority to encouraging the efficient use of coal and oil, emphasizing instead the development of new sources of energy. Environmentalists say the Administration has even encouraged wastefulness through moves like lowering fuel efficiency standards for automobiles.</p>
        <p>But that emphasis appears to be changing in the face of mounting evidence that carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial gases are accumulating in the atmosphere, where they trap heat from the sun like a greenhouse. Many scientists predict that the greenhouse effect will cause the earth's temperature to rise within a century to levels unreached in human experience.</p>
        <p>Pollution from fossil fuels also contributes to urban smog and acid rain. Emissions Seen Rising 38%</p>
        <p>A report prepared recently for the Energy Department warned that carbon dioxide emissions, the largest single potential cause of global warming, would rise by 38 percent in the United States by 2010 if nothing was done.</p>
        <p>The report, prepared by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, said carbon dioxide pollution could be cut by 40 to 50 percent through aggressive measures to use fossil fuels more efficiently. One measure mentioned by the report is tougher fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles.</p>
        <p>Donna R. Fitzpatrick, Energy Under Secretary, said in a telephone interview that while global warming remained an unproven theory, ''we ought to be pursuing energy efficiency gains anyway'' because it made sense for other reasons, including reducing dependence on foreign fuel.</p>
        <p>While the trend is beginning to take root, it is too soon to tell how it will fare under President-elect Bush. He has called the global warming problem a serious issue that he intends to address in his first year in office, but he has not discussed the issue of energy conservation in any detail. Major World Effort Vowed</p>
        <p>William A. Nitze, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for environment, health and natural resources, said today that at an international conference set for 1990 the United States was likely to propose a major world effort to use fuel more efficiently. That meeting, to be held to prepare an agreement on global warming, will be under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nitze was part of the United States delegation at a meeting in Geneva this month to plan for the 1990 conference. At that meeting the United States was given the leadership of the committee for planning ways to reduce carbon dioxide and other gases. Mr. Nitze said the committee would be considering ''the obvious candidates.'' These include shifting to other energy sources, including nuclear power, over the long run.</p>
        <p>He said the United States had assumed a leadership role in addressing the threat of global warming.</p>
        <p>Separate bills to require more efficient use of energy were introduced in the Senate this summer, one by Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, and the other by Robert T. Stafford, Republican of Vermont. While it was too late in the year for the legislation to move forward, similar legislation is almost certain to be introduced in 1989. Calls for Safe Nuclear Energy</p>
        <p>Mr. Wirth's bill included a call for the development of safe sources of nuclear energy. Proponents of nuclear power say the warming threat demonstrates the need for this source of energy.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists say the safety and economic problems that still plague nuclear power make such an alternative unrealistic for the foreseeable future. They insist that the safest and cheapest approach is to use existing energy sources more efficiently and to invest in renewable sources like solar power.</p>
        <p>Other proposed energy savers include co-generation, or dual use of energy used in industrial production to produce both power and heat; development of industrial processes that require less energy; better insulation of homes and buildings; development of appliances that use energy more efficiently, and more reliance on mass transportation.</p>
        <p>While the nation started using energy far more efficiently after the Arab oil embargo sent fuel prices soaring in the 1970's, that improvement leveled off in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>A report issued last week by the World Resources Institute, a research and policy group based in Washington, said, ''The United States is one of the world's least energy-efficient countries, using twice as much energy as Japan to produce a dollar of gross national product.'' The report said, ''Of the 10 largest economies, the United States' energy efficiency is better than that of only China, India and Canada.''</p>
        <p>Another report issued last week by Renew America, a nonprofit group dedicated to the efficient use of natural resources, found a great disparity among individual states in energy efficiency. Some states, like California, have already adopted energy-efficiency standards for appliances like refrigerators, while others have done nothing.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists say that so far the Reagan Administration has given only lip service to the efficient use of energy while taking actions that promote wasteful use of energy. Howard Geller, associate director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, another Washington-based nonprofit group, said the Administration had ''gutted'' conservation research and development programs.</p>
