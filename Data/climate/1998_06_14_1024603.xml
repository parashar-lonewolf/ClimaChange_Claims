        <p>Six months ago, in a sleepless, adrenaline-fueled rush of last-minute dealing in Kyoto, Japan, delegates from around the world agreed for the first time to make specific, legally binding reductions in industrialized countries' emissions of heat-trapping gases believed to affect Earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Now, in something of a morning-after, what-have-we-done state of mind, negotiators grappling with the details of putting the first cuts into effect are finding the task as difficult as that of hammering out the original accord.</p>
        <p>As they made their first formal efforts to flesh out the Kyoto accord in talks here over the last two weeks, it became clear that the agreement remains largely a work in progress. Thanks to the same clash of interests that nearly scuttled the negotiations in Kyoto, the work may not be finished for quite some time.</p>
        <p>Before the Kyoto meeting took place, said Michael Zammit Cutajar of Malta, who heads the United Nations climate secretariat, the initial agreement was seen as a kind of summit to be reached. But ''when we got to Kyoto, we saw it wasn't a peak at all but a plateau.'' With a new mountain ahead, he added, ''we are not anywhere near the top.''</p>
        <p>As the next phase of the struggle got under way, developing countries renewed their insistence against submitting to specific, mandatory emissions caps until wealthier nations achieve reductions. That left open the question of whether the poorer nations can be drawn more fully into the reduction program anytime soon. If not, American politicians say, the Kyoto Protocol, as the agreement is called, cannot be approved by the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>The talks here set the stage for the next high-level conference of the more than 150 countries that signed the 1992 treaty under which the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated. The conference is scheduled for Buenos Aires in November. Its main objective will be to make as much progress on the details of the protocol as possible.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping atmospheric gases by an annual average of about 5 percent below 1990 levels for the period 2008 through 2012. Some countries are to cut their emissions by more than that, some less. The United States' reduction target is 7 percent. Carbon dioxide is produced by the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil.</p>
        <p>The Kyoto targets are widely viewed as a first step, since overall concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise if deeper cuts are not eventually made. Without any reductions at all, scientific advisers to the delegates here say, the Earth's average surface temperature will rise by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees, by 2100.</p>
        <p>A warming of this magnitude, the scientists say, would cause the sea level to rise and inundate many coastal areas. It would also worsen droughts and rainstorms, cause more heat waves and floods, increase precipitation generally and shift climatic and agricultural zones.</p>
        <p>For the countries here, the immediate challenge is to enable the first steps included in the Kyoto accord to be taken. That involves agreeing on how new mechanisms for cutting emissions will work in practice.</p>
        <p>One, which negotiators have named the clean-development mechanism, is a system for channeling and certifying rich countries' investment in emissions-reducing projects in poor countries -- power plants that emit less carbon dioxide, for instance. The two nations involved would share the credit for emissions reductions achieved, and part of the proceeds would help the developing countries adapt to climatic change.</p>
        <p>Another mechanism is called emissions trading. In this system, much favored by the United States, a country or private company could achieve its reductions target partly by buying reductions from a country or company with excess cuts. Proponents say this arrangement would work globally, and at lowest cost.</p>
        <p>These two mechanisms are the operational heart of the protocol, and both came under criticism in the talks just concluded. Developing countries balked, resisting pressure to move rapidly until questions about the mechanisms are answered.</p>
        <p>What is required now is ''to learn and understand,'' said Vijai Sharma, the chief delegate from India, who said that much had been unclear in the chaos of Kyoto. Answering the questions and then formulating rules for operating the mechanisms ''is going to take long,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One reason for the developing countries' caution is that they are likely, eventually, to come under the same rules as the rich nations. And many delegates from the poorer countries say privately that while the clean-development mechanism holds apparent benefits for them, it is unclear what the costs might be.</p>
        <p>On emissions trading, a split developed between the European Union and much of the rest of the industrialized world, including the United States, over the critical issue of how much of a given country's reduction it should be allowed to achieve by purchasing emissions rights from another country.</p>
        <p>The Europeans insisted that some cap be placed on the proportion of a country's reduction that can be achieved through trading.</p>
        <p>The United States and other countries insist just as strongly that trading should be unrestricted. Otherwise, they say, the market mechanism will not function properly and the cost of reductions will rise. The Americans say it is simply not yet known how much emissions can be reduced by domestic action.</p>
