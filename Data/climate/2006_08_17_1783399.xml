        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Culture of Nations,'' by David Brooks (column, Aug. 13):</p>
        <p>Many in the field of intercultural research have been working for years to help people more effectively achieve their goals across borders -- not only in business transactions, but also across borders of politics, faith, professions, age and other sometimes formidable barriers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Brooks's conclusion that we are ''foolish to think we can address the root causes'' of young Muslim men's martyrdom and that we will ''just have to fight the symptoms of a disease we can neither cure nor understand'' does not follow from the analysts he cites.</p>
        <p>While it is true that long-term cultural change is rarely, if ever, imposed from the outside, that does not mean that policies in one country have no effect on culture change in other societies.</p>
        <p>In all civilizations, having an unyielding outside adversary strengthens those who would support the most militaristic, radical and uncompromising aspects of their own societies. When one nation or group threatens another, only extremists are strengthened.</p>
        <p>Democratic societies have more resilience in this regard, which may ultimately, we may hope, allow the United States to step outside the vicious circle of mutual demonization.</p>
        <p>John W. Bing  Ewing, N.J., Aug. 13, 2006</p>
        <p>The writer is chairman of a firm that helps businesses and organizations work effectively across borders.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's comforting to be assured by David Brooks that ''if you're Swedish and you have a chance to pull up in front of a fire hydrant, you still don't do it.''</p>
        <p>Then again, I've sat on a bench in front of a luxury dessert-and-beverage shop at the tony southwest corner of Madison Avenue and 92nd Street and watched as one super-sized, gas-guzzling S.U.V. after another pulled up with its sole, severely pampered, affluent occupant blithely unconcerned with our energy crisis or global warming. Perhaps not all of Western culture is so enviably altruistic.</p>
        <p>Doug Brin  New York, Aug. 13, 2006</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Contrary to David Brooks's Aug. 13 column, diplomats in New York City no longer rack up a lot of unpaid parking tickets. Working with the State Department, the Bloomberg administration crafted and put into effect in November 2002 a new diplomatic parking program that ended parking with impunity and reduced the number of unpaid summonses.</p>
        <p>Since that time, the total number of diplomatic parking tickets issued has dropped by nearly 90 percent, little new debt is accruing and -- with the help of federal legislation -- old debt accrued before the parking program started has been reduced by $4 million. A diplomat who has more than three unpaid parking tickets in 100 days now faces the same enforcement action as every New Yorker.</p>
