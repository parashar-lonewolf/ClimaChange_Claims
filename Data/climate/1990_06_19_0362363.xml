        <p>LEAD: AS the sun arcs toward the summer solstice and swarms of unregenerate sunbathers head for the beach, scientists are struggling mightily to undo the damage of profligate tanning. They are racing to devise new therapies against malignant melanoma, the deadly skin cancer that is rising faster than any other cancer in the world.</p>
        <p>AS the sun arcs toward the summer solstice and swarms of unregenerate sunbathers head for the beach, scientists are struggling mightily to undo the damage of profligate tanning. They are racing to devise new therapies against malignant melanoma, the deadly skin cancer that is rising faster than any other cancer in the world.</p>
        <p>At several recent cancer meetings, epidemiologists and dermatologists presented stark new figures that they said make melanoma one of the most troublesome cancers they now confront. They reported that the incidence of the skin malignancy has doubled since 1980, and that it continues to soar by 4 percent or 5 percent a year worldwide. In that same period, they said, malignant melanoma climbed from being the third most common cancer among women between the ages of 25 and 29, to its current status as No. 1 for the group, and the ninth most common cancer overall in the United States. Last year 27,300 people were diagnosed with melanoma, and 6,000 died of the disease.</p>
        <p>''It's a near epidemic,'' said Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, a dermatologist and melanoma specialist at New York University Medical Center. ''To have something double in 10 years is really amazing. No other cancer has this rate of increase.''</p>
        <p>Faced with these statistics, many researchers are working to design new therapies against the disease. When caught early enough, melanoma tumors, which resemble moles, can be surgically removed and the cancer completely cured. But once the malignancy has spread from the skin to other parts of the body, melanoma is among the most aggressive and lethal of cancers, resisting traditional methods of chemotherapy and radiation.</p>
        <p>Researchers now say that a far more promising approach to treating advanced melanoma is to coax the immune system to recognize melanoma cells as deadly and to destroy them. Some investigators have crafted vaccines that spur the immune system to recognize melanoma cells and to produce antibodies and white blood cells to fight them. Several of these vaccines are in or nearing large-scale clinical trials. Other investigators are employing powerful hormones like interferon and interleukin-2 to stimulate an immune response in patients.</p>
        <p>''Two years ago I wouldn't have said that I have much hope for new treatments,'' said Dr. Alan N. Houghton, chief of the clinical immunology service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ''But now we have a whole set of new agents and new approaches that I think are going to make a difference in the future.''</p>
        <p>Still other scientists are striving to understand why melanoma defies many of the rules that apply to other cancers. They are scrutinizing the enzymes in the tumor cells to determine why melanoma can infiltrate more organs than almost any other type of malignancy. They also are learning how stray melanoma cells that have broken away from the original tumor can lie dormant in the body for 10 years or longer before suddenly exploding into a deadly tumor mass at a distant site. Scientists say they believe that such insights will lead to dramatically improved cancer therapies.</p>
        <p>''One absolutely critical, important point that we have learned by studying melanoma is that we can use a biological approach to alter a patient's immune system and cause cancer regression,'' said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.</p>
        <p>But dermatologists stress that right now the only good treatment for the disease is to catch it at its earliest stages, when surgery can rout it out. Better still, say doctors, is to avoid excessive sun exposure and to wear a strong sun block while outdoors.</p>
        <p>''The best thing to do about melanoma is not to get it,'' said Dr. Fred T. Valentine, an immunologist at New York University Medical Center. ''That's the lesson folks still have to learn.''</p>
        <p>Melanoma is a cancer of the melanocytes, the cells that produce skin pigment. It is less common than basal cell carcinoma, a relatively benign type of skin tumor that usually appears on the face or hands and rarely spreads beyond the skin.</p>
        <p>Dangers of the Healthy Look</p>
        <p>Some scientists blame part of the melanoma epidemic on the use of industrial and commercial chemicals that are thought to be depleting the ozone layer, the stratum of the atmosphere that blocks out many dangerous ultraviolet rays. But the theory is hotly contested, and most researchers believe that a more important cause is an obsession with tanning.</p>
        <p>They say that the steep rise in melanoma began when the bronzed ''healthy'' look replaced the porcelain complexion as a physical ideal, a trend that began in the 1920's and accelerated in the 50's and later.</p>
        <p>''It's insidious because there's a lag period before the sun damage becomes clinically apparent,'' said Dr. Rigel. ''What we're seeing now are the cancers that were initiated in the 60's and 70's, when people were outdoors more than they had been 20 years before, but when strong sunscreens were not yet widely available.''</p>
        <p>Buttressing the link between melanoma and recreational sunning are the locations on the body where the first tumors usually appear. On men, melanoma tumors normally show up on the back, shoulders or belly, places that are usually exposed to strong sun only sporadically.</p>
        <p>No Safe Suntan</p>
        <p>On women, melanomas most frequently occur on the legs, although they can also appear on the torso.</p>
        <p>Wherever they crop up, the tumors usually are dark brown or black, slightly raised, with irregular edges.</p>
        <p>Researchers say that the most dangerous type of exposure is binge sunning, which frequently results in bad burns. According to the American Cancer Society, people who have had three or more blistering sunburns before the age of 20 have five times the risk of getting melanoma of those who have never been sunburned. But researchers say that the unusual danger of a bad sunburn does not mean that gradual or mild tanning is harmless. ''There is no such thing as a safe suntan,'' said Dr. Rigel.</p>
        <p>Other risk factors include a family history of the disease, a fair complexion and blond or red hair, and a noticeably freckled back and shoulders, indicating excessive sun exposure. Blacks and Asians also develop melanoma, although at a much lower rate than do fair-skinned whites.</p>
        <p>Researchers recently determined the precise size of the tumor that can spell the difference between life and death, Dr. Rigel said. When the vertical thickness of the tumor is less than a 0.75 millimeters, or one thirty-second of an inch, the removal of the tumor marks the end of the disease virtually 100 percent of the time. But if the tumor is thicker than an eighth of an inch - the width of a dime - it very likely already has metastasized, or spread.</p>
        <p>Optimism Over Vaccines</p>
        <p>Metastatic melanoma is one of the toughest tumors to treat. For unknown reasons, it is invulnerable to most types of chemotherapeutic drugs that kill other cancer cells. Radiation is sometimes used to treat melanoma, but the therapy can do little beyond shrinking tumors enough to relieve a patient's pain.</p>
        <p>But scientists are optimistic that melanoma may be more amenable to new immune therapies than are other cancers. They have found that a melanoma cell has an unusually high number of antigens, or protruding proteins, on its surface, which could provide easy targets for the immune system to assault. Researchers do not yet understand the function of the surface proteins, but they are exploiting the bulging antigens to design new therapies.</p>
        <p>''We believe that we can train the immune system to go out and destroy any melanoma that's been left behind after surgery,'' said Dr. Jean-Claude Bystra, director of the melanoma program at the New York University Kaplan Cancer Center.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most promising approach lies with a cancer vaccine, long a dream of oncologists. Researchers hope that by vaccinating a patient with telltale pieces of a cancer cell, they can spur the immune system to mount a fierce response against all cells in the body that bear those distinguishing marker proteins.</p>
        <p>Triggering the Immune System</p>
        <p>Furthest along is a melanoma vaccine developed by the team of Dr. Marc K. Wallack, chief of surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla. They took a harmless version of the vaccinia virus, which causes smallpox, and infected melanoma cells with it in the laboratory.</p>
        <p>They then pulverized the membranes of the infected melanoma cells, emerging with a combination of vaccinia particles and melanoma antigens. That mixture is injected into melanoma patients. ''The body knows how to react to viruses very well,'' said Dr. Wallack. ''This vaccine calls attention to melanoma antigens, and therefore the immune system reacts to the melanoma proteins as well as to the viral proteins.''</p>
        <p>In early clinical trials, the scientists tested the vaccine on patients who had melanoma that had spread to their lymph nodes, which put them at great risk for a recurrence of the disease after surgery. The researchers found that there was an improvement in those who received the vaccine. For example, in a group of patients with melanoma that has already spread to a lymph node, about half would be expected to remain free of melanoma for two years after surgery. With the vaccine, almost 80 percent of the patients survived two years without a recurrence.</p>
        <p>The Florida researchers now are in the midst of a large, three-year clinical trial involving six institutions and, eventually, 210 melanoma patients. They plan to use the results to improve their vaccine, with the hope that someday they can inoculate people who are at high risk of contracting melanoma before they get the tumor. At least half a dozen other anti-melanoma vaccines also are being developed.</p>
        <p>Hormones and Gene Therapy</p>
        <p>Another immunological approach that is being tested against melanoma is the use of hormones like interleukin-2 and interferon, which work in the body to stimulate proliferation of immune cells. Most of these methods were developed by Dr. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute. He and his researchers have found that about 20 percent of patients with advanced melanoma who receive steady infusions of either interleukin-2 or interferon have notable regression of their tumors for anywhere from several months to over five years.</p>
        <p>Interleukin-2 is now being used against melanoma at 38 institutions nationwide, and new studies are under way to determine if a combination of interleukin and interferon may prove more effective than either alone.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenberg has also submitted a proposal to the National Institutes of Health to attempt treating melanoma with a highly experimental type of gene therapy. Under that scheme, Dr. Rosenberg will isolate from patients a species of white blood cell, known as a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, that he has found is drawn to tumors and somehow is able to degrade them.</p>
        <p>Natural stores of such lymphocytes are not sufficient in patients with advanced melanoma to defeat the cancer, but Dr. Rosenberg plans to grow batches of the isolated cells in culture. To lend the cells extra anti-tumor strength, he plans to insert through recombinant DNA methods a gene that produces tumor necrosis factor, a natural cancer-killing agent. When reinfused into the patient, the high doses of the manipulated lymphocytes should theoretically seek out melanoma tumors, and, with the aid of the necrosis factor encoded within them, destroy the malignancies.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenberg's proposal was submitted last month and must make its way through a long review process, but if it is approved, it will become the first example of gene therapy used to treat human cancer.</p>
        <p>Cellular Wanderlust</p>
        <p>Other researchers study the basic mechanisms of melanoma in an effort to understand its unusual complexities. In several recent studies, scientists have learned that melanoma cells secrete potent enzymes capable of dissolving collagen and other structural proteins in tissue that normally help to hold cells together. That talent may explain why melanoma cells seem to wrest free of a primary tumor mass when the malignancy is much smaller than most tumors that spawn renegade metastases.</p>
        <p>Some scientists trace the ability to secrete enzymes to the early role of melanocytes. They have learned that during the early growth of an embryo, melanocytes move freely up and down the developing fetus, eventually covering the body as part of the skin. ''The normal cell has the ability to invade and travel,'' said Dr. Houghton, ''so melanoma cells may be using this trait that the cells had during early embryogenesis.'' That same built-in cellular wanderlust, he proposes, could explain why melanoma can spread to the lungs, brain, liver, bone and even the heart. Researchers say that if they can use an antibody to block the melanoma enzymes that degrade collagen, they may be able to defeat the cancer before it breaks free.</p>
        <p>An Approach to a Melanoma Vaccine</p>
        <p>Researchers hope to coax the immune system into recognizing melanoma cells as virulent and attacking them.</p>
        <p>Vaccinia virus is used to infect the melanoma cell so that it has both melanoma proteins and vaccinia proteins on its surface. These combination cells are injected into patients to elicit a combined immune response.</p>
