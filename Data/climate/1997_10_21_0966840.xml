        <p>The Energy Department and an engineering company plan to announce on Tuesday that they have produced electricity from gasoline through a new method that yields twice as much useful energy per gallon as a car engine does, and with pollution 90 percent lower.</p>
        <p>The development raises the prospect of an electric car, still quiet, swift and clean, but without the problem of heavy batteries that must be recharged often. Instead, such a car would be refilled with energy in minutes from the pump at the corner gasoline station and get twice the gas mileage of a comparable car with an internal combustion engine.</p>
        <p>''We have a terrific breakthrough here,'' said Federico F. Pena, the Secretary of Energy, in an interview. He said, however, that the technology was not about to go into immediate use. Such cars could be on the road by 2010, Mr. Pena said.</p>
        <p>Other experts not directly involved with the new system praised it as an important technical achievement, although several pointed out that important steps remained before the method could be commercialized.</p>
        <p>The method uses a fuel cell, a device first used by NASA for the Apollo moon program, that makes electric current by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water. Oxygen can be pulled out of air, but hydrogen has always been a problem, because it is expensive to produce and store.</p>
        <p>The new method, developed by Arthur D. Little Inc., with $15 million from the Energy Department and technical aid from a nuclear bomb laboratory, is the first practical way to extract hydrogen efficiently and cleanly from gasoline, which is made of hydrocarbon molecules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pena said that because gasoline is available worldwide, auto makers could produce a new generation of ultra-clean vehicles that would achieve twice the fuel economy, without having to develop a new network of refineries, pipelines, trucks and service stations for a new fuel. That barrier has largely defeated efforts to wean America's 180 million cars from gasoline to methanol, ethanol or compressed natural gas.</p>
        <p>The Chrysler Corporation has already announced that it wants to build a fuel-cell car that runs on gasoline. ''A lot of people thought this was a crazy idea,'' said Christopher E. Borroni-Bird, a fuel-cell expert at Chrysler. ''This shows it is technologically feasible.'' The Exxon Corporation and ARCO are also involved in fuel-cell research.</p>
        <p>Making hydrogen from another chemical is called reforming. Some companies have reformers that process methanol, an easier task from a chemist's point of view because methanol is a simpler fuel than gasoline, but the reformer is too big for cars, and very few filling stations sell methanol. Fuel cells in fixed locations can use natural gas, but that is hard to load on vehicles, too.</p>
        <p>Eugene Smotkin, a professor of chemical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology and an expert on fuel cells, said ''reforming gasoline is quite a feat.''</p>
        <p>''We already have gasoline everywhere,'' he said. ''If you can actually reform gasoline, to give you hydrogen, that would be ideal. The infrastructure is already there.''</p>
        <p>There are other ways to achieve high efficiency with reduced pollution, and the new technology will have to compete with them. Sheila A. Lynch, the executive director of the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium, which backs electric and hybrid cars, pointed out that Toyota announced last week that it would soon sell a hybrid -- an electric car with a small gasoline engine to recharge the batteries -- and that it, too, doubled gasoline mileage. And, she said, a demonstration electric vehicle is scheduled to drive on Thursday from City Hall Plaza in Boston to the New York Academy of Sciences, more than 250 miles, on a single charge.</p>
        <p>The vehicle, the Sunrise, which was built with grants from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Institute for Standards and Technology, is ready for mass manufacturing, according to the builder, the Solectria Corporation of Arlington, Mass.</p>
        <p>The A. D. Little system would be a step forward if it achieveed the efficiencies it claims, Ms. Lynch said, ''but it does not mean we should wait around for many years to see if this technology is commercially viable.''</p>
        <p>A key question for a fuel-cell car is the cost of the fuel cell itself. Auto industry experts say they need a cell that costs $100 to $150 per kilowatt of capacity for such cars to be marketable, but existing models cost about $1,500. In contrast, conventional gasoline engines cost about $35 per horsepower, which works out to $50 a kilowatt. But engineers are confident that mass production will bring down prices.</p>
        <p>The A. D. Little innovation, which was tested earlier this month, mixes oxygen with the gasoline fumes, breaking up the complex hydrocarbon molecules into H2  and carbon monoxide, which is a pollutant.</p>
        <p>If carbon monoxide exceeds about 40 parts per million, it will poison the fuel cell. To prevent such damage the new system includes a device built at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear weapons laboratory, that accepts the gas and adds a second oxygen atom to the carbon monoxide, producing carbon dioxide. Engineers were able to accomplish that difficult step without adding oxygen to the H2 , a step that would rob the fuel cell of its fuel.</p>
        <p>Then the gas, almost pure H2 , goes to a fuel cell, an older technology that has been gradually improved in the last few years. The hydrogen atoms, which consist of one proton and one electron, flow down one side of a permeable membrane. On the other side is oxygen from air. The hydrogen's proton wants to join with the oxygen, to create H2 O, or water, and is drawn through the membrane, but the electron is left behind. With the positively charged proton on one side and the negatively charged electron on the other, the membrane creates an electrical difference that becomes a current.</p>
        <p>As is often the case in science, the membrane was initially developed for an unrelated purpose. Du Pont first manufactured it for making insecticides.</p>
        <p>The testers used one cell from Ballard Power Systems Inc., the Vancouver company that sells buses powered by fuel cells, and another cell from Plug Power of Latham, N.Y., which plans to offer them for home use within two years.</p>
        <p>In 16 hours of tests earlier this month at a Little laboratory in Cambridge, Mass., a processor ran smoothly on gasoline and ethanol, officials said. It produced enough hydrogen for 50 kilowatts, big enough to run a medium-size car. Ethanol can be produced from corn, and the Energy Department hopes it will eventually be the main fuel for such cells. Gasoline might therefore be a transitional step to ethanol, which is completely renewable.</p>
        <p>The system delivers 84 percent of the energy in a gallon of gasoline to the fuel cell, said Jeffrey M. Bently, a vice president of Little, and the fuel cell turns most of that energy into electricity. In contrast, an internal combustion engine loses more than 80 percent of the energy in a gallon, either as heat out the tail pipe or friction in the drive train.</p>
        <p>One use for a fuel-cell system, which Chrysler has been pursuing even in advance of the new development, is to perfect an electric car without a breakthrough in battery design. Such a car might still carry a few batteries, for quick starts and for recapturing energy when a driver brakes the car, but existing battery designs could handle that easily.</p>
        <p>''This blows the doors off any battery-powered electric vehicle,'' Mr. Bently said in a telephone interview. Batteries take hours to charge, he said, but this car could be re-fueled ''with a five minute fill-up anywhere in the free world.''</p>
        <p>A major jump in efficiency could be a big step in fighting global warming, Mr. Pena said. He predicted that third-world countries that hope to add cars by the hundreds of millions in coming decades could move directly to cars powered by fuel cells. ''They can leapfrog us like they did with cell phones,'' he said, referring to countries that skipped the older technology of phones tied to copper wires.</p>
        <p>Even before cars, though, the new system could be used to make electricity for houses, according to the Energy Department and companies involved in the research. Such a system could run on propane or natural gas, two hydrocarbons that are widely available in homes. Plug Power, a joint venture between DTE Edison, which is the parent company of Detroit Edison, and Mechanical Technologies Inc., a 36-year-old technology company in Albany, N.Y., says it will have demonstration units available within a year and units for commercial use in two years. Plug Power says it will install the units in homeowners' basements and sell the electricity at a price below what is paid by about 25 million households.</p>
        <p>The package would be ''roughly the size of a small dishwasher,'' said Gary Mittleman, president and chief executive of Plug Power. ''You won't have to pay a penny for the device,'' he said, but it will have an electric meter on it, charging for power at 8 to 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, depending on the price of hydrocarbon fuel.</p>
