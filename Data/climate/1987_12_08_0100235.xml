        <p>LEAD: IT was 1976, say, or 1977. If you had a personal computer, you were a rarity. It might have been an Altair or an IMSAI, and you had built it yourself from a kit. It couldn't do much of anything, but it was a computer, and its possibilities seemed unlimited.</p>
        <p>IT was 1976, say, or 1977. If you had a personal computer, you were a rarity. It might have been an Altair or an IMSAI, and you had built it yourself from a kit. It couldn't do much of anything, but it was a computer, and its possibilities seemed unlimited.</p>
        <p>Typical of the feelings of the hard-core hackers of the time was the following, from Jim C. Warren Jr.'s preface to a collection of the 1976 issues of Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia: ''The more I see of it, the more I slowly come to believe that the massive information processing power which has traditionally been available only to the rich and powerful in government and large corporations will truly become available to the general public. And I see that as having a tremendous democratizing potential, for most assuredly, information - data and the ability to organize and process it - is power. It is an exciting vision to me.''</p>
        <p>At about the same time, John R. Lees Jr. was asking in Creative Computing magazine: ''Can we have computers for people? Can we use computers to bring about useful social change? Can we reconcile personal computers in this country with the fact that much of the world population will starve to death by the end of this century of technological progress? Are we really doing something useful in terms of the future of this planet, or are we really just playing games?''</p>
        <p>It was a poetic vision, particularly as expressed by Richard Brautigan:</p>
        <p>I like to think (it has to be!) of a cybernetic ecology where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature, returned to our mammal brothers and sisters, and all watched over by machines of loving grace.</p>
        <p>These thoughts are occasioned by an article by David Bunnell, the editor in chief of PC World, in the December issue of his magazine. ''But what of the original vision of the PC?'' he asks. ''That it would set the human race free, that it would equalize opportunity for all races, creeds, minority groups, social classes -even help save endangered species. Desktop democracy for everyone.''</p>
        <p>While there are on-line bulletin boards where people sitting at their personal computers, linked by telephone lines, discuss important social and political questions, far more of these participatory services are devoted to technical matters, juvenile exchanges and games. And as far as equality and freedom are concerned, consider the following:</p>
        <p>* One study found that students in the 12,000 most affluent schools were four times more likely to have access to computers than students in the 12,000 poorest.</p>
        <p>* Twice as many boys as girls have a computer in the home.</p>
        <p>* Many companies count the number of keystrokes their clerical employees make on their PC's.</p>
        <p>* Electronic mail is much easier to intercept than paper mail.</p>
        <p>Where should we be going? As Mr. Bunnell sees it, ''We should be able to hook up and talk to people who are concerned about the same issues as we are, whether nuclear disarmament, environmental conservation like the protection of the ozone layer, American Indians' rights on the reservation.'' Save the Whales should be a bulletin board, he suggests.</p>
        <p>He sees an apt opportunity coming, in a Presidential election year, for establishing at least one modest piece of the dream: a political computer network where people could check on the candidates and their positions and where voters all over the country could exchange views.</p>
        <p>A hitch in this, of course, is that people who own computers and modems and can afford often-hefty on-line charges are not the have-nots of the country. But it is an intriguing idea nonetheless.</p>
        <p>More than 200,000 computer owners use Managing Your Money by Andrew Tobias, a program for budgeting, check writing, tax and insurance planning, portfolio managing and other home-finance uses. A new release, version 4.0, adds a word processor and reflects the changes in the tax law structure. It retails for $219.98 for the I.B.M. PC family and is available from software stores or from MECA Ventures, 355 Riverside Avenue, Westport, Conn. 06880; telephone (203) 226-2400.</p>
