        <p>Detroit's latest automotive brainchild appears to be an updated version of the old family station wagon. The automakers say the new cars are designed to attract drivers who want the space of an S.U.V. plus the handling and looks of a luxury car. As a report in The Times by Danny Hakim makes clear, however, these vehicles will also allow manufacturers to exploit a loophole in the government's outdated fuel economy standards to sell inefficient -- if highly profitable -- cars.</p>
        <p>The Senate had a chance last week to tighten these standards and do something meaningful about global warming and the country's dependence on foreign oil. It surrendered instead to a fear campaign mounted by the companies and the United Automobile Workers. The net result is that industry can continue to devote its energies to gaming the system instead of building cars that could save money, energy and even the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The new ''crossover'' vehicles are the latest products of this system. Whereas traditional station wagons were classified as ordinary cars under federal fuel economy rules, these new vehicles will be classified as light trucks, a category that includes pickup trucks, minivans and S.U.V.'s. Vehicles in the standard passenger car category must meet a fleetwide average of 27.5 miles per gallon; vehicles in the light truck category must meet a less exacting average of 20.7 m.p.g. These new wagons will look less like trucks than the S.U.V.'s do; nevertheless, they will be measured by the same lenient standard, at considerable cost to the environment and even to national security -- though at considerable profit to the automakers, who make most of their money on the gas-guzzlers.</p>
        <p>A bill sponsored by Senators John McCain, John Kerry and Ernest Hollings would have ended this nonsense. Over time it would have eliminated the distinctions between light trucks and passenger cars, meanwhile requiring a gradual increase in average fuel efficiency for all vehicles to 36 m.p.g. by 2016. This was not a radical proposal. A cautious report last year from the National Academy of Sciences suggested that such gains were well within Detroit's technological capacity, even without cutting-edge vehicles like electric/gas hybrid cars. Indeed, the automakers themselves had promised, during a flurry of one-upmanship two years ago, to produce a 25 percent increase in fuel economy without federal prodding. Yet to listen to the unions and manufacturers, you would have thought the bill would bring the entire economy of the Upper Midwest to its knees and squeezed American drivers into dangerous little mini-cars.</p>
        <p>Their victory may be illusory. At the moment, with gas prices low, Detroit can count on the indulgence of consumers who seem unconcerned about fuel efficiency. Yet history suggests that things will change; the oil shocks of the 1970's caught the automakers woefully short of efficient cars. Industry and labor's present intransigence could cost them heavily down the road, especially if the only fuel-efficient cars in the showrooms turn out to be Japanese.</p>
        <p>Another of history's lessons is that Detroit will respond to timely regulation. Though industry lobbyists almost always predict bankruptcy when Congress demands change, the engineers on the shop floor almost always find a cost-effective solution. Unfortunately, apart from one lonely tax credit, the Senate has produced an energy bill with no incentives for innovation and a bias toward waste.</p>
