        <p>As he was running one day, deep into what he calls ''head-talk,'' William H. Hinkle had an environmental epiphany.

        <p>As he was running one day, deep into what he calls ''head-talk,'' William H. Hinkle had an environmental epiphany. He had recently sold his wholesale electronic bond trading company and was voraciously reading about global warming. It was not enough merely to worry about the ice caps melting; he had to act. So he decided to put together a list of 500 well-heeled friends and colleagues and try to make them carbon conscious.</p>
        <p>He wrote a series of six e-mail messages, each a brief presentation of what he believes is the grim reality of global climate change, and how the rich and powerful make things worse with their limousines, jet flights and big homes. He challenged each recipient to read all the messages and send them to others. He then promised to buy a $100 pass from one of three carbon-offset programs in the name of the first 1,000 people who complied.</p>
        <p>''I could have just sent $100,000 directly to the groups, but that would not create leverage,'' said Mr. Hinkle, 53, as he dashed for a train to his home in Summit, N.J. ''My goal is really to get people to look at these three options.''</p>
        <p>His Web site, www.thehcf.org, lists three carbon-offset organizations to which he will send the $100 proxy contributions. The organizations are www.carbonfund.org, which supports renewable energy projects; www.self.org, which supports solar electrification projects in developing countries, reducing the use of dirty diesel and kerosene for lighting; and the Lomakatsi Restoration Project, www.lomakatsi.org, which restores northern forests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinkle said he sent out the first e-mail messages two months ago, and he has already received several hundred messages from people who were not on his original list. He has paid about $60,000 so far. ''When you've been lucky like me, that's nothing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He does not check to make sure people have actually read all the e-mail. ''If, in some cases, $100 goes out in the name of somebody who hasn't met my challenge, it's not going to break my leg,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has a second carbon-reducing challenge. He drives a Toyota Prius hybrid and thinks everyone should. So he is willing to give $500 rebates to 20 families anywhere in the nation with annual incomes of less than $80,000 that buy a new fuel-efficient Prius before July 31.</p>
        <p>The former executive, who spent 22 years on Wall Street with Goldman Sachs, might now sound like he is become a raging idealist, but, in fact, he is still hard-nosed and pragmatic. ''I don't expect all this to make a big difference,'' he said. ''But I'd like to be wrong.''</p>
