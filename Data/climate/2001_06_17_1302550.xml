        <p>President Bush and European leaders made little effort to conceal significant differences over global warming, capital punishment and missile defenses as he visited there for the first time since taking office.</p>
        <p>The allies were nearly as unhappy about his plans to abandon the Antiballistic Missile Treaty as Russia has been; Mr. Bush met with President Vladimir V. Putin on Saturday. And Mr. Bush's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases was politely but firmly criticized by European leaders, who said they would move ahead with or without the United States. Before meeting Mr. Putin, Mr. Bush called for letting all the democracies of Europe join the NATO alliance eventually -- including states that once were members of the Warsaw Pact or Soviet republics.</p>
