        <p>LEAD: Energy efficiency in the United States has stopped growing, Government statistics show, ending a powerful trend dating from the energy crisis of the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>Energy efficiency in the United States has stopped growing, Government statistics show, ending a powerful trend dating from the energy crisis of the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>Energy efficiency, a comparison of energy used with the amount of goods and services produced, increased 24 percent between 1976 and 1986, but after the price of oil collapsed in 1986, efficiency stopped growing. It was flat in 1987, and it declined in the first nine months of 1988.</p>
        <p>One reason, analysts say, is that cheap gasoline has rekindled American taste for big cars. And during this period of low prices, all energy users are less inclined to spend money to save fuel. Some shorter-term factors, like severe weather last year and a resurgence of the energy-intensive steel and aluminum industries, also contributed. In addition, Government efforts to deal with the problem were cut back during the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>Experts see little chance for a quick turnaround in efficiency, unless a new shortage occurs or environmental concerns suddenly become more pressing. A Vulnerability to Shortages</p>
        <p>The halt in improving energy efficiency means increased dependence on foreign oil, which is already near an all-time high. This makes the United States more vulnerable to shortages and price increases. The halt also bodes ill for efforts to limit smog, acid rain and the ''greenhouse effect.''</p>
        <p>The change means that the economy is no longer squeezing ever-greater amounts of production from each gallon of oil, ton of coal and cubic foot of natural gas. The shift marks the end of more than a decade of doing more with less. From 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, through 1986, the United States increased its output of goods and services by 40 percent while energy use barely budged.</p>
        <p>Since the collapse of oil prices in 1986, however, energy use has increased slightly faster than gross national product.</p>
        <p>''It's awful,'' said Howard S. Geller, associate director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization. ''We've really stalled out.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said: ''People are not worried about being more efficient now. There isn't a sense of urgency about it, either.</p>
        <p>''People are not worried about a shortage, or anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Even some oil company executives are troubled.</p>
        <p>''I like to drive fast and have a high-powered car, but it's bad public policy,'' Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman of ARCO, said. Mr. Cook said he favors conservation as one component of future energy policy, to assure that the country is secure and solvent. Oil Imports at $40 Billion a Year</p>
        <p>With rising demand for oil and declining United States oil production, oil imports are now virtually equal to domestic production and the import bill is almost $40 billion a year, one-third of the trade deficit.</p>
        <p>By the broadest measure used by the Department of Energy, peak efficiency was reached in 1986 and was maintained in 1987. During the first three quarters of 1988, the most recent period for which figures are available, energy use was slightly less efficient than for 1987 as a whole.</p>
        <p>The Department of Energy calculation integrates all fuels into a single unit, the British thermal unit, or B.T.U., the amount of heat needed to increase the temperature of a pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. Efficiency is the ratio between B.T.U.'s consumed and goods and services produced. Progress Stopped 3 Years Ago</p>
        <p>According to the department, the United States now uses 20.1 B.T.U.'s to produce one dollar of goods and services, a major improvement from the 27.1 B.T.U.'s used in 1973, the year of the first energy crisis. But three years ago, the progress stopped, at 20.0 B.T.U.'s per dollar, according to the department's figures. The figures are adjusted for inflation.</p>
        <p>Experts also say that in the current period of cheap, plentiful imports, improvements in efficiency are unlikely. ''We're victims of the Pearl Harbor syndrome,'' said Elihu Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence, a Washington-based lobbying group. ''We know there could be trouble ahead. We're told there's trouble. We see it, and we don't react.''</p>
        <p>''Then,'' he added, ''when it strikes, we ask for a quick fix, and usually the quick fixes are wrong.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergman's group is supported by utilities, engineering companies, natural gas suppliers, labor unions and other organizations.</p>
        <p>The United States is not the only nation in which the drive toward efficiency has slowed, calculations by Mr. Yergin's group show. But a comparison of efficiency efforts in industrialized countries shows that the United States is not doing as well as most of its major trading partners, raising competitive concerns. Japan, for example, was 44.9 percent more efficient than the United States in 1970. Last year it was 49.1 percent more efficient. Benign Causes and Neglect</p>
        <p>Experts say there are some benign reasons for the shift. The revival of the steel and aluminum industries, brought on by the decline in the value of the dollar, means lower energy efficiency, because it takes more energy to make $1,000 worth of steel than, say, $1,000 worth of computer software. Also, unusually cold weather last winter and hot weather last summer pushed up energy consumption without increasing production.</p>
        <p>Another reason is a cut of about 50 percent during the Reagan years in Government spending to promote efficiency and to develop efficient technologies.</p>
        <p>Amory B. Lovins, a conservation consultant who specializes in electric technologies and utilities, said that some utilities that had been pushing conservation have returned to encouraging consumption to raise their profits. Momentum Lost by Auto Makers</p>
        <p>There are other trends that some experts find more disturbing. One is the loss of momentum in building more efficient cars. New cars are still more efficient than old ones - cars sold in 1974 averaged 14.2 miles a gallon, and last year's cars averaged 28.5, according to the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.</p>
        <p>But nearly all the improvement came before 1986. There was no progress from 1986 to 1987, and from 1987 to last year the gain amounted to a scant three-tenths of a mile per gallon. Each increase of a mile per gallon means a savings of 420,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 2.6 percent of daily oil consumption.</p>
        <p>The auto makers can still manage mileage gains of 2 percent to 3 percent a year through technical improvements, said Floyd E. Allen, the Chrysler Corporation's chief of power train systems engineering. That would mean an addition of five- to eight-tenths of a mile per gallon. Bigger Cars, Bigger Engines</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''superimposed on that are the major shifts in the marketplace, in public tastes.'' The early gains, he said, came from turning 4,000-pound cars into 3,000-pound cars, when ''people were buying very small cars and liking it.'' Now they are buying bigger cars with bigger engines. And they are buying more cars, and cars are being driven more miles.</p>
        <p>Adding to the decline in mileage gains was a decision by the Reagan Administration to relax the mileage improvement schedule set by Congress after the first oil shock, reducing the final goal to 26 miles per gallon from 27.5. Some people who follow the auto industry say that, without Government encouragement, in a few years new cars may get fewer miles per gallon than those being built today.</p>
        <p>''We shot ourselves in the foot in terms of car efficiency,'' Mr. Amory said.</p>
        <p>He cited another factor. By his estimate, increasing the speed limit to 65 miles an hour, from 55, cost about 500,000 barrels of oil a day, another 3 percent of total oil consumption. Decline in Gasoline Prices</p>
        <p>At the moment, however, even for the price-conscious consumer, the trend toward larger engines and heavier cars is rational. Mr. Yergin calculated that when inflation is taken into account, the average price of gasoline last year was 10.3 percent lower than it was in 1970. Gasoline prices peaked in 1981 and have declined by 37.9 percent since then, he said.</p>
        <p>In the residential sector, too, an efficiency plateau is being reached, with houses completed last year showing little efficiency gain over those built in earlier years.</p>
        <p>''The serious threat is that it's really slacked off a lot since 1986,'' said Bion D. Howard, a senior energy analyst at the National Research Center of the National Association of Home Builders, a trade group. He called it ''the gas pump mentality.'' For consumers, he said, the barometer of energy prices is gasoline, and low prices at the pump means low consciousness of other energy prices. Increase in Size of New Homes</p>
        <p>One reason for higher home energy use is size. The home builders association says that new single-family houses averaged about 1,500 square feet in the early 1980's but the figure was 1,755 square feet in 1987 and probably slightly larger in 1988.</p>
        <p>The home builders also say that all the easy steps have been taken in existing homes and in new ones, although conservation advocates dispute this assertion.</p>
        <p>Clearly, however, additional conservation will require new techniques. For example, at the time of the oil embargo, most new homes had 1.5 inches of insulation in a 3.5-inch wall cavity, with an insulation value of R-7. (R-values measure the resistance to heat transfer.) Today, Dr. Robert C. Stroh of the National Research Center said, builders put in more insulation, but ''we still build homes with a 3.5-inch wall cavity.'' The most insulation that will fit in that space, he said, is R-19, which builders are now using; putting in additional insulation means mounting it on the exterior.</p>
        <p>''In the industrial and transportation sector, there is a great deal more room for improvement,'' he said. ''But we jumped to our physical limits immediately.''</p>
        <p>Improvements in heating efficiency in new houses show up more slowly than gains in automobile efficiency, because new cars replace older ones while new houses are usually mostly additions to existing stock.</p>
        <p>Conservation advocates say that far more can be done in more than just home building. They point to new Federal standards for home appliances, due to take effect over the next decade, among other examples.</p>
