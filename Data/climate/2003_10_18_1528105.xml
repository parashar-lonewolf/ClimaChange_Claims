        <p>President Bush's nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Mike Leavitt, finally won committee approval this week, but not before a half-dozen senators had openly expressed exasperation at his habit of retreating behind ecofriendly phrases when asked about his record as Utah's governor. Which means, of course, that Mr. Leavitt will fit right in with the Bush administration. Indeed, Mr. Bush himself may fairly be said to have become the master of the ostensibly ecofriendly sound bite, offering oversimplified solutions to complex environmental problems and wrapping them in tempting slogans that hide their generally pro-business tilt.</p>
        <p>''Healthy Forests,'' for instance, describes an initiative aimed mainly at benefiting the timber industry rather than the communities threatened by fire. ''Freedom Car'' (to be powered by ''Freedom Fuel'') describes a program to develop a hydrogen-fueled car that, while beguiling in the long term, absolves automakers from making the near-term improvements in fuel economy necessary to reduce oil dependence and the threat of global warming.</p>

        <p>President Bush's nominee to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Mike Leavitt, finally won committee approval this week, but not before a half-dozen senators had openly expressed exasperation at his habit of retreating behind ecofriendly phrases when asked about his record as Utah's governor. Which means, of course, that Mr. Leavitt will fit right in with the Bush administration. Indeed, Mr. Bush himself may fairly be said to have become the master of the ostensibly ecofriendly sound bite, offering oversimplified solutions to complex environmental problems and wrapping them in tempting slogans that hide their generally pro-business tilt.</p>
        <p>''Healthy Forests,'' for instance, describes an initiative aimed mainly at benefiting the timber industry rather than the communities threatened by fire. ''Freedom Car'' (to be powered by ''Freedom Fuel'') describes a program to develop a hydrogen-fueled car that, while beguiling in the long term, absolves automakers from making the near-term improvements in fuel economy necessary to reduce oil dependence and the threat of global warming.</p>
        <p>These verbal contortions reached a new plateau a few weeks ago in back-to-back presidential appearances at a power plant in Michigan and in the Rose Garden. Mr. Bush's purpose was to defend his controversial decision in August to rewrite the Clean Air Act in ways that spared power companies the expense of making investments in pollution controls whenever they upgraded their plants and increased emissions. His basic argument was that the old rules thwarted modernization and economic growth, costing American workers their jobs, and that his own initiative -- dubbed ''Clear Skies,'' in the come-hither nomenclature favored by the White House -- would achieve equal results at lower cost.</p>
        <p>It sounded tidy, except for two things. Clear Skies will not, even by E.P.A. estimates, improve air quality as surely and swiftly as the steady application of current law. Second, there is no persuasive evidence that tough environmental laws impede efficiency or economic growth. Quite the contrary. As Mr. Bush himself observed, air pollution has declined steadily in the last 30 years even as the population grew and the economy boomed.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, this happy state of affairs would seem to argue for leaving the clean air laws much as they are, leaving room, of course, for streamlining and simplification. Yet Mr. Bush insists that to protect jobs, only radical surgery will do. It is all very dizzying. The only explanation for what amounts to a willing suspension of history and logic is that American industry, which for 30 years has cried wolf about the costs of major regulatory initiatives -- the phaseout of lead in gasoline, catalytic converters on cars, controls on acid rain -- has at last found a sympathetic ear in the White House.</p>
        <p>It is this reality -- the relationship between Mr. Bush and his corporate underwriters -- that could give his frustrated critics an opening. This week, a group of people responsible for environmental policy in the Clinton administration -- former officials like Carol Browner, Mr. Clinton's chief of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Bruce Babbitt, his secretary of the interior -- announced a campaign to mobilize voters unhappy with Mr. Bush's environmental record.</p>
        <p>One of the points they intend to focus on is the administration's reflexive tendency to interpret the laws in ways that favor private claims over larger public interests. Our own modest hope is that they will also encourage more plain speaking.</p>
