        <p>MOST homeowners have had the experience of standing under a sinfully hot shower only to notice, almost imperceptibly at first and then with chilling rapidity, that the water temperature is changing from hot . . . to warm . . . to lukewarm . . . to cooler . . . to, whoa, I'm out of here!</p>
        <p>Wouldn't it be nice to be able to have all hot water, all the time?</p>
        <p>Well, plumbers and energy efficiency experts say, it is possible. The breakthrough is called ''tankless hot water,'' and while the equipment costs more than a traditional system, it lasts much longer and the operating costs are usually lower.</p>
        <p>''If the person who invented tank-type hot water heaters invented the car, you'd never turn off your engine,'' said Kyle Murray, marketing director for Controlled Energy Corporation, a distributor of tankless hot water heaters in Waitsfield, Vt.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Murray's analogy may be stretched a bit, it illustrates the basic difference between tankless water heaters and those cylindrical gas or electric hot water heating and storage tanks in many homes.</p>
        <p>With a standard tank-type heater, Mr. Murray said, the water in the tank is heated to a preset temperature -- usually 120 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit -- and then kept at that temperature 24 hours a day. Whenever someone in the house uses the hot water, the gas or electric heating element in the tank switches on to heat the cold water replenishing the tank and to bring the temperature of the entire tank back to the desired setting. But the work of a tank-type water heater is not limited to times that the hot-water tap is open, Mr. Murray said. Since even the most efficient hot-water storage tanks lose heat when they are not being used, the heating element works day and night to keep the water in the tank hot and ready for use.</p>
        <p>''Stored water in a tank-type heater loses as much as 20 percent of its heat up the flue if it's a gas-fired system,'' Mr. Murray said, adding that while electric water heaters lose less heat because they do not have a flue, such heaters are typically more expensive to operate than gas units.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray said that most tankless water heaters have copper ''heat exchangers'' through which the water flows as it is being used. Instead of maintaining a preset temperature by switching on and off throughout the day, however, a tankless hot water heater produces heat only when water is flowing.</p>
        <p>He explained that when the hot water tap at a sink or appliance is turned on, the flow of water activates a switch that turns on the heating element. That element -- which can be electric-powered or fueled by natural or propane gas -- then heats the water passing through the heat exchanger for as long as the water continues flowing.</p>
        <p>As a result, with an appropriately sized tankless hot water system, there will be a virtually endless supply of heated water.</p>
        <p>Carsten Ginsburg, president of Empowerco, an alternative energy systems company in Summit, N.Y., said that a gas-powered tankless water heater can be up to 40 percent more energy-efficient than a gas-powered tank-type heater and up to 60 percent more energy-efficient than an electric unit. And while the standard pilot light used on some tankless heaters can reduce the appliance's energy efficiency, newer tankless heaters have either hard-wired or battery-powered electric pilots that produce a spark to ignite the gas when the unit switches on.</p>
        <p>Among the other advantages of tankless hot water heaters, Mr. Ginsberg said, are their longevity; tankless units can operate for 15 to 25 years without requiring service, while tank-type heaters generally have to be replaced every 10 years or so.</p>
        <p>As great as tankless hot water heaters may seem, however, they do have some shortcomings.</p>
        <p>Henry Gifford, president of Gifford Fuel Savings Inc., a Manhattan heating and ventilation design and consulting company, said, for example, that while tankless heaters can indeed supply a seemingly endless amount of hot water, they can only do so if the unit is properly sized for the demand it will be subjected to.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gifford explained that since a tankless heater heats only water passing through it, the ''flow rate'' of the unit is critical. A tankless heater that has a flow rate of, say, 3 gallons per minute should be able to quickly raise the temperature of that amount of water flowing through it from about 50 degrees to 140 degrees and then maintain that temperature for as long as the water continues flowing.</p>
        <p>The problem, however, is that when the flow of water through such a unit is more than 3 gallons per minute, the water is moving too fast to be heated to the desired temperature. So, Mr. Gifford said, if a dishwasher is turned on while a person is taking a shower -- thereby increasing the flow of water through the heater -- there is a possibility that the water temperature to both the dishwasher and the shower head will be lower than desired.</p>
        <p>''You have to make sure that you have a unit that is properly sized for your house,'' Mr. Gifford said.</p>
        <p>Another problem with some older tankless heaters, he said, is that if the flow of water through the unit is low, the heating element has to cycle on and off to prevent the water from becoming too hot. ''That means that water temperature can be terribly inaccurate,'' Mr. Gifford said, offering his own automotive analogy. ''It's like trying to maintain the speed of your car by turning the ignition on and off.''</p>
        <p>He pointed out that newer tankless heating units on the market eliminate that problem by using ''modulating energy input'' technology. With such heaters, instead of turning the heating element on and off to produce the desired temperature, the unit instead increases or decreases energy to the heating element to maintain a constant temperature no matter how much water is flowing through the unit.</p>
        <p>Another problem with tankless heaters, Mr. Gifford said, is that they typically require a larger vent hole than the tank-type heaters they often replace. As a result, he said, to install such a unit the vent must be enlarged from the standard 4 inches in diameter up to 6 inches. Failure to provide a properly sized vent, Mr. Gifford said, can result in dangerous levels of carbon monoxide backing up into the house.</p>
        <p>(Michael Lamb, a certified energy manager for the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse, a service of the United States Department of Energy, said that all tankless and tank-type water heaters sold in this country must be tested for safety and should carry safety labels.)</p>
        <p>Alex Wilson, editor of Environmental Building News, a newsletter published in Brattleboro, Vt., said tankless hot water heaters are typically more energy-efficient than tank-type heaters. The energy factors for most tankless heaters, for example, range from 0.69 to 0.84 (the higher the number, the more efficient the unit) while energy factors for tank-type heaters generally range from 0.49 to 0.68.</p>
        <p>Robert Bellini, a principal of the Varsity Home Service Company, a plumbing and heating contractor in Bohemia, L.I., said that for homeowners who are contemplating replacing an aging tank-type water heater with a tankless unit, the benefits of each have to be weighed against the costs.</p>
        <p>A standard tankless hot water heater for a one-family house, for example, would cost about $1,500 installed. A 40- or 50-gallon replacement tank, on the other hand, would run anywhere from $650 to $1,100 installed. Since the cost to operate the tankless units can be $60 to $100 a year less than a tank-type heater -- with the actual savings depending on the type of fuel used and the efficiency of the heater -- the price differential could be quickly recovered.</p>
