        <p>Energy Department's operating budget for 2000 fiscal year would rise $717 million, or 4.1 percent above 1999, under proposals in Pres Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget; spending for year would be about $17.8 billion (S)</p>

        <p>The Energy Department's operating budget for the 2000 fiscal year would rise $717 million, or 4.1 percent about the 1999 figure, not counting one-time expenditures  this year like buying enriched uranium from Russia and helping that country safeguard plutonium. Spending in 2000 would be $17.8 billion, about the same as what the department is spending this year, including those one-time expenditures.</p>
        <p>The Administration wants to spend $208 million more on renewable energy and energy efficiency, and $138 million for science projects, including supercomputers and a new nuclear laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,  that would use neutrons to investigate the properties of matter. The proposal also includes $109 million for ''threats of nuclear, biological and chemical proliferation,'' and for doubling the counterintelligence effort, because of penetration of the department's laboratories by foreign spies.</p>

        <p>The Administration wants to spend $208 million more on renewable energy and energy efficiency, and $138 million for science projects, including supercomputers and a new nuclear laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tenn.,  that would use neutrons to investigate the properties of matter. The proposal also includes $109 million for ''threats of nuclear, biological and chemical proliferation,'' and for doubling the counterintelligence effort, because of penetration of the department's laboratories by foreign spies.</p>
        <p>Other areas that would get big increases include a testing program for nuclear weapons that substitutes for explosions, and environmental clean-up of former weapons sites.</p>
        <p>The budget also proposes to pay for maintenance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve out of tax revenues, rather than sales from the reserve, and the Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, said he would soon propose some way to add oil. He said that this would not be a ''budgetary initiative'' but did not say how he planned to pay for increasing the reserve, which is at 561 million barrels, roughly two months' worth of imports.</p>
        <p>The budget also calls for $86.5 million, up from $78.5 million, for health studies of workers and people who live near weapons plants. The department is trying to determine, with the Department of Health and Human Services, which sites most merit study.</p>
