        <p>President Bush's grand design for reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism lacks one obvious and critical piece -- a realistic strategy for reducing America's crippling reliance on imported oil, especially petroleum from the Persian Gulf. Reducing our dependence on gulf oil would increase our flexibility in the war on terrorism and in other areas of foreign policy as well. If the Bush administration took the most practical approach and explored new methods of energy conservation, the effort could also yield important technological gains and reduce America's unconscionably large contribution to global warming.</p>
        <p>Right now, the United States uses 25 percent of the world's oil production even though it has only 4 percent of the world's population and 3 percent of its reserves. Two-thirds of world reserves, more than 600 billion barrels, belong to the nations of the Persian Gulf. No matter how many holes are punched on American soil, we simply cannot drill our way to energy independence. The route lies elsewhere.</p>

        <p>President Bush's grand design for reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism lacks one obvious and critical piece -- a realistic strategy for reducing America's crippling reliance on imported oil, especially petroleum from the Persian Gulf. Reducing our dependence on gulf oil would increase our flexibility in the war on terrorism and in other areas of foreign policy as well. If the Bush administration took the most practical approach and explored new methods of energy conservation, the effort could also yield important technological gains and reduce America's unconscionably large contribution to global warming.</p>
        <p>Right now, the United States uses 25 percent of the world's oil production even though it has only 4 percent of the world's population and 3 percent of its reserves. Two-thirds of world reserves, more than 600 billion barrels, belong to the nations of the Persian Gulf. No matter how many holes are punched on American soil, we simply cannot drill our way to energy independence. The route lies elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Buying oil from many different nations would help, up to a point. Compared with its allies, the United States already has an advantage in this regard. The gulf supplies only one-quarter of total imports, or 14 percent of the total consumption of seven billion barrels a year. Hemispheric neighbors like Canada and Mexico supply well over 40 percent, and they could be asked for more. Africa remains an important source, while other potential suppliers are ramping up production. Together, Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have more than 6 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, more than the United States and Canada combined, and exploration in the former Soviet Union is continuing.</p>
        <p>Diversification, though, has its limits. Not only is most of the planet's oil located in the Persian Gulf, but that is where America's allies -- which do not have substantial reserves of their own -- must turn to find the bulk of their imports. That won't change, even if the United States finds alternative sources for itself.</p>
        <p>The surest road to greater energy independence is a disciplined program of energy efficiency, coupled with a major effort to develop renewable non-petroleum sources. This is the road Jimmy Carter started on after the oil shocks of the 1970's, leading to fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks. Yet Mr. Bush continues to put his chips on an alarmingly unbalanced House bill that provides $27 billion in subsidies for traditional energy sources and only $6 billion for conservation.</p>
        <p>Our quarrel is not with Mr. Bush's desire to find more domestic oil. There are untapped resources in areas like the Gulf of Mexico that have long been open for drilling, and, as Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force noted, we may be able to double our reserves by using new technologies in older fields. We could also do far more with Alaska's huge natural gas reserves, which could be pumped southward along the route of the existing trans-Alaska pipeline and used as a substitute for oil.</p>
        <p>Our quarrel, rather, is with Mr. Bush's fixation on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (as well as other ecologically sensitive areas) and with the impression he leaves that we can somehow drill our way out of dependency. Blinded by its ties to the drillers, the administration cannot or will not concede that conservation is the more reliable path to self-sufficiency and that aggressive investments in new technologies can smooth that path. The numbers are clear. Increasing fuel-efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon -- a reasonable expectation, even with existing technology -- would save about 2.5 million barrels a day by 2020. That is about five times what the Arctic refuge is expected to yield and, as it turns out, is roughly the same amount as our present imports from the Persian Gulf.</p>
        <p>Important members of Mr. Bush's own party, like Senator John McCain, are pushing increases in fuel economy. Yet Mr. Bush devoted only one line to conservation in his State of the Union address, and his policy initiatives are modest or mystifying. Recently, for example, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced a program to develop a hydrogen-powered car. Hydrogen may well be the fuel of the future. But Mr. Abraham also took the occasion to downgrade a demonstrably useful program to develop efficient hybrid cars in the near term, in part because it annoyed the automobile industry. Mr. Bush should be using his current political capital to seize all available strategies to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil.</p>
