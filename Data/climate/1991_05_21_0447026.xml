        <p>The Southern California Edison Company and the municipal utility that serves Los Angeles said yesterday that they would cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause climate change, by 20 percent in the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>The companies, the first American utilities to make such a promise, said the reductions would be achieved primarily through improving the efficiency with which electricity is used in lighting, cooling, heating and other uses. Other reductions would come by rebuilding plants that now burn oil and natural gas at low efficiency to burning gas at high efficiency and by buying more power made from wind, solar energy and geothermal heat.</p>

        <p>The Southern California Edison Company and the municipal utility that serves Los Angeles said yesterday that they would cut their emissions of carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause climate change, by 20 percent in the next 20 years.</p>
        <p>The companies, the first American utilities to make such a promise, said the reductions would be achieved primarily through improving the efficiency with which electricity is used in lighting, cooling, heating and other uses. Other reductions would come by rebuilding plants that now burn oil and natural gas at low efficiency to burning gas at high efficiency and by buying more power made from wind, solar energy and geothermal heat.</p>
        <p>Most of the steps would be required anyway, to reduce smog and keep electric rates as low as possible, the companies said. But environmentalists said the announcement showed the potential for utilities around the country to cut the emission of "greenhouse gases" at low cost.</p>
        <p>At the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group based in Washington, Daniel A. Lashof, the group's senior climate scientist, said, "It's something that all utilities could achieve."</p>
        <p>The United States will have to be prominent in any effort to control greenhouse gases, Mr. Lashof said, adding that Southern California Edison, with a population area of 10 million, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, with 3.5 million people in its service territory, now emit more carbon dioxide than Portugal, Ireland or New Zealand emit from all sources.</p>
        <p>The European Community has promised to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions in 2000 at 1990 levels, and some countries, especially Germany, have promised to go further. In international negotiations, the Bush Administration has refused to commit the United States to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which would essentially mean reducing the use of fuel, especially coal.</p>
        <p>The Administration has said, however, that it expects American emissions of all greenhouse gases to stabilize by 2000, as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, are phased out. CFC's are greenhouse gases that also destroy the ozone and that are being eliminated by treaty.</p>
        <p>At the Environmental Protection Agency, Dennis A. Tirpak, director of the global climate change division, said that the ability of utilities to cut their carbon dioxide emissions would differ from company to company, but that the two California companies "certainly would be serving as an example for what other uiltiies might want to look at."</p>
        <p>Southern California Edison, the nation's second-largest utility after the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal company, said that with no action, rapid growth of population and demand in their service areas would cause their emissions of carbon dioxide to grow rapidly.</p>
        <p>Scientists disagree about how fast or how much the climate will change because of the man-made change in the concentration of carbon dixoide and other atmospheric gases. But John E. Bryson, the chairman and chief executive of Southern California Edison, said at a news conference in New York yesterday, "Taking prudent, reasonably economical steps to reduce carbon dioxide is warranted by the current state of knowledge."</p>
        <p>The reductions, he said, were based on a "no regrets policy," meaning that most of the steps made sense for other reasons as well. Encouraging more efficient use of electricity is generally cheaper than building new power plants, he continued.</p>
        <p>And state and local regulations in California will require the companies to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides about 75 percent in coming years, he said. Nitrogen oxides react with other gases in sunlight to form smog.</p>
        <p>But the promise announced yesterday will require the companies to go further than other factors would push them. Vern Pruitt, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, estimated that his department would spend about $12 million a year, entailing rate increases of one-tenth of 1 percent, to pay for the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bryson said that the additional cost for his company would be small, that he was not able to say how much it would be, but that the company would seek a rate increase.  Efforts Already Being Made</p>
        <p>Southern California Edison, a holding of SCEcorp, is already paying bonuses to home builders who construct energy-efficient houses, subsidizing customers who buy energy-efficient fluorescent light bulbs and adding "renewable energy" -- mostly solar, wind or geothermal, produced by small companies. Last month the company, with Texas Instruments Inc., announced a breakthrough in photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity.</p>
        <p>While no American utilities have been ordered to cut carbon dioxide emissions, many expect carbon dioxide to be added to the list of pollutants they must minimize. Mr. Pruitt of the Department of Water and Power said his department would rather cut emissions itself than wait to be told to act.</p>
        <p>"If you wait for the voters to begin a ballot initiative, you've waited too long," he said.</p>
