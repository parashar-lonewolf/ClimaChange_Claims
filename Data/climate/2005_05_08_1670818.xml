        <p>ONE-THIRD of the world's population has no access to electricity  but Phil LaRocco is working on that problem, one watt at a time.</p>
        <p>From a small office here, Mr. LaRocco and the nonprofit company he directs, E+Co., put together money from foundations, governments and investors, and lend it to entrepreneurs in Africa, Asia and Latin America. These local businesses then deliver solar power and other forms of clean energy to the poorest of the poor.</p>
        <p>''Energy is the key to alleviating poverty,'' Mr. LaRocco said bluntly during a recent conversation. ''Without energy to improve your quality of life, to make an income -- and the fact that you spend your time going out to collect wood and water -- you're trapped in a vicious cycle. It's a no-brainer. With energy, many things are possible. Without energy, very little is possible.''</p>
        <p>Specifically: without energy, people in developing countries can't study at night or sew. And without clean energy, they can't cook indoors without polluting the air. ''You don't want to be burning sticks in the house while your 8-month-old infant is sucking in the fumes,'' Mr. LaRocco said.</p>
        <p>Since its creation in 1994, E+Co. has sponsored 120 businesses in 35 countries. These companies now deliver energy to nearly two million people.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRocco could supply the energy needs of a small nation all by himself. A compact man with short gray hair and a close-trimmed gray beard, he is (let's get this out of the way) a dynamo. He speaks knowledgeably and enthusiastically about subjects as diverse as carbon dioxide offsets, the Civil War and wood stoves, and admits that he enjoys teaching children to spray Reddi-wip into their mouths. A gap between his front teeth shows when he laughs, which he does often.</p>
        <p>And his work makes a difference to people in poverty. Dana Younger, a renewable-energy adviser at the World Bank, described an E+Co. business in Honduras that sells solar photovoltaic panels to the rural poor: ''The systems provide relatively small amounts of electricity, four to six hours a day, generally enough to power a radio or a black-and-white television or a fan. A tailor can run a small sewing machine, or have enough lighting to work at night, and to displace a kerosene lantern or candles. This product has had a very direct impact on the lives of a large number of people.''</p>
        <p>Those who have financed E+Co. include the MacArthur Foundation, Nike, the Body Shop, Ted Turner's United Nations Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development. In the future, Mr. LaRocco wants to shift from grant money toward loans from private investors.</p>
        <p>How does he answer investors who ask why they should accept a lower rate of return than they could get elsewhere? ''If you have a choice between investing at 10 percent in a company that causes cancer and 9 percent in a company that cures cancer, which would you choose?''</p>
        <p>Colleagues say he always says exactly what he thinks. ''There were some meetings on clean energy in New York, following the Rio Earth Summit,'' said Mr. Younger, referring to the 1992 summit. ''These U.N. meetings are often couched in obscure, bureaucratic language, and Phil just punctured all that with some very telling examples. He made people sit up and notice that, if anything, these problems are getting bigger, not smaller, and the current approaches are not sufficient to solve the problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRocco explained why he is the way he is: ''I was a blue-collar kid in Brooklyn. My father was a U.P.S. driver. Part of that background is saying what you see.''</p>
        <p>Eric Usher, a clean-energy specialist with the United Nations Environmental Program, admires Mr. LaRocco's ability to bridge cultural gaps. ''He's very effective at connecting with people, from high officials at the World Bank to the Zambian Women's Union,'' Mr. Usher said. ''These are people who are very far from Brooklyn, but he's able to bring them around and motivate them. When he leaves the room, people say, 'O.K., this is on the edge of what we would normally consider, but let's give it a try.'''</p>
        <p>Christine Eibs Singer, who has worked closely with Mr. LaRocco for 20 years, says he has an insatiable appetite for information. ''The International Energy Association recently put out the World Energy Outlook, a 1,200-page book of statistics and forecasts,'' Ms. Singer said. ''Phil devoured it in a weekend.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRocco insists that the future of energy lies with the small entrepreneur. ''For close to 50 years, the whole development community has operated from the top down, with big organizations as the prime movers,'' he said. ''To be fair, an awful lot of homes, millions and millions of homes, have electricity from the centralized approach. But it's reached its limit. While it reaches a vast number of people, it has failed to reach an amazingly large number of people.''</p>
        <p>And large power projects -- oil or natural gas or large hydroelectric dams -- come with harsh consequences for the environment and for the people who live near them. ''Dams often require relocations,'' Mr. LaRocco said. ''And if you burn coal or wood indoors, the air becomes disgusting, causing respiratory illnesses.''</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Younger, traditional financiers would never lend to most of the businesses that E+Co. supports. ''Basically, the companies are viewed as very bad credit risks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even so, with a self-described bean counter in charge, E+Co. has recouped the great majority of its loans. ''We've been very rigorous,'' Mr. LaRocco said. ''We're confident that we can offer investors returns of 3 to 5 percent. We in turn lend that to local entrepreneurs at 8 to 10 percent. The difference is so we can cover the roughly 11 percent that don't repay their loans.''</p>
        <p>A big question remains, though: Can E+Co.'s small-enterprise approach really supply energy to the two billion people who don't have it -- or even make a dent?</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRocco's short answer is that he doesn't expect E+Co. to create the necessary businesses directly. ''The hope is that governments will start doing this on their own. We're trying to create that point in the lever where suddenly everybody says, 'Yeah, this is the way to go.'''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaRocco attended St. Francis College in Brooklyn at night while working as a bank teller. Before forming E+Co., he worked at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 20 years, starting out as a parking lot auditor in Newark and ending up, 12 jobs later, as the director of world trade and economic development. When he left in 1990, lured away by ''an entrepreneurial itch,'' he had a staff of 550 and an annual budget of roughly $750 million, and was responsible for the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>''The biggest change was going from a big office and a big staff to one, two, three people,'' he said. ''We started out with just a fax machine.''</p>
        <p>E+Co. has a staff of 22 worldwide: in Costa Rica, Bolivia, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, the Netherlands -- and Bloomfield, N.J., which Mr. LaRocco calls ''the clean-energy capital of the developing world.''</p>
        <p>After having finished 10 marathons, he reported that his knees still work, but added, ''My hip we won't discuss.'' He lives in nearby Glen Ridge with his wife, Patricia, an accountant, and their teenage daughter.</p>
        <p>The World Energy Outlook (that tome he polished off in a weekend) forecasts that $7 trillion will be spent supplying the growing energy needs of the developing world between now and 2030 -- and that 85 percent of that amount will be spent on fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>''The question isn't one of money,'' Mr. LaRocco said. ''We're going to spend it one way or another. I want to bend that $7 trillion so it's spent in a sustainable manner. If you want people to not invest in a coal plant, you have to give them a viable alternative.''</p>
