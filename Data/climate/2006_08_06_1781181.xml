        <p>To my friends in my adopted city of New York who suffered through a heat wave last week:</p>
        <p>Yes, it was hot, and so muggy that it was like walking the streets while wearing a bodysuit made from greasy, hot pastrami.</p>
        <p>But enough with the complaints.</p>
        <p>I speak as a Texan, where summer can be the most invigorating five months of the year. Temperatures sometimes exceed 110 degrees; I remember taking breaths that seemed to make my lungs crinkle.</p>
        <p>And yet you won't hear Texans -- or Louisianans, or our friends in New Mexico or Arizona, for that matter -- complain about the heat, since they recognize that they don't have a lot of choice in the matter.</p>
        <p>Neither do we.</p>
        <p>Now, I'm not playing down the health risks from heat for many, nor am I denying global warming. Whether you think warming is a natural phenomenon or one accelerated by human activity, no single heat wave or other bit of weather can be directly linked to it. And the most aggressive approach imaginable to reversing it would not have an appreciable impact in the near future. In short, for now, simply, there is this: It was hot last week.</p>
        <p>So listen to Texans about heat, which is something we know on a deep and personal basis, and learn our ways of coping with it:</p>
        <p>1) We sweat. We suffer no embarrassment about this. Deodorant is a wonderful thing. We take cool showers, and frequently.</p>
        <p>2) We use air-conditioning. It's what made the Sunbelt possible, according to the Encyclopedia of Southern Culture. Many Texas malls are so cold they could be used to hang meat.</p>
        <p>3) We drink iced tea, and lots of it. Thirty-two-ounce glasses are common, and 36-ounce glasses are not unknown, though at some point they become hard to lift. And -- this is critical -- refills are free.</p>
        <p>Hey, beer is also good.</p>
        <p>4) We wear light fabrics, and less of them.</p>
        <p>5) Above all, we don't whine about the weather. It's too hot for too long, and whining generates little light, but plenty of heat.</p>
