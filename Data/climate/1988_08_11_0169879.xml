        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The Greenhouse Effect? Real Enough'' (editorial, June 23) recommended, among remedies, cutting ''production of freon, chemicals used as solvents and refrigerants.''</p>
        <p>We are concerned by your use of ''Freon'' as the generic description for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, as they are commonly called. The trademark ''Freon'' is the property of the Du Pont Company and serves as the exclusive designation for fluorocarbon products manufactured by Du Pont. Fluorocarbons are also produced by a number of other companies that use different trademarks. In the case of your editorial, ''chlorofluorocarbons,'' or ''CFC's,'' would have been the proper reference.</p>
        <p>Your recommendation that production of CFC's be cut has been addressed by the international Montreal protocol, which calls for a 50 percent reduction in CFC consumption by mid-1998. Additionally, Du Pont has set as its goal the orderly transition to the total phase-out of production of fully halogenated CFC's by the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>We have also recommended that the protocol's assessment process be initiated to consider limitations on CFC emissions beyond its current provisions, but at a rate consistent with the development of alternatives. We hope that our action stimulates other producers and users to adopt our goal and to work toward an orderly phase-out as well. KATHLEEN H. FORTE, Senior Public Affairs Specialist  E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.  Wilmington, Del., July 20, 1988</p>
