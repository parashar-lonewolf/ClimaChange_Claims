        <p>Almost every Michael Crichton novel has embedded in its clockwork plot machinery a microchip of alarm, intended to start readers fretting about something they hadn't sufficiently worried about before. In his first book, ''The Andromeda Strain,'' Mr. Crichton introduced us to space-borne plagues. In ''Jurassic Park'' and its sequel, ''The Lost World,'' we found out what could happen if genetic engineering ran amok. ''Airframe,'' it seems safe to say, did not swell the ranks of frequent fliers, and ''Timeline'' ought to have made any sensible person think twice about stepping into a quantum teleportation machine.</p>
        <p>''Rising Sun'' raised the specter of a Japanese takeover of the American economy. ''Disclosure'' revised that scenario somewhat to suggest that an even bigger problem might be rapacious female executives. And ''Prey,'' Mr. Crichton's last book, refined that message still further to suggest that an overly ambitious mother who worked outside the home might find herself caught up in nanotechnology research and unwittingly turning the world into goo.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week, Mr. Crichton suggested that we have become a nation of worrywarts. ''There are many groups in contemporary society who find it in their interest to promote fears,'' he said. ''A free society, a free press, has a lot of good features, but giving you an accurate view of the world is not one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crichton himself, of course, is not without blame for this state of affairs. His scary techno-thrillers typically spend lengthy sojourns on the loftiest slopes of the best-seller lists and bounce up there again, in paperback, when they're made into movies</p>
        <p>Mr. Crichton's newest novel, which came out last week, has the classically Crichtonian title ''State of Fear,'' and it's about a subject so menacing that it's surprising he hadn't got to it long before now. This time he has taken on global warming, which provides the book with some cliffhanging action sequences including an ice slide, tidal waves, a flash flood and some SUV-melting lightning strikes -- except they're all engineered, it turns out, by a new kind of fear monger. The villains here are the sinister agents of an environmental group called NERF, reverse eco-terrorists, bent on making us think that the earth is in much worse shape than it actually is. In a review of the book yesterday in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani called the plot ''ludicrous'' and said the characters ''practically come with Post-it notes on their foreheads indicating whether they are good guys or bad guys.''</p>
        <p>Plot aside, the not-so-hidden message of ''State of Fear,'' spelled out in copious footnotes, a lengthy afterword, an appendix and a 20-page bibliography, is an oddly reassuring one for a Crichton book, even if many scientists would disagree with it: there is no such thing as global warming, or not that anyone can prove or predict, and when it comes to climatic change, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself and the compromised and politicized experts who are in the business of purveying it.</p>
        <p>For good measure the book also includes a number of mini-lectures challenging some of the green movement's most cherished beliefs and arguing, for example, that DDT is safe enough to eat, that the giant sequoias are practically junk trees and that the methane emitted by termites is potentially a greater hazard than the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>''For most of my life I have felt burdened by highly publicized fears that decades later did not turn out to be true,'' Mr. Crichton wrote in a recent article for Parade magazine, and the new novel appears in some ways to be a heave of exorcism. Throughout the novel and in the afterword, he takes the opportunity to disparage a number of other widely held fears. Fossil fuel shortage? Not to worry, we'll come up with something. Population explosion? Nope, birthrates are coming down. Cancer from power lines? Please, you've got to be kidding.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crichton, who was in New York last week to promote his new book, could easily be mistaken for one of his own creations. He is himself an example of superior bioengineering: extremely tall (6 feet 7 inches), almost unnaturally youthful looking (62, but you'd never know it), and opinionated about all manner of scientific subjects. (He is also a medical doctor, a successful film director and the creator of a long-running television series.) He speaks slowly, without much inflection, in perfectly outlined paragraphs that frequently begin with a topic sentence and include subsections and analogies.</p>
        <p>Sitting in his hotel room, he had at hand a stack of photocopied graphs and articles, but he seldom needed to refer to them as he patiently explained what he thinks is wrong with the theory of global warming: temperatures have not increased at anything like the rate that was originally predicted, and temperature data are not especially reliable to begin with; back in the 70's we were worried about global cooling. He was particularly dismissive of the various computer models for climate change, saying, ''You have to remember, I come from an experience where you can use a computer to make a photo-realistic dinosaur, and I know that isn't real.''</p>
        <p>He began idly looking at temperature records about three years ago, he explained, and even after he became convinced that climate changes were impossible to predict and the threat of global warming much less than environmentalists were claiming, he resisted writing about it. ''I didn't want the hassle,'' he said, adding that at first he didn't see a way to turn his findings into a novel. ''My message is there isn't a problem,'' he said. ''That's not a very good message -- it's not a smash-bang one.''</p>
        <p>Eventually Mr. Crichton shamed himself into starting ''State of Fear'' -- he ''felt like a coward,'' he admitted -- and his most important breakthrough came when he hit upon the notion of inverting everything and turning the ostensible good guys into bad ones.</p>
        <p>The book's action sequences, he said, were modeled on the old Saturday-morning movie serials, though he added that ''no one in the contemporary world knows what a Saturday-morning serial is.''</p>
        <p>And, indeed, for readers who may not remember how often cannibals figured in Saturday-morning cliffhangers, ''State of Fear'' includes a doozy of a scene in which the heroes are captured and tied to posts by some man-eating Solomon Islanders led by a menacing chief called Sambuca, as in the liqueur. (''Don't ask why this name,'' another character says. ''Him crazy man.'')</p>
        <p>''This book has been the most wrenching experience for me personally -- in terms of what changes it has brought about in my view of the world,'' Mr. Crichton said. He explained that two years ago some armed robbers entered his house in California and held him and his daughter at gunpoint. ''That changed me,'' he said. It taught him ''that there really are events that are going to take place about which you can do nothing -- things that really do happen.''</p>
        <p>''But I think it heightened my attunement,'' he continued. ''I mean, if that was a real fear -- then what about all the other fears that maybe weren't so real?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Crichton also said that in his opinion the message of ''State of Fear'' is cautionary. ''What you're reading may not be right,'' he explained. ''Take it easy, just be careful. Could be overstated, could be not entirely accurate.''</p>
