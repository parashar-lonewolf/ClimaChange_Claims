        <p>HOPE, HUMAN AND WILD True Stories of Living Lightly on the Earth By Bill McKibben 227 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $22.95.</p>
        <p>This new book by Bill McKibben is a kind of sequel to "The End of Nature," which attracted a great deal of attention when it was published six years ago and made Mr. McKibben perhaps the nation's most prominent literary environmentalist. The book's stark concept was that global warming, caused by hydrocarbon consumption, erased nature as something separate from human civilization. Too much carbon dioxide affects all of nature, altering "the most  fundamental phenomena," with consequences likely to be disastrous.</p>
        <p>"Writing that book depressed me," Mr. McKibben declares near the beginning of "Hope, Human and Wild." In his new book, which is "devoted to strategies for retooling our societies and economies so they do less damage," Mr. McKibben tries to improve the mood by providing evidence that we could live more "lightly on the earth" and still be all right. He talks about three places, the Adirondacks where he lives, the city of Curitiba in Brazil and the densely populated state of Kerala in extreme southwestern India. Curitiba and Kerala, he writes, make do with far less than we have, and yet they have not sacrificed health, longevity or the possibility of happiness. They therefore provide the sort of hope and vision that might help us to think more boldly about home.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKibben is certainly not wrong to emphasize the gravity of our ecological situation or to advocate simpler ways of life in which we would use bicycles for transportation, do without bananas (and the environmental cost of shipping them), join rural cooperatives for our fruit and vegetables and begin to think of other economic paradigms besides continuous growth. His new book, which often has the homiletic tone of a Sunday school sermon, is nonetheless disappointing as an environmentalist's prescription for a new future.</p>
        <p>In part this is because Mr. McKibben is not a sophisticated thinker on economic matters. He does not generally take into account the consequences of the measures he proposes. A reduction in the huge North American consumption of  bananas, to take one small example, would increase poverty among South Americans who grow them, yet reconciling ecological needs with basic economic needs is the nub of the issue. Meanwhile, Mr. McKibben's descriptions of places like Curitiba and Kerala are too breathless to provide the inspiration he intends.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. McKibben is much too smart to fall into a simple utopianism as he searches for lessons in these locales. He allows that the communities he has studied, including the American one where he lives, are poor and want to be  less so. But Curitiba and Kerala, he argues, can ease our understandable fear that living with less "would plunge us into a world of poverty, disease, ignorance -- that it's either our life in all its detail or a grim, short, narrow life." Kerala, for example, has achieved life expectancies, infant mortality rates, levels of literacy and an atmosphere of liveliness that rival our own, but on one-seventieth of what we spend per capita. "It gives the lie to the idea that only endless economic growth can produce decent human lives," Mr.  McKibben writes.</p>
        <p>But one month in Brazil and another month in India do not make for great expertise on either place, and one senses that Mr. McKibben's descriptions are both too rosy and too thin. "Romanticizing Kerala is a mistake," Mr. McKibben writes, but he does romanticize Kerala. While Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have gone in for economic growth, "Kerala has been much more interested in sharing what wealth is available," he writes. But Japan et al. have achieved Western standards of living and of cultural and scientific advance. Kerala has a per capita income of $330, and its chief source of hard currency is the tens of thousands of its sons who leave their homes and families to labor in the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. One critic cited by Mr. McKibben calls Kerala "a  bloated social welfare state without the economy to support it."</p>
        <p>And still Mr. McKibben glows with admiration. "If there's a general lesson about socialism provided by Kerala, it's that the government benefits from having to answer to voters," he writes, not explaining why this is a lesson in socialism rather than democracy. Mr. McKibben interviews a Gandhian disciple named Vishwanathan who describes to him "a future as close to the one envisioned by E. F. Schumacher or Thomas Jefferson or Gandhi as is currently imaginable on  this planet." On a per capita income of $330?</p>
        <p>Mr. McKibben surely does us a service in raising the possibility of alternative concepts of the good life, but he often leaves difficult questions unanswered. He disparages the new policies of economic growth in China, but plainly the Chinese people, who were forced to endure three decades of a political philosophy that largely prevented economic growth, want it now. Is there really a Kerala-style alternative? Early on, talking about his home territory, Mr. McKibben describes the regeneration of the Northeastern American  forest, calling it "the great environmental story of the United States -- in some ways, of the whole world." But wasn't this natural regeneration made possible by agribusiness in the Midwest and by the replacement of wood by oil as a primary source of fuel, in short by the sorts of development he deplores? Later, Mr. McKibben speaks approvingly of efforts in the Northeast to revive farming, so the region can be more self-sufficient, even if it means food will be more expensive. But wouldn't such a revival on a scale sufficient for self-sufficiency lead again to the cutting of the forests?</p>
        <p>What we seem to need, especially in light of possible global warming, is a way of making environmental prudence compatible with development to alleviate global poverty and perhaps produce more new technology, like fiber optics, to ease the strain on the earth's natural resources.</p>
        <p>Hard thinking will be required on this, and there are probably few more qualified to do it than Mr. McKibben. He just hasn't done enough of it yet.</p>
