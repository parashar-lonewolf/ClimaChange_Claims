        <p>There is no better snapshot of the brutal political climate facing many Republicans in these final days than this: Senator Rick Santorum, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, stubbornly behind in the polls, warning with anger and growing frustration that voters should not -- must not, for their own good -- reject him for his Democratic opponent, Bob Casey, the state treasurer.</p>

        <p>There is no better snapshot of the brutal political climate facing many Republicans in these final days than this: Senator Rick Santorum, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, stubbornly behind in the polls, warning with anger and growing frustration that voters should not -- must not, for their own good -- reject him for his Democratic opponent, Bob Casey, the state treasurer.</p>
        <p>Assailing Mr. Casey's national security credentials, the Santorum campaign has run a television commercial that shows a mushroom cloud, missiles streaking through the air and the faces of North Korean, Iranian and terrorist leaders. It concludes, ''We just can't take a chance on Bob Casey.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santorum began the final stretch of his campaign with a series of speeches on ''The Gathering Storm,'' offering a dark, Churchillian vision of the threats facing the United States -- like the threats, he said, that faced England in the years leading up to World War II.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Santorum all but acknowledges that the national security issues that proved such a fundamental strength for the Republicans in 2002 and 2004 are far riskier for his party this year.</p>
        <p>''People ask me, 'Why are you giving a major foreign-policy address two weeks before your election? Don't you realize this war is not popular?' '' he said Friday. But he plowed forward, to an audience of about 75 in a Holiday Inn in the western Pennsylvania city of Johnstown, one of several stops on his tour.</p>
        <p>The political world has changed fundamentally for Mr. Santorum, who rode an anti-establishment wave into the Senate in 1994 but is now at risk of being swept out of office by a very different wave. He has spent millions, campaigned hard, attacked his Democratic opponent on every imaginable front, closing with what Democrats assert is ''a campaign of fear and smear.'' But Mr. Santorum has remained consistently behind in the public polls.</p>
        <p>He speaks of Mr. Casey with barely disguised disdain, as if he cannot imagine the possibility of losing to the Democrat who, he asserts, ''is simply reading from the bullet points of Howard Dean.''</p>
        <p>[The latest Philadelphia Inquirer/Temple University poll, published Sunday, showed Mr. Santorum at 38 percent, 16 points behind Mr. Casey. Other polls have shown smaller leads for the Democrat, but G. Terry Madonna, who runs the Keystone Poll at Franklin &amp; Marshall College in Lancaster, said, ''The stability in this race is truly remarkable'' in one respect: Mr. Santorum generally comes in at about 40 percent.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Santorum's advisers blame the national climate for his difficulties; in a state like Pennsylvania, which often leans Democratic, the plummeting popularity of President Bush and the Republican-led Congress was bound to hit hard. In fact, several Republican House incumbents are also fighting for their political lives in Pennsylvania this year.</p>
        <p>''Environmentally, this is probably the toughest year I've ever seen,'' said John Brabender, a top Santorum adviser.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Santorum's own personality and political style have also played a role, political strategists and analysts say. Over the past two years, he aggressively intervened in the right-to-die case of Terri Schiavo and jumped into debates on flashpoint issues like the Roman Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal and same-sex marriage. Along with his staunchly conservative voting record, that took a toll, reflected in what polls show as his continued difficulty among moderate suburbanites outside Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a controversy over his residency -- his family lives much of the year in Virginia -- is widely blamed for his sagging support in the polls in western Pennsylvania, where he began his political career. He won a House seat in 1990 with a campaign that lambasted the Democratic incumbent for living in Virginia.</p>
        <p>As he campaigned across western Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum said he ''absolutely'' felt he had time to turn the race around, that voters would, in the end, recognize what he asserted was a clear gap in competence between him and Mr. Casey. Mr. Brabender, who dismissed the public polls, said he believed that the Santorum campaign could be five or six points behind on Election Day and still win through their superior turnout operation.</p>
        <p>Jay Reiff, Mr. Casey's campaign manager, countered, ''First of all, it's not a single-digit race. And secondly, the intensity is not on Santorum's side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santorum opened new lines of attack in recent days, including one over Mr. Casey's management of state pension fund investments.</p>
        <p>But Democrats can taste victory. At a Casey rally at the University of Pittsburgh Friday afternoon, college Democrats roared as Representative Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, declared, ''In 11 days, we're going to change America!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Casey proceeded to give a stump speech aimed squarely at the bread-and-butter issues of the middle class, like affordable health insurance, universal pre-school access, assistance for college tuition, and the general promise of ''a new direction.'' He mocked Mr. Santorum as a rubber stamp for the Bush administration who had defended Mr. Bush and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld instead of asking hard questions about the war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>It was not a dazzling performance, but it was disciplined and firmly on message, and that is another explanation for Mr. Santorum's difficulties. From the beginning of this race, 20 months ago, the Democrats have run a careful, pragmatic campaign. Democratic leaders like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, recruited Mr. Casey to run on the grounds that as an experienced statewide candidate, the son of a popular former governor, he was the strongest candidate the party could field.</p>
        <p>From a strategic standpoint, Mr. Casey's conservatism on social issues -- he opposes abortion rights -- was expected to help the party with more traditional voters. In an interview, Mr. Casey, a Roman Catholic like Mr. Santorum, said he worked hard to signal that he wanted a conversation with ''people of faith.''</p>
        <p>He spoke at Catholic University this fall over the objection of conservatives who did not want him invited there, met with evangelical Christians on global warming and closes his stump speech these days with a reflection that ''your burdens can become your blessings.''</p>
        <p>''Too often Democrats have avoided talking about faith -- the national party has had the perception, and sometimes it's a perception we've fostered or amplified -- that people of faith are not part of a coalition we want to build,'' said Mr. Casey, a soft-spoken man, who often talks about the importance of his service as a Jesuit volunteer in an urban school. ''But you can build bridges.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the polls and the Democratic primary showed that Mr. Casey was holding his party's liberal base, even among those who disagree with him on abortion; opposition to Mr. Santorum proved a powerful unifying force among Democrats. And while the Santorum campaign raised more funds than the Casey campaign, the last fund-raising report showed Mr. Casey held a slim advantage in cash-on-hand for the final stretch.</p>
        <p>Throughout the year, the Santorum campaign accused Mr. Casey of lacking ideas, ducking debates and failing to understand the nuances of foreign policy.</p>
        <p>By the end of the campaign, an extraordinarily long campaign, by Senate standards, the personal animus between the two men was striking.</p>
        <p>In a recent debate in Philadelphia, Mr. Santorum told voters: ''I had to earn this job. It's not a job I inherited because of my last name.''</p>
        <p>Moments later, when reporters pressed Mr. Casey about the possibility of more debates, he shot back: ''We've spent enough time together, the two of us. Let's go meet the voters. I'll see him at the finish line.''</p>
