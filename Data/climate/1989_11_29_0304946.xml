        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Governments Start Preparing for Global Warming Disasters'' (Science Times, Nov. 14) states that a rise in sea level will mean flooding that affects ''coastal areas where about a billion people, a quarter of the world's population, now live.'' In 1974, we had 4 billion humans; in 1987, 5 billion. That would mean only 20 percent, except that a greater proportion of the growing population is gravitating to coastal areas.</p>
        <p>Last May, the United Nations announced its demographers had revised its midseries projections upward from 1984, when a world population of 6.1 billion was expected by the year 2000, with a leveling off at 10 billion for the second half of the 21st century. The newer estimate suggests 6.25 billion in 2000, 8 billion by 2018 (only 30 years away) and a leveling at 14 billion!</p>
        <p>Growth rates are not declining as the United Nations earlier predicted. From an increase of 80 million a year in 1987, the rate will soon reach 100 million a year if this trend is not reversed (The Futurist, May 1989; The Zero Population Growth Reporter, October 1989).</p>
        <p>Although it is difficult to extrapolate globally, next year 75 percent of Americans, more than 180 million people, will live within 50 miles of a coast (''Not Man Apart,'' Friends of the Earth, June 1989). So you may be correct in saying 25 percent worldwide may be affected by flooding. But this will translate to 2 billion, or double the estimate for today.</p>
        <p>What this shows is the need for an all-out attack against births. The culprit is too many people, not only subject to dislocation by coastal flooding but as creators of more greenhouse emissions that exacerbate global warming in the second place. We will have to adapt to warming changes and limit production of greenhouse gases; but for the long-term the pressing emphasis has to be to limit production of people. KARL B. WEBER 3D  Doylestown, Pa., Nov. 16, 1989</p>
