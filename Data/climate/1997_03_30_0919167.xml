        <p>SINCE it is the major office building to go into construction in midtown Manhattan in the 90's, the structure being built at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Broadway could be expected to include a few new technical wrinkles.</p>
        <p>When the project was announced last year, the Durst Organization, which is developing the 48-story, 1.6-million-square-foot building, struck an environmental theme. The building would have energy efficient lighting, special chutes for materials to be recycled and high-tech windows that admit light, but little heat.</p>
        <p>The intention was to develop a building that was pleasant, efficient and easy to work in. The building, which has the address of 4 Times Square, will be named for its first -- and anchor -- tenant, the Conde Nast publishing group, which took 585,000 square feet of space. But the success of the semi-speculative project was insured when Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom, the law firm, agreed to lease 660,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Since then prospective tenants have grown more interested in the area, and developers have been working with renewed vigor trying to put together deals that might involve the three other Times Square office sites. These are on the west side of Seventh Avenue -- between 41st Street and 42d Street, and between 42d Street and 43d Street -- and on the east side between 41st Street and 42d Street. Prudential Insurance, the owner, is trying to sell these sites.</p>
        <p>While attention has focused on potential development, the Dursts, their architects,</p>
        <p>Fox &amp; Fowle, and construction manager, Tishman Construction Corporation, have continued to refine the design of a building that is actually under way.</p>
        <p>If necessary city approvals can be obtained, 4 Times Square could become the first major office building in New York to have photoelectric panels incorporated in the outer wall of the building. The panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, would contribute power to provide lighting for the building and the garish signs that are a requirement for buildings facing Times Square.</p>
        <p>In addition, the design team is working to incorporate fuel cells into the building's power system. Fuel cells convert natural gas into electricity, while emitting only water and carbon dioxide, a gas that is already in the atmosphere. The panels and cells would make the building largely self sufficient in energy, with managers purchasing supplementary power from Consolidated Edison, or another supplier as deregulation proceeds, as needed.</p>
        <p>Energy specialists say that the value of the panels and cells would be twofold: to demonstrate that these techniques have advanced beyond the experimental stage and are now actually usable in buildings, and to give them a showcase in a prominent location.</p>
        <p>''It's a great showcase for real technologies that work,'' said Ashok Gupta, a senior energy economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental  organization based in New York. ''Someone has to lead in introducing new technologies to increase demand. Increased demand attracts new producers and the competition makes the price go down.''</p>
        <p>The plan to incorporate solar panels in the skin of the building came after several other ideas for generating power were considered and discarded, said Robert F. Fox Jr., one of the founding partners in Fox &amp; Fowle. ''We looked at wind power, but there was nothing available that would work now,'' he said. ''Nobody is doing research on using wind power on office buildings.''</p>
        <p>Putting solar panels on the roof was considered as well, but they were costly, took up valuable roof space and had an unacceptable 30-year payback on the investment, he said.</p>
        <p>BUT Daniel J. Kaplan, another partner in the firm, kept looking into the possibilities for solar power and found a place where they could fit -- in the spaces between the top of one row of windows and the bottom of the next row, spaces called spandrels. Since the spandrel panels are needed anyway, the only increase in cost was the difference between a solar panel and a conventional one, or about $10 a square foot.</p>
        <p>Because of the design of the building, spandrel panels are relatively small, only 14,000 square feet of the 600,000-square-foot surface of the building. Still, they are estimated to provide enough power for six or seven suburban homes, or about 1.5 percent of the anticipated interior load at 4 Times Square.</p>
        <p>One reason for the relatively small area for the solar panels is that they were an afterthought. ''If we had known in the beginning, we would have designed in more panels,'' said Bruce S. Fowle, the other founding partner.</p>
        <p>Since the outside walls of a modern office building are not structural and serve mainly to keep the tenants in and wind and rain out, strength was not an issue. The photovoltaic material is deposited on a thin piece of glass that is laminated between two other pieces of glass and installed in the wall.</p>
        <p>The panels will be connected electrically to a device that converts the direct current they produce into the alternating current usable in the building. Mr. Fox said photovoltaic technology is expected to improve over time by converting more of the sunlight falling on them to power.</p>
        <p>''We've designed it so that as the technology evolves, in 10 or 20 years, you could pop out the old panels and install new one to generate more power,'' He said.</p>
        <p>If the panels will be the most visible mark of the design's novel approach to energy, the more significant part will most likely be hidden in the mechanical recesses of the building. The current plan is to install eight (up from three just a few weeks ago) fuel cells, each capable of putting out 200 kilowatts of power an hour.</p>
        <p>If all eight run continuously, as they are intended to do, they would supply 12.8 million kilowatt hours a year, enough to handle 100 percent of the estimated power requirements of the signs or 60 percent of the demand by tenants. ''You do not turn fuel cells on and off, because it takes two hours and a lot of power to get them going,'' Mr. Fox said. ''You just turn them on and let them run for four and a half to five years. And they produce very clean power, which is important for people using computers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said that by using the fuel cells to provide the base electrical demand of the building, the Durst Organization, which manages the buildings it owns, will lower the rates paid to Con Ed for whatever supplemental power it needs. The utility, he said, not unreasonably bases its rates on peak demand -- reached for example on a hot summer afternoon -- since it has to invest in equipment to meet that demand.</p>
        <p>''Using the fuel cells as the base load takes out that peak, so you pay a lot lower rate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fuel cells work at about 96 percent efficiency converting the chemicals of natural gas into energy, but only about half of that is electricity, with the rest coming off as heat, Mr. Kaplan said. But that presents possibilities as well.</p>
        <p>The developers and designers rejected conventional electrically powered chilling equipment in favor of devices that burn natural gas to produce cooled air. ''We are looking into whether we could use the heat from the fuel cells in the air-conditioning equipment to supplement the heat from burning gas,'' Mr. Kaplan said.</p>
        <p>The decision to use heat-driven cooling equipment blocked any chance to use ice storage as a means of reducing electrical power costs. This approach involves using electric chillers at night, when power costs are the lowest, to make ice. The ice is then used during the day to help produce the cool air all large office buildings need year round. ''We looked into ice storage pretty carefully, but it would not quite pay for itself as it worked out,'' Mr. Fowle. He said using heat-based cooling changed the economics. ''It would have worked if the building was all electric,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fowle said the failure to find adequate wind power technology was disappointing, since tall buildings have a natural draft, which can often be felt in elevator shafts. ''There is natural air movement,'' Mr. Fowle said. ''You could design a building to funnel the air to a paddle wheel array to generate power if the technology were more mature.''</p>
