        <p>Here in the heart of one of Europe's most polluted regions, three American utility companies are embarking on a project that environmentalists hope will show the world a new way to reduce the greenhouses gases that are believed to be altering the world's climate.</p>

        <p>Here in the heart of one of Europe's most polluted regions, three American utility companies are embarking on a project that environmentalists hope will show the world a new way to reduce the greenhouses gases that are believed to be altering the world's climate.</p>
        <p>The utilities are to break ground on Monday for a gas-fired power plant to replace a coal-burning plant that has been spewing heat-trapping gases and poisons into the air since it was built in 1980.</p>
        <p>The plant, which will supply heat and hot water to apartments housing about 4,000 people and contribute a small amount of electricity to the local grid, is minuscule by world standards. But scattered across Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are about 80,000 dirty power plants like the one here, and if this experiment is successful, it is likely to be copied.</p>
        <p>"This is the first project of its kind in the world," the United States Energy Secretary, Hazel O'Leary, said at a news conference in Prague. "It's the model. You need one or two successes, and then others will come."</p>
        <p>The project is one of the first concrete results of decisions made at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and a follow-up meeting in Berlin this year.</p>
        <p>At the Berlin meeting, most of the world's countries accepted a new concept called "joint implementation," under which governments and companies can receive credit toward their domestic pollution reduction targets by sponsoring projects abroad.</p>
        <p>"Greenhouse gases don't respect political boundaries," said Roger Dower of the World Resources Institute, an environmental group that will serve as an independent monitor to try to insure that projected reductions in pollution here are achieved. "We're moving into a new era where we not only understand the importance of this issue, but we're also coming up with some creative and promising solutions."</p>
        <p>The announcement of the project came after mounting evidence that global warming is continuing and that pollution is part of the reason.</p>
        <p>Under the accord signed in Rio, industrial nations are seeking to lower their levels of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.</p>
        <p>American officials have concluded that the United States will fall short of that goal, but they have embraced the idea of "joint implementation" as a strategy that could have even greater effect.</p>
        <p>The United States has not yet enacted a law allowing utilities to count their pollution reductions abroad against reductions they would otherwise be expected to achieve at home. But many utility executives predict that such a law may be enacted in the years ahead, and are seeking experience in ways to cut emissions abroad.</p>
        <p>And American utilities are actively seeking markets in the developing world, from which almost all of the future increase in demand for electric power is likely to come.</p>
        <p>The utilities behind the Decin project -- Wisconsin Electric Power Company, a unit of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation; Nipsco Industries of Indiana, and Commonwealth Edison of Illinois, a unit of the Unicom Corporation -- are hoping that their work here will position them for future contracts in the Czech Republic and elsewhere if emissions of pollutants and of gases like carbon dioxide are restricted.</p>
        <p>Decin, a town of 55,000 in northern Bohemia, is in the heart of the "black triangle," a highly polluted region that includes corners of Poland and the former East Germany as well as the Czech Republic. The incidence of respiratory ailments and malignant tumors in Decin is more than 50 percent higher than in the rest of the Czech Republic, and diseases during pregnancy are four times as frequent.</p>
        <p>"These levels would have to qualify us as an environmental disaster area," said Milan Kunc, 29, the Mayor of Decin, who has been a driving force behind the project. "We now see the possibility of confronting this problem, and at the same time contributing to the global environment."</p>
        <p>The new 10.6-megawatt plant in Decin is to cost $7 million to build. The Czech Government is paying most of the cost, with the American utilities putting up $600,000 and the Danish Government contributing a similar sum.</p>
        <p>Gas will come from Russia, through a 10-mile spur that will be built off a pipeline that runs nearby. When it comes on line next September, the new plant will emit 31 percent less greenhouse gas than the old one, Secretary O'Leary said. She said there would also be a 90 percent drop in sulfur dioxide emissions and complete elimination of particulate and coal ash emissions.</p>
        <p>At the old plant, which is still running, mountains of soft lignite coal are piled outside. The coal is carried by a conveyer belt into a blazing furnace. Outside, the air is pungent and faintly nauseating.</p>
        <p>This is one of four such plants in Decin, all of which are to be replaced by gas-fired plants by 2000.</p>
        <p>"Conditions here have gotten a little better since 1990, but we still don't have any healthy children here," said Josef Charouzd, the plant manager.</p>
        <p>"Before 1990, parents didn't allow their children to play outside at all between November and March, because the air was so bad," Mr. Charouzd said. "Both of my own kids have serious asthma. They cough and have seizures. But with the new plant being built, I think we can hope that their children will live in a much cleaner environment.</p>
        <p>"There's only one bad aspect of this project. The new plant will take only 5 people to operate, not 35 like this one. I'm hoping I'll be one of the five."</p>
