        <p>''HOW was Hawaii?'' a woman asked Turk Pipkin, the towering comedian, writer and actor with a new consciousness-raising film to his list of credits.</p>
        <p>''Ah. '' Mr. Pipkin hesitated, realizing that his role as activist could be compromised by recounting the bliss of his vacation. ''Hawaii was good.''</p>
        <p>It was the rare curveball thrown to Mr. Pipkin on a recent night at the Paramount Theater here in his hometown. He was chatting up potential donors before a benefit screening of the film, ''Nobelity,'' in which he -- the writer, director and interviewer -- talks with nine Nobel laureates about the world's most urgent problems.</p>
        <p>Wearing size 14 cowboy boots, jeans, a ''Nobelity'' T-shirt and a Muslim-style skullcap with mirrors representing the eyes of the world, Mr. Pipkin moved through the Classical-Revival theater with the poise of a politician. In fact, with his snow-white hair and 6-foot-7-inch frame, he could have been a larger-than-life George Washington, save for his mustache and mishmash of an outfit.</p>
        <p>So what if ''Nobelity'' was obscured by, among many things, Al Gore's film ''An Inconvenient Truth''?</p>
        <p>''Gore's movie is just so easy to understand what it is,'' Mr. Pipkin said, pausing from a snack-size bag of Fritos garnished with a dollop of venison chili. ''Look, it's global warming. It's real. It's scary. The biggest achievement of 'Nobelity' is we manage to cover all this really depressing stuff -- land mines and nuclear proliferation, pretty deep issues -- and do it without being preachy and depressing.''</p>
        <p>Shortly after the release of ''Nobelity'' on Earth Day in April, two of the laureates died. Chalk up Mr. Pipkin's interviews with them as good timing, or attribute it to his Plimpton-esque instincts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pipkin's résumé is highlighted by gigs as a street performer, a stand-up comic who toured with Rodney Dangerfield and a writer for prime-time television and magazines. He is also the author of nine books, most recently ''The Tao of Willie,'' which he wrote with his buddy Willie Nelson. But he gained celebrity as the narcoleptic boyfriend of Tony Soprano's sister, Janice. ''When I was first doing 'The Sopranos' and my hair was long, I was gold in New York,'' Mr. Pipkin said. ''I couldn't buy a drink or a meal anywhere.''</p>
        <p>In between thanking vendors and conferring with fellow event organizers, Mr. Pipkin drummed up a bit about his career path: ''My view on being a Renaissance man is, I always wonder if that means I'm going to catch bubonic plague and die screaming. There are a lot of downsides to being a Renaissance man.''</p>
        <p>In all seriousness, he added, ''I just do pretty much what I want to do and trust that it will work out.'' That plan includes roles in Mike Judge's upcoming film ''Idiocracy'' and Richard Linklater's ''A Scanner Darkly.'' In the Linklater film, which opened Friday, Mr. Pipkin plays what he called ''a hallucination with 50 eyes.''</p>
        <p>After the screening, Mr. Pipkin retired to the nearby Roaring Fork Bistro and Saloon, where he was greeted by applause from his cohort of friends. He picked up right where he left off -- working the room with affability, a trait Mr. Gore could benefit from in a right-hand man should he consider another presidential run. ''I don't know what I'm sweating for,'' Mr. Pipkin wisecracked to a group in the corner. ''I've already got the job.''</p>
