        <p>Julia Mancuso, a 23-year-old from Squaw Valley, Calif., finished third in the overall standings of the 2006-7 World Cup circuit, the best finish for an American woman since 1984.</p>
        <p>Nicole Hosp of Austria and Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway clinched the women's and men's overall titles Sunday in the final races of a ski season that was often made surreal by record high temperatures in the Alps.</p>
        <p>Svindal said that the biggest obstacle of the winter had been the warmth, which caused numerous race postponements and relocations, and seemed to compromise athlete safety.</p>
        <p>The heat required several organizers to import snow from higher elevations, and even use helicopters to move snow in an unsuccessful effort to save the Hahnenkamm, the celebrated late-January downhill at Kitzb√ºhel, Austria.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a good thing that we had a bad winter because people get their eyes up for global warming,'' Svindal said.</p>
        <p>A big and friendly 24-year-old who rarely crashes and often competes while injured, Svindal could be the face of the sport for another decade, especially now that Hermann Maier, who had his worst season at age 34, is contemplating retirement.</p>
        <p>Switzerland's largest daily newspaper, Blick, suggested Sunday that the key to Svindal's success was romantic affection from Mancuso. Svindal played down the report.</p>
        <p>''I think you shouldn't always believe what you read in Swiss and Austrian newspapers,'' Svindal said. ''But I have to say I've been hanging out with her, and she's a nice girl.''</p>
        <p>After racing in all 36 of the season's races, in 10 countries, as well as in each of five individual events in the world championships in February, Svindal nearly lost the title in the blink of an eye in Sunday's slalom.</p>
        <p>Had he finished just eight-hundredths of a second slower, he would have finished 16th, without enough overall points to hold off the defending champion Benjamin Raich of Austria, who won the race. Raich ended up 13 points behind Svindal.</p>
        <p>Asked if she had provided Svindal with his luck, as the newspaper suggested, Mancuso laughed and said, ''I wish I was a little luckier for myself.''</p>
        <p>Hosp is the eighth Austrian woman to win the overall title. She benefited from the absence of the three-time overall champion Janica Kostelic of Croatia, who sat out the season. Kostelic has had 10 knee operations and her thyroid removed since starting her career.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what she will do next year,'' Hosp said, ''but when she comes back, I think it will be a very big fight again.''</p>
        <p>Most skiers expect normal temperatures to return to the Alps next season, but the chaos of their calendar this season changed many of them to climate-change activists, perhaps none more so than Mancuso.</p>
        <p>''We leave a pretty big carbon footprint as skiers, staying in hotels and flying, but we can also help raise awareness,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Gian Franco Kasper, the president of the International Ski Federation, which has run the tour for 40 years, said, ''In general, it was a lousy season, to be honest.</p>
        <p>''It was lousy if you think about the youngsters who couldn't race or train or even get on snow. It was a big loss for the industry and tourism.''</p>
