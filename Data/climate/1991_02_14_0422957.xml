        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Oil Prices and Profits; What Goes Up . . . " (Op-Ed, Jan. 26), Mark Green, New York City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, asserts that lower gasoline prices could "spur more home building and retail buying, lower overall business costs and hasten the recovery by adding a half point of growth to the gross national product." While cheap oil stimulates economic growth short-term, cheap oil encourages the United States to continue to use energy unwisely.</p>
        <p>Energy complacency causes extra pollution, pays for Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries whims, swells our trade deficit massively and funnels money out of our economy. Raising the taxes on fossil fuels and lowering income or other taxes on modest-income Americans would discourage energy waste and raise our long-term competitiveness.</p>
        <p>If income taxes were a little lower and gas was a little more expensive, it would be profitable for industry to develop new energy technologies. Solar and wind power provide limitless and pollution-free alternatives. Cheap fossil fuels in the United States are the principal reason we lag behind Germany and other countries that are investing far more heavily in the emerging energy technologies that are so critical for future economic growth. THOMAS P. O'BRIEN  Director for Research Horizon Institute for Policy Solutions Charlottesville, Va., Jan. 29, 1991</p>
