        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Liberals, Conservatives and Aid,'' by David Brooks (column, June 26):</p>
        <p>Mr. Brooks makes an important point that we must not discount the role of bad governance, corruption and greed in the misery of millions of Africans.</p>
        <p>Certainly, the development of peace and democracy on that continent is necessary to raise Africans from poverty. Moreover, these are noble goals worth pursuing for their own end.</p>
        <p>But as Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist and author of ''The End of Poverty,'' points out in his book, ''well-governed countries in Africa, such as Ghana, Malawi, Mali and Senegal, failed to prosper.'' Without targeted assistance to address specific problems such as tropical disease, climate change and famine, these ''African success stories'' will continue to falter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sachs is right to fault the Bush administration for failing to live up to global agreements to increase aid to 0.7 percent of G.D.P. This money is sorely needed on the ground, and without this aid no measure of democracy will bring quinine, bed nets, and antiretrovirals to the millions who need them.</p>
