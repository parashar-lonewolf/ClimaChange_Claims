        <p>THE STORY OF WILLIAM MULHOLLAND,  the Irish immigrant and onetime ditch digger who initiated the construction of the vast Los Angeles water system, has the shape of a classical tragedy.</p>
        <p>As superintendent of the Los Angeles Water Department in the early 1900's, he took on the task of bringing water to a city that had used up its only source, the Los Angeles River. Under Mulholland the city secretly bought up the water rights to the Owens River in a valley 230 miles north of the city. The clandestine maneuvering to accumulate land inspired the 1974 movie ''Chinatown,'' a fictional tale of intrigue and corruption surrounding Los Angeles municipal thirst.</p>
        <p>There is deception in the true tale, as told in the first of four shows in ''Cadillac Desert: Water and the Transformation of Nature,'' a series that starts on Channel 13 in New York tonight at 6:30 (it began on some other PBS stations on June 24). But the corruption here is not on Mulholland's part. His goals were simply to bring water to the city. He supervised the construction of an aqueduct -- a pipeline, really -- that brought Owens River water across the Mojave Desert to Los Angeles. For five years, in 110-degree heat, men labored to create an aqueduct that could have crossed Massachusetts twice. Orange groves blossomed in the San Fernando Valley, and palm trees, swimming pools and real estate agents bloomed in the city itself.</p>
        <p>The city's needs and Mulholland's determination together amounted to a tragic flaw. Water promoted growth, and growth increased the demand for water. A second aqueduct was built, sucking the Owens Valley dry and prompting ranchers there to make guerrilla forays to dynamite the aqueduct. Soldiers and police officers had to be brought in to protect it.</p>
        <p>As part of the project, Mulholland built the San Francisquito Dam, which collapsed in 1928, killing 200 people. He was not prosecuted, but the disaster was judged to be his fault. He resigned as superintendent and never recovered personally.</p>
        <p>But Los Angeles continued to water its lawns, fill its pools and flush its toilets. The city drew water from the Colorado River and the Feather River and finally from the streams feeding Mono Lake, a spectacular desert oasis that is a source of life to flocks of migrating birds. With Mono Lake, the expansion was blocked. After the lake fell 40 feet, environmentalists and biologists began to fight the city. In 1988 the city began to return water to Mono Lake.</p>
        <p>The first three episodes of ''Cadillac Desert'' are based on a book of the same title by Marc Reisner, published in 1986, and the fourth on the book ''The Last Oasis,'' by Sandra Postel, published in 1992 and revised this year. In addition to the story of Los Angeles, the series covers the fate of the Colorado River, so regulated and controlled that in most years none of its water reaches the sea, and the transformation of the Central Valley of California into a home of flourishing agribusiness by the creation of a huge waterworks project to tap an aquifer under the valley. The last show, perhaps the most important but the least dramatic, is about conservation of water.</p>
        <p>The series is largely about politics: who needs water, who pays for it, who gets it free, who uses it. The stories it tells are not happy ones. But the series does not slight the accomplishments of the builders of dams and aqueducts; in fact, it seems to display an involuntary awe at projects it largely deplores. There is no longer romance in taming wild rivers, but there was, and the show reflects that. It also reminds the viewer, at a time when thoughts of planet-changing human activity center more on fossil-fuel emissions, global warming and damage to the ozone layer, that with bulldozer and concrete human beings have changed the face of the earth in astonishing ways.</p>
        <p>WHEN THE HOOVER DAM WAS BUILT  in the heart of the Depression on the Colorado River, it was the largest on earth, 726 feet high. It is still compared to the pyramids. But it was soon surpassed. The Grand Coulee Dam, though not as high, stretched 4,290 feet across the Columbia River and created a 150-mile-long lake as its reservoir. It opened in 1942 and for some time was the world's single most powerful source of electricity. Woody Guthrie wrote a song in its praise.</p>
        <p>It is now hard to imagine a folk singer waxing rhapsodic about the control of nature. The price that is paid is too clear, and that is what the series is really about. The Owens Valley dried up. Lake Tulare, the largest lake west of the Mississippi, was drained to irrigate farmland in the Central Valley in California. To remake the planet so people can live in the desert as if they were by the sea, dry land was made wet and wet land dry.</p>
        <p>In this country the move to create vast water projects began to turn with President Carter, but it was still years before the era of huge public water projects stopped and conservation began. For instance, the price of water in the Central Valley was raised by Congress in 1992, with the result that most of the big farms simply left. Los Angeles was forced to look to conservation when its draining of Mono Lake was stopped.</p>
        <p>But elsewhere around the world, the dam building has continued. In China, the Three Gorges Dam, if completed, would be the biggest on the planet, displacing a million people. The United States Bureau of Reclamation, which boasts one of the most Orwellian names ever given to a Federal agency, after having dammed just about every river in the West, decided that enough was enough. It withdrew its technical support for the Chinese project, as did the World Bank. But China is determined to continue with the project.</p>
        <p>And it is not just the face of the planet that is being remade. If there is any doubt of the immensity of human dam-building activity, last year a NASA scientist calculated that 88 major reservoirs in temperate regions worldwide, created by dams built since 1950, had produced a redistribution of the earth's water significant enough to tilt the planet's axis, if ever so slightly, alter its gravitational field and speed up its rotation. The effects are so small as to have no practical effect on people or the environment, but the notion that with bulldozers and concrete, human beings can change how fast the planet spins is shocking to contemplate.</p>
