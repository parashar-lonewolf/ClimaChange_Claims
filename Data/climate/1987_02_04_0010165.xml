        <p>LEAD: Acid rain and the pollutants that cause it are a serious threat to human health, especially to children, representatives of major public health groups told a Congressional panel today.</p>
        <p>Acid rain and the pollutants that cause it are a serious threat to human health, especially to children, representatives of major public health groups told a Congressional panel today.</p>
        <p>Testifying before the Environmental Pollution Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, medical doctors from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Lung Association, the American Public Health Assocation and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City urged that action be taken now to curb acid rain. They said the potential threat to health was too significant to defer protective action until more scientific evidence was accumulated.</p>
        <p>Senator George J. Mitchell, a Maine Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee, said after the hearing that today's testimony was the first strong evidence presented to Congress that acid rain posed a serious health problem for the nation.</p>
        <p>''Until now, the basis for action on acid rain was its adverse effects on water resources and the potential effects on forests,'' the Senator said. ''Now we have independent evidence of its impact on health.'' Pollution Controls Sought</p>
        <p>Senator Mitchell is the author of one of three bills already introduced in the 100th Congress that would impose controls on sources of pollution that cause acid rain.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration opposes such controls, contending that much more has to be learned about the causes and effects of acid rain before imposing a new regulatory program that would cost billions of dollars and perhaps some jobs in the coal industry.</p>
        <p>Acid rain is a term for pollution produced by coal-burning power plants and factories, as well as motor vehicles and other sources, principally oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, that change chemically as the travel through the atmosphere and fall to the earth as acidic rain, snow, mist or dust.</p>
        <p>Acid rain had been found to destroy life in bodies of fresh water in some parts of the country, especially in the Northeast and Canada, and to damage buildings and other man-made structures. It is also believed to be at least a contributor to the decline of forests along the Eastern Seaboard and in Canada. Now, the witnesses testified, there is mounting evidence that acid rain and the pollutants that produce it are harming the health of human beings. Threat to Children Cited</p>
        <p>The witnesses agreed that available studies of human health histories showed that the pollutants linked to acid rain were an important cause of bronchitis and asthma, particularly among children.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas Godar, president-elect of the American Lung Association, said other people whose health was particularly at risk from the oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and from ozone, another pollutant from the same sources, included people over 65, those with asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, pregnant women and people with a history of heart disease.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Narkewicz, president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told the subcommittee: ''The ingredients of acid rain have been shown to adversely affect the respiratory tract and consequently the quality of health for children. They contribute greatly to morbidity and mortality rates.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''The sources of the pollution are being identified. Technology to significantly reduce pollutants has been in operation for many years in Japan. Doesn't it make more sense to eliminate the cause of the health problem, whenever possible, rather than have children suffer?''</p>
        <p>Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, director of the division of environmental and occupational medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, reviewed a series of recent studies on the health effects of acid rain pollution and said that ''all of these data confirm that exposure to current, relatively low levels of air pollution can produce toxic effects on the lungs.''</p>
        <p>In response to a question, Dr. Landrigan said that ''acid rain is probably third after active smoking and passive smoking as a cause of lung disease.''</p>
        <p>Christian Rice, a spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said that ''the agency is cognizant of the health studies cited in today's study,'' and added: ''The national air quality standards established by the E.P.A. are designed to protect against harmful health effects. The agency by law periodically reviews the standards to make sure they achieve that objective.''</p>
