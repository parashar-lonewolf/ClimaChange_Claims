        <p>Early Americans known as the Clovis people left a trail of elegant, fluted arrowheads at campsites far and wide, beginning about 11,200 years ago. These distinctive artifacts have appeared to archeologists to be a thoroughly North American invention, a technology Stone Age hunters developed after they migrated across the Bering land bridge from Asia to the New World.</p>
        <p>Now, after years of searching, archeologists have found the first Clovis-style stone projectile point outside the New World, in Siberia. The discovery could provide important evidence relating to some of the thorny questions about the early colonization of the Americas.</p>
        <p>In a report being published today in the journal Science, archeologists said the spear point, slightly smaller than a house key, was found near the Uptar River about 25 miles north of the Siberian city of Magadan. The site is some 1,200 miles from the Bering Strait.</p>
        <p>During the most recent ice age, sea levels fell sharply and for several centuries dry land connected Asia and Alaska at the strait. There the first people presumably crossed to America at least 12,000 years ago, probably much earlier.</p>
        <p>The discovery was described by Maureen L. King, a doctoral candidate at the University of Washington and a staff archeologist at the Desert Research Institute in Las Vegas, Nev., and Dr. Sergei B. Slobodin, a Russian archeologist in Magadan. Dr. Slobodin began excavating the Uptar site 10 years ago. In examining his collection of artifacts last year, Ms. King noted that one of the stone points resembled the American points, which were named for Clovis, the town in New Mexico where the first specimens were found earlier this century.</p>
        <p>''The implications are immense,'' Ms. King said of the new find. ''This suggests that the technology associated with Paleo-Indians was not confined to the Americas.''</p>
        <p>It could, for example, have had origins in northeast Asia and been brought to the New World. It could have evolved independently in the two regions. Or it could have arisen in the New World and been communicated back to Asia by people who continued to travel back and forth between the two continents.</p>
        <p>''We know that there were many migrations to the New World,'' Ms. King said in an announcement by the University of Washington, ''but before this discovery it appeared that fluting had not crossed the land bridge in either direction.''</p>
        <p>Most of the spear and arrow points in Siberia followed a common pattern, each shaped like a willow leaf. The one fluted point, Ms. King said, is not the most beautiful ''because it lacks the marks of fine workmanship evident in many Clovis points.''</p>
        <p>Fluting involved the removal of a flake or flakes of stone to leave a characteristic channel or groove from the base toward the tip. Archeologists do not necessarily agree with the belief that fluting served simply to make an easier fit in the shaft or with the possibility that it could have been purely esthetic.</p>
        <p>The Siberian fluted point and other artifacts were found beneath a layer of volcanic ash that was dated as 8,300 years old. Radiocarbon dating of wood charcoal at the site produced the same age. The archeologists suggested that the tools could be even older, but other researchers doubted that the fluted point could be older than the fluted weapons prevalent in America 11,200 to 10,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. C. Vance Haynes, an archeologist at the University of Arizona who specializes in studies of the Clovis culture, said the spear point was ''an interesting find'' that defied easy interpretation. He said the dating appeared to be firm, which meant the Siberian fluted point was nearly 2,000 years younger than New World specimens. He found it curious, he said, that only one fluted point showed up among all the other stone weapons.</p>
        <p>''If I had found this point,'' Dr. Haynes said, ''I'd be happy and showing it to my colleagues and saying, what do you make of this?''</p>
        <p>As Ms. King conceded, the discovery is not expected to resolve the debate about when people first migrated to the Americas, but it has raised hopes that digging deeper in Siberia could bring scholars closer to some answers.</p>
