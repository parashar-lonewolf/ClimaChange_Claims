        <p>The Gillette Company is threatening to close the world's largest razor blade plant if Boston bans ozone-depleting chemicals. The City Council is considering outlawing chemicals that when released into the atmosphere deplete the ozone layer protecting the earth from damaging rays from the sun.</p>
        <p>At a hearing on Thursday, Gillette's vice chairman, Joseph E. Mullaney, said that the ban would put the company at a significant competitive disadvantage and that if the bill were adopted, Gillette would close its plant in the South Boston section by January 1992. A statement from the company this morningsoft-pedaled the threat somewhat, saying if the proposed ordinance is approved, Gillette "will make any necessary decisions at that time." Joan Fitzgerald, a Gillette spokeswoman, said the company hoped a compromise wording for the ordinance could be worked out. The Gillette plant employs 3,100 people.</p>
