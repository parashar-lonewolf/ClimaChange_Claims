        <p>LEAD: Viewed from afar, Czech and Hungarian spas seem oddly medicinal places. Government-approved brochures come laced with words like ''acidulous'' and ''anti-inflammatory'' and promise rejuvenated muscles, kidneys, blood and heart.</p>
        <p>Viewed from afar, Czech and Hungarian spas seem oddly medicinal places. Government-approved brochures come laced with words like ''acidulous'' and ''anti-inflammatory'' and promise rejuvenated muscles, kidneys, blood and heart.</p>
        <p>Seen up close, however, in rococo mountain towns above pine-covered valleys stolen right out of some German Romantic painting, these spas appear more affairs of fancy than of medicine, a nostalgic return to what were once required stops on the European Grand Tour. As Goethe, who spent 16 summers in Czech spa towns, wrote his wife from Carlsbad (now Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia), ''I feel as if I'm in some paradise of innocence and spontaneity here.''</p>
        <p>Hungary's more than 150 spas and Czechoslovakia's 37 are built on a bed of volcanic rumblings, geological faults and hundreds of thermal springs. Some have drawn the sickly, come to ''take the waters,'' for more than 2,000 years; most reached their heyday during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when aristocrats, intellectuals and idlers made a point of whiling away at least one month a summer in a spa. Since World War II, rural spas have enjoyed revived clinical and cultural life; during the summer, countryside resorts fill to overflowing with visitors from East and West, those from the east for a three-week or so state-subsidized health-farm romp, those from the West drawn by the Old World pace and low prices.</p>
        <p>In most spas a somewhat clinical atmosphere prevails and guests who express a desire for the full gamut of spa therapies can expect, upon arrival, a medical examination by a licensed doctor. Among the procedures spa doctors may recommend are hydrotherapy, drinking cures, mud packs and steam inhalation. These are invariably accompanied by massages, exercise and special diets. Some spas go so far as to advertise radioactive water and carbon dioxide injections, but these, experts say, should be avoided.</p>
        <p>''I don't know the levels of radioactivity and neither do they,'' said Dr. Gordon M. Martin, director of the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. ''None of these procedures have been medically proven.''</p>
        <p>He did say, however, ''When spas are used for a rest cure or for some help with arthritis and people get into the warm water or get dietary advice, it can help them.'' But, he added, undertake no treatment without consulting your physician.</p>
        <p>Don't try to book a room on your own. Reservations at Czech spas should be made through the Government office in Prague that oversees spas, Balnea, 11 Parizka, 110 01 Prague 1, Czechoslovakia (telephone 232 19 38), or call Cedok, 10 East 40th Street, New York, N.Y. 10016 (212-689-9720) for advice. Cedok does not make spa reservations but will refer callers to agencies that do.</p>
        <p>Reservations at Hungarian spas are handled by the state-affiliated Ibusz Hungarian Travel Bureau, 400 Kelby Street, Suite 1104, Fort Lee, New Jersey, 07024 (201-592-8585) and the Hungarian Hotels Sales Office, 6033 West Century Boulevard, Suite 670, Los Angeles, Calif. 90045 (800-448-4321). In California, call 800-231-8704; in the Los Angeles area: 213-649-5960.</p>
        <p>Most of the hotels listed have their own restaurants, which are patronized by many nonhotel visitors since small spa towns don't have many independent restaurants. Foreign wines are pricey, more than double the price of fine wines from Hungary or the Slovak republic. Hotel rates quoted are for the high season, from May 1 to Oct. 1. Prices drop slightly in spring and fall and are slightly higher in winter. Some prices include full spa treatment. If they do not, a bath can be had for a pittance - under $1 - and full treatment, which includes a checkup, massage, mud packs, sauna and often a dental checkup, usually costs $15 to $20 a day.  Czechoslovakia</p>
        <p>Frantiskovy Lazne (Franzenbad). In the northwestern corner of Czechoslovakia lies what may be the best preserved, and quietest, of the three great Bohemian spas (Marianske Lazne and Karlovy Vary are the other two). Forests keep the air relatively fresh, the better to stroll through the town sipping mineral water from china teapots and gazing at the faded yellow Empire villas, the Greek Doric rotunda and colonnade that shelters the main drinking well, and the house where Beethoven lived. Frantiskovy Lazne's carbonic baths and mud are used to treat gynecological ailments, particularly sterility. The town is near the Soos peat bogs, where gas bubbling up from mud forms tiny mud volcanoes, and it is three miles from the town of Cheb, a treasury of 17th- and 18th-century buildings next to a 12th-century castle. A room for two in the Imperial Hotel during the summer costs $67 a person, including three meals and full spa treatment.  Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad). Twelve springs feed this biggest and most renowned of Czech resorts, folded into the Tepla Valley; among them is the Vridlo, which leaps into the air at a rate of 500 gallons a minute at 160 degrees. While Karlovy Vary has all the attractive buildings and main thoroughfares one would expect of a former imperial and military resort, its real glory lies in its forest walks, all well marked and graded. The waters contain sulfate of soda, carbonate of soda and salt and bubble up from beneath a hard crust of rock. Another popular water - locally distilled Becherovka liqueur - comes from what Czechs call the 13th spring. A room for two at the Grand Hotel Moskva with meals costs $52 a person a night.  Marianske Lazne (Marienbad). An abbot from the nearby Tepla monastery designed this garden city, but it quickly became a secular center as foreign heads of state descended for some convalescent diplomacy for a few weeks a year. Edward VII left the strongest mark on the town, with a now melancholy, stripped-down English church and scattered touches of Edwardian architecture. A room for two at the Hotel Palace Praha costs $52 a person a night.  Teplice V Cechach (Teplice). The oldest spa in Bohemia - it was discovered in 762 by a herdsman and Roman and Celtic coins have since been dug up - Teplice is now billed as the one with the area's most up-to-date physical therapy equipment. This Bohemian town, once the headquarters of the armies allied against Napoleon, contains a Baroque church and remains of a Benedictine convent. The J. Fucik sanitarium is a reconstruction of 11 neo-classical buildings, supplemented by some fairly drab modern wings. The Kamenne Iazne Sanitarium is housed in a yellow Empire building. A room for two at the J. Fucik sanitarium costs $57.50 a person a night, including meals and full spa treatment.  Piestany. About 50 miles from Bratislava on the north shore of the popular boating and kayaking spot Slnava Lake is Slovakia's most famous spa. Spa buildings are among trees on Bath Island. The sulfurous mud has been known since Roman times and was used in the Middle Ages to cure gout and rheumatism. The slopes of the nearby Inovec mountains make for good walks. A room for two at the Thermia Hotel, with meals and full spa treatment, costs $67 a person a night.  HUNGARY  Gellert Hotel in Budapest. Opened in 1918, this hotel on a hill next to the Gellert baths remains gracefully ensconced in the 19th century, its grand domed entrance hall and its rococo facade intact. Many of its 240 rooms offer a view of the Danube; its terrace and indoor restaurants sparkle with crystal, silver and fresh flowers. A room with breakfast costs $136 for two.  Thermal Hotel in Budapest. On Margaret Island filled with flowers, trees and wildlife - it is a sanctuary and conservation park -is the modern Thermal Hotel, with the widest variety of bath and physical therapy treatments in Budapest. Most of the rooms have views of the island, which also contains ruins of a monastery and memorials to leading figures of Hungarian arts and literature. A room with breakfast costs $136 for two.  Budapest Baths. The following baths, described in an article on page 15, are open from 6:30 A.M. to 7 P.M; entry fee under $1. A few more cents will obtain towels, suits, bathing caps and use of a safe-deposit box.</p>
        <p>Szechenyi, 11 Allatkerti Korut, in district XIV; Lukacs, 25-29 Frankel Leo Ut, in district II; Rudas, 9 Dobrentei Ter, in district II; Rac, 8-10 Hadnagy Utca, in district I; Kiraly, 84 Fo Utca, in district II; Ramada Grand Hotel on Margaret Island.  Balatonfured. Protected from the elements by a range of hills, this lively town on the northern shore of Lake Balaton, Central Europe's largest lake, was described in a 19th-century Baedeker as ''a pleasing bath with springs impregnated with carbonic acid, beneficial in female complaints and frequented by the country's aristocracy.'' It still has the best beaches on the lake and hops with bars, dancing and night life. Restaurants come recommended, especially those that serve the lake's catch. A room at the three-star Hotel Annabella, with breakfast and one meal, costs $62 for two.  Heviz. Hungary's best-known spa lies on Heviz, Europe's largest hot-water lake, its nearly 50,000 square yards of water fed continuously by a spring 120 feet deep gushing 82-degree water. The most popular time to take these waters is late autumn, when steam from the lake's surface surrounds the red Indian water lilies lining the shores and a swim counteracts the chill in the air. The Romans apparently favored Heviz; cemeteries have been found in town. The town is only about four miles from the western end of Lake Balaton, with all its resorts and beach towns. A room at the Thermal Hotel Heviz, with breakfast, costs $40 for two.  Sarvar. The Thermal Hotel in this small town 75 miles from Vienna sits in the shadow of the Sarvar Castle, once the home of several Hapsburg-Lorraines and a Bavarian king; between the two buildings is an old royal park and arboretum with 300-year-old trees. The water, rich in sodium, calcium, magnesium and sulfur, bubbles up from a 6,000-foot-deep well, bored in 1964. A room in the Hotel Thermal Sarvar, a modern facility, costs $74 for two, with breakfast.</p>
