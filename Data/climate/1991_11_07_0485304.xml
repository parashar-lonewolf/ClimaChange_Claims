        <p>Western countries, including the United States, are becoming more favorable to the idea of a major international program to protect Amazon forests and jungles, diplomats in Bonn and Washington say.</p>
        <p>For the last several years, the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has been the only leader of a wealthy industrial country who has pressed the cause of rain forest preservation at international summits. As recently as last July, he sought action at the London summit of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, but without notable success.</p>
        <p>There are signs, however, that the United States may soon join the effort. Last month, the State Department sent a cable to Bonn and other capitals signalling new American interest in an ambitious Amazon project supported by Germany that could cost donor countries $1.6 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>The project would create large Amazon reserves in which business would be restricted or banned. The $1.6 billion would be used not only to buy land and protect it, but also to find new, environmentally sound work for ranchers, farmers, prospectors, loggers and others who exploit the Amazon.</p>
        <p>"To our great surprise, we received this memo from the Americans suggesting that they may be interested in taking part in this," said an aide to Chancellor Kohl. "Up to now, they have been very reluctant."</p>
        <p>An official in Washington familiar with the memorandum said copies were sent to the governments of major industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>"The United States is saying that we are going to participate in this project in some way," said the official. "We need a lot of information, because the United States is very conservative when it invests this kind of money abroad.</p>
        <p>"There is a constituency pushing us to be more active, but we are not yet prepared to commit ourselves to one-seventh of $1.6 billion. That's a huge amount of money. What we are doing now is asking questions to people in Brazil, in Germany and in other places." World Bank 'Pledge Session'</p>
        <p>Officials in Bonn and Washington said a World Bank meeting scheduled for December could become a "pledge session" for countries interested in protecting the Amazon. They said that outlines of a new American policy, as well as new views from Britain and others, may emerge there.</p>
        <p>Scientists say the Amazon and other large tropical forests play an important role in keeping the world climate stable. Many believe that destruction of forests has contributed to global warming, a trend that threatens to flood low-lying regions of the world.</p>
        <p>Environmental consciousness has grown sharply in Germany since the 1970's, when the Green Party became a force in national politics.</p>
        <p>Some of Chancellor Kohl's critics in Bonn are skeptical of the depth of his environmental commitment.</p>
        <p>"The trip to Brazil had a lot to do with publicity," said Liesel Hartenstein, an opposition member of Parliament. "He is giving aid to Brazil without requiring that it be administered in cooperation with native peoples, and without asking for land reform in Brazil or an end to tax subsidies for development in the forest. And he is not confronting what German companies are doing to encourage deforestation of the Amazon."</p>
