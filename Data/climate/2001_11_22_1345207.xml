      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Scientists said last month was the warmest October on record, based on an average of surface temperatures around the world. The new high was noteworthy because there had been no El Nino warming in the Pacific Ocean to help raise temperatures, said the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. The average temperature for the month was 58.2 degrees, a degree warmer than the October mean from 1880 to 2000. The findings are consistent with the conclusion of most climatologists that a global warming trend is at least partly caused by releases of heat-trapping gases.</p>
