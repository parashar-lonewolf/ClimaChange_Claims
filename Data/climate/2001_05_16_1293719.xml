        <p>President Bush has endured an outpouring of criticism since repudiating his campaign promise to battle global warming by regulating carbon dioxide. For a way to address the environmental issue without compromising his concerns about energy supply and costs, the president should look to Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>In late April, Governor Jane Swift issued a rule requiring the six major coal- and oil-fired power plants in Massachusetts to meet stringent new air emissions standards by 2008. The standards cover major air pollutants that cause acid rain, smog and soot -- as well as carbon dioxide. Power plants must limit carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equal to 10 percent of what generators have been discharging in the state, but the plants have freedom in how they do it. They can switch fuels, change generating technologies or trade emissions reductions credits with other power plants. Or, significantly, they can invest in ''off system'' reductions, like lowering the output of carbon dioxide from other industries or from trucks and buses, or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees.</p>

        <p>President Bush has endured an outpouring of criticism since repudiating his campaign promise to battle global warming by regulating carbon dioxide. For a way to address the environmental issue without compromising his concerns about energy supply and costs, the president should look to Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>In late April, Governor Jane Swift issued a rule requiring the six major coal- and oil-fired power plants in Massachusetts to meet stringent new air emissions standards by 2008. The standards cover major air pollutants that cause acid rain, smog and soot -- as well as carbon dioxide. Power plants must limit carbon dioxide emissions by an amount equal to 10 percent of what generators have been discharging in the state, but the plants have freedom in how they do it. They can switch fuels, change generating technologies or trade emissions reductions credits with other power plants. Or, significantly, they can invest in ''off system'' reductions, like lowering the output of carbon dioxide from other industries or from trucks and buses, or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees.</p>
        <p>The reductions must be analyzed, measured and verified to ensure that they really occurred and wouldn't have happened anyway.</p>
        <p>The Massachusetts regulations will lead to real carbon dioxide reduction. But they don't mandate reducing the use of coal or making high-cost technical changes all at once, and they won't disrupt the reliability of electrical supplies. Instead, the Massachusetts rule will prompt a private-sector chase for the lowest-cost reductions over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Governor Swift, who has drawn far more attention in the press for being pregnant with twins, has made Massachusetts the first state to put in place broad and deep cuts in air emissions from older plants. Illinois, North Carolina, New York and New Hampshire are trying to find ways to do the same. Nationwide, there are about 500 older coal and oil plants, some built as early as the 1940's, that do not have to meet modern emissions standards. These plants pollute at four to 10 times the rate of even a new coal plant built today, let alone a clean new gas-fired plant or a renewable energy facility like a field of windmills or solar panels. If Governor Swift's rule were applied nationwide, not only would carbon dioxide emissions be reduced, but smog, acid rain, soot and haze originating from power plants would drop by 75 percent.</p>
        <p>By putting requirements on its own plants, Massachusetts has also moved beyond the tired old argument in which the Northeast states say most of their pollution comes from the Midwest, while the Midwest claims that the Northeast is simply promoting power-plant rules to gain an economic edge. Now the burden falls on the Midwest and Congress to follow, promoting wider and more broadly effective clean-air legislation.</p>
