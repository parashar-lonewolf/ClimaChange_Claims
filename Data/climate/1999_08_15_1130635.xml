        <p>WEEKS of searing heat without rainfall have taken a toll. Could this be a phenomenon of global warming and a preview of the decades to come? The answer will be left for the scientists and environmental gurus. The results this summer, have left dead pine trees, wilting forsythia, straw lawns and on and on. Random surveys in the region indicate the severity of the situation, yet there has proved to be some remarkable resilience in the plant world.</p>
        <p>One of the most stalwart plants to come through seemingly unscathed is corydalis. These rather dainty-looking plants have never ceased to bloom, even in areas where there has been little hand watering to help them along. The perky yellow flowers remain.</p>
        <p>Its cousin, bleeding heart, has also performed with little reluctance. Even though its flowering season is long gone, the plants have remained robust and vital all through the adversities of high heat and no water. Possibly this fine clan is telling us something.</p>
        <p>Then there are the marigolds. These bright sunny flowers of the summer season are usually devoured by the slug population. But, so far the slugs seem to have been done in by the high heat and they are a rare sight. As a result all of the marigolds have been performing gloriously. From the short border hugging French marigolds to the giant-sized African marigolds, with their huge, bright flowers, these plants have been true winners. Remember that to keep the show going for the rest of the summer, cut off the faded flowers so seed does not form and the flowering end.</p>
        <p>Of course, hosta seems to go on, no matter what. These large-leaved shade plants prove again and again weather adversity doesn't bother them. Their only enemy appears to be deer, who find these leaves a tasty treat.</p>
        <p>Ornamental grasses seem to be holding their own nicely, too. These handsome additions to larger gardens are proving themselves again and again as worthy landscape features. Their leafy textures also add a dimension of coolness to the scene. Many other plants have earned good grades during this trying summer. In addition to the stalwart marigolds, the sunny and sun-loving zinnias have not been without spectacular merit. The newer hybrids have proved to be noteworthy as the seed trade magicians have been able to breed into the newer stock some remarkable mildew resistance, one of the major zinnia faults at this time of year.</p>
        <p>Even the handsome gray-leaved dusty millers have done extremely well. Their contrasting leaf texture has provided some fine accents. Of course any of the succulent plants such as members of the sedum clans are doing well. So are the ice plants.</p>
        <p>Even though lantanas have been boycotted in some gardens because they attract white flies, where these plants have been selected for tubs and window boxes, lantanas have proved to weather through.</p>
        <p>Praise should also go to melampodium, a distinguished member of the aster family. This bright yellow posy, sometimes called the Blackfoot daisy, continues to prove that it is drought-tolerant. If your nose gets close to the perky plants, you will detect a slight hint of honey. Some of the shrubs have proved to be stalwarts as well. Most of the members of the holly clan have done well. Even tiny seedlings, started in the spring, seem to be holding their own in spite of adverse temperatures. The butterfly bushes have not ceased to attract their namesakes.</p>
        <p>And the butterflies seem to abound around them, in spite of everything. pyracantha or firethorn is also holding its own. A proliferation of berries on these plants this fall will indicate exactly how well they have done this summer.</p>
        <p>Even the rather sensitive mountain laurels seems to be holding their own. And the cotoneasters are holding on, too.</p>
        <p>Fall will be another season to note how well the berries form on these plants. But some of the most treasured shrubs are not coming through this season as well as might be expected. The rhododendron and azalea population has been set back quite a bit, unless wise gardeners have remembered to provide them with adequate water. Any of the thin-leaved shrubs have had a difficult time. Weigela and forsythia have been set back.</p>
        <p>Even a few clethras and spice bushes have not been as strong. Rosebushes have almost stood still and their bloom has been marginal, to some extent.</p>
        <p>Many of the shade trees have already started to drop their leaves as a defense mechanism against lack of water. Also many of the popular bedding plants such as petunia and sweet alyssum have started to form seed, which means the end of their flowering.</p>
        <p>Come fall with cooler weather and, it is hoped, adequate rainfall, much will be set right again.</p>
