        <p>Building a Healthier Tomato</p>
        <p>In recent years there has been much talk, and some action, about reducing commercial agriculture's reliance on chemicals in favor of more environmentally friendly, ''sustainable'' practices. Taking their cue from backyard gardeners, for example, some commercial tomato growers are replacing the ubiquitous black plastic sheeting used to control weeds and conserve heat and moisture with mulch made from plant matter.</p>
        <p>Intuitively, organic mulching seems like a better idea; for one thing, it requires the application of less fertilizer. But as with many alternative agricultural practices, there has been relatively little scientific analysis seeking to understand why it might be better.</p>
        <p>Into this breach comes a team from the United States Agriculture Department's research farm in Beltsville, Md. In a study in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they show the molecular basis by which tomato plants grown with organic mulch lived longer and were more tolerant of disease.</p>
        <p>The researchers compared tomato plants grown in plastic mulch with those grown in a plot that was first sown with a legume, hairy vetch. The vetch was then cut close to the ground, young tomato plants were transplanted into the plot, and the cut vetch was used as mulch.</p>
        <p>The study found that the organically mulched plants had higher levels of expression of numerous genes responsible for the production of proteins involved in carbon and nitrogen utilization and in immune defenses. The researchers suggest that the vetch, as it decomposes, provides a steady stream of carbon and nitrogen to the plant, which affects the hormonal signaling system that regulates the workings of the various genes.</p>
        <p>The Benefits of Smoke</p>
        <p>Plants do not live by carbon and nitrogen alone, of course. Some need smoke, for example, to help their seeds germinate. In the past several decades, research in North America, Australia and Africa has shown that many plant species that repopulate a burned area of forest or brush get a jump start from the fire's smoke.</p>
        <p>Just what it is about smoke that promotes seed germination in species like brushes and grasses has not been known, however, until now. A group of Australian scientists has isolated and identified a seed-starting compound in smoke from burning cellulose, a major component in all plants.</p>
        <p>The compound, described in a paper published online by the journal Science, is one of a class called butenolides. The researchers found that it is active at a wide range of concentrations and is capable of stimulating germination in many species that grow after forest and brush fires.</p>
        <p>Now that it has been isolated, scientists can try to determine how the compound works and how it might be beneficial to agriculture -- by speeding up the germination of certain weed species, for example, when preparing land for cultivation.</p>
        <p>Another Threat to Gorillas</p>
        <p>Conservation groups are expressing alarm about recent land-clearing by illegal settlers in a national park in eastern Congo that is home to much of the world's small population of mountain gorillas.</p>
        <p>Officials with the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Zoological Society of London say that six square miles of the Mikeno section of Virunga National Park near the Ugandan and Rwandan borders was deforested this spring for agriculture as up to 6,000 people moved into the area. Most of the settlers were from Rwanda, the organizations say.</p>
        <p>The Mikeno section and two adjacent parks in Uganda and Rwanda make up what is known as the Virunga Volcanoes area, a small reserve of 165 square miles with a population of 380 mountain gorillas, which are a subspecies of eastern gorillas. About 320 mountain gorillas live in another reserve in Uganda.</p>
        <p>The Virunga Volcanoes area, which was the site of Dian Fossey's long-term study of the gorillas in the 1970's and 80's, had been considered a conservation success story recently, with the announcement in January of a 17 percent increase in the gorilla population in the most recent survey. In all, through habitat protection and other measures, the number of mountain gorillas has increased about 12 percent since 1989. The Virunga Volcanoes area is also the home of the last remaining population of golden monkeys.</p>
        <p>Alvin! Theodore! Take Cover!</p>
        <p>In the recent eco-disaster film ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' as a new ice age rapidly envelops the United States, roughly half the population scurries in panic to warmer climes in Mexico.</p>
        <p>What wimps. They could learn a thing or two from chipmunks.</p>
        <p>A DNA analysis by Kevin C. Rowe of the University of Illinois and colleagues shows that chipmunks rode out the last ice age 18,000 years ago, surviving in refuges near the edge of the great ice sheets that descended as far south as central Illinois.</p>
        <p>The finding, reported today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, defies the prevailing view that most animals fled the ice and cold for warmer, southern regions. According to that view, northern areas were repopulated from the south as the ice receded.</p>
        <p>''We were surprised to find out that they seemed to be colonizing from north to south,'' Mr. Rowe said.</p>
        <p>The researchers analyzed DNA taken from 244 eastern chipmunks in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. The degree of genetic difference among specimens is a measurement of how closely related they are.</p>
        <p>The analysis showed a group of related specimens in the western part of the study area, northwestern Illinois and Wisconsin, with the most ancestral of them from the northern end of that range, indicating that animals from the north had spread to the south.</p>
        <p>During the last ice age, this part of the study area was never covered by the ice sheet. But because of the cold conditions, it had been assumed that the area would have been tundra.</p>
        <p>Other recent studies have shown that oaks and other deciduous trees might have survived in the area. The chipmunk study adds to the evidence that there were sheltered areas near the ice where some species could survive.</p>
        <p>''The general dogma out there is that as the ice sheets came into place, everything moved southward,'' said an author of the paper, Dr. Ken H. Paige, head of the department of animal biology at Illinois. ''Here we find that the chipmunks were in a pocket that was thought to be tundra.''</p>
        <p>And while the chipmunks moved from north to south, the data shows that there were a lot of other movements going on -- ''really complex patterns of movement given that the central United States is pretty flat,'' Dr. Paige said.</p>
        <p>This, in turn, has implications for the current climate situation, he added. As the planet warms up, organisms may not all migrate toward colder areas, as many scientists assume.</p>
        <p>''It's not predictable how organisms will eventually move,'' Dr. Paige said. ''Our study shows things aren't going to be quite as straightforward as the literature says it will be.''</p>
