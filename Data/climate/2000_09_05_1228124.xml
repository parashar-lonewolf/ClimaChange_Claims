        <p>The Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that had endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and seriously flirted with supporting Ralph Nader in the general election, has decided to endorse Vice President Al Gore, officials with the group said.</p>
        <p>The endorsement, which will be announced in Oregon on Tuesday, provides another sign that Mr. Gore is moving swiftly to consolidate his support in the Democratic Party's liberal wing, much of which had balked at supporting him up until just a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Friends of the Earth, considered the most left-leaning of the three national environmental groups that endorse candidates, has in the past sharply criticized Mr. Gore and the Clinton administration on a variety of issues, including their support for fewer restrictions on global trade and their failure to do enough to slow global warming.</p>
        <p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth, said in an interview on Sunday that the organization's political action committee had agonized over whether to support Mr. Nader, the Green Party candidate for president, because he shared their views on trade and many other major issues. By comparison, the group said in a statement, it ''knows the environmental disappointments with Gore.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Blackwelder said the organization concluded that endorsing Mr. Nader would be tantamount to helping to elect Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee. And he said Mr. Gore's environmental positions were far better than those of Mr. Bush, which he asserted would ''plunge us into a dark age'' of environmental policy.</p>
        <p>''We're looking at the reality here,'' he said. ''In the United States, third parties do not get elected to the presidency.''</p>
        <p>In particular, Dr. Blackwelder asserted that Mr. Gore would spend more money on environmental programs, select more environmentally concerned judges for the federal bench and appoint more environmentally conscious administrators to federal agencies than Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Though Friends of the Earth is relatively small and has little money to invest in campaigns, it is potentially influential with liberal voters. Dr. Blackwelder said he and other leaders of his group would be traveling to swing states where Mr. Nader has been running strong, including Oregon, Washington, New Mexico and Michigan, to encourage potential Nader voters to support Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, the two other national environmental groups that publicly support national candidates, have already endorsed Mr. Gore.</p>
