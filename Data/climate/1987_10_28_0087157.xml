        <p>THERE was that time - I think it was about 1972 -when we all said in unison, ''Oh, God, not another cocktail party,'' and stopped, for the most part, giving and going.</p>
        <p>What exactly we objected to is difficult to recall now, but since it occurred at about the same time we started drinking Perrier and eating yogurt, it may have had something to do with liquor and canapes, traditional cocktail party fare. On the other hand, it may also have had to do with a nationwide refusal to become adult; I am speaking of a generation that, approaching its late 40's, still anxiously asks what it is we want to be when we grow up.</p>
        <p>Cocktail parties are the very stuff of grown-up life. Our parents went to cocktail parties and gave them, too -usually two or three times a year; always at Christmas and at least once during the summer, and perhaps one more for a special occasion, an anniversary or a promotion. (I remember my parents, returning from cocktail parties after homecoming games at my father's college. To the children, rushing out to open the car doors, the aroma that tumbled out on the cold night air was magically adult.) If there are parts of the country where the cocktail party never really died, in New York it became a thing of press-agentry, used to promote the latest product or trend. As such, by 1985, the cocktail party had generally become a dull and spiritless affair, bereft of the glamour that once infused it.</p>
        <p>Recently, however, there have been glimmerings of life. The cocktail party is making a comeback. Even gin is back in fashion; the stock market is foundering, and we are all, willy-nilly, growing up at last. Besides, if the future looks as bleak as we've been told in the last week or so, who wants to go to the health club for a workout after work? A cocktail party is so much more fun.</p>
        <p>It need not be a formal affair with invitations and costumed waiters. Like many events, the best cocktail party is often unplanned and spur-of-the-moment: ''Come up for a drink after work. Bring your new boyfriend, and I'll see if my ex-wife will join us.'' Something like that. This works for several reasons, among them the fact that people don't, can't and won't plan ahead these days. And grazing - remember grazing? - is perfect for cocktail parties. For a well-rounded diet, just make sure you include one each of the Basic Four: cheese, Vienna sausages, carrot sticks and crackers.</p>
        <p>Certain things are obligatory for cocktail parties. You must have a martini shaker, for instance; preferably one that was purchased at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch in 1935. You must have an ice bucket with a Princeton or Yale escutcheon. And you absolutely must have a soda siphon, the kind with silver webbing and a holster into which you flip little bombs of carbon dioxide. (If it's not one your parents used before you, no one will know if you don't tell.) It may well be that your guests will drink nothing but Melton Mowbray spring water. But you must have all these objects on display, nonetheless, together with large and dusty bottles of the best (read, most expensive) gin, scotch and bourbon. Vodka, alas, is declasse. And rum, of course, you only drink at the yacht club after the races.</p>
        <p>There are also certain things you must not have, among them colored paper napkins that say, ''Bottoms up.'' You must not have potato chips, unless you call them Saratoga chips and they are freshly made moments before serving by the family cook -who might actually have been hired for the occasion. You also must not have celery sticks stuffed with cream cheese or deviled eggs.</p>
        <p>So what should you serve? You can get very fancy, if you will, with old-fashioned chafing dishes full of creamed things in sauces and little cream puffs stuffed with lobster salad. But the point of a modern-day cocktail party is simplicity above all else, and the house should not feel constrained to produce anything more complex than the finest delicacies the corner deli or takeout shop can supply.</p>
        <p>Expensive cheese, the runnier the better, is always good, especially with fancy English biscuits. (Just remember that no matter how many people you invite, there will always be Muenster cheese left over.) Salami, pepperoni, prosciutto and the like are good choices, very thinly sliced, of course. Likewise, if it comes your way, a salty country ham from some obscure mountain village in North Carolina or Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Olives - black or green, Greek or Italian - should always be served with the pits in so that as the evening grows merrier, your male guests, in a traditional 50's American rite of passage, can drop olive pits down the decolletages of your female guests. (On second thought, perhaps this custom isn't worth reviving.) Actually, at the very best cocktail parties, the ones that begin sometime after sundown and go on and on into the evening, the finest food of all is a pot of something savory on the back of the stove - soup or chili or chowder. Then, as conversation flourishes and grows more brilliant and animated, the invitation that began with ''Come up for a drink . . .'' quickly turns to ''. . . and stay for supper.''</p>
