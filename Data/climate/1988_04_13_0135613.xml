        <p>LEAD: Ending months of speculation, Robert C. Byrd said today that he would step down as Senate majority leader at the end of the year, opening the way for new leadership when the next President takes office in January.</p>
        <p>Ending months of speculation, Robert C. Byrd said today that he would step down as Senate majority leader at the end of the year, opening the way for new leadership when the next President takes office in January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd, a 70-year-old West Virginian, has led Senate Democrats since 1977 and has come under criticism for an old-fashioned leadership style that some senators contend is not suited to the age of television. He was apparently yielding to age, his critics and his desire, as he said today, to use his remaining years in the Senate to help West Virginia.</p>
        <p>The decision, which he announced in a meeting with his colleagues, sets the stage for a wide-open race for the leadership job if the Democrats retain control of the Senate in this year's election. Inouye Among Candidates</p>
        <p>Three Democratic Senators - Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and George J. Mitchell of Maine - each announced as they left the closed meeting that they would run for Mr. Byrd's job.</p>
        <p>The choice between these three men ranges from a member of Mr. Byrd's generation, Mr. Inouye, to a slightly younger leadership in Mr. Bennett and Mr. Mitchell. But no young Democrat, such as Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is 44, has indicated an interest in the job.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Byrd is stepping down as majority leader, he will not leave the Senate, since he is running for re-election this year. Cites Help for Home State</p>
        <p>If he wins as expected, he will take over the chairmanship of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, where he said he would work to get programs for West Virginia. He said the need to help his home state had finally led him to step down.</p>
        <p>While he maintained that he would have retained the majority leader's job if he had sought it again, Mr. Byrd has been under pressure for several years to make way for new leadership. He was challenged for the post in 1984 and again briefly in 1986 and faced the possibility of another challenge this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd has been highly regarded for his mastery of the procedures of the Senate, but he has been criticized for what some senators call a lack of interest in substantive issues and for his performance as a spokesman for the Democrats. He was usually overshadowed by other members of the Senate on issues and by the Speaker of the House as a party leader.</p>
        <p>But in the last two years he has been more agressive, especially in asserting the role of the Senate in foreign policy and arms control.</p>
        <p>Democrats said today that there was no leader in the race to succeed him and that the outcome would be difficult to predict. The vote, which is expected late this year or early in January, is by secret ballot. This makes votes very hard to count, and personal relationships and past favors more important than positions on issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inouye, who is 63 and ranks No. 3 in the current leadership, has a style most like Mr. Byrd's and was the highly active chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra Committee. But his reputation was hurt last year when he quietly put $8 million into a spending bill for educating North African Jews in France. After the program was discovered, he moved to rescind it this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston, 55, is a popular Southerner who is mastering the political give-and-take of the Senate and who efficiently shepherded the omnibus spending bill though the Senate last year. But his close connections to the oil and gas industry could hurt him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell, 54, achieved national prominence with his role in the Iran-contra hearings. He was also chairman of the Senate Democrats' campaign committee when they won the Senate in 1986. He is considered the most articulate and politically aggressive of the three. Some industrial state senators may worry that he might use the job to help push legislation to curb acid rain.</p>
        <p>While the Democratic senators will consider who would be their best leader and spokesman, the declining ''quality of life'' in the Senate is emerging as an equally or even more important issue in their selection. Several Democrats said today that they wanted a leader who would make the Senate run more efficiently by changing some of its cumbersome rules. Freshman senators especially expressed this concern and said they planned to meet as a group will all three candidates.</p>
        <p>''The driving thing now is whether the Senate leadership adopts a new character,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Graham of Florida added, ''In terms of what the freshmen Democrats are talking about, it is more the process and the institution than a spokesman.''</p>
        <p>And Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama said, ''I doubt we Senate Democrats can find a leader that can hold the diverse elements of the party within the Senate together with the same coherence and power as Robert Byrd has done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd made clear today that changing the rules and making the Senate a more efficient and comfortable place to work will not be easy.</p>
        <p>''As far back as you want to go, you will find criticism of the Senate,'' he said. ''It is not meant to be efficient. The problem with the Senate is with ourselves, and to fix it we have to fix ourselves. The rules are hard to change.''</p>
        <p>He said he did not make a final decision until Monday night. He informed his staff this morning. He said the only person who had asked him not to run was his wife of 51 years, Erma.</p>
        <p>In explaining his decision, he said, ''I chose that role which at this point in time will be best for West Virginia, and West Virginians feel the same way about it.''</p>
        <p>When asked if this meant appropriations bills would be ''loaded up'' with projects for his home state, he did not say no. ''I will do my best to see that West Virginia receives the share for which it is eligible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd was first elected as majority leader in 1977 and then as minority leader during the first six years of the Reagan Administration. He regained the majority leadership when the Democrats took back control of the Senate in 1986.</p>
        <p>Besides taking over the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Byrd would become the senior Democratic senator in years of service. If the Democrats retain control of the Senate, he would become the president pro tempore, allowing him to be the presiding officer in the Senate in the absence of the Vice President.</p>
        <p>The combination of these two jobs, along with his legendary knowledge of the rules and precedents that govern the inner workings of the Senate, could still leave him in a very powerful position and possibly make the job of the new majority leader difficult at times.</p>
