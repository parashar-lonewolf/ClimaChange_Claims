        <p>The Bush administration said today that it would raise fuel economy regulations for light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans -- by 1.5 miles a gallon, or about 4.5 percent, by the 2007 model year.</p>
        <p>The administration called the plan, which has been working its way through the regulatory system for several months, one of the biggest fuel economy increases in years. Environmental groups criticized it as a minuscule step at a time when gas consumption is a national security issue.</p>

        <p>The Bush administration said today that it would raise fuel economy regulations for light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans -- by 1.5 miles a gallon, or about 4.5 percent, by the 2007 model year.</p>
        <p>The administration called the plan, which has been working its way through the regulatory system for several months, one of the biggest fuel economy increases in years. Environmental groups criticized it as a minuscule step at a time when gas consumption is a national security issue.</p>
        <p>''The Bush administration is committed to improving vehicle fuel economy while protecting passenger safety and American jobs,'' Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>David Friedman, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the measure's oil savings would be more than offset by a decision to continue credits automakers receive for making cars that can use ethanol.</p>
        <p>Daniel Becker, the top global warming expert at the Sierra Club, said, ''Our troops are risking their lives in the Middle East for a war that is in part about oil, gas prices are skyrocketing, and global warming pollution is more of a problem than ever.''</p>
