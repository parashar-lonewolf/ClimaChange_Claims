        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Senate resolution against committing industrial nations to greenhouse gas reductions unless developing countries have commensurate commitments is sad (news article, July 26). The United States has the potential to cut energy use while saving money with existing efficiency technology. According to the Energy Department, we could cut electricity use alone by as much as 35 percent. Environmental benefits will exceed raw energy savings, because not only global warming but also ozone depletion, acid rain, particulates and many other harmful effects will be reduced as the least economic appliances and equipment are modernized.</p>

        <p>The Senate resolution against committing industrial nations to greenhouse gas reductions unless developing countries have commensurate commitments is sad (news article, July 26). The United States has the potential to cut energy use while saving money with existing efficiency technology. According to the Energy Department, we could cut electricity use alone by as much as 35 percent. Environmental benefits will exceed raw energy savings, because not only global warming but also ozone depletion, acid rain, particulates and many other harmful effects will be reduced as the least economic appliances and equipment are modernized.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, this approach will lead to reduced use of energy-inefficient equipment in developing countries. After all, they are trying to acquire the good things in life that we have, and if we improve our standard of living while reducing energy waste, so will they. Unfortunately, the marketplace we are so proud of doesn't work very well when it comes to energy efficiency.</p>
