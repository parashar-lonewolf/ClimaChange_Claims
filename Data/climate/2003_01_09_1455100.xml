      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Gov George Pataki, in his speech to State Legislature, painted New York's budget crisis as something that has no relation to his own policies, and had 'nerve' to lecture Legislature about need to be 'frank, honest and clear' about budget crisis, when he 'clearly is not'; criticizes Pataki's plan to make cuts in services and use 'irresponsible gimmicks' in effort to alleviate budget troubles; asserts that Pataki is hoping for Federal aid that might not be forthcoming,</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Gov. George Pataki offered a feel-good assessment of the state of the state yesterday when there was little to feel good about. Mr. Pataki painted New York's budget crisis as something that had no relation to his own policies, and suggested that it could be resolved without undue pain to the taxpayers. The governor, a Republican, even had the chutzpah to lecture the Legislature about the need for being ''frank, honest and clear about the scope of the crisis.'' It was a challenge he certainly did not meet with yesterday's speech.</p>
        <p>Sounding more conservative than he did during his re-election campaign, Mr. Pataki made his main pitch for no new taxes. That felt less like a promise than an attempt to make the Legislature find the revenue to bridge a $2 billion deficit in this year's budget and a gap of maybe $10 billion in next year's. The governor's plan is to cut his way out of budget troubles, and to use irresponsible gimmicks like borrowing against anticipated proceeds from the tobacco company settlements. Until this week he was also undoubtedly expecting help from Washington. But President Bush failed to come to the rescue on Tuesday in his speech about the economy.</p>

        <p>Gov. George Pataki offered a feel-good assessment of the state of the state yesterday when there was little to feel good about. Mr. Pataki painted New York's budget crisis as something that had no relation to his own policies, and suggested that it could be resolved without undue pain to the taxpayers. The governor, a Republican, even had the chutzpah to lecture the Legislature about the need for being ''frank, honest and clear about the scope of the crisis.'' It was a challenge he certainly did not meet with yesterday's speech.</p>
        <p>Sounding more conservative than he did during his re-election campaign, Mr. Pataki made his main pitch for no new taxes. That felt less like a promise than an attempt to make the Legislature find the revenue to bridge a $2 billion deficit in this year's budget and a gap of maybe $10 billion in next year's. The governor's plan is to cut his way out of budget troubles, and to use irresponsible gimmicks like borrowing against anticipated proceeds from the tobacco company settlements. Until this week he was also undoubtedly expecting help from Washington. But President Bush failed to come to the rescue on Tuesday in his speech about the economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki notably failed to mention any help for localities that are drowning in costs imposed by the state. Unless they get aid, any taxes he avoids in Albany will show up in the overstressed cities and counties.</p>
        <p>When it came to new initiatives, the governor revived many of his moss-covered favorites, good ideas that are always tucked into the end of this speech and never seem to go anywhere, like campaign finance reform and revamping the Rockefeller drug laws. With the state government broken, his only proposed fix was to promise voters the right to put their own ideas on the ballot through petitioning. This is an attractive-sounding concept that works out to be terrible in reality, as most states saddled with the initiatives have found out.</p>
        <p>To be fair, it would be hard for the governor to come up with many new programs at a time of such financial peril. A promise to push for more renewable energy over the next 10 years was one suggestion that sounded promising. But over all, Mr. Pataki's big thought for the new year seems to be that if he says everything will be fine, that will make it so.</p>
