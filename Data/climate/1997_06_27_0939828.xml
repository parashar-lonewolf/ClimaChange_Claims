        <p>President Clinton told a special session of the United Nations tonight that if countries ignore the ''real and imminent'' problem of global warming, the earth risks severe drought, floods and the spread of infectious disease.</p>
        <p>But, speaking a day after he sharply tightened pollution limits on soot and smog, Mr. Clinton stopped well short of the commitment to cutting greenhouse gases that allies have been urging. He deferred announcing any such restrictions -- which are  opposed by automobile and oil companies and other heavy industries --  until an international meeting in December in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton went further tonight than he has before in endorsing scientific findings establishing the dangers of pollution.</p>
        <p>''The science is clear and compelling: We humans are changing the global climate,'' he said. ''Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at their highest levels in more than 200,000 years and climbing sharply.'' $(Transcript, page A11.$)</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's speech fit the tone of the conference, which has been attended this week by the heads of state of about 70 nations. The debate over the environment here has been marked by talk of crisis, bitter criticism of international foot-dragging and apocalyptic visions of a stricken planet.</p>
        <p>Warning that unless changes are made, scientists expect the seas to rise by two feet or more in the next century, Mr. Clinton envisioned an America in which ''9,000 square miles of Florida, Louisiana, and other coastal areas will be flooded.'' He spoke of an increase of 50 million or more malaria cases worldwide each year.</p>
        <p>''No nation can escape this danger,'' he said. ''None can evade its responsibility to confront it.'' Mr. Clinton noted that with 4 percent of the world's population, the United States emits 20 percent of its greenhouse gases, which are defined as carbon dioxide emissions generated by anything that burns fossil fuels like oil and coal. ''Here in the United States, we must do better,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But just last weekend at an annual summit meeting of industrialized nations held in Denver, Mr. Clinton fended off demands from the French and Germans that he move immediately to restrict greenhouse emissions.</p>
        <p>Privately, his aides said the Europeans were more interested in posturing for their voters back home than in setting immediate and strict goals that could also prove difficult for them to meet.</p>
        <p>Further, Mr. Clinton faces less pressure domestically on the issue of greenhouse gases than he did over soot and smog. While heat waves, like the one in Chicago that was blamed for more than 400 deaths two years ago, have periodically drawn public attention to the issue of global warming, on a daily basis, parents ferrying their children to baseball practice are more likely to fret about the smog.</p>
        <p>Today, the President said he would take action on greenhouse gases later this year. He said he would ''work with our people and we will bring to the Kyoto conference a strong American commitment to realistic and binding limits that will significantly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases.''</p>
        <p>Within the Administration, Vice President Al Gore has been the house goad over the dangers of greenhouse gases. He is fond of unveiling a chart whose right side unfolds repeatedly upward to display a dramatic red spike depicting the recent global increase in carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>Support from environmentalists --  who were delighted by the Administration's moves against pollution on Wednesday but disappointed tonight -- is considered a key to Mr. Gore's probable Presidential bid. But it is an open question how far the Administration can afford to push energy and auto companies, and the union workers who depend on them.</p>
        <p>Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund, said President Clinton's failure to set specific timetables for reduction of greenhouse gases made ''instant Pablum'' out of his speech, despite the promises of foreign aid and advanced research aimed at controlling climate change.</p>
        <p>But Richard Mott, vice president of the World Wildlife Fund, called the speech ''the strongest statement on climate change by any sitting U.S. President, by a wide margin.'' He said it was very significant that Mr. Clinton had endorsed the scientific consensus that the problem is serious, and had pledged to educate the public and persuade the Congress to address it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton promised some modest steps tonight to begin tackling the problem of climate change -- two of them intended to modify the practices of foreign countries, rather than of the United States. He promised $1 billion in assistance, already proposed in his budget plan, to help third-world nations manage their resources and develop alternative energy sources.</p>
        <p>He also said the United States would require that certain projects it helps finance overseas meet new environmental standards.</p>
        <p>Lastly, he said the United States would try to increase its own use of  more environmentally friendly technologies, including solar energy.</p>
        <p>In keeping with rules at the conference, most speeches have lasted about seven minutes. Mr. Clinton spoke for 12 minutes. He wrestled with the wording of his remarks all afternoon after attending the burial of a great-uncle in Hope, Ark.</p>
        <p>Bill Richardson, United States representative to the United Nations, said Mr. Clinton's decision on Wednesday to tighten pollution restrictions had helped allay other nations' doubts about the Administration, proving it was ''serious about the environment.''</p>
        <p>Asked why the President decided not to move immediately on the issue of greenhouse gases as well, Mr. Richardson said, ''We've got to build support with the Congress and the American people first,'' adding, ''I think there'll be a good basis to move aggressively in Kyoto.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he needed to generate more support before trying to cut greenhouse emissions. To do so, he said, he will hold a White House conference on climate change later this year, ''to lay the scientific facts before our people, to understand that we must act, and to lay the economic facts there so that they understand the benefits and the costs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton intended his appearance at the United Nations tonight to  raise his profile on environmental issuesdramatically.</p>
        <p>He had announced his intention to attend during a speech in a Costa Rican rain forest on May 9. In that speech, he issued a more hedged warning about the dangers of climate change.</p>
        <p>''There is some doubt about what increased greenhouse gas emissions are doing to the climate,'' Mr. Clinton said then, ''but no one doubts that they're changing the climate, and no one doubts that the potential consequences can be very profound and severe.''</p>
        <p>The special session of the General Assembly was called to assess what progress has been made toward solving global environmental problems since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro five years ago. When the conference ends on Friday night, representatives of 199 countries and international organizations will have spoken, including 42 heads of state or government, a couple of princes and dozens of ministers.</p>
        <p>There was little expectation that the conference would break any new ground or reach any new agreements.</p>
        <p>The highlight of the week was the unexpectedly strong language used by Europeans in urging the United States to take a leadership role in solving environmental problems.</p>
        <p>Britain's Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, said on Monday that this meant the American people as well as the Clinton Administration.</p>
        <p>Nations from the third world wanted promises of more aid to help alleviate pollution and other problems. Except for offers of some assistance from Japan and the United States, no such pledges materialized.</p>
