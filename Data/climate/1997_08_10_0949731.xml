        <p>REBIRTHING PAINS  Apple Makes Its Peace  Apple Computer and its archrival Microsoft exchanged words last week -- harmonious ones, for a change. In a stunning alliance, Microsoft agreed to invest $150 million in the struggling Apple, and to cooperate on several fronts. That offered Apple a much-needed vote of confidence. Microsoft apparently concluded it would pay too high a price if it let Apple die, since Microsoft is the largest seller of programs for Macintosh computers. And cleaning its own house, Apple changed its board, bringing in Steven P. Jobs, its co-founder, below, to a more official role and sweeping out A. C. Markkula Jr., another co-founder and power broker. Mr. Jobs joins the board with a number of industry and investment veterans, including Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of the software company Oracle and a critic of Microsoft. The changes mean that virtually every major computer hardware and software company -- many of which had been fighting each other -- have entered into the Apple camp. Apple's stock jumped on the news, but gave up some of its gains in Friday's market selloff.</p>
        <p>THE BUDGET DEFICIT</p>
        <p>A Monster at Bay  The Government's budget deficit is dwindling to a mere $37 billion this year, from $107 billion in 1996. That will bring it to its lowest level since 1974, President Clinton forecast. The strong economy and high tax receipts -- thanks in part to increases passed in 1990 and 1993 -- brought a great improvement even before the balanced-budget agreement he signed into law last week had a chance to take effect. Economists said the budget deal would control the deficit in coming years, however, when the gap between revenue and spending would otherwise begin widening.</p>

        <p>THE BUDGET DEFICIT</p>
        <p>A Monster at Bay  The Government's budget deficit is dwindling to a mere $37 billion this year, from $107 billion in 1996. That will bring it to its lowest level since 1974, President Clinton forecast. The strong economy and high tax receipts -- thanks in part to increases passed in 1990 and 1993 -- brought a great improvement even before the balanced-budget agreement he signed into law last week had a chance to take effect. Economists said the budget deal would control the deficit in coming years, however, when the gap between revenue and spending would otherwise begin widening.</p>
        <p>STOCK INVESTING  Cloud on the Market  Stocks teetered at the end of the week, as interest rates rose. For the week, the Dow gave up its record-setting ways and fell 162.82 points, to 8,031.22, down 1.99 percent. Virtually all the drop came on Friday, on profit-taking and rising concerns that inflation may accelerate in the third quarter, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. In the credit markets, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 6.63 percent from 6.29 percent a week earlier. But mutual funds investors have kept on pouring money into the market. New estimates for July show that investors put $23 billion in new cash into equity funds, the most since January and the fifth-biggest month ever.</p>
        <p>TAX AVOIDANCE  Kicking Back at the Rich  The cosmetics company Estee Lauder went public two years back, and some shrewd maneuvering by its namesake and her son Ronald avoided as much as $95 million in capital gains taxes on the sale, a feat that impressed Wall Street. Rather than selling their own shares, they borrowed shares from family members and sold them, a move based on the classic tax-avoidance technique called shorting against the box. Now, in the new tax law, Washington has struck back. Unless one of the Lauders dies in the next few months, or unless the law is amended or struck down in court, the Lauders or their estates will end up facing a big tax bill. The provision could catch other investors as well.</p>
        <p>HEALTH CARE GIANTS  The Leader Stumbles  Columbia/HCA Healthcare is changing the way it does business, vastly transforming a company that upended the sleepy world of hospitals and pushed the proposition of medical care for profit, to the point that it drew the interest of Federal investigators. Gone apparently is the obsession with 15 percent profit growth each year. Gone also is the seemingly insatiable appetite for acquiring competing hospitals. And gone is the unshakable faith that to succeed, a modern health care company must own businesses that provide every phase of treatment, from hospital care to home care. The jettisoning of many of its controversial practices, like its cash bonuses for executives who met financial targets, may portend changes in other parts of the consolidating industry.</p>
        <p>PHONE REGULATION  Heat Is on the Foreign Carriers  Washington issued tough rules to cut the $5.4 billion that American phone companies pay foreign carriers to complete their calls. The rules represent the Government's aggressive entry into the back-room haggling of phone companies and may have a dramatic impact on the average phone bill. Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the F.C.C., said the rules would help slash the average cost of calling overseas from 88 cents a minute, to just 20 cents six years from now. ''There has been a consensus for a decade that a cartel of companies has jacked up prices to a hideous level,'' he said. But foreign carriers howled, and some might refuse to go along. For good measure, they also questioned the agency's jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>GLOBAL WARMING  Oil Companies Relent  The industry monolith that opposed efforts to curb greenhouse gases is cracking up. Just a few years ago, the energy industry spoke with one voice dismissing the whole idea of global warming, particularly the need for a treaty to control gas emissions into the atmosphere. Now that unanimity has cracked and from an unlikely direction -- producers of coal and oil. British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil company, said it believed there was enough evidence to warrant concern about whether burning coal and oil was changing the Earth's climate. The dominant scientific view is that greenhouse gases are probably responsible for at least part of a rise of 1 degree Fahrenheit in the average global temperature over the last century. And the next century could see a rise of 3.5 degrees.</p>
        <p>BOTTLED WATER FRENZY  Eau de Buffalo, Coming Up  Tapping into the $4 billion-a-year market for bottled water, cities of lesser cachet, like Kansas City and North Miami Beach, are exploring plans to market their tap water, with eye-catching labels and the ever-popular ''sport caps'' that enable the thirsty to open the container with a pull of the teeth. The marketing plans dare consumers to pay $1 or more for a quart that could be drawn from their own taps and put in a refrigerator for less than a tenth of a cent. Water drinkers praise the trend as a sign of marketing genius, or deride it as worthy of P. T. Barnum.</p>
        <p>CITY SLICKERS  Garth Takes Manhattan  Simon and Garfunkel conquered Central Park, and so did Diana Ross, but let's face it, country music is far afield in Manhattan. But nationally country music has exploded, and Garth Brooks is the best-selling performer of the decade and one of the most successful singers in pop history, a blend of ''classic rock'' and country. His appearance in the park, before a live audience estimated at a quarter million people, drew a crowd of folks in cowboy hats, some carrying a cell phone to boot. HBO spent $5 million or more to advertise and produce the concert, which it broadcast simultaneously. It operated 22 cameras and 600 speakers over 25 acres of the park.</p>
