        <p>Democratic presidential candidates are putting a new emphasis on making environmental issues more voter friendly. Instead of talking abstractly about ozone levels or the Superfund budget, they speak of the children whose asthma is aggravated by smog, or of how many more minority members than whites live near toxic waste dumps.</p>
        <p>Even as the Republicans have tinkered with their vocabulary in an effort to ward off Democratic attacks over the environment, Democrats are trying to lift environmental issues out of the confines of science and transform them into topics of greater scope across the spectrum of social justice, national security and morality.</p>
        <p>At the same time, they are trying to focus public attention on what they call the Bush administration's cozy relationship with business on environmental issues. In a striking example, some have been singling out the Interior Department's No. 2 official, accusing him of conflicts of interest and trying to turn him into a powerful symbol of cronyism.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' strategy aims to expand their appeal to minorities, independents and queasy suburban Republicans. But it also seeks to broaden the field of battle on which they will undertake campaign attacks against President Bush.</p>
        <p>''The environment will play a different kind of role in this campaign than it has in the past,'' said John Podesta, a chief of staff in the Clinton White House who is now the president of a new Democratic research group, the American Majority Institute. The Democrats' old approach largely motivated a set of activists, Mr. Podesta said, but ''hasn't had as broad a reach as a voting issue into the general public.''</p>
        <p>In fact, while polls show that a vast majority of people consider themselves environmentalists, and that the environment is one of the few areas where they trust Democrats more than Republicans, surveys also show that the environment is a low priority for most voters.</p>
        <p>The new strategy was on display here on Thursday, when all five of the nine Democratic presidential candidates who appeared at a forum sponsored by the League of Conservation Voters sought to cast traditional environmental issues in larger, more humanizing terms.</p>
        <p>''I want to change the entire debate and discussion about the environment in this country,'' said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. ''It's about jobs, it's about health, it's about our legacy as a generation, and it's about national security.''</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a doctor, said his fellow Democrats should speak concretely rather than in abstractions, and so link environmental problems with real-world consequences. Instead of talking about greenhouse gases, Dr. Dean said, they should talk about what it is like to take a child to the emergency room because of an asthma attack.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the ways we can win on the environment,'' he said. ''We've got to connect people with the consequences.''</p>
        <p>A third candidate at the forum, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said passage of a global-warming bill he has proposed ''would restore us as the moral leader of the world.''</p>
        <p>The strategy's other element -- to attack the administration as a crony of big business -- is reflected in the intense focus on J. Steven Griles, deputy secretary of the interior. Mr. Griles, previously a lobbyist for mining companies and other energy industries, is receiving from his former firm, National Environmental Strategies, more than $280,000 annually for the next four years for the sale of his client base, while meeting with and regulating those industries he once represented.</p>
        <p>As a condition of his confirmation by the Senate, Mr. Griles signed agreements saying he would recuse himself from decisions involving his former clients. But investigations by news organizations and environmental groups show that he has met with them dozens of times. Mr. Griles has denied any wrongdoing, and Interior officials have noted that the payments from his former firm were approved by the Office of Government Ethics and that the Senate was aware of the arrangement before it confirmed him.</p>
        <p>In any event, Democrats and environmentalists are now configuring Mr. Griles as a symbol of alliance between business and the Bush administration, a tactic that has won publicity for the critics and raised consternation in the White House.</p>
        <p>Asked about being used as such a symbol, Mr. Griles said, ''Those who make such predictable statements ignore the facts and what we at Interior have been saying publicly: energy and development and protecting the environment are not mutually exclusive.''</p>
        <p>Implicit in the Democrats' new approach is a recognition that environmentalism has too much political potential to be left to the environmentalists. The strategy is less a tool for the primaries, in which most of the candidates agree on environmental issues, than for setting the stage for the general election. If framed right, Mr. Podesta said, those issues can motivate independents and suburban Republicans in swing states.</p>
        <p>Conservatives agree that the Democrats are trying to transform the environmental debate.</p>
        <p>''Environmentalists realize they are in a ghetto, and they are trying to figure out a way out of it,'' said Myron Ebell, an environmental analyst at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute. ''They're realizing that these things relate to people's lives and are not just wonky policy debates.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ebell said part of the problem for Democrats had been that ''the environmental message is so shrill and so at odds with reality, they realize it doesn't get them very far: it helps with California, Massachusetts and New York, but Democrats already win those states.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the election will be fought in swing states -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, Missouri -- where, Mr. Ebell said, President Bush has been convincing suburban Republicans who are ''slightly green and not socially conservative'' that he is ''not the total environmental enemy.''</p>
        <p>The White House had been well aware that it was losing what Republican strategists called ''the environmental communications battle.'' Last year Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, told administration officials in a lengthy memorandum how to talk about the environment without alarming swing voters.</p>
        <p>For example, he urged them to use the term ''climate change'' instead of ''global warming,'' because, he wrote, while global warming connotes something catastrophic, ''climate change sounds like a more controllable and less emotional challenge.'' Over the last several months, the Republicans have subtly altered their language.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ebell suggested that the Democrats as well might have been listening to focus groups. Certainly most of the candidates seem to be working on carefully developed messages. Take Senator Lieberman.</p>
        <p>Mark Penn, who served as Mr. Clinton's pollster, became Mr. Lieberman's chief pollster in January. In February, Mr. Penn signed on as a director of a new watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, according to documents the group filed in support of its tax-exempt status.</p>
        <p>In April, Senator Lieberman asked the Interior Department's inspector general to investigate Mr. Griles for meeting with former clients to discuss regulatory matters. In June, Mr. Penn's group, whose mission is to take legal action against officials who violate the public trust, held a news conference where it joined with several environmental organizations to call for a special counsel to investigate Mr. Griles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn did not return calls seeking comment, but Mr. Podesta said Mr. Griles had become a useful foil for Democrats.</p>
        <p>''Griles is the clearest example, but not the worst example, of someone who has gone through the revolving door,'' Mr. Podesta said of administration officials who were once industry lobbyists. ''The environment can be a key to opening up Bush on his relationship with special interests against the public interest.''</p>
        <p>Former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois took up that theme at the forum here on Thursday, saying, ''We have to be concerned about breaking up the kind of revolving-door cabal that this administration has put in place.''</p>
        <p>So did another candidate, the Rev. Al Sharpton. Instead of criticizing President Bush's Clear Skies proposal on the science, an approach that can be confusing to voters, Mr. Sharpton succinctly dismissed it. ''Clear Skies,'' he said of a plan that many environmentalists maintain would undercut the Clean Air Act, ''is nothing but a gift to his friends in big business.''</p>
        <p>After the forum, Deb Callahan, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said she was pleased that all the candidates seemed to see the potential for expanding the concept of the environment.</p>
        <p>''This is an issue that encompasses every facet of life,'' Ms. Callahan said. ''What happened up there tonight is how this issue becomes a political issue.''</p>
