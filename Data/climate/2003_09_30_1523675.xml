        <p>Russian President Vladimir V Putin, speaking at Moscow scientific conference, declines to commit to Russia's signing of Kyoto Protocol, which is aimed at reducing emissions to control global warming; US has already rejected treaty, placing even more importance on Russia's participation to ensure treaty is put into effect; photo (S)</p>

        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin said Russia had not yet decided whether to ratify the international treaty aimed at reducing emissions linked to global warming. Speaking at a scientific conference opening in Moscow, Mr. Putin did not commit Russia to any timetable for adopting the treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, as many international leaders and environmentalists had hoped he would. Although 118 countries have ratified the treaty, it will not go into effect without the participation of the world's largest polluters. The Bush administration has rejected the treaty as onerous to the American economy, making Russia's participation decisive.</p>
