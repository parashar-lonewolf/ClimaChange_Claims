        <p>Boston Scientific Raises Bid Again for Guidant  Boston Scientific, with financial help from Abbott Laboratories, bid $27 billion for Guidant, the medical devices maker, and within hours Guidant said it would switch its support from Johnson &amp; Johnson's merger proposal in favor of Boston Scientific's.

        <p>Coca-Cola Creates a Post for International Sales  In a move that signals the growing importance of foreign markets to its overall business, Coca-Cola has created a position in charge of all of the company's operations outside of North America and filled it with an executive who revived sales in Eastern Europe in the 1990's. The appointment places the executive, Muhtar Kent, in line as a possible successor to the chairman. [C3.]</p>
        <p>I.B.M. Posts 13 Percent Increase in Quarterly Profit  I.B.M. reported a 13 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit as aggressive cost cuts offset tepid sales growth, easily surpassing Wall Street estimates. [C6.]</p>

        <p>E*Trade Financial Promises Reimbursement for Fraud  E*Trade Financial said it would fully reimburse any customer who is the victim of fraudulent activity -- the first online brokerage company to offer the kind of protection that users of credit and debit cards receive. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Japanese Stocks Hurt by Inquiry at Internet Concern  An investigation of Livedoor, a popular Internet-portal company, caused a decline in Japanese stock markets as it also raised questions about the nation's tolerance for a more freewheeling version of capitalism. [C7.]</p>
