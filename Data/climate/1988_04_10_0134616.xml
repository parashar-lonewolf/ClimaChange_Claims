On March 24, 1988, Du Pont honored that commitment and announced its intention to phase out production of the most ozone-damaging C.F.C.</p>
        <p>IN 1974, when stratospheric ozone depletion was still a theory, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company made a pledge: If scientists proved that chlorofluorocarbons were a threat to public health, the company would stop making the chemicals. On March 24, 1988, Du Pont honored that commitment and announced its intention to phase out production of the most ozone-damaging C.F.C.'s over a 10-year period.</p>
        <p>Du Pont's action breaks new ground. It shows that corporate America can take steps to protect the global environment. Some background on the ozone depletion issue is needed to understand the significance of this precedent.</p>
        <p>In 1978, concern over the possibility of ozone depletion due to the changes in atmospheric chemistry that might be induced by chlorine-containing C.F.C.'s prompted a government ban on the use of these products in aerosols in the United States. Ozone depletion did not reappear on the political agenda until 1985, when a British research team reported a springtime hole in the ozone over Antarctica.</p>
        <p>Though some claimed that this finding heralded the anticipated thinning of the global ozone shield, Du Pont and others remained unconvinced. But subsequent studies confirmed a growing springtime hole over Antarctica and a similar but smaller hole over the Arctic. Scientists also began to detect signals of a thinning ozone layer globally.</p>
        <p>With each new study, the evidence was strengthened that C.F.C.'s were at least partly to blame for the depletion. Hypotheses based on natural causes were discredited when increased chlorine concentrations in the stratosphere were discovered.</p>
        <p>After difficult and protracted negotiations last September, under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Program in Montreal, representatives of 24 countries agreed to freeze and then cut C.F.C. production by 50 percent by 1999. So far, the United States and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified the treaty. It takes effect when signed by the 11 nations that consume two-thirds of the world's C.F.C.</p>
        <p>Although Du Pont led industry support of the Montreal Protocol, it objected to proposals for any additional cutbacks. But everything changed last March 15 when the NASA-sponsored Ozone Trends Panel, composed of more than 100 scientists, released its critical analysis of all existing ozone data. The panel reported a 1.7 to 3 percent depletion of year-round global ozone, three times greater than the predictions that led to the Montreal agreement. It singled out the increased atmospheric abundance of C.F.C. as the primary cause of the Antarctic ozone hole and the likely cause of global depletion.</p>
        <p>This time Du Pont reacted. According to Elwood Blanchard, an executive vice president of Du Pont, the company reviewed the panel's report as soon as it became available and quickly established as a goal the orderly phase-out of production of fully the dangerous C.F.C.'s.</p>
        <p>Du Pont's response is crucial from an environmental and health perspective because that company supplies about half of the C.F.C.'s used domestically. Without this phase-out, even assuming that the Montreal Protocol is put into effect, an estimated 10 million to 15 million additional Americans born before 2075 would contract skin cancer and 2 million to 3 million would develop cataracts from the loss of the ozone shield.</p>
        <p>Du Pont's corporate viability will not be threatened by its phase-out of C.F.C.'s since the chemical's sales of $600 million last year represented only 2 percent of the company's revenues. The loss associated with the elimination of C.F.C. production will be eased by the windfall profits to be earned on the dwindling supply of the chemical. And since C.F.C.'s were singled out in the NASA panel's report as a cause of global ozone depletion, the company may be acting to prevent future lawsuits that could be brought by those suffering the consequences of ozone loss.</p>
        <p>The company also holds an edge in the development of substitutes that are less damaging. It has spent $30 million developing alternatives since the mid-1970's, including $10 million in 1987 alone. Three of these are now produced commercially, four have been disqualified on toxicological grounds, and others show promise.</p>
        <p>Despite great uncertainty surrounding the chemistry of ozone depletion and the commercial viability of C.F.C. substitutes, Du Pont has reacted to the new scientific data as a responsible and ethical corporate citizen. Its action sets a compelling precedent for those skeptical of the urgent need to develop alternatives.</p>
        <p>Such an approach to corporate responsibility is unfortunately rare. But if other companies were to follow Du Pont's lead and act quickly to allay the impending threats to the global environment, all the earth's citizens would benefit, including the corporate citizens who could plan their futures in the board room instead of the courtroom.</p>
