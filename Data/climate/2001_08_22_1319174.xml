        <p>Editorial on EPA Admr Christie Whitman's stated goal of streamlining Clean Air Act says that key test of reform will be whether important law is strengthened, or weakened in ways that please Pres Bush's campaign contributors; opposes abolition of new source review provision of act, which compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they build a new power plant or significantly upgrade or expand one already in use; provision is basis for lawsuits brought by several Eastern states and federal government against 51 power plants in Midwst</p>

        <p>Christie Whitman says that one of her main goals as President Bush's chief environmental officer is to streamline the Clean Air Act without diminishing its effectiveness. On the face of it, this is a laudable objective. Even Mrs. Whitman's predecessor at the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol Browner -- who built a stellar record on clean air by aggressively using nearly every regulatory lever the act has to offer -- was heard to complain about its complexity.</p>
        <p>The key test of reform, however, will be whether it strengthens an important statute or weakens it in ways that please President Bush's contributors in the utility and mining industries. There are disheartening indications that the latter is what the White House has in mind. Most worrisome are reports that the administration plans to scale back if not abandon altogether an aggressive Clinton-era initiative to reduce emissions from aging coal-fired power plants.

        <p>Christie Whitman says that one of her main goals as President Bush's chief environmental officer is to streamline the Clean Air Act without diminishing its effectiveness. On the face of it, this is a laudable objective. Even Mrs. Whitman's predecessor at the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol Browner -- who built a stellar record on clean air by aggressively using nearly every regulatory lever the act has to offer -- was heard to complain about its complexity.</p>
        <p>The key test of reform, however, will be whether it strengthens an important statute or weakens it in ways that please President Bush's contributors in the utility and mining industries. There are disheartening indications that the latter is what the White House has in mind. Most worrisome are reports that the administration plans to scale back if not abandon altogether an aggressive Clinton-era initiative to reduce emissions from aging coal-fired power plants. Mrs. Whitman supported the initiative when she was governor of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>At issue is a provision of the Clean Air Act that went unused for years until Ms. Browner and various state attorneys general on the Eastern Seaboard resurrected it two years ago. The provision, known as new source review, compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they build a new power plant or significantly upgrade or expand one already in use. The provision was aimed mainly at hundreds of aging, coal-fired plants that were ''grandfathered'' from the original act's stringent pollution controls in the expectation that they would soon be retired. Most of these plants are still going strong, contributing heavily to smog and acid rain. Those in the Midwest send so much pollution eastward on the prevailing winds that it is nearly impossible for New York and New Jersey to meet federal clean air standards.</p>
        <p>In 1999 several Eastern states and the federal government sued 51 of these plants for illegally making major upgrades without installing the necessary pollution controls. Three companies have settled their cases by agreeing to drastic reductions in pollution. But the other cases are now in limbo, as is the status of the entire initiative. One reason is fierce lobbying from the utilities, which have complained that the law unfairly punishes them for even routine maintenance. This argument, in turn, found a warm response in Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, which ordered Mrs. Whitman to issue a reassessment of the new source review program by last Friday. Last week the E.P.A. announced that it would defer its report until September, reportedly because of internal disagreements over whether the existing lawsuits should go forward.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's dream is to persuade Congress to accept a grand bargain in which the existing law's individual enforcement provisions would be replaced by a broader approach that would impose nationwide caps on major pollutants and let the states and industry figure out how to meet them. That will be a tough sell in any case. But it would be tougher still if she arrived on Capitol Hill having caved in to the utilities by abolishing a demonstrably effective program without putting anything in its place.</p>
