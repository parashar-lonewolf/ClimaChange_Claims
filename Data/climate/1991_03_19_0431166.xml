        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator Al Gore speaks for many of us in Congress in calling for a bolder energy proposal from President Bush than the one we received last month ("Still Hooked on Oil," Op-Ed, March 6). But his otherwise excellent commentary neglects to spell out what the essential ingredient of any effective policy must be: an energy tax.</p>
        <p>There would be no better way for the President to turn his feeble proposal into a stunningly bold initiative than to propose a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, phased in by 10 cents a year. Raising this tax would be the single most effective step we could take to begin reducing oil imports, and it would give us the resources to pay for all the other energy measures we need.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Senator Al Gore speaks for many of us in Congress in calling for a bolder energy proposal from President Bush than the one we received last month ("Still Hooked on Oil," Op-Ed, March 6). But his otherwise excellent commentary neglects to spell out what the essential ingredient of any effective policy must be: an energy tax.</p>
        <p>There would be no better way for the President to turn his feeble proposal into a stunningly bold initiative than to propose a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, phased in by 10 cents a year. Raising this tax would be the single most effective step we could take to begin reducing oil imports, and it would give us the resources to pay for all the other energy measures we need.</p>
        <p>Because this tax would bring in $50 billion a year when it is fully implemented, we could use it to build mass transit systems; pay for a crash program to develop alternative sources of energy; weatherize schools, hospitals and low-income homes; pay for tax credits to promote more efficient uses of energy -- and still have a lot of money left over to reduce the budget deficit.</p>
        <p>Higher gas prices resulting from the new tax would generate demand for more fuel-efficient autos and better mass transit, which would substantially reduce our need to import oil. Not only would reducing oil imports improve our nation's energy security, but it would also help lower our trade deficit (half of which is attributable to oil imports) and reduce the auto emissions that choke our cities and are a major cause of global warming.</p>
        <p>We will never break our addiction to oil until we pay more for it. We will never have the resources to pay for diversifying our energy sources and promoting energy efficiency unless we raise taxes. We will never have a better way to accomplish both these objectives than by levying a higher gas tax. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON Member of Congress, 23d Dist., Calif. Washington, March 7, 1991</p>
