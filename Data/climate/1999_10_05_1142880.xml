        <p>The body of a hunter that appeared this summer after five centuries in a British Columbia glacier is part of a wider, equally rich trove of artifacts that are suddenly melting out of receding glaciers across the border in Canada's Yukon Territory.</p>
        <p>Landing by helicopter on remote glaciers this summer, Yukon archeologists ''found bows and arrows and atlatl shafts, whole spears -- pretty dramatic finds,'' said Dr. Erik Blake, a glaciologist who accompanied the archeologists on the surveys, which have not been made public.</p>
        <p>While Canada's ''iceman,'' an Indian, was dated by radiocarbon last week to around A.D. 1450, the tools and weapons emerging from ancient alpine caribou hunting grounds date as far back as 6,800 years. In an area of acidic soils, where archeologists have historically relied on stone artifacts, the glaciers are now yielding rare bounties of frozen organic material: wood, bone and even feathers.</p>
        <p>''Through some kind of global warming phenomenon, alpine ice is melting and things that have been frozen for centuries and thousands of years are melting out,'' Greg Hare, a  Government archeologist, said in a telephone interview from Whitehorse, the territorial capital. ''Canadian archeology is largely based on stone artifacts. What is coming out of the ice is preserved organic material -- wood and bone tools, which, for the most part have not been seen.''</p>
        <p>With temperatures rising in the southern Yukon, glacial ice has receded by 20 to 100 feet in this century. Mr. Hare said that receding glaciers could also yield human artifacts in southern Alaska and in northern British Columbia, the corner of Canada where three sheep hunters found the iceman on Aug. 14. He added, ''In the European Alps, people monitoring melting ice patches are observing the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Studying the ancient caribou summering grounds, Mr. Hare said that in 1997 the Yukon governmental team retrieved ''a small dart shaft with sinew and a bit of feather on it'' that was dated by radiocarbon to 4,300 years ago. In 1998, the team retrieved darts that dated back 6,800 years, and caribou dung pellets that dated back 7,400 years.</p>
        <p>''This summer made the last couple of years look very minor,'' Mr. Hare said. But he would not go into greater detail about finds that an interdisciplinary team of Yukon scientists is still analyzing.</p>
        <p>Around A.D. 1400, what is now western Canada entered a minor ice age. After this cooling peaked around 1700, glaciers started to recede in the 1850's, said Dr. Blake, who is president of Icefield Instruments Inc., a glacier research company in Whitehorse. In recent years, the process accelerated, converting areas that elderly Indians remember as ice patches into expanses of moss-covered rock.</p>
        <p>This climatic history explains the good state of preservation of the remains of the Indian hunter, whose woven hat and fur cloak were dated to a few decades before Columbus's arrival in America, said Al Mackie, a British Columbia archeologist. Based in the provincial capital of Victoria, Mr. Mackie is the spokesman for the study of what local Indians now call Kwaday Dan Sinchi, or ''Long Ago Person Found.''</p>
        <p>''This person got into the ice at a time when he would have been kept in the ice and be enveloped and buried in it as the glacier developed,'' Mr. Mackie said of the Indian, a man who was probably in his 20's.</p>
        <p>The remains, which are being stored in a freezer at the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, represent the oldest known frozen human tissue in the region, Mr. Mackie said.</p>
        <p>The body could ''throw light on nutrition, health standards, and perhaps diseases -- which you don't have access to with bones,'' said Dr. Knut R. Fladmark, a British Columbia archeologist, who has written extensively on the region's ancient history. Although archeologists decline to detail what parts of the body survived, they say that flesh, bones and hair are in good shape. An Indian tribal official has said that the head was not found.</p>
        <p>Pollen analysis could reveal what plants he brushed against on his trek into the high mountains, where he died, apparently by falling into a crevasse. Mr. Mackie, who took part in the removal of the remains in late August, said, ''The only plants up there you could fit in a small baggie; it is rock and snow and ice.''</p>
        <p>Scattered at five sites around the body were various bone and wooden tools or weapons: poles, sticks and an atlatl (pronounced AT-lat'l), or spear-throwing stick. Radiocarbon datings will determine whether these implements belonged to the iceman, or were part of centuries of litter discarded along a known trade route, lost artifacts now coming to light as the glacier retreats.</p>
        <p>As scientists prepare for a year of tests on the remains and on his possessions, mystery surrounds the discovery of a small piece of iron among the personal effects of a man who died 300 years before the first traders, Russians, appeared on the coast of what is now British Columbia. Before contact with cultures from outside North America, Indians in this area mined and worked copper, but did not use iron.</p>
        <p>''It could have been from the driftwood of an Asian wreck that was traded up and down the coast,'' Mr. Mackie said. Pointing to another possible source, he said iron from fallen meteors had long been worked by the Inuit, or Eskimos, who traditionally lived 500 miles north of the accident site. Finally, he said, the iron could have even come from Vikings, who landed on Canada's east coast around A.D. 1000. Referring to aboriginal trade routes, he said,  ''Things did move across North America.''</p>
        <p>Both archeological studies, of the Long Ago Person found in British Columbia and of the ancient artifacts scattered over Yukon glaciers, are being undertaken with the support and consultation of local Indian tribes, say leaders of the major group, the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations.</p>
        <p>This Indian-scientist cooperation stands in sharp contrast to the feuding in Western Canada's southern neighbor, Washington, where leaders of the Umatilla tribe are seeking to keep anthropologists from studying the Kennewick Man, a 9,200-year-old skeleton found in 1996. The Umatilla say the bones are of an ancestor. Citing the 1990 Native American Graves and Repatriation Act, they demand that the skeleton be buried without scientific study.</p>
        <p>After three years of impasse, a United States magistrate on Sept. 21 gave the Federal Government six months to determine the bones' origin, noting that ''any decision that did not include DNA analysis would probably be challenged as arbitrary and capricious.'' The magistrate, John Jelderks of Portland, Ore., was responding to a suit by eight anthropologists who want to study the skeleton, considered one of the oldest and most complete found in North America.</p>
        <p>In Canada, the remains of the iceman were found in a provincial park, within the traditional territory of the Champagne and Aishihik. As part of a wider land claims settlement reached in 1995, the tribe won veto power the following year over archeological work in the discovery site, the Tatshenshini-Alsek Park. In August, announcement of the discovery was delayed for 10 days to allow scientists to consult with tribal elders. Since then, all news conferences have been held by provincial officials with tribal leaders.</p>
        <p>'There is genuine respect on both sides,'' Bob Charlie, chief of the 1,130-member tribe, said in a telephone interview from tribal headquarters in Haines Junction, Yukon. ''Their willingness to cooperate has been quite pleasing to us. They have been very patient, because I am sure they would have liked to jump ahead and plow ahead with it.''</p>
        <p>Part of the tribe's willingness to go ahead with research is related to the manner of death of Long Ago Person.  ''In this case, it looks like it was an accident,'' Mr. Charlie said. ''Even today, if you have an accident, you have an autopsy, you try to found out what happened.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference last week, Ian Waddell, British Columbia's Culture Minister, reaffirmed the province's intention to complete testing on the remains by the end of next year and then to return the body to the appropriate tribe for burial.</p>
        <p>In interviews, tribal leaders repeatedly use the word ''exciting'' to describe the find.</p>
        <p>Noting that the tribe had approved radiocarbon and DNA testing of the remains, Mr. Charlie said, ''There is some excitement among our citizens that the DNA might indicate who his present-day relatives are.''</p>
        <p>While some scientists may have been disappointed that the remains did not date back thousands of years, tribal members believe that study of the remains will complement their oral histories of foot trails and trading routes with coastal peoples. The earliest sketches and written accounts of British Columbia's northern tribes, by a Spanish explorer in the 1790's, show Indians wearing conical, broad-brimmed woven hats with chin straps similar to the one found near the human remains.</p>
        <p>''We are extremely excited about this because it ties in with oral history research,'' said Diane Strand, the tribe's heritage resource officer, adding that she planned to talk about the discovery at the tribal school's cultural day in October. Referring to stories passed down from generation to generation, she said: ''The oral history talks about that travel route, what materials the coastal people traded with us. We had songs about glaciers, stories about glaciers.''</p>
