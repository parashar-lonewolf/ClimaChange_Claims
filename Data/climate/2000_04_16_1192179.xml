        <p>TEN Shades of Green,'' the new architecture show at the Urban Center, should not just be seen. It should be enacted into law. All those pols who march on St. Patrick's Day each year would perform a public service by lining up for this Green parade. Especially if non-attendance were construed as a tacit attack on the right to breathe.</p>
        <p>The subject of the show is sustainable architecture, energy-efficient buildings that reduce air pollutants and cut dependence on fossil fuel. Buildings produce half of all greenhouse gases, the chemicals that are thought to cause global warming. Global warming is an imminent problem, not a distant one. In Great Britain, engineers are designing sea walls to surround nuclear reactors, in anticipation of the day the icecaps melt. In Bangladesh, the flood levels. . . .</p>
        <p>But it is depressing and probably futile to introduce this compelling show with the sort of alarm bells that Americans long ago learned to tune out. Perhaps it would be more productive to say that ''Ten Shades of Green'' presents the 10 Most Beautiful recent European buildings, that it includes work by Famous Architects and a handful of Hot Young Stars. It includes a miniature village of Fabulous Beach Bungalows for exotic South Pacific living, and an indoor, palm-lined Promenade des Anglais that allows German students to bask in a balmy Riviera climate.</p>
        <p>All this is true. And it does not distort the message to say that the 10 projects are packed with style. Organized by the Architecture League, with Peter Buchanan as guest curator, the show sets out to demonstrate that environmental priorities are not antagonistic to the highest aesthetic standards, as they are often presumed to be. Personally, I would not think of watching a network TV show about global warming unless Leonardo DiCaprio was the guest host. He knows how important it is to look your best on sinking ships. The projects presented in ''Ten Shades of Green'' may be no more than lifeboats. But they're fine-looking lifeboats, every one.</p>
        <p>Success in architecture, as in television, is mainly a matter of getting other people to show up. Green design is concerned as much with the comfort of a building's inhabitants as with the state of the ozone layer. In corporate and commercial buildings, physical and psychological comfort can translate into slower turnover rates and less absenteeism among employees. You may want to move into the Commerzbank headquarters in Frankfurt, Europe's tallest skyscraper, designed by Norman Foster. A three-sided tower with a hollow core, the building features a series of triangular sky gardens that spiral around the building vertically at four-story intervals. Handsomely landscaped and furnished, illuminated with natural light, they are refreshing spaces to gaze upon as well as relaxing oases to visit.</p>
        <p>The project makes several key points about the design process. Green architecture demands close collaboration between architects and engineers. You don't hire an architect to make a shape and then retain an engineer to prop it up. A building's environmental components are not bolted-on attachments, like off-the-peg solar collectors or windmills on stilts. They are designed for particular climate conditions and client needs. Architecture, accordingly, is not just a decorative skin to be draped over an armature devised by developers and space planners. It is a process of integrating aesthetic, structural, social and environmental factors into an organic whole. The integrity of architecture is the most valuable lesson ''Ten Shades of Green'' has to teach.</p>
        <p>''Energy is pure delight,'' William Blake believed. Energy-efficient buildings can be completely radiant, too. The Beyeler Museum, in Basel, Switzerland, designed by Renzo Piano, has been acclaimed for the classical serenity of its design, but it is also an efficient green machine. Perforated metal panels and a translucent glass roof modulate light in the galleries. They also create a thermal buffer that reduces fluctuations in temperature. The Gotz headquarters in Wurzburg, Germany (Webler und Geissler Architekten), and the Mont-Cenis Training Center in Herne-Sodingen, Germany (Jourda et Perraudin Architectes, and Hegger Hegger Schleiff), are rigorously delightful essays in neo-classical style.</p>
        <p>The Dutch firm Neutelings Riedijk Architekten holds up the Surrealist shade of green. Its Minnaert Building in Utrecht, which houses a university geophysics department, is a warm, fuzzy structure in which Teletubbies would feel at home. From outside, the laboratory building appears to be molded from Jell-O chocolate pudding, an effect created by spraying the exterior walls with the concrete insulation usually concealed behind them. At the corner entrance, the name is spelled out in giant steel letters that provide structural support.</p>
        <p>The Minnaert Building is another instance in which architecture is used to aestheticize infrastructure. Rainwater, collected on the roof, drips into a pool in the building's central hall, a dramatic interior with bright red booths for seating carved into drab concrete walls. In summer, the building is cooled by pumping the rainwater onto the roof and letting it circulate through the floors on its way back to the pool. In winter, it is warmed by heat generated by computer equipment in the labs.</p>
        <p>The Cotton Tree Pilot Housing complex in Queensland, Australia, is the most romantically utopian project on view. It is a mix of private houses and low-income rental units within walking distance of the local beach. These buildings have sand in their shoes. The site plan organizes the units in a series of transitions from public to semi-public to private space. Balconies, windows and a communal garden extend the transitions vertically. Overhanging roofs create shade from the subtropical sun and capture breezes that circulate between walls and through stairwells. The breezes also seem to have a deforming effect on the roofs, which are slightly askew and fitted with tilted drain pipes. The effect lies somewhere between shantytown and Club Mediterranee.</p>
        <p>The most utopian aspect of this project is its atmosphere of social and spatial informality. It picks up on the direction in which American architects were headed in the postwar years, when California's Case Study Houses, designed by Charles and Ray Eames and others, wove spare, modern design into the West Coast landscape. Today, Americans are lightening up their office wardrobes but want to live in ponderous remakes of period-style houses. Why should the Australians run away with a style of living that began with Frank Lloyd Wright?</p>
        <p>Remember the long lines of cars at gas stations in the 70's? Even with the latest round of threats from OPEC, many Americans may find it difficult to recall these events. But for Europeans it was a different story. They couldn't afford to forget the high cost of oil dependence. That's why European architects have been practicing energy-efficient design for a generation. Gas guzzling wasn't an option.</p>
        <p>Americans have allowed themselves two choices: plugging in or checking out; the power grid or the Unabomber shack. Bill McKibben called ours ''The Age of Missing Information'' because the media deprive us of the contact with nature that was once taken for granted. But ''Ten Shades of Green,'' which continues at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue, through May 13, supplies information that could help break down this dichotomy between rural isolation and urban artifice. Whether Americans want to hear it is another matter.</p>
        <p>The greatest resistance to green design comes from architects themselves. With a few exceptions, like the Croxton Collaborative, architects are unfamiliar with environmental technology and have formed few durable alliances with engineers who practice it. They are in no position to educate their clients, who incorrectly assume that green design must cost more green. All those sky gardens taking up rentable space. Those attractive sun screens requiring constant maintenance. Add high-end design, and the prospect can appear suicidal.</p>
        <p>Things are even worse in architecture schools, where green design is routinely demonized. The epithet ''eco-fascist'' is occasionally heard, usually spoken by academics who fear that their authority will be undermined by exposure to information they haven't bothered to learn. Scholarly papers are devoted to proving that nature is a cultural construct, which no doubt it is. Retribution is often meted out to the frivolous.</p>
        <p>WHAT ''Ten Shades of Green'' makes clear is that sustainable design can help advance the causes many architects have been working toward on a formal and philosophical level. For one thing, green design makes it impossible to equate architecture with building skins. It discourages the practice of mistaking exterior decoration for architecture that deals with wholes. Exterior decoration can be as wonderful as the interior kind, but you can get too much of a bad thing.</p>
        <p>Further, at a time when many architects are preoccupied by the idea of tradition, green design offers an opportunity to extend historical awareness beyond the use of reassuring images to evoke the past. Throughout history builders have used sophisticated if low-tech methods to control heat, ventilation, light and other factors affecting human comfort. The show includes several residential designs that draw on local vernacular to enhance their quotient of green.</p>
        <p>But it is on the philosophical plane that the meaning of these 10 projects resides. They should be seen as paths that extend contemporary interest in the interplay between subjective perception and objective reality. Nature, in these buildings, is simultaneously ''out there'' and ''in here.'' It is not held at bay by walls, any more than perception is confined within the membrane of the skin. The metaphoric and material realms merge in this exhibition. It contemplates the physiognomy of breath.</p>
