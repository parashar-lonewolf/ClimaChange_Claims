        <p>YOU called it a vacation when you went camping. Maybe you even told friends it was good therapy. But you were righter than you know. Psychology, a science born to heal the ills of alienated urban man, is taking a leaf from the books of Rousseau and Outward Bound and even the ancient Greeks. This one goes by a new name, ecopsychology.</p>
        <p>The movement reaches beyond psychology's conventional turf to examine the human connection -- or lack of it -- to nature itself. In a return to Thoreau, ecotherapists see psychological uplift in wilderness experience; some are taking clients outdoors, and others take groups into the wild for extended pilgrimages.</p>
        <p>"Wilderness experience seems to disrupt people's normal habits and usual sense of themselves, opening the way for change," said Robert Greenway, a psychologist at Sonoma State University in California and a pioneer of the movement. "We try to encourage that break by altering what people eat and their sleep habits -- we might get up in the middle of the night to climb a mountain by moonlight -- and having complete silence for three or four days."</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenway, who has taken more than 1,400 people into the wilderness for up to four weeks at a stretch, says many or most undergo profound changes in their personal relationships or the direction of their life's work. "They report an increased awakeness and power, a sense of energies obtained from nature," Mr. Greenway said.</p>
        <p>The best-known wilderness program, Outward Bound, comes in many varieties, several of them expli citly therapeutic. While programs for business executives may emphasize leadership and team-building, others are tailored to bolster self-confidence for groups like juvenile offenders, battered wives or alcoholics.</p>
        <p>"Outward Bound makes people face physical and mental challenges -- like rapelling down sheer cliffs -- so they can learn their strengths and weaknesses, for example, about how they confront fear," said Steven Harper, an Outward Bound instructor for many years and now director of the wilderness program at Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif.</p>
        <p>"I come from a very competitive, goal-oriented background," said Kathie Wickstrand, head women's swim coach at Northwestern University and a former champion swimmer herself, who recently went on one of Mr. Harper's trips. "But this wasn't about who can get to the top of the hill first."</p>
        <p>Another recent graduate of Mr. Harper's program is Tim Gillen, an insurance broker in Washington, who said: "There was a definite perspective shift. It quickly downsizes your preoccupation with problems in your career or private world. You see that a human being is a very small creature with a short time on this earth."</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Gillen added, "Once you're back at Eighth Avenue and 53d Street, it begins to recede a bit too quickly."</p>
        <p>Ecotherapy is part of a wider effort to merge psychology with ecological concerns. "Ecopsychology focuses on the emotional bond between humans and the rest of the natural environment," said Alan Kanner, a psychologist in Berkeley, Calif., who is at the hub of a national network of psychologists and environmentalists.</p>
        <p>The greening of psychology is finding its way into the academy; perhaps a dozen schools, from Prescott College in Arizona to Harvard Medical School, offer courses on ecopsychology.</p>
        <p>"The individualism emphasized by American psychology and culture separates us from one another and from the earth itself," said Sarah Conn, a psychologist who, with her husband, Lane Conn, teaches the ecopsychology course at Harvard's medical school. "That leaves us feeling alone and helpless when confronted with the Earth's distress. Then our recourse is to deny our connection, to numb our senses and to continue our destructive assault on the Earth."</p>
        <p>The rallying cry for the movement was sounded in a 1992 book by Theodore Roszak, "The Voice of the Earth" (Summit), which argued that there is an "ecological unconscious" that can be drawn on to restore people to harmony with the natural world, and a bond between our species and the planet as tenacious as the sexual instincts Freud found in the psyche.</p>
        <p>"If psychology needs ecology in order to find an adequate image of human nature, ecology also needs psychology in order to find more sensitive ways to address the public it wishes to persuade," Mr. Roszak, a historian at California State University at Hayward, wrote in the April issue of Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club.</p>
        <p>His book is on the Harvard course's reading list with Vice President Al Gore's "Earth in the Balance," Joanna Macy's "Despair and Personal Power in the Nuclear Age" and the Worldwatch "State of the World" reports.</p>
        <p>One of the most influential theorists of ecopsychology is James Hillman, a Jungian psychoanalyst in Thompson, Conn. Writing in the early 1980's, Dr. Hillman proposed that alarm about environmental threats, from pesticides in food to acid rain, signaled a new kind of symptom, a fear of the world around us, and that these anxieties hold clues to the psyche just as dreams or sexual fantasies do.</p>
        <p>"Our fears about the environment are a sign that we're reconnecting to the natural world, waking up to it," said Dr. Hillman. "Our usual relationship to what in classical times was called the anima mundi, or soul of the world, has been numbed, anesthetized."</p>
        <p>Skeptics might say that the message has been with us since the Greeks, and that protestations of deep change are belied by the short half-life of the effects of wilderness once people return to civilization and their discontents. But those who criticize the self-absorption promoted by self-improvement fads might applaud one that seeks to raise people's horizons beyond the navel.</p>
