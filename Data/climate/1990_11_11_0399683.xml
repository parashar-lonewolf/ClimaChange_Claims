        <p>NO SIGN OF MURDER  By Alan Russell. 174 pp. New York: Walker &amp; Company. $17.95.</p>
        <p>TOWARD the end of this first novel, a mystery set in contemporary San Francisco, the narrator, a detective named Stuart Winter, comments: "Vanishing wilderness, acid rain, and diminished quality of life aren't stories people want to read when compared to murder." That may be true, especially when murder is presented in as eclectic a package as this.</p>
        <p>Alan Russell's whodunit doesn't just track down the doer of the dastardly deed. It offers tasty tidbits of San Francisco lore as well -- such as who invented cable cars, and why. It also includes bird-watching lessons, with emphasis on the feeding habits of the red phalarope. More unusually, it serves as a concise introduction to the world of the deaf. The touchy politics of lip-reading versus sign language; the way deaf people use the telephone; the unusual history of Martha's Vineyard, where the large number of deaf people among the early settlers made sign language the lingua franca of the island -- all turn out to have some bearing on the plot.</p>
        <p>A 19-year-old model named Anita Walters -- pretty, rich and deaf -- has been missing for six months. Her mother suspects foul play. Her father doesn't appear to care. The police have reached a dead end. Winter, taking on the case, is quickly introduced to the people in Anita's life, an unsavory lot. He also discovers that Anita was no angel herself. Even her best friend acknowledges her shortcomings, commenting that modeling "was a good profession for her. It allowed her to look at her portfolio almost as much as she did her mirror."</p>
        <p>The question is: Is Anita really dead? Or did she simply take flight from a life she hated? And if she's dead, who, among those who hated her, hated her enough to kill her?</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell offers a chilling gallery of rogues to choose from. Chief suspects include Anita's icy father, a prominent lawyer; Kevin Bateson, the sleazy photographer who helped launch Anita's modeling career; and the painter and performance artist Vincent (no last name), who refers to himself in the third person and likes to use bodily fluids in his paintings. Even a gorilla named Joseph and his keeper, Dr. Harrison, aren't beyond suspicion. Harrison's experiments with sign-language communication among primates may have been endangered by Anita.</p>
        <p>Providing Winter with crucial clues are Anita's nosy neighbor, Mrs. Houston, and a raven-haired actress named Goldilocks. (The explanation of how Goldilocks got her name is a high point of the book.)</p>
        <p>Acting as sounding boards and drinking companions when things get Winter down are a psychiatrist, Norman Cohen (author of a self-help book called "Rainbows From Blues"), and a gay librarian, Leland Summers (handled so gingerly that readers may wonder why Mr. Russell included him at all). Miss Tuntland -- a "marvelous disabled woman" whom Winter has met only over the telephone -- offers motherly advice, sassy commentary on his caseload and an efficient, if expensive, answering service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell paces his story well. His revelation of what happened -- and why Anita was so hateful -- is as satisfying as it is disturbing. He has a gift for dialogue, slyly using it to reveal character. Some of his observations are a treat. Anita's mother, a well-known socialite, "has a perpetual smile like a three-way lamp: bright, brighter, brightest." The author pithily describes her marriage as "loveless but decorated."</p>
        <p>These gems, and others like them, make it all the more puzzling that Stuart Winter's first-person narrative should be marred by excessive cuteness and plain sloppiness. There are mistakes a copy editor should have caught: "wanton" for "won ton"; "an opened glass of red wine" when surely he means bottle; "Andrew Carnegie smiles and patter" when he probably means Dale.</p>
        <p>IN other places, Mr. Russell is more awkward than careless: Anita's father is an "unflappable lawyer who birthed every word with a cautious heritage." Some readers may get impatient with smart-aleck wordplay like "I smirked while I served him with the papers, and then he tried to serve me with his fist -- it had almost served me right."</p>
        <p>Winter</p>
        <p>is</p>
        <p>a wise guy. But with his odd hobbies and love of miscellaneous information, he's disarmingly attractive. His creator could make him even more appealing by easing up on his "puerile so-called wit" (as his friend Norman calls it). If Mr. Russell streamlines his prose a bit, too, he'll end up with tales so cleanly and dazzlingly told, they'll be dangerous. In the meantime, with "No Sign of Murder," he's off to a promising start.</p>
