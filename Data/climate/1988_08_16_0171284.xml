        <p>LEAD: The hurricane that ripped across southern England last October devastated the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the 300-acre repository of plants and trees from throughout the world. Nearly 1,000 trees, almost 10 percent of the collection, were severely battered or destroyed.</p>
        <p>The hurricane that ripped across southern England last October devastated the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the 300-acre repository of plants and trees from throughout the world. Nearly 1,000 trees, almost 10 percent of the collection, were severely battered or destroyed.</p>
        <p>Ten months after the storm, members of Kew's staff still call Oct. 16 the worst day in the 229-year history of the gardens. The damage took nearly six months to clear and assess. But now scientists realize that in the storm's debris was a bonanza of research material that should prove valuable for those working to protect the environment far beyond the borders of Kew. 'Get the Maximum Benefit'</p>
        <p>''What we've tried to do is get the maximum benefit out of the disaster,'' said David F. Cutler, head of the plant anatomy section at Kew's Jodrell Laboratory.</p>
        <p>The large number of fallen trees with exposed roots, many more than would ordinarily be lost in random storm damage, has aided research into root system development and the chemical properties of roots, including possible natural pesticides.</p>
        <p>Studies of rings from fallen trees are providing detailed information on the effects of pollution on varieties of trees grown at Kew, near the center of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
        <p>Scientists also hope that analysis of the storm's effects will help them identify the kinds of trees and planting arrangements most likely to survive severe storms.</p>
        <p>In addition, the storm accelerated an intensive tree-planting program to improve the collection's scientific value. Since the mid-1970's, more than 170 new trees from known sources have been planted annually. They will eventually replace older trees whose unknown origins make them less useful to scientists.</p>
        <p>''It's often a difficult decision to remove a tree from Kew, even if it's of little value to taxonomists,'' said Mark Flanagan, former supervisor of the gardens and arboretum at Kew. ''The storm made the decisions for us.'' Mr. Flanagan is now at Wakehurst Place, the the Royal Botanic Gardens' other property in Sussex, where storm damage is even worse. A Week of Destruction</p>
        <p>Kew normally loses five or six trees during storms, but unusual conditions made last October's gale particularly destructive. A week of heavy rains preceded the storm, and most of the deciduous trees were still in full leaf, making it easy for fierce gusts to yank top-heavy trees from their saturated soil.</p>
        <p>Kew's staff quickly decided which trees they would try to propagate. But the storm had struck just as the trees were entering their dormant period, the worst time of year for conventional propagation from cuttings.</p>
        <p>Material from the collection's most important trees was divided into two groups. One large set of twigs and other material was placed in cold storage for the winter, then grafted onto stalks in April. The successful grafts will remain in Kew's nursery at least until next spring before being planted, said Charles Erskine, assistant curator of the Kew arboretum.</p>
        <p>The second group of cuttings was young twigs from the 15 rarest casualties. They went to Kew's micropragation unit, which specializes in tissue cultures, where they were placed in ''forcing solutions'' of sucrose and an antibacterial agent in an effort to induce the dormant twigs to sprout shoots out of season. If that did not work, a tiny piece of live material was taken from the center of the bud and placed in a gel of hormones, nutrients and other growth regulators to induce shoots.</p>
        <p>Resulting shoots from both types of tissue cultures were then placed in agar gel, a seaweed extract, and surrounded by growth hormones in an effort to induce more shoots.</p>
        <p>It now appears that ''only three or four'' of the tissue cultures will succeed, said Michael Fay, who supervises Kew's micropropagation unit.</p>
        <p>The root research may eventually lead to the development of safe, natural pest repellants or antifungus treatments, Mr. Cutler said. By October, the trees were storing lots of starch for the winter, which attracts small mammals and fungi. Trees have evolved defense systems over the years, Mr. Cutler said.</p>
        <p>''Bark is the tree's first line of defense, but inner roots store different chemicals, which may stop fungal growth,'' he explained. ''It's a shot in the dark, but but with 130 species, I'll be surprised if we don't find something biologically active.'' History of Industrial Pollution</p>
        <p>Kew is also studying tree rings to learn the effects of pollution. Rings mirror a tree's growing conditions; they are wider in good times. Kew's older trees survived a variety of well-documented environmental changes, including the advent of a nearby gas-making factory and later a plant that made sulfurous fuel. Researchers hope the rings will show the effects of clean-air legislation and problems with acid rain.</p>
        <p>Weather can affect growth rings as well, but because of Kew's proximity to a weather station that has been operating for decades, such changes can be accounted for. In addition, Kew's trees can be compared to those at Wakehurst Place, which has seldom been exposed to pollution.</p>
        <p>Scientists are also surveying property owners in hard hit areas. ''We want to identify soil types and root types that lead to trees being secure or dangerous,'' Mr. Cutler said.</p>
        <p>Planting situations and wind direction can also affect stability. The garden's plane trees, densely planted and properly rooted, survived the storm, but plane trees on nearby streets blew over. ''Their rooting was under roads and less stable,'' Mr. Cutler explained. New Director in September</p>
        <p>Kew's transformation comes just as it is about to get a new director, Ghillean T. Prance, senior vice president for science at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He is to take over in September, replacing Arthur Bell, who is retiring.</p>
        <p>The storm damage at Kew involved both ordinary landscape trees and botanical rarities. Among the 500 trees lost in the storm was an oak planted by Queen Charlotte 200 years ago, mainly of historical value, and an extremely rare Malus trilobata, a wild apple tree from the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The storm also wiped out much of the garden's formal landscaping, including Broad Walk, twin avenues of tulip trees that had just reached maturity.</p>
        <p>For a first-time visitor unfamiliar with specific trees, Kew today shows few signs of the storm. A number of old and important trees survived, including a 226-year-old Chinese gingko.</p>
        <p>Yet it could take as long as 50 years for Kew to regain its pre-October appearance, staff members said. Landscaping constraints insure that the Kew of the future will look much like the Kew of the past. Trees and plants will still be arranged by family. And historic landscapes, including those of Capability Brown in the 18th century and W. A. Nesfield in the 19th century, will be respected.</p>
        <p>''The difference,'' Mr. Flanagan said, ''will be the scientific quality of the trees.''</p>
