        <p>LEAD: The letter praising Nora Bredes  [ July 3 ]  for killing the Shoreham nuclear power plant is indicative of how the emotionally ignorant, the doomsday agitators and their opportunistic politicians are out to terrorize and mislead the public and destroy American technology.</p>
        <p>The letter praising Nora Bredes  [ July 3 ]  for killing the Shoreham nuclear power plant is indicative of how the emotionally ignorant, the doomsday agitators and their opportunistic politicians are out to terrorize and mislead the public and destroy American technology.</p>
        <p>This country developed safe nuclear energy and made it into a major source of power for the generation of electricity and for propulsion of our Navy. All of this accomplished without one recorded death or injury to any member of the public, a 100 percent safety record.</p>
        <p>In stark contrast, coal, oil, and gas fossil fuel plants kill between 50,000 to 125,000 people each year from emitting sulfides and toxins in the air as well as from fires and explosions. The acid rain and greenhouse damage from these fossil fuel plants is well documented. Nuclear energy has none of these problems, plus it reduces our dependency on OPEC oil.</p>
        <p>The Three Mile Island accident, where there was no injury to human, animal or plant life, proved the safety of our nuclear plant design. The scare stories about radiation damage at Three Mile Island were farfetched; ''experts'' inflamed public fears by dealing recklessly with statistics. Since Three Mile Island, all of our plants have been made doubly safe. The new Shoreham plant is the safest-designed plant in the nation.</p>
        <p>It was clearly politics bending to the irrational negative influences in our society. This was more than proven by Governor Cuomo naming Nora Bredes to the Board of Trustees of the Long Island Power Authority.</p>
        <p>Since when do the qualifications for a high-level public job require no previous experience in that industry or in any public job, just that the applicant be an accomplished activist in that field? No wonder that competent, progressive people in other countries are leaping ahead of us and we are becoming a second-rate technical nation.</p>
        <p>The damage being done to Long Island and our nation by people like Nora Bredes and Governor Cuomo will hurt us for many years to come.  LAN L. HAUSMAN  Port Washington</p>
