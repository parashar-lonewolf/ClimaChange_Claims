        <p>Mating of a Flasher</p>
        <p>Consider the lamentable situation of the typical male firefly. It has only a couple of weeks to find a mate before it dies, and precious little, save its lantern, for attracting one. It can't preen like a peacock or strut like a turkey (or drive around in a Lamborghini like a male Homo sapiens). It can only flash on and off every few seconds.</p>

        <p>Mating of a Flasher</p>
        <p>Consider the lamentable situation of the typical male firefly. It has only a couple of weeks to find a mate before it dies, and precious little, save its lantern, for attracting one. It can't preen like a peacock or strut like a turkey (or drive around in a Lamborghini like a male Homo sapiens). It can only flash on and off every few seconds.</p>
        <p>But that simple flash, it turns out, can speak volumes. A study by biologists at Tufts University shows that in one firefly species, mating preferences are based in part on the duration of the flash. Simply put, females make passes at males with longer flashes.</p>
        <p>The researchers, Dr. Christopher K. Cratsley and Dr. Sara M. Lewis, studied Photinus ignitus, a firefly that graces New England lawns in the early summer.</p>
        <p>They timed the duration of males' flashes -- from 56 to 123 milliseconds -- and, by using a light-emitting diode to make precise simulated flashes, showed that females responded more (with a return flash of their own) as the flashes became longer.</p>
        <p>The work was published in the January-February issue of Behavioral Ecology.</p>
        <p>More experiments showed why, apparently, females prefer longer flashes. The researchers found that males with longer flashes also produced larger spermatophores, the sperm-containing sac that is passed from the male to the female during mating.</p>
        <p>The spermatophore also contains proteins that the female digests and that serve as a critical source of nutrients for the eggs. So by selecting for a male with a long flash, the female is helping to ensure reproductive success.</p>
        <p>Photosynthesis Explosion</p>
        <p>Fashion photographers know the advantages of diffuse light. Spotlights with the rays from the same direction cause shadows that harden models' features. But light scattered by a scrim or other means creates a softer image, with less contrast, as the light rays come from many directions.</p>
        <p>Now, think of earth as a photo studio and a tree as a model. On a bright day, the sun's rays will come from one direction, causing some leaves to be in bright sunshine, but others below them to be in shadow. On a cloudy day with scattered light, however, more rays will reach more leaves. Other things being equal, photosynthesis will increase.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and other centers have shown a rise in photosynthesis over two years at a hardwood forest and have tied it to increased scattering of light. The scattering was linked to the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which sent huge amounts of light-scattering sulfur aerosols into the air.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who reported on their work in the March 28 issue of Science, used data from the Harvard Forest, an experimental tract in central Massachusetts. Comparing data from cloudless days in 1992 and 1993 to cloudless days in later years (when the aerosol effect of the Pinatubo eruption had dissipated), they estimated that noontime photosynthesis increased by 23 percent in 1992 and by 8 percent in 1993.</p>
        <p>Because increased photosynthesis results in increased absorption of carbon dioxide, the researchers say their findings suggest that the greater light scattering caused by Pinatubo contributed to a measured decline in the rate of growth of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the two years that followed.</p>
        <p>A Rare Killing</p>
        <p>With few natural predators, cougars and wolves usually leave each other alone. So a recent report by a Wildlife Conservation Society biologist, Toni Ruth, is stunning: a cougar in Yellowstone National Park was killed by a pack of wolves.</p>
        <p>The cougar was outfitted with a radio collar so its movements could be tracked. When it stopped moving for a day, researchers located it and found it dead from a wolf attack. While wolves sometimes harass cougars in an effort to steal their food, actual killings of them are extremely rare.</p>
