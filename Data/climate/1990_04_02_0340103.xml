        <p>LEAD: For the first time since the late 1970's, the Federal Government has begun trying to develop a comprehensive energy policy - a system of strategies, goals, inducements and penalties covering everything from how much oil should be produced domestically to the amount of light each watt of electricity should yield.</p>
        <p>For the first time since the late 1970's, the Federal Government has begun trying to develop a comprehensive energy policy - a system of strategies, goals, inducements and penalties covering everything from how much oil should be produced domestically to the amount of light each watt of electricity should yield.</p>
        <p>But the first report in this effort, a compendium of opinions compiled by the Energy Department and scheduled for release this morning in Washington, contains a welter of conflicting advice and hints at a rough road ahead.</p>
        <p>The report comes at the midpoint of an 18-month process to develop legislative proposals. It contains written submissions from 1,000 individuals and organizations and summaries of the testimony of 379 witnesses at 16 hearings held in locations like Atlanta, Honolulu and Boise, Idaho.</p>
        <p>A Case for Efficiency</p>
        <p>The compendium leaves for later the job of putting goals in order of importance and making choices between alternatives. But it clearly sets the stage for action on energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>''People are not willing to pay more for energy, either environmentally or economically, unless they are first convinced that you have no choice,'' W. Henson Moore, Deputy Secretary of Energy, said in a telephone interview Friday. ''They say, 'What are you doing to increase the efficiency in the use of energy, so we do not have to do this?' You're never going to get a consensus until you establish your credibility in that area, that you're really serious about efficiency.''</p>
        <p>Still, the report offers no conclusions about how efficiency should be achieved. Its first section, for example, notes that vehicle fuel economy, prodded by Federal standards, more than doubled between 1970 and 1987, but that at current fuel prices, a 10 mile-a-gallon improvement in gas mileage would save a typical driver only $94 a year. The options identified by those who testified range from making the standards more stringent to abandoning them altogether.</p>
        <p>Critical Time for Oil</p>
        <p>The effort to establish a comprehensive plan, which is supposed to conclude next January, comes as domestic oil production has fallen and imports have rapidly approached 50 percent of demand for the first time. Some experts have predicted that market conditions once again favor price control by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
        <p>In addition to those trends, some parts of the country appear to be approaching a critical juncture in electricity production. As demand increases, these regions face decisions about whether to build more plants or reduce demand through efficiency, or accept a higher likelihood of occasional blackouts. Other pressing policy questions include how to reduce air pollution from energy use.</p>
        <p>As part of the process of gathering the contents of the report, James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, and Mr. Moore held meetings that included the Secretaries or Under Secretaries of Agriculture, Transportation, Treasury and Interior, as well as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the White House science adviser.</p>
        <p>More hearings are contemplated, with competing interests offering their positions on what the policy should include.</p>
        <p>The 230-page interim report charts the view of business executives, academicians, advocacy groups and other experts on the problems and possibilities for oil, gas, coal, nuclear fission and fusion, renewable energy sources, scientific research, technology transfer, waste handling, air and water pollution from energy extraction and use, and even energy education.</p>
        <p>To this, the Energy Department added five white papers written by Government laboratories and others covering the greenhouse effect, the potential for renewable energy and the limits of energy efficiency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore said that the effort was the most comprehensive he had seen the Federal Government undertake. ''The closest thing to it was in the Carter Administration,'' he said.</p>
