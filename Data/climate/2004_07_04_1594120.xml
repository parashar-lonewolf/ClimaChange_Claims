        <p>WIND power for Long Island is advancing beyond the talking stage.</p>
        <p>The Long Island Power Authority has named FPL Energy of Juno Beach, Fla., to build 40 wind turbines in the ocean, the closest less than three miles southwest of Robert Moses State Park.</p>
        <p>In a stiff, steady breeze, each turbine would produce up to 3.6 megawatts of energy, for a combined total of more than 140 megawatts, or enough to power 140,000 Long Island homes.</p>
        <p>Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the authority, said last week that Long Island was an ideal location for what would be the country's first offshore wind park, and he predicted that the project would move ahead.</p>
        <p>''If we are serious about reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, and particularly oil, then we have no choice but to invest in renewable technologies, and wind seems to be a perfect fit,'' he said. The project would also be in line with a goal set by Gov. George E. Pataki for 25 percent of the state's power to be from renewable resources by 2013.</p>
        <p>From Robert Moses State Park, which is on the west end of Fire Island, the nearest turbine would appear as the size of a dime held at arm's length against the horizon, supporters of the project said. Turbines farther way would appear progressively smaller.</p>
        <p>The authority plans to buy all the power the turbines produce under a long-term agreement it will negotiate with FPL Energy. Federal and state permits and final approval by the authority's trustees are needed before FPL Energy begins work.</p>
        <p>If built and put into operation as planned by 2008, the turbines will be situated to reap offshore breezes averaging more than 18 miles an hour in one of the three wind ''hot spots'' off the Eastern seaboard.</p>
        <p>The hot spot begins only miles off the South Shore and includes the 52-square-mile area where the authority sought wind-power proposals. The other areas are off Cape Hatteras, N.C., where the risk from hurricanes is too great to invite turbines, and off Cape Cod, where a similar plan has met with strong opposition.</p>
        <p>Bruce Bailey of AWS Scientific in Albany, a consultant to the authority for the South Shore project, said the location took advantage of prevailing west-to-northwest winds in winter and spring and weaker prevailing south-to-southwest breezes in summer.</p>
        <p>The summer sea breeze occurs when hot air rises from the land and cooler air from over the ocean rushes in. Mr. Bailey said that on hot, seemingly windless summer days when electric use peaked the offshore turbines would provide power when it was needed most.</p>
        <p>''It goes against some conventional wisdom,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''When it is hot and hazy people feel there is no wind, but sailors will know better, and the wind turbines will benefit during sweltering conditions.''</p>
        <p>Though final designs for the Long Island project have yet to be drawn, the three-bladed turbines would be spaced from a third- to a half-mile apart and would be arranged in a cluster. Each would measure more than 400 feet from the tip of a blade pointed skyward to the ocean surface, or more than 100 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty.</p>
        <p>Daniel Zaweski, project manager for the authority, said water depths in the areas where turbines would be sited averaged 50 to 60 feet, deeper than offshore turbines now operating in 40- to 45-foot depths in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaweski said each turbine tower would be supported by a thick-walled steel tube with a 15-foot diameter hammered 70 to 80 feet into the sea floor. Cables from each turbine would be bundled into a single cable buried in the seabed to carry power to a substation in Massapequa.</p>
        <p>The turbines would turn into the wind and tilt up or down for maximum effect. Though the final decision will rest with FPL, they may be supplied by General Electric, which sells half of all land wind turbines in this country.</p>
        <p>In actual use, the turbines would probably produce about 35 percent of their rated 140-megawatt capacity most of the time, with somewhat higher production in the winter and somewhat lower in the summer, Mr. Zaweski said.</p>
        <p>But this would still power about 42,000 homes year round, according to Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, one of a large number of environmental and energy groups applauding the authority's plan. The authority has 1.1 million customers.</p>
        <p>''With the situation in the Middle East and the rest of the world, it's clear that we need to do something about reducing our dependence on imported fuel,'' said Mr. Raacke, who also leads the Citizens Advisory Panel, an energy watchdog group.</p>
        <p>Earlier descriptions placed the turbines farther west off Jones Beach, where there had been some preliminary opposition to having them near Long Island's most heavily used public oceanfront.</p>
        <p>No organized opposition has arisen to the new site. ''I don't know how many people realize it is really going to be close to Robert Moses,'' said George Gorman, a spokesman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ''But as the project gets closer, people will look at it.''</p>
        <p>Charles Muoio, vice president for development at FPL Energy, said the project would cost considerably more than $300 million. While the company would make the investment, its costs would be recovered in wholesale rates it charged the authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muoio said the turbines would be about twice as expensive to build offshore than on land but did not present insurmountable engineering obstacles. ''It sounds exotic and new, but it is really just using all the experience of the oil and gas industry in Europe off the coast of Long Island,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the wind turbines would be designed to withstand ''the worst hurricane conditions.''</p>
