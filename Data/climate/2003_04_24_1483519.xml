        <p>All the electricity at the Environmental Protection Agency's regional headquarters in Lower Manhattan will be supplied by wind power beginning next month, E.P.A. officials said yesterday. The contract will make the E.P.A. the largest federal buyer of wind energy in New York State. The E.P.A. occupies about half of a 30-story office tower at 290 Broadway, and buys 6.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, or enough for 1,800 average apartments. The renewable energy will cost about 10 percent more than fossil fuel, an official said.</p>

        <p>Correction:  April 26, 2003, Saturday  A report in the Metro Briefing column on Thursday about the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to buy wind-generated electricity for its regional headquarters in Lower Manhattan misstated the use to which the power will be put. The wind power goes into a general grid, not to individual customers; the agency's electricity will continue to come from a variety of sources.</p>
