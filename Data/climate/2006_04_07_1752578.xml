        <p>'GUARDIANS' Opens Tuesday. A favorite from the 2005 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, this series of monologues juxtaposes the Abu Ghraib scandal in the United States with the release by a London newspaper of forged photos of English soldiers torturing detainees. Jason Moore directs (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983.</p>
        <p>'PEER GYNT' Opens Tuesday.

        <p>'AWAKE AND SING!' Opens April 17. Lincoln Center revives Clifford Odets's classic fist-shaking drama about a Jewish family struggling to survive during the Depression.

        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' Opens May 1. This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 27. Redemption is a major theme of this musical fantasy adapted from a Peter S. Beagle novel about a recluse who lives in a Bronx cemetery (2:00). York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444.</p>
        <p>'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' Opens April 16. John Guare, never satisfied with an overly tidy play, throws comedy, tragedy, satire and mystery into this cult drama, which first opened almost three decades ago. Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott star (2:15). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.</p>
        <p>'LESTAT' Opens April 25. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have a good track record making pop hits, but can they find success in the cursed genre of the vampire musical? Hugh Panaro stars (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 16. C. J. Hopkins's dark drama, a hit at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival, is about a game show host even more bizarre than Bob Barker (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' Opens May 10. Phil Collins lends his invisible touch to the score of the latest Disney musical. David Henry Hwang wrote the book (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' Opens April 19.

        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Opens April 20. If any Broadway theater was made for a revival of Brecht's classic, it's the cabaret-style Studio 54, which will be host to an intriguing cast that includes Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27. Stephen Lynch plays the goofy title character in this musical adaptation of the Adam Sandler film about leg warmers, Billy Idol and other artifacts from the 1980's. John Rando (''Urinetown'') directs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed by with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Closing Sunday. Moving to Broadway. Previews begin April 19; opens May 3 at the Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER'  A soccer game in Belfast is a catalyst for personal transformation in Marie Jones's tour de force two-act monologue. Marty Maguire throws himself into the revival of this well-written, funny piece with an abandon that verges on hysteria. (1:30). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'PEN'  David Marshall Grant's sometimes preachy new three-character play is about an unhappy Long Island family in 1969. J. Smith-Cameron is fascinating to watch as she exposes the anguish behind the tough, angry exterior of the wheelchair-bound mother; Dan McCabe is uneven but believable as the troubled teenage son who wants to get away from her; and Reed Birney is less persuasive as the ex-husband who has already left. The title object is a gift from the author to himself: it allows something impossible to happen. (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Goes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condi Rice, is casual to the point of offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON'  A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens)</p>
        <p>'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton,(212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TRIAL BY WATER'  Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. ( Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)'  O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; closing Sunday. (212) 352-3101.

        <p>'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who co-stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM SCHOOL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) John Goodman plays a dying crash victim on his way to a 40-year-old appointment, and Robert Carlyle is the widowed baker entrusted with keeping it. Instead he meets Marisa Tomei, who teaches him to dance and, more important, throw away his wife's ashes. Toggling back and forth between past and present, ''Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School'' is a soggy, endless wallow in nostalgia and the healing power of very bad dancing. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'YANG BAN XI: THE 8 MODEL WORKS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mandarin) In her documentary about Chinese propaganda of the campiest kind (think rosy-cheeked, chubby-kneed dancers leaping across the stage, guns clutched in one hand, Little Red Books in the other), the director Yan-Ting Yuen revisits the Cultural Revolution to explore the history and legacy of one of the strangest byproducts of totalitarian madness: the revolutionary spectacular. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>AGAINST THE TIDE: REBELS &amp; MAVERICKS IN CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE FILM (Through April 16) Japan Society's spring film series, which began yesterday, continues this weekend with films including ''Wild Berries'' (2003), Miwa Nishikawa's satire of Japanese family values; and ''Kaza-hana'' (2001), the director Shinji Somai's last work, a drama about a bureaucrat and a young widow trying to redefine their damaged lives. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258; $10. (Anita Gates)</p>
        <p>PRIX JEAN VIGO (Through Dec. 30) The Museum of Modern Art is honoring Vigo (1905-34), the French filmmaker, with a series of 41 films from directors who have won the prize that bears his name. ''Paris Awakens'' (1991), Olivier Assayas's drama about alienated urban teenage lovers, will be shown tomorrow. Judith Godrèche and Thomas Langmann star. (212) 708-9400; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>RECENT FILMS FROM DENMARK (Through April 19) Scandinavia House continues its overall Scandinavian film series with Rumle Hammerich's ''Young Andersen'' (2005), the story of Hans Christian Andersen's encounter, at the age of 18, with a difficult school principal. 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8.

This weekend's films include ''The Calm'' (1976), about an ex-convict and a workers' strike; ''The Double Life of Veronique'' (1991); and all three parts of the Colors trilogy: ''Blue'' (1993), ''White'' (1994) and ''Red'' (1994).

        <p>DON SIEGEL (Through Thursday) Siegel, who died in 1991, was a master of several genres, including science fiction, westerns and police thrillers. Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work concludes with a weeklong run of ''Dirty Harry'' (1971), his biggest hit. This is Clint Eastwood's first and best interpretation of Harry Callahan, a tough San Francisco cop who has been known to ask deserving punks whether they're feeling lucky. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>VILLAGE VOICE BEST OF 2005 (Through April 26) This annual series, which opened yesterday, continues this weekend with three films. ''Funny Ha Ha'' (2003), Andrew Bujalski's debut feature, is a study of post-college life. Claire Denis's ''Intruder'' (2004) is a drama about a dying man.

(Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>YOLANDA ADAMS (Tomorrow) Blending gospel and rhythm-and-blues, Yolanda Adams has a powerful voice, though it is used more for purposes of warm inspiration and uplifting solace than quasi-sexual shudders of praise. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Midtown, (212) 997-4144; $65. (Laura Sinagra)</p>
        <p>EVA AYLLON (Tomorrow) Eva Ayllon is a stadium-filling star in Peru who, for more than 30 years, has placed her own stamp on the Afro-Peruvian folk heritage: songs with crisp syncopations played on instruments as basic as the box drum called the cajón. She adds a husky voice that never shies away from drama. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $45. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>ANTI-FLAG (Thursday) You can't accuse this politically minded punk band of flip-flopping on the issues. Sure, it moved to the center on the subject of corporate record labels, but it still has lots of leftist bile to spew about topics like the lazy news media (''The Press Corpse''), big trade (''The W.T.O. Kills Farmers'') and plain old greed (''1 Trillion Dollar$''). 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $15.75 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) Ms. Bhosle is famous as a vocalist for Indian film. Here she performs reinterpreted Bollywood classics accompanied by the Kronos Quartet, with Zakir Hussaino on the tabla, and Wu Man on pipa. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $21 to $72. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NEKO CASE (Tonight) The clarion voice that's best known as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to this alt-country chanteuse, who performs her own songs here. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KEYSHIA COLE (Tomorrow)The R&amp;B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than on righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tomorrow) Donna the Buffalo is not named after its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 6:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>FRANZ FERDINAND, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Thursday) At the vanguard of the post-post-punk trend, the poker-faced group Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound took on some added alternative-rock heft on its most recent album, ''Plans'' (Atlantic). 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 485-1534; $40 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GOGOL BORDELLO (Wednesday) Led by a gruff and extravagantly mustached Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, Gogol Bordello calls itself a Gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oompah that's the makings of a rowdy party. 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $22. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>HEARTLESS BASTARDS, THE SOLEDAD BROTHERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Because of her primal yowl, the singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The members switch off headlining slots with the Soledad Brothers. 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE HOLD STEADY, P.O.S. (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The indie-rapper P.O.S. also performs. 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE iO'S (Tuesday) Just like the Canadian band Stars, the iO's remind you of that exuberant 90's moment when bands like Mavis Piggott and Madder Rose made it seem that smart girl voices over big guitars were the way of the future. The iO's have a guy singer, too. But as in Stars, the female voice is the more affecting. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This brainy rapper's agile attack still lacks Jigga's precision, 50 Cent's swagger and Nas's anguish. But his rapping can be beautiful when he laments things like Lauryn Hill's exit from the music scene. 8 p.m., Pratt Institute Student Union, 200 Willoughby Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 636-3422; free for Pratt students, $4 for nonstudents. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KYP MALONE (Tomorrow) With his ethereal falsetto and coronal afro, Kyp Malone is known to many as a vocalist and guitarist in the spacy local band TV on the Radio. For years, though, he was a fixture on San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>McCULLOUGH SONGS OF THUNDER, THE BIRMINGHAM SUNLIGHTS (Tomorrow) The 16-piece ''shout'' gospel brass band, McCullough Songs of Thunder, from the United House of Prayer for All People in Harlem, aims to blare its devotion so loudly and joyously that the angels have to sing along. They are joined here by the Birmingham Sunlights, a traditional a cappella gospel group. 8 p.m., Harlem Center for the Performing Arts, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100; Free. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SUSAN McKEOWN (Tonight) Susan McKeown interprets Irish traditionals with a distinctive intensity. Accompanying her here are some musicians who play on her most recent recording: the fiddler Dana Lyn and the guitarist Eamon O'Leary. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BETH ORTON (Tuesday) Though her voice, which recalls the best of the English folk tradition, should be enough to put her songs across, the quality of Ms. Orton's work has often depended on her adept collaborations. Her most recent is with the post-rock gadfly Jim O'Rourke. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>QUASI (Monday and Tuesday) Sam Coomes and his ex-wife, the Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss, make tempestuous indie-rock that veers toward apocalypse blues. Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $12 in advance , $14 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE RACONTEURS (Tonight) Jack White of the White Stripes and the power-pop talent Brendan Benson team up with members of the Greenhorns in this assertive side project. They play garage-rock cut with incisive pop hooks. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>RJD2, BEANS (Tonight) Representing an offshoot of the record-store scavenging D.J. tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach. The rapper Beans, formerly of Antipop Consortium, has made a solo career out of meshing his surreal lyrics with the work of electronic-rock artists and culture-hopping D.J.'s. 9, Guggenheim Auditorium, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500; $20 (cash at door only, free for members).(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOSH ROUSE (Tonight) This confessional singer-songwriter gives contemplative navel-gazing a Nashville twist. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $22.50 to $26.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722;$17 to $50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>THE SOUNDS, MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) The Sounds are a Swedish band that plays sugar-sharp arena pop with a pinch of bad-girl sass. Morningwood is more punky, though somehow less authentic. 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) The Russian-born singer and pianist Regina Spektor brings punk immediacy into a cabaret setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KREMENA STANCHEVA (Tomorrow) Ms. Stancheva is a member of Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian vocal group that created one of world music's first minibooms in the late 1980's. She has been with the group for 45 years. This concert and folklore presentation allows her to apply her many years of Bulgarian song scholarship. 8 p.m., Bulgarian Consulate General, 121 East 62nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 935-4646; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE SWORD (Tonight and Sunday) The Texans in the Sword do a great approximation of Black Sabbath's slow menace, at points also revealing hard-core punk underpinnings with thrash bravura. Tonight at 8:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J.,(201) 653-1703; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Sunday at 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village; (212) 982-4052; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TINARIWEN (Tonight) This guitar band from the deserts of Mali turns Tuareg culture's acoustic music into a chant-based kind of distended electric blues, addressing the issues of exile, displacement and poverty. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>WOLFMOTHER (Tuesday) Part of a wave of what's been dubbed ''heritage metal,'' the Australian trio Wolfmother strives to sound like Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>WOLF PARADE (Sunday and Monday) Part of Montreal's wave of ''It'' art-pop bands that includes Arcade Fire and Unicorns, Wolf Parade has a Northern noir take on keyboard-heavy epics. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out.(Sinagra)</p>

        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)</p>
        <p>ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)</p>

        <p>ALPHABET LOUNGE BIG BAND (Sunday) Led by the pianist Deidre Rodman, this large ensemble expands on the mischievous eclecticism of the Jazz Passengers, with a lineup that includes Kate McGarry on vocals; Roy Nathanson, Ohad Talmor and Jay Rodriguez on saxophones; Sam Bardfeld on violin; and Curtis Fowlkes on trombone. 6 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Tonight) Pulse and texture shift perpetually in this trio, thanks to the earthy rhythm team of Ben Allison and Jeff Ballard, on bass and drums; but the group's capricious tone is set by Mr. Blake, on tenor and soprano saxophones. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GARY BURTON'S GENERATIONS (Wednesday through April 15) Mr. Burton, the extravagantly proficient vibraphonist, educator and composer, features younger talent exclusively in this ensemble, reserving a central role for the teenage guitar prodigy Julian Lage. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILLY CHILDS CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Wednesday through April 16) The pianist and composer Billy Childs favors a billowy sound that often drifts perilously close to New Age. But behind a genteel front line of piano, saxophone, harp and guitar lurks the action-oriented rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Antonio Sanchez on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with 11:30 sets Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 Fridays and Saturdays. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for the veteran alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who receives strong support here from Dr. Lonnie Smith on Hammond B-3 organ, Randy Johnston on guitar and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SHANE ENDSLEY GROUP (Monday) An ethereal sense of groove guides this chamber ensemble, which enfolds Mr. Endsley's trumpet in a dark cocoon of Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone, guitar, bass and drums. Sharing the bill is Common Thread, a flintier band featuring Mr. Endsley but led by another trumpeter, Jonathan Finlayson. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GOOD FOR COWS (Tonight and tomorrow) The bassist Devin Hoff and the drummer Ches Smith constitute this Bay Area duo, which interrogates jazz and punk with equal rigor.

        <p>JON GORDON QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Gordon, an accomplished alto and soprano saxophonist, projects standards through a slightly warped lens, with the help of Mike Moreno on guitar, Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. 10, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BARRY HARRIS AND REGINA CARTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Harris, one of bebop's stalwart pianists, and Ms. Carter, a violinist of sleek composure, both hail from Detroit, a fact that has some bearing on this concert of newly commissioned music, featuring each artist with a separate ensemble. 8, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILLY HART QUARTET (Tuesday through April 16) Mr. Hart, a loose but focused drummer with a sterling résumé, fronts a dream team of younger players: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>WILL HOLSHOUSER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Holshouser is an accordionist in tune with his instrument's folk legacy, but hardly constricted by it; his longstanding trio, with the trumpeter Ron Horton and the bassist David Phillips, manages a playful sort of melancholy. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STANLEY JORDAN TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Jordan applies a distinctive tapping technique to the fretboard of his guitar, producing a harmonic range more suggestive of pianism. His rhythm section consists of Zirque Bonner on bass and Ed Barattini on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVE LEHMAN GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Lehman, an intense young saxophonist, features his own sharp-cornered compositions in this ensemble, which derives much of its heft from the drumming of Tyshawn Sorey. Wednesday at 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. Thursday at 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JIMMY McGRIFF GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) A powerfully bluesy presence on the Hammond B-3 organ since the early 1960's, Mr. McGriff marked his 70th birthday earlier this week and continues the celebration here. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHARNETT MOFFETT (Monday) Mr. Moffett may be a few years late with his new album, ''Internet'' (Piadrum), but his bass playing is characteristically solid, and he surrounds himself with good musicians -- in this case, the alto saxophonist Vincent Herring, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Eric McPherson. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $10 at tables with a $5 minimum or $5 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GRACHAN MONCUR III BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Moncur was one of the first trombonists to make sense of free improvisation, compellingly, in the 1960's; this modern ensemble includes such kindred adventurers as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Michael Blake and the pianist John Hicks. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Through Sunday) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and Odean Pope's signature ensemble (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SAXOPHONE SUMMIT (Tuesday through April 16) The alto saxophonist Charles McPherson has always nursed a fondness for Charlie Parker's blistering bebop, so his role in this Parker tribute makes perfect sense. So does the supporting cast: Tom Harrell on trumpet, Ronnie Mathews on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC &amp; Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SKIRL RECORDS LAUNCH PARTY (Tuesday) Skirl is an independent label with the stated objective of documenting new music by a Brooklyn-centered cadre of musicians. The first three bands on its roster will perform here: the Clarinets, featuring Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed (the label's founder); Ted Reichman's My Ears Are Bent; and Curtis Hasselbring's New Mellow Edwards. Also on hand is a pair of bands with Skirl releases in the foreseeable future: Tyft (Hilmar Jensson on guitar, Andrew D'Angelo on reeds and Jim Black on drums) and Mr. Noriega's trio (with Trevor Dunn on bass and Tom Rainey on drums). 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GRANT STEWART QUINTET (Tuesday) A big-toned tenor saxophonist in the hard bop mainstream, with a fine ensemble, including the pianist Bill Charlap and the guitarist Peter Bernstein. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Through Sunday) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre; in this superb ensemble, his flute and alto saxophone are flanked by cello, oud, acoustic guitar, tuba, trombone and drums. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $20 (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ERNIE WATTS-LEW SOLOFF QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Watts, a Los Angeles-based saxophonist, and Mr. Soloff, a New York trumpeter, present a formidable partnership, especially in the presence of Mulgrew Miller on piano, François Moutin on bass, and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. 8, 10and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. A mostly new cast has taken over, with Yunah Lee as Mimi, Gerard Powers as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black as Musetta, and Philip Torre as Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $45 and $79. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tonight, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) City Opera seems to be finishing its season with a new emphasis on voice. This ''Carmen'' looks as if it is worth hearing, with the strong mezzo Kate Aldrich in the title role, and the soprano Laquita Mitchell making her company debut as Micaëla. Robert Breault has already shown he has a strong if unvaried voice as Alfredo in ''La Traviata;'' let's see what he offers in a heavier part, Don José. George Manahan conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 tickets remaining tonight; $45 on Sunday; and $65 to $120 on Tuesday and Thursday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow) A largely decent cast helps bring across Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Elizabeth Caballero, new to the company, is a feisty Donna Elvira who utters little squeaks of indignation when she's not pouring out her heart in melisma; Yeghishe Manucharyan shows his white-toned tenor to advantage as Don Ottavio. Alas, Christopher Schaldenbrand, a talented singer, has not quite grown into the demanding title role. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $25. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he has accomplished this vividly. He taps into the emotions -- jealousy, yearning, fear of death -- that swirl below the surface of this farcical tale about a crusty and miserly bachelor who foolishly decides to take a young wife and disinherit his shiftless nephew. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko; the robust, dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien; and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Maurizio Benini conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $70 to $205 tickets remaining tonight; $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Jürgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production, which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Erika Sunnegardh, who recently made her Met debut as Leonore when Ms. Mattila was ill, sings in the last performance on Thursday. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'MANON' (Tomorrow) The news is Renée Fleming, who closes out the run of a signature role in this venerable but appealing Jean-Pierre Ponnelle production, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jesús López-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, but returns may be available. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. The Met has assembled a strong cast that includes Andrea Rost as Susanna, John Relyea as Figaro, Alice Coote as Cherubino, Soile Isokoski as the Countess, and Peter Mattei as the Count. Mark Wigglesworth conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) The Met's first-rate revival is back again with Hei-Kyung Hong, Frank Lopardo and Dwayne Croft in the major roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $175. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Gather all ye Anglophiles. Leon Botstein conducts Bridge, Bliss and Vaughan Williams. 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $53. (Holland)</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music performances, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Tonight the pianists Gerald Robbins and Katya Mihailova play Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Dvorak and Shostakovich. Tomorrow and Sunday, Mark Peskanov and colleagues team up for Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet along with Beethoven and Mozart. Thursday brings the pianist Dmitri Alexeev in Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Scriabin and Rachmaninoff. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>ELIOT FISK AND PACO PEÑA (Monday) Eliot Fisk, the great, high-energy classical guitarist, and Paco Peña, the fine flamenco player, join forces for a recital that includes music by Albéniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Granados, Paganini, Scarlatti, Mendelssohn and Bach, as well as Mr. Peña's own works. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>VADIM GLUZMAN (Tonight) This violinist's program goes all the way from Mozart to Castelnuovo-Tedesco. 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $25. (Holland)</p>
        <p>GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri is soldiering through another season as the de facto quartet in residence at the Met Museum. Each of the group's concerts features a Mozart chamber composition, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Clarinet Quintet (with David Shifrin), as well as Arriaga's Quartet No. 2 and Dohnanyi's Quartet in A minor. 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Gerard Schwarz, a hometown conductor heard less in New York these days, conducts the Juilliard's young professional-quality players in Mahler, David Diamond and Behzad Ranjbaran, with the violinist William Harvey. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* KRONOS QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) This ensemble's wide-ranging ''Live Mix'' series continues with two concerts in which the boundaries between classical, pop and world music are exceedingly porous. Tonight the quartet plays works by Glenn Branca, best known for his huge electric guitar symphonies, as well as ones by Terry Riley, a founder of Minimalism; the eclectic rock composer J. G. Thirlwell; and the pipa virtuoso Wu Man. Tomorrow the quartet, with the Indian singer Asha Bhosle and the tabla player Zakir Hussain, plays music by the Icelandic band Sigur Ros and the composers Derek Charke, Ram Narayan and Rahul Dev Burman. Tonight at 7:30 at Zankel Hall, tomorrow at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35 tonight, $21 to $72 tomorrow. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>MIAMI STRING QUARTET (Sunday) This excellent group, in residence at the Hartt School in Connecticut, has been admirably committed to contemporary music. But this time, in the essential (and affordable) Peoples' Symphony Concerts series, the quartet is playing works by Haydn, Schumann and Sibelius. ''Intimate Voices,'' the Sibelius quartet, is a deeply personal and hauntingly eclectic work, and may strike some as a bolder score than many works of more recent decades. 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leonard Slatkin made a superb recording of John Corigliano's powerful Symphony No. 1 during his years with the St. Louis Symphony, and he is taking it up again with the National Symphony. The program also includes Elgar's Introduction and Allegro (Op. 47) and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Emanuel Ax. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today) The orchestra spotlights talent from among its own ranks, with the concertmaster Glenn Dicterow performing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3, and the principal trumpet player Philip Smith as the soloist in Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's ''American Concerto.'' Bramwell Tovey conducts, adding a Mozart overture and Franck's Symphony. 11 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>PEABODY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) The prestigious Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore regularly sends its impressive student ensemble on tour to make music and spread the word about the institution. With its music director, Hajime Teri Murai, the orchestra plays an adventurous program with New York premieres of works by Christopher Theofanidis and Michael Hersch; Paquito D'Rivera's ''Gran Danzon'' (a flute concerto); and Mahler's mighty ''Das Lied von der Erde.'' 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $18. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC (Sunday and Monday) The first installments of Valery Gergiev's cycle of Shostakovich's symphonies, with the Kirov Orchestra last month, were both invigorating and revelatory. Mr. Gergiev takes up the project with the Rotterdam Philharmonic, with contributions on Sunday from the Riverside Choral Society and the Rutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir. The programs include the Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 on Sunday, and Nos. 5 and 15 on Monday. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's humble, eloquent staging strips Bach's masterpiece to its humane core. No sets, no costumes -- just casually dressed musicians sitting in a circle, and soloists singing in English. Paul Goodwin conducts Rufus Müller, Curtis Streetman, Krisztina Szabo, Suzie LeBlanc, Daniel Taylor, Nils Brown and Stephen Varcoe. Tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $30 to $90. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>ANDREAS SCHOLL (Tuesday) Countertenors are on the rise, and Mr. Scholl is one of the fastest-rising of the bunch, with a rounded, fluty instrument and a definite flair in how he sings with it. His program is a potpourri, ranging from the late Middle Ages to Haydn and Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>TRIBECA NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) ''Music of the Avant-Pop'' is the title for this disparate festival of four concerts extending through May, presented by the avowedly eclectic New York Art Ensemble.

        <p>* LES BALLETS GRANDIVA (Monday) This all-male drag ballet company may seem to be performing for laughs, but there is a great deal of loving knowledge and technical expertise in the classical and contemporary pieces (including Peter Anastos's new ''Serenadiana'') presented by these dancers, former members of troupes that include the Kirov Ballet, American Ballet Theater and the National Ballet of Canada. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, or www.balletsgrandiva.com.

        <p>CHRIS &amp; JUSTIN (Tonight through Sunday) Chris Yon and Justin Jones get this week's best-title award for ''Pear Cowboy Planet,'' which they describe, unfortunately, as a tragicomic triptych about the mysterious properties of addition and subtraction. Oh, well, so much for poetic ambiguity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10, Sunday at 5:30 p.m., the Club at La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, www.lamama.org; $15.

        <p>JOHN PASSAFIUME DANCERS (Tomorrow and Sunday) A protégé of Paul Sanasardo and a former dancer with Anna Sokolow, Mr. Passafiume's new ''Fissures,'' inspired by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, examines the way everyday events can cause fault lines in our perceptions of ourselves. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Sunday at 5 p.m., Clark Studio Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 243-4370; $25. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>JAMES SEWELL BALLET (Tonight through Sunday) Mr. Sewell, a New York expatriate who now works in Minneapolis, returns with his company in a program of dances that include ''Guy Noir: The Ballet,'' a collaboration with Garrison Keillor; ''Anagram,'' a choreographic response to music by Schubert; and ''Involution,'' which mixes ballet and improvisation. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, www.joyce.org; $40. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>'SHARING THE LEGACY: DANCE MASTERWORKS OF THE 20TH CENTURY' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The masterworks in question are by choreographers who include George Balanchine, Merce Cunningham, Laura Dean, José Limón, Mark Morris and Antony Tudor. The performers are young dancers from 10 colleges across the nation, among them New York's own Hunter College, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and Purchase College's Conservatory of Dance. 8 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>
        <p>SUGAR SALON LAUNCH (Monday) Five panelists, including the choreographer Susan Marshall and Wendy Perron, editor in chief of Dance Magazine, will participate in ''What Does the Future Hold for Women in Modern Dance?''

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>TRINAYAN COLLECTIVE (Thursday) This New York-based company of Indian classical dancers will explore the notion of the witness in ''Sakshi/Witness,'' a dance in the Odissi style. (Through April 16.) 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo, (212) 334-7479; $25; $20 for students and 65+. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>WORK AND SHOW FESTIVAL (Tonight, tomorrow and Monday) The dance component of this festival ends with performances of work by Baraka de Soleil and D Underbelly (tonight) and a marathon of works by all participants (tomorrow).

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>KEVIN WYNN COLLECTION (Tonight through Sunday) Known for his high-energy, fast-sweeping group pieces, Mr. Wynn will present ''Tracing Sirocco,'' which he describes as a ''hallucinogenic ensemble work for 16 dancers'' that is set in an African desert and danced to a soundscape by Luna Reyes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, www.smartix.com; $18. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through April 24. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally-savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot . 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* FRANCIS PICABIA: 'WORKS ON PAPER, 1901-1951' Consistent with the predominantly linear, sometimes kitschy imagery of the artist's proto-postmodern transparency paintings, the 100 works on paper here reveal a lifelong involvement with drawing, marked by an indifference to notions of style, taste, consistency, skill or progress. It is both a challenge and a treat. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab he was working in. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>RECENT PAINTINGS BY QIN FENG Working in ink and tea on silk-cotton paper, this 45-year-old Chinese artist continues the long tradition of Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, with assists from Japanese sumi-ink painting and Abstract Expressionists like Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. Goedhius Contemporary, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 535-6934, through April 17. (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'REFLECTIONS OF GODS' Ensconced in a small, chapel-like gallery, this exhibition of nine sacred objects and one hanging screen includes a beautiful 16th-century mask and a 12th-century carved wood sculpture of a Shinto deity holding a Buddhist wish-granting jewel. Mika Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-3900, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* 'SPRING MIST FROM SNOW' This veritable wonder cabinet of furniture, objects and artworks conjures up the rarefied realm of the Chinese scholar's study but also represents other Asian cultures. One stand-out is a Qing wish-granting scepter in carved boxwood that must be among the fountainheads of Art Nouveau; its provenance is listed as ''an old French collection.'' William Lipton Ltd., 41 East 57th Street, (212) 751-8131, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>Tara Donovan Known for creating improbable accumulations of ordinary things, Ms. Donovan here has arranged three million plastic cups in stacks from ankle-high to five feet. They make a 50-by-60-foot rectangle on the floor, resembling a lumpy field of snow. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Dan Fischer Velvety graphite drawings copied from Xerox copies of book and magazine images of well-known artists like Robert Smithson and Sol LeWitt and artworks like Jeff Koons's iconic ''Rabbit'' evoke and possibly satirize the reverence that some people feel for modern and contemporary art. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Great Performance: Contemporary Chinese Photography' This group show updates the careers of artists who gained notice in the 1990's and gives some exposure to others who are still unfamiliar here. The real find is work by two women, Yin Xiuzhen and the formidable young performance artist Chen Qiulin. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through April 15. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Anthony James Call it Industrial Surrealist Chic. Mr. James's works include old heavy-duty power tools displayed in gleaming, mirrored cases; a glass case of white birch tree trunks that seems to extend infinitely by virtue of two-way mirrors; and a life-size, digitally copied female nude of laser-cut aluminum. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Daniel Johnston: 'The Story of an Artist' The nearly 70 ballpoint and felt-tip drawings by this semi-outsider artist and rock musician and 2006 Whitney Biennial pick don't live up to the hype, but they are fun to look at. In a distracted but versatile, faux-adolescent style, the Texas-based Mr. Johnston creates sweet and sometimes hair-raising cartoon improvisations on themes of love, sex, hope, despair and death. Clementine, 632 West 27th Street, (212) 243-5937, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Eve K. Tremblay: 'Tales Without Grounds' A rising young Canadian photographer presents glossy staged photographs of people doing enigmatic things in and around a large facility for hydroponic lettuce cultivation. With their cinematically intense colors, Ms. Tremblay's pictures are like stills from a Tarkovskian science fiction movie. Buia, 541 West 23rd Street, (212) 366-9915, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>TIM BARBER A fresh, even touching reprise of the overused convention of walls papered with unframed photographs and small cartoonish drawings, this show has been culled from Mr. Barber's Web site, tinyvices.com. With 250 people represented, it blurs the line between professional and amateur and introduces a savvy curatorial eye. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Marcel Broodthaers This reverential exhibition of just three works by a Belgian Conceptualist regarded as a Duchampian saint in some sectors of the art world includes a hat painted white and attached to a canvas painted black and white; a work called ''L'Erreur,'' consisting of 45 eggshells attached to a canvas labeled ''moules,'' the French word for mussels; and a set of canvases neatly inscribed with words relating to the composition and sale of paintings. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Rico Gatson: 'African Fractals' Mr. Gatson's suave geometric paintings and sculptures of symbolically charged vernacular objects -- a whipping post in the form of a Christian cross with wrist-holes, for example -- feature African-style stripe patterns, creating a dialogue between utopian Modernism and tragic social history. A video installation produces hypnotic patterns out of films of the pageantry surrounding the great boxing match between Muhammed Ali and George Foreman that took place in Zaire in 1974. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Joëlle Tuerlinckx: 'Drawing Inventory' A prominent Belgian conceptualist presents a dry and oblique installation consisting of a large quantity of ordinary materials more or less related to the art of drawing. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* 'ARTS OF ANCIENT CHINA' A museum-quality selection that begins with an elegant Neolithic red pottery bowl includes rare examples of early lacquer and is especially notable for its profusion of bronze vessels and objects. J. J. Lally, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380; closes Wednesday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THIERRY DE CORDIER AND PIERRE HUYGHE Mr. de Cordier's ''Female Drawings'' evoke blurred, semi-abstract Madonnas and also the recherché style of postwar European figuration. Mr. Huyghe's puppet video, ''This is Not a Time for Dreaming,'' which ruminates on, and was commissioned for, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard -- suffers from obscurity, but is still one of the most beautiful videos made in recent years. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 581-5187; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* REALM OF THE GODS: ART FROM INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA A lavish display of sculptures of Hindu deities and Buddhist monks offers excellent examples of several of India's dynastic and regional styles in bronze, sandstone and terra cotta, along with works from Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia and, especially, Tibet. Carlton Rochell, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7600; closes today. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Charlotta Westergren: 'Ahus Sommaren 1974' Preoccupied by her family and ancestry, Ms. Westergren presents a James Turrell-like room with artificial aroma added, designed to simulate the light and smell of a summer home in Sweden. She also presents Swedish wildflowers made of sugar by a professional confectioner and her own reprisals of old paintings by a beloved sister who once aspired to become an artist. Bellwether, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-5959; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)</p>

        <p>'GUARDIANS' Opens Tuesday. A favorite from the 2005 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, this series of monologues juxtaposes the Abu Ghraib scandal in the United States with the release by a London newspaper of forged photos of English soldiers torturing detainees. Jason Moore directs (1:30). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983.</p>
        <p>'PEER GYNT' Opens Tuesday.

        <p>'AWAKE AND SING!' Opens April 17. Lincoln Center revives Clifford Odets's classic fist-shaking drama about a Jewish family struggling to survive during the Depression. The impressive cast includes Mark Ruffalo, Ben Gazzara and Zoë Wanamaker (2:30). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' Opens May 1. This little-musical-that-could about an unscrupulous Broadway producer in the 1920's (some things never change) began at the Toronto Fringe Festival and now makes its unlikely premiere on the Great White Way (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'A FINE AND PRIVATE PLACE' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 27. Redemption is a major theme of this musical fantasy adapted from a Peter S. Beagle novel about a recluse who lives in a Bronx cemetery (2:00). York Theater, St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444.</p>
        <p>'LANDSCAPE OF THE BODY' Opens April 16. John Guare, never satisfied with an overly tidy play, throws comedy, tragedy, satire and mystery into this cult drama, which first opened almost three decades ago. Lili Taylor and Sherie Rene Scott star (2:15). Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529.</p>
        <p>'LESTAT' Opens April 25. Elton John and Bernie Taupin have a good track record making pop hits, but can they find success in the cursed genre of the vampire musical? Hugh Panaro stars (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'SCREWMACHINE/EYECANDY OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE BIG BOB' Previews start Thursday. Opens April 16. C. J. Hopkins's dark drama, a hit at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival, is about a game show host even more bizarre than Bob Barker (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200.</p>
        <p>'TARZAN' Opens May 10. Phil Collins lends his invisible touch to the score of the latest Disney musical. David Henry Hwang wrote the book (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100.</p>
        <p>'THREE DAYS OF RAIN' Opens April 19.

        <p>'THE THREEPENNY OPERA' Opens April 20. If any Broadway theater was made for a revival of Brecht's classic, it's the cabaret-style Studio 54, which will be host to an intriguing cast that includes Alan Cumming and Cyndi Lauper (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300.</p>
        <p>'THE WEDDING SINGER' Opens April 27. Stephen Lynch plays the goofy title character in this musical adaptation of the Adam Sandler film about leg warmers, Billy Idol and other artifacts from the 1980's. John Rando (''Urinetown'') directs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>'BAREFOOT IN THE PARK' For a work that celebrates the liberating force of spontaneity, this revival of Neil Simon's 1963 comedy doesn't have one scene that feels organic, let alone impromptu. Directed by Scott Elliott, and starring Patrick Wilson and a miscast Amanda Peet as newlyweds in Greenwich Village, this ''Barefoot'' has the robotic gait of Frankenstein's monster (2:20). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'BRIDGE &amp; TUNNEL' This delightful solo show, written and performed by Sarah Jones, is a sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America. In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' The arrival of Jonathan Pryce and his eloquent eyebrows automatically makes this the season's most improved musical. With Mr. Pryce (who replaces the admirable but uneasy John Lithgow) playing the silken swindler to Norbert Leo Butz's vulgar grifter, it's as if a mismatched entry in a three-legged race had become an Olympic figure-skating pair (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this drama by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE PAJAMA GAME'  Sexual chemistry in a Broadway musical? Isn't that illegal now? If it were, then Harry Connick Jr. and Kelli O'Hara -- the white-hot stars of Kathleen Marshall's delicious revival of this 1954 musical -- would be looking at long jail terms. This intoxicating production, which features a charming supporting cast led by Michael McKean, allows grown-up audiences the rare chance to witness a bona fide adult love affair translated into hummable songs and sprightly dance (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RING OF FIRE'  The man in black turns sunshine yellow in a show that strings songs associated with Johnny Cash into a big, bright candy necklace of a musical revue, created and directed by Richard Maltby Jr. In the current bio-flick ''Walk the Line,'' Cash wrestles demons; ''Ring of Fire'' wrestles with a really bad case of the cutes (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'WELL' Lisa Kron's sparkling autobiographical play about illness, integration and her mother (portrayed by with majestic warmth and weariness by Jayne Houdyshell) helps restore the honor of that tarnished literary form, the memoir. Though it shows the strain of scaling up for Broadway, this singular work, which stars Ms. Kron as herself, opens windows of insight and emotion found in no other show (1:40). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'DEFIANCE' The second play in John Patrick Shanley's cycle of morality dramas that began with ''Doubt,'' this ambitious tale of racial relations and the military mindset on a North Carolina marine base feels both overcrowded and oddly diffuse. If ''Doubt'' has an elegant and energy-efficient sprinter's gait, ''Defiance'' progresses with a flustered air of distraction. The excellent Margaret Colin, as an officer's wife, provides a welcome shot of credibility (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, Theater 1, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'ENTERTAINING MR. SLOANE' Miscasting is the mother of invention. Or so it proves to be for Jan Maxwell, who retailors an ill-fitting part and makes it as snug as a glove in this underpowered revival of Joe Orton's scandalous 1964 comedy. Scott Ellis's production of Orton's great farce of sexual hypocrisy, which also stars Alec Baldwin, is breezy, often funny and rarely convincing. (2:00). Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'GEORGE M. COHAN TONIGHT!'  The all-singing, all-dancing Jon Peterson summons the spirit of this legendary Broadway entertainer in this engaging one-man musical, devised and directed by Chip Deffaa (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (George Hunka)</p>
        <p>'GREY GARDENS'  As the socialite in limbo called ''Little'' Edie Beale, Christine Ebersole gives one of the most gorgeous performances ever to grace a musical. Unfortunately, she's a pearl of incalculable price in a show that is mostly costume jewelry. Adapted from the Maysles brothers' 1975 cult documentary movie, a camp favorite, and directed by Michael Greif, with the excellent Mary Louise Wilson as Edie's bedridden mother (2:40). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men (Robert Cuccioli and Rodney Hicks) and two women (Natascia Diaz and Gay Marshall) perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems. Ms. Marshall's captivating performance of ''Ne Me Quitte Pas,'' sung in the original French and with heart-stirring transparency, represents Brel at his best. (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'THE LIEUTENANT OF INISHMORE' Please turn off your political correctness monitor along with your cellphone for Martin McDonagh's gleeful, gory and appallingly entertaining play. This blood farce about terrorism in rural Ireland, acutely directed by Wilson Milam, has a carnage factor to rival Quentin Tarantino's. But it is also wildly, absurdly funny and, even more improbably, severely moral (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Closing Sunday. Moving to Broadway. Previews begin April 19; opens May 3 at the Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'A NIGHT IN NOVEMBER'  A soccer game in Belfast is a catalyst for personal transformation in Marie Jones's tour de force two-act monologue. Marty Maguire throws himself into the revival of this well-written, funny piece with an abandon that verges on hysteria. (1:30). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'PEN'  David Marshall Grant's sometimes preachy new three-character play is about an unhappy Long Island family in 1969. J. Smith-Cameron is fascinating to watch as she exposes the anguish behind the tough, angry exterior of the wheelchair-bound mother; Dan McCabe is uneven but believable as the troubled teenage son who wants to get away from her; and Reed Birney is less persuasive as the ex-husband who has already left. The title object is a gift from the author to himself: it allows something impossible to happen. (2:15). Playwrights Horizons, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)</p>
        <p>'THE PROPERTY KNOWN AS GARLAND' Adrienne Barbeau as Judy, backstage on the night of her last concert in Copenhagen. Billy Van Zandt's play is tawdry and dull, and Ms. Barbeau's performance offers neither the minor rewards of a decent impersonation nor the guilty pleasures of an indecent one. (1:30). The Actors Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'RED LIGHT WINTER'  A frank, occasionally graphic story of erotic fixation and the havoc it can wreak on sensitive types. Written and directed by Adam Rapp, this play is both a doomy romantic drama and a morbid comedy about the anxieties of male friendship. Although somewhat contrived, it features a lovely performance by Christopher Denham as a lonely soul starved for intimacy (2:25). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'A SAFE HARBOR FOR ELIZABETH BISHOP' The life of a great poet becomes the stuff of stale prose in this one-woman bio-play by Marta Goes, starring Amy Irving (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'SANDRA BERNHARD: EVERYTHING BAD AND BEAUTIFUL' Sandra Bernhard was a proverbial rock star long before headline-making folks in even the most prosaic walks of life were being referred to as such. Her new show, a collection of songs interspersed with musings on her life and on public figures ranging from Britney Spears to Condi Rice, is casual to the point of offhand. That said, it's invigorating to be in the presence of a true original (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, at Union Square, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* '[TITLE OF SHOW]' Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell are the authors, stars and subject matter of this delectable new musical about its own making. The self-consciousness is tempered by a wonderful cast performing with the innocence of kids cavorting in a sandbox. It's a worthy postmodern homage to the classic backstage musicals, and an absolute must for show queens (1:30). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 353-0303. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'TRANSATLANTIC LIAISON'  A play fashioned from Simone de Beauvoir's love letters to the American novelist Nelson Algren and scenes from her novel ''The Mandarins'' (which tells the story of their affair). Wonderful performances by Elizabeth Rothan as de Beauvoir in love, and Matthew S. Tompkins as the emotional Algren (1:30). Harold Clurman Theater on Theater Row, 412 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Honor Moore)</p>
        <p>Off Off Broadway</p>
        <p>'BURIED CHILD' Tom Herman's revival makes something known new by revealing how close Sam Shepard's play about a dysfunctional Midwest family is to tragic opera, speechlike arias included. The Michael Chekhov Theater Company is presenting 45 Shepard plays, and this first effort sounds a positive note. (2:30) Big Little Theater, 141 Ridge Street, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444. (Stevens)</p>
        <p>'WE USED TO GO OUT' Jason Mantzoukas and Jessica St. Clair revive the tradition of male-female comedy team in this appealing sketch about a disintegrating romance (1:00). UCB Theater, 306 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-9176. (Jason Zinoman)</p>
        <p>Long-Running Shows</p>
        <p>* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)</p>
        <p>'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton,(212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>'BERNARDA ALBA' Michael John LaChiusa's musical adaptation of Federico García Lorca's tragedy of sexual repression often feels wan and weary, though not for want of erotic imagery. The ominous, oppressive atmosphere that makes Lorca's play so much more than a potboiler is mostly missing in inaction. Graciela Daniele directs a game ensemble led by a miscast Phylicia Rashad (1:30). Mitzi Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'THE MUSIC TEACHER, A PLAY/OPERA' A pair of interlocking monologues surrounding a little parody of an opera, with text by Wallace Shawn and music by his brother Allen. Written two decades ago and shelved when the authors failed to find a producer, this is a minor-key, underrealized work that hits a few elegiac notes but steps too gingerly around the psychosexual trauma at its core (1:45). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)</p>
        <p>* 'RABBIT HOLE' Thanks to a certain former American president, it has become almost impossible to say that you feel someone else's pain without its sounding like a punch line. Yet the sad, sweet release of David Lindsay-Abaire's wrenching play, about the impact of the death of a small child, lies precisely in the access it allows to the pain of others, in its meticulously mapped empathy. With an emotionally transparent five-member cast led by Cynthia Nixon and Tyne Daly, directed by Daniel Sullivan, this anatomy of grief doesn't so much jerk tears as tap them (2:10). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200; closing Sunday. (Brantley)</p>
        <p>'TRIAL BY WATER'  Qui Nguyen, raising worthwhile questions about how to live a humane and moral life in the real world, has based his play on the experiences of a cousin who survived a voyage of Vietnamese refugees in the South China Sea that ended in murder and cannibalism. Though the actors are not able to surmount the play's unfortunate didacticism and melodrama, Clint Ramos's stunning wooden set does. (1:30).

        <p>* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)'  O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; closing Sunday. (212) 352-3101.

        <p>'ATL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A couple of rap stars make respectable starts on acting careers in this tale of black teenagers in Atlanta, despite a script marred by clichés and predictability. Tip Harris -- the rapper T. I. -- is intriguing as a young man who takes on the responsibility of raising his younger brother when their parents are killed, and Antwan Andre Patton -- Big Boi from OutKast -- makes a terrific drug lord. (Neil Genzlinger)</p>
        <p>'BASIC INSTINCT 2' (R, 120 minutes) A joyless calculation, starring Sharon Stone and directed by Michael Caton-Jones, that is also a prime object lesson in the degradation that can face Hollywood actresses, especially those over 40. (Manohla Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'THE BEAUTY ACADEMY OF KABUL' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Dari) In the summer of 2004, a group of volunteer American hairstylists arrived in Kabul to open a school. In ''The Beauty Academy of Kabul,'' the director Liz Mermin documents the hilarious, moving and sometimes fractious meeting of diametrically different cultures, one having suffered unimaginable horrors and the other believing a good perm is the answer to everything. (Jeannette Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. (Mr. Lee won the Academy Award for best director.) Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. (Mr. Hoffman won the Academy Award for best actor.) Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott)</p>
        <p>'CRASH' (Academy Award, Best Picture) (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, within an extremely hectic 36 hours. Well intentioned, impressively acted but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'DAVE CHAPPELLE'S BLOCK PARTY' (R, 103 minutes) The setup is blissfully simple: a free block party on a dead-end street in Bed-Stuy, with a lineup of musicians, some of whom, like Kanye West and Mos Def, have put in appearances on ''Chappelle's Show.'' The nominal idea, Mr. Chappelle explains on camera, was ''the concert I've always wanted to see.'' The result, which ping-pongs between Brooklyn and Mr. Chappelle's hometown in Ohio, is a tantalizing sketch-portrait of the artist amid an outpouring of hard beats and soul. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON' (PG-13, 110 minutes) The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about Daniel Johnston, a mentally ill songwriter whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living. Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best director award at the 2005 Sundance Festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs. (Dana Stevens)</p>
        <p>* 'DRAWING RESTRAINT 9' (No rating, 135 minutes) Most of this stately film of few words, conceived and directed by the artist Matthew Barney, who co-stars with his wife, Bjork, takes place on a Japanese whaling ship afloat in Nagasaki Bay. Steeped not only in Japanese seafaring lore but also in centuries-old traditions of Japanese ritual, the film could be described as Mr. Barney's ''Moby-Dick.'' (Holden)</p>
        <p>* 'FIND ME GUILTY' (R, 124 minutes) This gripping courtroom drama, directed by Sidney Lumet, now 81 and near the top of his game, is based on the 1987-88 trial of 20 members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family on multiple counts. Vin Diesel turns in a sensational performance as Giacomo DiNorscio, better known as Jackie Dee, who broke from the ranks of his fellow defendants to be his own defense lawyer. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN' (PG, 93 minutes) Creative exhaustion haunts ''Ice Age: The Meltdown,'' as the characters from 2002's ''Ice Age'' face global warming and the submersion of their valley. While the animals head for safety in a giant, arklike boat, the director, Carlos Saldanha, indulges in biblical imagery and bad science. Over all, a flat and uninspired follow-up to a vastly superior movie. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'INSIDE MAN' (R, 128 minutes) The latest from Spike Lee takes a familiar setup -- in this case, a Wall Street bank heist that mutates into a hostage crisis -- and twists it ever so slightly and nicely. Among the film's most sustained pleasures are its holy trinity -- Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster -- and the best lineup of pusses and mugs outside ''The Sopranos.'' (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'LONESOME JIM' (R, 91 minutes) Steve Buscemi directed this deadpan comedy about a depressed 27-year-old writer (Casey Affleck) who returns from New York in defeat to his childhood home in rural Indiana and takes a job in his parents' ladder factory. (Holden)</p>
        <p>'MARILYN HOTCHKISS BALLROOM DANCING AND CHARM SCHOOL' (PG-13, 103 minutes) John Goodman plays a dying crash victim on his way to a 40-year-old appointment, and Robert Carlyle is the widowed baker entrusted with keeping it. Instead he meets Marisa Tomei, who teaches him to dance and, more important, throw away his wife's ashes. Toggling back and forth between past and present, ''Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing and Charm School'' is a soggy, endless wallow in nostalgia and the healing power of very bad dancing. (Catsoulis)</p>
        <p>* 'SLITHER' (R, 96 minutes) A horror film about an extraterrestrial monster with a hunger for flesh that slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation. The writer and director James Gunn knows his icky, scary stuff. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'Thank You for Smoking' (R, 92 minutes) The director Jason Reitman has made a glib and funny movie from Christopher Buckley's glib and funny novel about a Big Tobacco lobbyist, but the real attraction here is the hard-working star, Aaron Eckhart. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'TORO NEGRO' (No rating, 87 minutes, in Spanish) A disturbed young matador stabs animals, beats his wife and drinks himself to the edge of oblivion in this harrowing, deeply suspect documentary set in rural Mexico. (Nathan Lee)</p>
        <p>* 'TRISTRAM SHANDY: A COCK AND BULL STORY' (R, 91 minutes) Michael Winterbottom both confirms and refutes the assumption that Laurence Sterne's 18th-century masterpiece of digression could never be made into a movie by making a movie about the making of such a movie. Steve Coogan is wonderful as Tristram, Tristram's father and himself, though Rob Brydon steals more than a few of Mr. Coogan's scenes. (Scott)</p>
        <p>'Tsotsi' (R, 94 minutes) (Academy Award winner for best foreign film.) Written and directed by Gavin Hood, from a novel by Athol Fugard, this South African film centers on a 19-year-old thug who steals a baby and finds redemption. You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>'V for Vendetta' (R, 131 minutes) James McTeigue directs this D-for-dumb future-shock story about a masked avenger (Hugo Weaving) and his pipsqueak sidekick (Natalie Portman) at war against a totalitarian British regime. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'YANG BAN XI: THE 8 MODEL WORKS' (No rating, 90 minutes, in Mandarin) In her documentary about Chinese propaganda of the campiest kind (think rosy-cheeked, chubby-kneed dancers leaping across the stage, guns clutched in one hand, Little Red Books in the other), the director Yan-Ting Yuen revisits the Cultural Revolution to explore the history and legacy of one of the strangest byproducts of totalitarian madness: the revolutionary spectacular. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>* 'NEIL YOUNG: HEART OF GOLD' (PG, 103 minutes) Filled with country memories, bluesy regret and familiar and piercing sentiment, Jonathan Demme's concert film sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or a turnoff. (Dargis)</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>AGAINST THE TIDE: REBELS &amp; MAVERICKS IN CONTEMPORARY JAPANESE FILM (Through April 16) Japan Society's spring film series, which began yesterday, continues this weekend with films including ''Wild Berries'' (2003), Miwa Nishikawa's satire of Japanese family values; and ''Kaza-hana'' (2001), the director Shinji Somai's last work, a drama about a bureaucrat and a young widow trying to redefine their damaged lives. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258; $10.

This weekend's films include ''The Calm'' (1976), about an ex-convict and a workers' strike; ''The Double Life of Veronique'' (1991); and all three parts of the Colors trilogy: ''Blue'' (1993), ''White'' (1994) and ''Red'' (1994).

        <p>DON SIEGEL (Through Thursday) Siegel, who died in 1991, was a master of several genres, including science fiction, westerns and police thrillers. Film Forum's four-week, 25-movie retrospective of his work concludes with a weeklong run of ''Dirty Harry'' (1971), his biggest hit. This is Clint Eastwood's first and best interpretation of Harry Callahan, a tough San Francisco cop who has been known to ask deserving punks whether they're feeling lucky. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110; $10. (Gates)</p>
        <p>VILLAGE VOICE BEST OF 2005 (Through April 26) This annual series, which opened yesterday, continues this weekend with three films. ''Funny Ha Ha'' (2003), Andrew Bujalski's debut feature, is a study of post-college life. Claire Denis's ''Intruder'' (2004) is a drama about a dying man.

(Gates)</p>
        <p>Pop</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>YOLANDA ADAMS (Tomorrow) Blending gospel and rhythm-and-blues, Yolanda Adams has a powerful voice, though it is used more for purposes of warm inspiration and uplifting solace than quasi-sexual shudders of praise. 8 and 10:30 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Midtown, (212) 997-4144; $65. (Laura Sinagra)</p>
        <p>EVA AYLLON (Tomorrow) Eva Ayllon is a stadium-filling star in Peru who, for more than 30 years, has placed her own stamp on the Afro-Peruvian folk heritage: songs with crisp syncopations played on instruments as basic as the box drum called the cajón. She adds a husky voice that never shies away from drama. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $25 to $45. (Jon Pareles)</p>
        <p>ANTI-FLAG (Thursday) You can't accuse this politically minded punk band of flip-flopping on the issues. Sure, it moved to the center on the subject of corporate record labels, but it still has lots of leftist bile to spew about topics like the lazy news media (''The Press Corpse''), big trade (''The W.T.O. Kills Farmers'') and plain old greed (''1 Trillion Dollar$''). 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $15.75 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>ASHA BHOSLE (Tomorrow) Ms. Bhosle is famous as a vocalist for Indian film. Here she performs reinterpreted Bollywood classics accompanied by the Kronos Quartet, with Zakir Hussaino on the tabla, and Wu Man on pipa. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $21 to $72. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>NEKO CASE (Tonight) The clarion voice that's best known as the transcendent secret weapon of the Canadian pop group New Pornographers belongs to this alt-country chanteuse, who performs her own songs here. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KEYSHIA COLE (Tomorrow)The R&amp;B singer Keyshia Cole presents a tough-cookie brand of diva soul that focuses less on fashionista posing than on righteous recrimination. On her single ''I Changed My Mind,'' she rides Kanye West's hard-clapping track with sultry grit. 9 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tomorrow) Donna the Buffalo is not named after its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. 6:30 p.m., Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780 or ticketmaster.com or (212) 307-7171; $16.50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>FRANZ FERDINAND, DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE (Thursday) At the vanguard of the post-post-punk trend, the poker-faced group Franz Ferdinand plays herky-jerky party music. Death Cab is a decorous diarist-rock band whose sound took on some added alternative-rock heft on its most recent album, ''Plans'' (Atlantic). 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, garment district, (212) 485-1534; $40 in advance, $45 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>GOGOL BORDELLO (Wednesday) Led by a gruff and extravagantly mustached Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, Gogol Bordello calls itself a Gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oompah that's the makings of a rowdy party. 7 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $22. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>HEARTLESS BASTARDS, THE SOLEDAD BROTHERS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Because of her primal yowl, the singer and guitarist Erika Wennerstrom is often compared to Robert Plant and Polly Harvey. The hungry stomp of her power trio, Heartless Bastards, is heavy enough for classic rockers and post-ironic enough for hipsters looking for bar band sincerity. The members switch off headlining slots with the Soledad Brothers. 10:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $12. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE HOLD STEADY, P.O.S. (Tonight) With hipster savvy and bar rock swagger, the Hold Steady savant Craig Finn spews an almost unseemly amount of pop culture references in a voice that recalls Bruce Springsteen's. The indie-rapper P.O.S. also performs. 8, Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $16.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE iO'S (Tuesday) Just like the Canadian band Stars, the iO's remind you of that exuberant 90's moment when bands like Mavis Piggott and Madder Rose made it seem that smart girl voices over big guitars were the way of the future. The iO's have a guy singer, too. But as in Stars, the female voice is the more affecting. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TALIB KWELI (Tonight) This brainy rapper's agile attack still lacks Jigga's precision, 50 Cent's swagger and Nas's anguish. But his rapping can be beautiful when he laments things like Lauryn Hill's exit from the music scene. 8 p.m., Pratt Institute Student Union, 200 Willoughby Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, (718) 636-3422; free for Pratt students, $4 for nonstudents. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KYP MALONE (Tomorrow) With his ethereal falsetto and coronal afro, Kyp Malone is known to many as a vocalist and guitarist in the spacy local band TV on the Radio. For years, though, he was a fixture on San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $8. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>McCULLOUGH SONGS OF THUNDER, THE BIRMINGHAM SUNLIGHTS (Tomorrow) The 16-piece ''shout'' gospel brass band, McCullough Songs of Thunder, from the United House of Prayer for All People in Harlem, aims to blare its devotion so loudly and joyously that the angels have to sing along. They are joined here by the Birmingham Sunlights, a traditional a cappella gospel group. 8 p.m., Harlem Center for the Performing Arts, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100; Free. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SUSAN McKEOWN (Tonight) Susan McKeown interprets Irish traditionals with a distinctive intensity. Accompanying her here are some musicians who play on her most recent recording: the fiddler Dana Lyn and the guitarist Eamon O'Leary. 9, Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, 1 Washington Mews, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-3950; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>BETH ORTON (Tuesday) Though her voice, which recalls the best of the English folk tradition, should be enough to put her songs across, the quality of Ms. Orton's work has often depended on her adept collaborations. Her most recent is with the post-rock gadfly Jim O'Rourke. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>QUASI (Monday and Tuesday) Sam Coomes and his ex-wife, the Sleater-Kinney drummer Janet Weiss, make tempestuous indie-rock that veers toward apocalypse blues. Monday at 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $12 in advance, $14 at the door. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103; $12 in advance , $14 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE RACONTEURS (Tonight) Jack White of the White Stripes and the power-pop talent Brendan Benson team up with members of the Greenhorns in this assertive side project. They play garage-rock cut with incisive pop hooks. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>RJD2, BEANS (Tonight) Representing an offshoot of the record-store scavenging D.J. tradition exemplified in the 1990's by the likes of DJ Shadow, RJD2 takes a cinematic approach. The rapper Beans, formerly of Antipop Consortium, has made a solo career out of meshing his surreal lyrics with the work of electronic-rock artists and culture-hopping D.J.'s. 9, Guggenheim Auditorium, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500; $20 (cash at door only, free for members).(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>JOSH ROUSE (Tonight) This confessional singer-songwriter gives contemplative navel-gazing a Nashville twist. 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Midtown, (212) 840-2824; $22.50 to $26.50. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>SOWETO GOSPEL CHOIR (Sunday) Gospel music and traditional South African harmonies and rhythms have found common ground and hybrid possibilities since Christian missionaries arrived in South Africa in the 19th century. This 32-member choir carries the fusion toward jubilation, performing traditional songs (and ''Mbube,'' the Zulu song better known as ''The Lion Sleeps Tonight''), alongside gospel messages. 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722;$17 to $50. (Pareles)</p>
        <p>THE SOUNDS, MORNINGWOOD (Wednesday) The Sounds are a Swedish band that plays sugar-sharp arena pop with a pinch of bad-girl sass. Morningwood is more punky, though somehow less authentic. 7:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $18 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>REGINA SPEKTOR (Tuesday) The Russian-born singer and pianist Regina Spektor brings punk immediacy into a cabaret setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and unhinged melodrama. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 387-0505; $20. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>KREMENA STANCHEVA (Tomorrow) Ms. Stancheva is a member of Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares, the Bulgarian vocal group that created one of world music's first minibooms in the late 1980's. She has been with the group for 45 years. This concert and folklore presentation allows her to apply her many years of Bulgarian song scholarship. 8 p.m., Bulgarian Consulate General, 121 East 62nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 935-4646; $15. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>THE SWORD (Tonight and Sunday) The Texans in the Sword do a great approximation of Black Sabbath's slow menace, at points also revealing hard-core punk underpinnings with thrash bravura. Tonight at 8:30, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J.,(201) 653-1703; $8 in advance, $10 at the door. Sunday at 7 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village; (212) 982-4052; $10 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>TINARIWEN (Tonight) This guitar band from the deserts of Mali turns Tuareg culture's acoustic music into a chant-based kind of distended electric blues, addressing the issues of exile, displacement and poverty. 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>WOLFMOTHER (Tuesday) Part of a wave of what's been dubbed ''heritage metal,'' the Australian trio Wolfmother strives to sound like Black Sabbath and Blue Cheer. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Sold out. (Sinagra)</p>
        <p>WOLF PARADE (Sunday and Monday) Part of Montreal's wave of ''It'' art-pop bands that includes Arcade Fire and Unicorns, Wolf Parade has a Northern noir take on keyboard-heavy epics. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. Sold out.(Sinagra)</p>
        <p>Cabaret</p>
        <p>Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL (Sunday) Even when swinging out, this Lady of a Thousand Songs remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. 2 p.m., Algonquin Hotel, Oak Room, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $55, including brunch at noon.

        <p>BLOSSOM DEARIE (Sunday) To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. The songs date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit. 6:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $15 minimum, or $54.50 for a dinner-and-show package. (Holden)</p>
        <p>BABY JANE DEXTER (Tomorrow) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7 p.m., Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20, with a $15 minimum. (Holden)</p>
        <p>ANNIE ROSS (Wednesday) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 9:15 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden)</p>

        <p>ALPHABET LOUNGE BIG BAND (Sunday) Led by the pianist Deidre Rodman, this large ensemble expands on the mischievous eclecticism of the Jazz Passengers, with a lineup that includes Kate McGarry on vocals; Roy Nathanson, Ohad Talmor and Jay Rodriguez on saxophones; Sam Bardfeld on violin; and Curtis Fowlkes on trombone. 6 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Nate Chinen)</p>
        <p>MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Tonight) Pulse and texture shift perpetually in this trio, thanks to the earthy rhythm team of Ben Allison and Jeff Ballard, on bass and drums; but the group's capricious tone is set by Mr. Blake, on tenor and soprano saxophones. 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GARY BURTON'S GENERATIONS (Wednesday through April 15) Mr. Burton, the extravagantly proficient vibraphonist, educator and composer, features younger talent exclusively in this ensemble, reserving a central role for the teenage guitar prodigy Julian Lage. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILLY CHILDS CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Wednesday through April 16) The pianist and composer Billy Childs favors a billowy sound that often drifts perilously close to New Age. But behind a genteel front line of piano, saxophone, harp and guitar lurks the action-oriented rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Antonio Sanchez on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with 11:30 sets Fridays and Saturdays, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $25, $30 Fridays and Saturdays. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>LOU DONALDSON QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) Bebop, blues and boogaloo are all fair game for the veteran alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who receives strong support here from Dr. Lonnie Smith on Hammond B-3 organ, Randy Johnston on guitar and Fukushi Tainaka on drums. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; cover, $35, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SHANE ENDSLEY GROUP (Monday) An ethereal sense of groove guides this chamber ensemble, which enfolds Mr. Endsley's trumpet in a dark cocoon of Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone, guitar, bass and drums. Sharing the bill is Common Thread, a flintier band featuring Mr. Endsley but led by another trumpeter, Jonathan Finlayson. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GOOD FOR COWS (Tonight and tomorrow) The bassist Devin Hoff and the drummer Ches Smith constitute this Bay Area duo, which interrogates jazz and punk with equal rigor. Tonight they share the bill with another duo, Sonar, from Brooklyn; tomorrow their second set will feature a special guest, the pianist Vijay Iyer. Tonight at 8, Issue Project Room, 400 Carroll Street, between Bond and Nevins Streets, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, (718) 330-0313, issueprojectroom.org; cover, $10.

        <p>JON GORDON QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Gordon, an accomplished alto and soprano saxophonist, projects standards through a slightly warped lens, with the help of Mike Moreno on guitar, Aaron Goldberg on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. 10, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 675-7369; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* BARRY HARRIS AND REGINA CARTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Harris, one of bebop's stalwart pianists, and Ms. Carter, a violinist of sleek composure, both hail from Detroit, a fact that has some bearing on this concert of newly commissioned music, featuring each artist with a separate ensemble. 8, Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500; $105.50 and $135.50. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>BILLY HART QUARTET (Tuesday through April 16) Mr. Hart, a loose but focused drummer with a sterling résumé, fronts a dream team of younger players: the tenor saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the bassist Ben Street. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>WILL HOLSHOUSER TRIO (Thursday) Mr. Holshouser is an accordionist in tune with his instrument's folk legacy, but hardly constricted by it; his longstanding trio, with the trumpeter Ron Horton and the bassist David Phillips, manages a playful sort of melancholy. 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STANLEY JORDAN TRIO (Through Sunday) Mr. Jordan applies a distinctive tapping technique to the fretboard of his guitar, producing a harmonic range more suggestive of pianism. His rhythm section consists of Zirque Bonner on bass and Ed Barattini on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>STEVE LEHMAN GROUP (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Lehman, an intense young saxophonist, features his own sharp-cornered compositions in this ensemble, which derives much of its heft from the drumming of Tyshawn Sorey. Wednesday at 10 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover, $8. Thursday at 8 and 10 p.m., Jimmy's Restaurant, 43 East Seventh Street, East Village, (212) 982-3006; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>JIMMY McGRIFF GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) A powerfully bluesy presence on the Hammond B-3 organ since the early 1960's, Mr. McGriff marked his 70th birthday earlier this week and continues the celebration here. 9 and 11 p.m., and 12:30 a.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662; cover, $25. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>CHARNETT MOFFETT (Monday) Mr. Moffett may be a few years late with his new album, ''Internet'' (Piadrum), but his bass playing is characteristically solid, and he surrounds himself with good musicians -- in this case, the alto saxophonist Vincent Herring, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Eric McPherson. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $10 at tables with a $5 minimum or $5 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GRACHAN MONCUR III BAND (Tomorrow and Sunday) Mr. Moncur was one of the first trombonists to make sense of free improvisation, compellingly, in the 1960's; this modern ensemble includes such kindred adventurers as the saxophonists Billy Harper and Michael Blake and the pianist John Hicks. 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121; cover, $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>PAUL MOTIAN QUARTET (Through Sunday) The teasingly suggestive drumming of Mr. Motian is just one of several enigmas posed by this ensemble, which is also distinguished by the tightly coiled alto saxophone scribbles of Greg Osby and the abstruse pianism of Masabumi Kikuchi. Larry Grenadier, on bass, serves a welcome clarifying purpose. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover, $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* DAVID MURRAY QUARTET/ODEAN POPE SAXOPHONE CHOIR (Through Sunday) In terms of sheer saxophone bluster, it would be tough to conjure a weightier double bill than this one, which pairs the avant-garde tenor titan David Murray (with Lafayette Gilchrist on piano, Jaribu Shahid on bass and Hamid Drake on drums) and Odean Pope's signature ensemble (nine saxophones, including Mr. Pope, and a rhythm section). 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover, $30 at tables with a $5 minimum or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SAXOPHONE SUMMIT (Tuesday through April 16) The alto saxophonist Charles McPherson has always nursed a fondness for Charlie Parker's blistering bebop, so his role in this Parker tribute makes perfect sense. So does the supporting cast: Tom Harrell on trumpet, Ronnie Mathews on piano, Ray Drummond on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (For NYC &amp; Company discount, (212) 484-1222.) (Chinen)</p>
        <p>SKIRL RECORDS LAUNCH PARTY (Tuesday) Skirl is an independent label with the stated objective of documenting new music by a Brooklyn-centered cadre of musicians. The first three bands on its roster will perform here: the Clarinets, featuring Anthony Burr, Oscar Noriega and Chris Speed (the label's founder); Ted Reichman's My Ears Are Bent; and Curtis Hasselbring's New Mellow Edwards. Also on hand is a pair of bands with Skirl releases in the foreseeable future: Tyft (Hilmar Jensson on guitar, Andrew D'Angelo on reeds and Jim Black on drums) and Mr. Noriega's trio (with Trevor Dunn on bass and Tom Rainey on drums). 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover, $10. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>GRANT STEWART QUINTET (Tuesday) A big-toned tenor saxophonist in the hard bop mainstream, with a fine ensemble, including the pianist Bill Charlap and the guitarist Peter Bernstein. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover, $20. (Chinen)</p>
        <p>* HENRY THREADGILL'S ZOOID (Through Sunday) The august composer and multi-reedist Henry Threadgill has always nursed a fascination with timbre; in this superb ensemble, his flute and alto saxophone are flanked by cello, oud, acoustic guitar, tuba, trombone and drums. 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063; cover, $20 (Chinen)</p>
        <p>ERNIE WATTS-LEW SOLOFF QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) Mr. Watts, a Los Angeles-based saxophonist, and Mr. Soloff, a New York trumpeter, present a formidable partnership, especially in the presence of Mulgrew Miller on piano, François Moutin on bass, and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. 8, 10and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum.

        <p>Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>'LA BOHÈME' (Tomorrow) James Robinson's production punts the Puccini favorite forward by some 80 years, placing the action in the opening months of World War I and lending an extra tug of pathos. A mostly new cast has taken over, with Yunah Lee as Mimi, Gerard Powers as Rodolfo, Jennifer Black as Musetta, and Philip Torre as Marcello. David Wroe conducts. 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $45 and $79. (Jeremy Eichler)</p>
        <p>'CARMEN' (Tonight, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday) City Opera seems to be finishing its season with a new emphasis on voice. This ''Carmen'' looks as if it is worth hearing, with the strong mezzo Kate Aldrich in the title role, and the soprano Laquita Mitchell making her company debut as Micaëla. Robert Breault has already shown he has a strong if unvaried voice as Alfredo in ''La Traviata;'' let's see what he offers in a heavier part, Don José. George Manahan conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 tickets remaining tonight; $45 on Sunday; and $65 to $120 on Tuesday and Thursday. (Anne Midgette)</p>
        <p>'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow) A largely decent cast helps bring across Mozart's nearly perfect opera at City Opera. Elizabeth Caballero, new to the company, is a feisty Donna Elvira who utters little squeaks of indignation when she's not pouring out her heart in melisma; Yeghishe Manucharyan shows his white-toned tenor to advantage as Don Ottavio. Alas, Christopher Schaldenbrand, a talented singer, has not quite grown into the demanding title role. 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; remaining tickets, $25. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'DON GIOVANNI' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Amato's venerable recipe -- no rehearsals, changing casts at every performance -- should make for an unusual version of Mozart's classic, but at least the theater's small scale represents a kind of period fidelity. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30; $25 for students and 65+. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>* 'DON PASQUALE' (Tonight and Tuesday) The veteran Austrian director Otto Schenk, who is also an acclaimed comic actor in his homeland, understands that the way to make a rich comic opera like Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale'' work is to treat it seriously. In his wonderful new production for the Met he has accomplished this vividly. He taps into the emotions -- jealousy, yearning, fear of death -- that swirl below the surface of this farcical tale about a crusty and miserly bachelor who foolishly decides to take a young wife and disinherit his shiftless nephew. The cast is splendid, especially the charismatic soprano Anna Netrebko; the robust, dynamic young baritone Mariusz Kwiecien; and, in the title role, the stylish Italian bass Simone Alaimo. Maurizio Benini conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $70 to $205 tickets remaining tonight; $175 on Tuesday. (Anthony Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* 'FIDELIO' (Tomorrow and Thursday) Jürgen Flimm's strikingly contemporary and deeply humane production, which opened at the Met in 2000, is back. So is the soprano Karita Mattila, who gives a courageous and vocally radiant portrayal of Leonore, opera's most valiant and devoted wife. The conductor Paul Nadler has taken over for James Levine, who has withdrawn for the rest of the season, and though Mr. Nadler is no Levine, he does honorable work. All in all, this production still delivers. And Ms. Mattila is astonishing. Erika Sunnegardh, who recently made her Met debut as Leonore when Ms. Mattila was ill, sings in the last performance on Thursday. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>'MANON' (Tomorrow) The news is Renée Fleming, who closes out the run of a signature role in this venerable but appealing Jean-Pierre Ponnelle production, along with the tenor Massimo Giordano, under the baton of Jesús López-Cobos. Not news is the length of this grand opera; after hearing an opera by Massenet, a notable dramatic soprano is supposed to have said, ''And they say Wagner is long?'' 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, but returns may be available. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' (Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's 1998 production, now directed by Robin Guarino, has the virtue of letting Mozart's music and Da Ponte's libretto work their magic unhindered. The Met has assembled a strong cast that includes Andrea Rost as Susanna, John Relyea as Figaro, Alice Coote as Cherubino, Soile Isokoski as the Countess, and Peter Mattei as the Count. Mark Wigglesworth conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Allan Kozinn)</p>
        <p>'LA TRAVIATA' (Monday) The Met's first-rate revival is back again with Hei-Kyung Hong, Frank Lopardo and Dwayne Croft in the major roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets, $175. (Bernard Holland)</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Gather all ye Anglophiles. Leon Botstein conducts Bridge, Bliss and Vaughan Williams. 8, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $25 to $53. (Holland)</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) A weekly presenter of chamber music performances, this floating concert hall also offers great views of Lower Manhattan. Tonight the pianists Gerald Robbins and Katya Mihailova play Mozart, Schubert, Brahms, Dvorak and Shostakovich. Tomorrow and Sunday, Mark Peskanov and colleagues team up for Brahms's G minor Piano Quartet along with Beethoven and Mozart. Thursday brings the pianist Dmitri Alexeev in Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Scriabin and Rachmaninoff. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>ELIOT FISK AND PACO PEÑA (Monday) Eliot Fisk, the great, high-energy classical guitarist, and Paco Peña, the fine flamenco player, join forces for a recital that includes music by Albéniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Granados, Paganini, Scarlatti, Mendelssohn and Bach, as well as Mr. Peña's own works. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $45. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>VADIM GLUZMAN (Tonight) This violinist's program goes all the way from Mozart to Castelnuovo-Tedesco. 7, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949; $25. (Holland)</p>
        <p>GUARNERI STRING QUARTET (Tomorrow) The Guarneri is soldiering through another season as the de facto quartet in residence at the Met Museum. Each of the group's concerts features a Mozart chamber composition, along with other works. This time around, it's Mozart's Clarinet Quintet (with David Shifrin), as well as Arriaga's Quartet No. 2 and Dohnanyi's Quartet in A minor. 8 p.m., (212) 570-3949; $50. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA (Monday) Gerard Schwarz, a hometown conductor heard less in New York these days, conducts the Juilliard's young professional-quality players in Mahler, David Diamond and Behzad Ranjbaran, with the violinist William Harvey. 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406; free, but tickets are required. (Holland)</p>
        <p>* KRONOS QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow) This ensemble's wide-ranging ''Live Mix'' series continues with two concerts in which the boundaries between classical, pop and world music are exceedingly porous. Tonight the quartet plays works by Glenn Branca, best known for his huge electric guitar symphonies, as well as ones by Terry Riley, a founder of Minimalism; the eclectic rock composer J. G. Thirlwell; and the pipa virtuoso Wu Man. Tomorrow the quartet, with the Indian singer Asha Bhosle and the tabla player Zakir Hussain, plays music by the Icelandic band Sigur Ros and the composers Derek Charke, Ram Narayan and Rahul Dev Burman. Tonight at 7:30 at Zankel Hall, tomorrow at 8 p.m. at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $28 to $35 tonight, $21 to $72 tomorrow. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>MIAMI STRING QUARTET (Sunday) This excellent group, in residence at the Hartt School in Connecticut, has been admirably committed to contemporary music. But this time, in the essential (and affordable) Peoples' Symphony Concerts series, the quartet is playing works by Haydn, Schumann and Sibelius. ''Intimate Voices,'' the Sibelius quartet, is a deeply personal and hauntingly eclectic work, and may strike some as a bolder score than many works of more recent decades. 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680; $9 and $11. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Leonard Slatkin made a superb recording of John Corigliano's powerful Symphony No. 1 during his years with the St. Louis Symphony, and he is taking it up again with the National Symphony. The program also includes Elgar's Introduction and Allegro (Op. 47) and Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3, with Emanuel Ax. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $24 to $85. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Today) The orchestra spotlights talent from among its own ranks, with the concertmaster Glenn Dicterow performing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3, and the principal trumpet player Philip Smith as the soloist in Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's ''American Concerto.'' Bramwell Tovey conducts, adding a Mozart overture and Franck's Symphony. 11 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $23 to $76. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>PEABODY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) The prestigious Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore regularly sends its impressive student ensemble on tour to make music and spread the word about the institution. With its music director, Hajime Teri Murai, the orchestra plays an adventurous program with New York premieres of works by Christopher Theofanidis and Michael Hersch; Paquito D'Rivera's ''Gran Danzon'' (a flute concerto); and Mahler's mighty ''Das Lied von der Erde.'' 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $18. (Tommasini)</p>
        <p>* ROTTERDAM PHILHARMONIC (Sunday and Monday) The first installments of Valery Gergiev's cycle of Shostakovich's symphonies, with the Kirov Orchestra last month, were both invigorating and revelatory. Mr. Gergiev takes up the project with the Rotterdam Philharmonic, with contributions on Sunday from the Riverside Choral Society and the Rutgers University Kirkpatrick Choir. The programs include the Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 on Sunday, and Nos. 5 and 15 on Monday. Sunday at 3 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $35 to $69. (Kozinn)</p>
        <p>* 'ST. MATTHEW PASSION' (Tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday) Jonathan Miller's humble, eloquent staging strips Bach's masterpiece to its humane core. No sets, no costumes -- just casually dressed musicians sitting in a circle, and soloists singing in English. Paul Goodwin conducts Rufus Müller, Curtis Streetman, Krisztina Szabo, Suzie LeBlanc, Daniel Taylor, Nils Brown and Stephen Varcoe. Tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100; $30 to $90. (Eichler)</p>
        <p>ANDREAS SCHOLL (Tuesday) Countertenors are on the rise, and Mr. Scholl is one of the fastest-rising of the bunch, with a rounded, fluty instrument and a definite flair in how he sings with it. His program is a potpourri, ranging from the late Middle Ages to Haydn and Mozart. 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; sold out. (Midgette)</p>
        <p>TRIBECA NEW MUSIC FESTIVAL (Sunday) ''Music of the Avant-Pop'' is the title for this disparate festival of four concerts extending through May, presented by the avowedly eclectic New York Art Ensemble.

        <p>* LES BALLETS GRANDIVA (Monday) This all-male drag ballet company may seem to be performing for laughs, but there is a great deal of loving knowledge and technical expertise in the classical and contemporary pieces (including Peter Anastos's new ''Serenadiana'') presented by these dancers, former members of troupes that include the Kirov Ballet, American Ballet Theater and the National Ballet of Canada. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, or www.balletsgrandiva.com.

        <p>CHRIS &amp; JUSTIN (Tonight through Sunday) Chris Yon and Justin Jones get this week's best-title award for ''Pear Cowboy Planet,'' which they describe, unfortunately, as a tragicomic triptych about the mysterious properties of addition and subtraction. Oh, well, so much for poetic ambiguity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10, Sunday at 5:30 p.m., the Club at La MaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, www.lamama.org; $15.

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>SUGAR SALON LAUNCH (Monday) Five panelists, including the choreographer Susan Marshall and Wendy Perron, editor in chief of Dance Magazine, will participate in ''What Does the Future Hold for Women in Modern Dance?''

(Dunning)</p>

(Dunning)</p>
        <p>KEVIN WYNN COLLECTION (Tonight through Sunday) Known for his high-energy, fast-sweeping group pieces, Mr. Wynn will present ''Tracing Sirocco,'' which he describes as a ''hallucinogenic ensemble work for 16 dancers'' that is set in an African desert and danced to a soundscape by Luna Reyes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday at 7 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, www.smartix.com; $18. (Dunning)</p>

        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'SYMPHONIC POEM: THE ART OF AMINAH BRENDA LYNN ROBINSON,' through Aug. 14. This prodigious show, by an artist born and still living in Columbus, Ohio, celebrates her heritage in paintings, drawings, sculpture, stitchery, leather work and less classifiable forms of expression. Besides its sheer visual wizardry, using materials like leaves, twigs, bark, buttons and cast-off clothes, her art is compelling in that it ruminates on the history of black migration to, and settlement in, the United States, from early times to the present, in a garrulous, very personal way. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Grace Glueck)</p>
        <p>* Brooklyn Museum: WILLIAM WEGMAN: 'FUNNEY/STRANGE,' through May 28. Descended from Marcel Duchamp and Buster Keaton, Mr. Wegman has straddled high and low for more than three decades, using his signature Weimaraners to make the art world's funniest videos, as well as television commercials, calendars and children's books. His popular success has tended to obscure his originality and influence, along with a multifarious production that includes wittily captioned drawings, wonderfully irreverent paintings and a host of nondog photographic work. This thorough and thoroughly entertaining retrospective highlights not only the accessibility of his richly human art, but also its dedication to the 1970's notion that art should not look like art. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)</p>
        <p>* Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum: 'David Smith: A Centennial,' through May 14. David Smith is best known for his worst work, bulky sculptures of the ''important'' kind that museums and banks like to buy. Much (though not all) of that material has been excised from this survey in favor of smaller, earlier, nonmonumental pieces that the curator, Carmen Gimenez, presents with plenty of air and light. The result is exemplary as a David Smith experience, an American Modernism experience and a Guggenheim Museum experience. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500. (Holland Cotter)</p>
        <p>* International Center of Photography: 'Snap Judgments: New Positions in Contemporary African Photography,' through May 28. If Martians tuned into our television news broadcasts, they'd have a miserable impression of life on Earth. War, disease, poverty, heartbreak and nothing else. That's exactly how most of the world sees Africa: filtered through images of calamity. The Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor offers a bracing alternative view in this show of recent photography from Africa. He isn't interested in simply exchanging an upbeat Africa for a downbeat one, smiles for frowns, but in engineering a slow, complex, panoptical turn in perspective, one that takes in many moods and directions. The results are stimulating, astringent, brimming with life. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'HATSHEPSUT,' through July 9. Can a queen be a king, too? Consider the case of Hatshepsut, an Egyptian ruler of the 15th century B.C. She assumed the supreme title of pharaoh and ruled Egypt in that powerfully masculine role until her death. Hatshepsut is the subject of a celebratory show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one that commemorates the 100th anniversary of the Met's department of Egyptian art. Organized by the Met and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, it includes many objects from the Met's own extensive holdings, excavated at its digs in the 1920's and 30's. But it isn't so easy to follow Hatshepsut's trail in this ambitious show, what with the number of relatives, subordinates, minor officials and such who also have a place in it, along with scarabs, jewelry, pottery, furniture and other artifacts. (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>Met: KARA WALKER AT THE MET: 'AFTER THE DELUGE,' through July 30. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's first foray into artist-organized shows is a small tour de force of curatorial creativity. Inspired partly by Hurricane Katrina, Ms. Walker has combined works from the Met with examples of her own art, connecting shared themes of race, poverty and water to illuminate contemporary art's inevitable dialogue with past art. The show has as many crosscurrents and undertows as a river. (See above.) (Smith)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'EDVARD MUNCH: THE MODERN LIFE OF THE SOUL,' through May 8. This affecting, full-scale retrospective is the first survey of this Norwegian painter in an American museum in almost 30 years. Its more than 130 oils and works on paper cover Munch's entire career, from 1880 to 1944. (212) 708-9400. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'ON SITE: NEW ARCHITECTURE IN SPAIN,' through May 1. Since the early 1970's, when Spain began to awaken from the isolation of a four-decade dictatorship, Spanish architects have produced designs of unusual depth, often with a firm connection to the land, a sense of humility and a way of conveying continuity with the past while embracing the present. Packed with pretty images and elegant models, this exhibition lacks the scholarly depth you might have hoped for on such a mesmerizing subject. (See above.) (Nicolai Ouroussoff)</p>
        <p>National Academy Museum: 'Treasures from Olana: Landscapes by Frederic Edwin Church,' through April 30. Exquisite small landscape studies by the best of the Hudson River School painters. They are from the collection at Olana, the Persian-style Victorian mansion -- now a museum -- that Church built on an upstate hill overlooking the Hudson River. 1083 Fifth Avenue, (212) 369-4880. (Ken Johnson)</p>
        <p>NEUE GALERIE: 'KLEE AND AMERICA,' through May 22. For a long time, the Swiss-born artist Paul Klee (1879-1940), regarded as a leading Modernist figure in Europe, didn't believe his delicate, chimerical work had much of a future in the United States. Yet, thanks to artists, collectors and dealers with close contacts in Germany who had begun to discover his work, by the early 1920's, Klee's impact began to be felt here. This show of more than 60 paintings and drawings assembled exclusively from American holdings covers the wide spectrum of Klee's work. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'The Thirteen: Chinese Video Now,' through April 24. A snappy roundup of recent video, a favored medium among young artists in a digitally-savvy 21st-century China, this show has two fine pieces by Cao Fei, who has garnered much attention recently. It is also the occasion for several worthy New York debuts. Some of the art is light, slight, and MTV-ish, but artists like Cui Xiuwen, Xu Zhen, Li Songhua, Xu Tan, Meng Jin and Dong Wensheng give us a lot . 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Whitney Museum of American Art: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2006: DAY FOR NIGHT,' through May 28. This biennial will provoke much head-scratching by uninitiated visitors. A hermetic take on what has been making waves, it's packaged -- branded might be the better word -- as a show long on collaboration and open-endedness: several shows under one roof, including a revival of the 1960's ''Peace Tower,'' which rises like a Tinker Toy construction from the Whitney courtyard, with contributions by dozens of artists. As a counter to the image of the art world as rich, youth-besotted and obsessed with crafty little nothings, the ethos here is provisional, messy, half-baked, cantankerous, insular -- radical qualities art used to have when it could still call itself radical and wasn't like a barnacle clinging to the cruise ship of pop culture. That was back in the 1970's. And much of what's here (including works by bohemians and other senior eccentrics around then) harks back to that moment. (800) 944-8639 or www.whitney.org. (Michael Kimmelman)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>* FRANCIS PICABIA: 'WORKS ON PAPER, 1901-1951' Consistent with the predominantly linear, sometimes kitschy imagery of the artist's proto-postmodern transparency paintings, the 100 works on paper here reveal a lifelong involvement with drawing, marked by an indifference to notions of style, taste, consistency, skill or progress. It is both a challenge and a treat. Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>'1968: All in a Dream' In 1968 the photographer Lenny Gottlieb saved 30,000 snapshots that were supposed to have been thrown out at the photographic processing lab he was working in. Approximately 500 of them are on view here; collectively, they offer an enthralling cross-section of American life during a year of tremendous change. Andrew Roth, 160A East 70th Street, (212) 717-9067, through April 29. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>RECENT PAINTINGS BY QIN FENG Working in ink and tea on silk-cotton paper, this 45-year-old Chinese artist continues the long tradition of Chinese calligraphy and ink painting, with assists from Japanese sumi-ink painting and Abstract Expressionists like Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. Goedhius Contemporary, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 535-6934, through April 17. (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>Darren Almond /Janice Kerbel: 'The Impossible Landscape' Nothing is obvious in this handsome show of works by two London-based Conceptualists. The connection is that both make visible things that are in different ways impossible. Ms. Kerbel's elegantly abstracted designs for gardens in an office, a Laundromat and other unlikely places are meant to be imagined but never actually built. Mr. Almond's sumptuous, subtly eerie landscape photographs were shot at night using long exposures, making visible what would be invisible to the naked eye. The Horticultural Society of New York, 128 West 58th Street, (212) 757-0915, through May 5. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'REFLECTIONS OF GODS' Ensconced in a small, chapel-like gallery, this exhibition of nine sacred objects and one hanging screen includes a beautiful 16th-century mask and a 12th-century carved wood sculpture of a Shinto deity holding a Buddhist wish-granting jewel. Mika Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-3900, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* 'SPRING MIST FROM SNOW' This veritable wonder cabinet of furniture, objects and artworks conjures up the rarefied realm of the Chinese scholar's study but also represents other Asian cultures. One stand-out is a Qing wish-granting scepter in carved boxwood that must be among the fountainheads of Art Nouveau; its provenance is listed as ''an old French collection.'' William Lipton Ltd., 41 East 57th Street, (212) 751-8131, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>Tara Donovan Known for creating improbable accumulations of ordinary things, Ms. Donovan here has arranged three million plastic cups in stacks from ankle-high to five feet. They make a 50-by-60-foot rectangle on the floor, resembling a lumpy field of snow. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-7000, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>* Dan Fischer Velvety graphite drawings copied from Xerox copies of book and magazine images of well-known artists like Robert Smithson and Sol LeWitt and artworks like Jeff Koons's iconic ''Rabbit'' evoke and possibly satirize the reverence that some people feel for modern and contemporary art. Derek Eller, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>'Great Performance: Contemporary Chinese Photography' This group show updates the careers of artists who gained notice in the 1990's and gives some exposure to others who are still unfamiliar here. The real find is work by two women, Yin Xiuzhen and the formidable young performance artist Chen Qiulin. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999, through April 15. (Cotter)</p>
        <p>Anthony James Call it Industrial Surrealist Chic. Mr. James's works include old heavy-duty power tools displayed in gleaming, mirrored cases; a glass case of white birch tree trunks that seems to extend infinitely by virtue of two-way mirrors; and a life-size, digitally copied female nude of laser-cut aluminum. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Daniel Johnston: 'The Story of an Artist' The nearly 70 ballpoint and felt-tip drawings by this semi-outsider artist and rock musician and 2006 Whitney Biennial pick don't live up to the hype, but they are fun to look at. In a distracted but versatile, faux-adolescent style, the Texas-based Mr. Johnston creates sweet and sometimes hair-raising cartoon improvisations on themes of love, sex, hope, despair and death. Clementine, 632 West 27th Street, (212) 243-5937, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Eve K. Tremblay: 'Tales Without Grounds' A rising young Canadian photographer presents glossy staged photographs of people doing enigmatic things in and around a large facility for hydroponic lettuce cultivation. With their cinematically intense colors, Ms. Tremblay's pictures are like stills from a Tarkovskian science fiction movie. Buia, 541 West 23rd Street, (212) 366-9915, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>TIM BARBER A fresh, even touching reprise of the overused convention of walls papered with unframed photographs and small cartoonish drawings, this show has been culled from Mr. Barber's Web site, tinyvices.com. With 250 people represented, it blurs the line between professional and amateur and introduces a savvy curatorial eye. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, through April 15. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Marcel Broodthaers This reverential exhibition of just three works by a Belgian Conceptualist regarded as a Duchampian saint in some sectors of the art world includes a hat painted white and attached to a canvas painted black and white; a work called ''L'Erreur,'' consisting of 45 eggshells attached to a canvas labeled ''moules,'' the French word for mussels; and a set of canvases neatly inscribed with words relating to the composition and sale of paintings. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, through April 15. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Rico Gatson: 'African Fractals' Mr. Gatson's suave geometric paintings and sculptures of symbolically charged vernacular objects -- a whipping post in the form of a Christian cross with wrist-holes, for example -- feature African-style stripe patterns, creating a dialogue between utopian Modernism and tragic social history. A video installation produces hypnotic patterns out of films of the pageantry surrounding the great boxing match between Muhammed Ali and George Foreman that took place in Zaire in 1974. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Joëlle Tuerlinckx: 'Drawing Inventory' A prominent Belgian conceptualist presents a dry and oblique installation consisting of a large quantity of ordinary materials more or less related to the art of drawing. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, through April 22. (Johnson)</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* 'ARTS OF ANCIENT CHINA' A museum-quality selection that begins with an elegant Neolithic red pottery bowl includes rare examples of early lacquer and is especially notable for its profusion of bronze vessels and objects. J. J. Lally, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 371-3380; closes Wednesday. (Smith)</p>
        <p>THIERRY DE CORDIER AND PIERRE HUYGHE Mr. de Cordier's ''Female Drawings'' evoke blurred, semi-abstract Madonnas and also the recherché style of postwar European figuration. Mr. Huyghe's puppet video, ''This is Not a Time for Dreaming,'' which ruminates on, and was commissioned for, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard -- suffers from obscurity, but is still one of the most beautiful videos made in recent years. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 581-5187; closes tomorrow. (Smith)</p>
        <p>* REALM OF THE GODS: ART FROM INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA A lavish display of sculptures of Hindu deities and Buddhist monks offers excellent examples of several of India's dynastic and regional styles in bronze, sandstone and terra cotta, along with works from Thailand, Cambodia, Mongolia and, especially, Tibet. Carlton Rochell, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7600; closes today. (Smith)</p>
        <p>Charlotta Westergren: 'Ahus Sommaren 1974' Preoccupied by her family and ancestry, Ms. Westergren presents a James Turrell-like room with artificial aroma added, designed to simulate the light and smell of a summer home in Sweden.
