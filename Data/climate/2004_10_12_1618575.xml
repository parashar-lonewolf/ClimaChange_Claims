        <p>'The Day After Tomorrow'</p>
        <p>.The latest apocalyptic fantasy from the German filmmaker Roland Emmerich (''Independence Day,'' ''Godzilla'') imagines earth in the grip of a new ice age, brought on by global warming. The widespread destruction as the entire Northern Hemisphere is beset by ferocious storms serves as a background for a father-son reconciliation story, with Dennis Quaid as a government climatologist making his way from Washington to Manhattan, where his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) is holed up in the nearly submerged New York Public Library.</p>
        <p>The computer-generated imagery is the primary attraction here, though Mr. Emmerich seems blind to the paradox of making an ecological thriller that includes few if any images of the natural world. Drawing on a dozen of Hollywood's most advanced C.G.I. contractors (including Digital Domain and Industrial Light and Magic), the film offers destructive delights like a hailstorm in Tokyo, tornadoes destroying downtown Los Angeles and a Statue of Liberty encrusted in ice. A very Dick Cheney-like vice president (Kenneth Welsh) is on hand to take the rap for pulling out of the Kyoto accord on global warming, turning ''The Day After Tomorrow'' into yet another ideologically charged entertainment in this contentious year.</p>

        <p>'The Day After Tomorrow'</p>
        <p>.The latest apocalyptic fantasy from the German filmmaker Roland Emmerich (''Independence Day,'' ''Godzilla'') imagines earth in the grip of a new ice age, brought on by global warming. The widespread destruction as the entire Northern Hemisphere is beset by ferocious storms serves as a background for a father-son reconciliation story, with Dennis Quaid as a government climatologist making his way from Washington to Manhattan, where his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) is holed up in the nearly submerged New York Public Library.</p>

        <p>The disc, from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, features an excellent DTS surround soundtrack and a generous complement of behind-the-scenes material. 2004. $29.98. PG-13.</p>
        <p>The Jerry Lewis Collection</p>
        <p>Paramount Home Entertainment has finally dug into the studio's Jerry Lewis holdings, releasing a superbly mastered suite of 10 Lewis films, including three of Mr. Lewis's finest achievements as a director: ''The Ladies Man'' (1961), ''The Family Jewels'' (1965) and his masterpiece, ''The Nutty Professor,'' from 1963.</p>
        <p>This isn't the place to settle the long-running debate over Mr. Lewis's work, which has found both eminent champions (Jean-Luc Godard, who once memorably remarked that ''even his colors are funny'') and eminent detractors (Andrew Sarris, who dismissed Mr. Lewis in his seminal book ''The American Cinema''). But to see these films again, with the deeply saturated color that is essential to Mr. Lewis's work and their proper aspect ratios restored (television broadcasts invariably chop off the sides of Mr. Lewis's wide frames), is to be stunned by Mr. Lewis's technical mastery and scientifically precise visual style.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis was so important to the French New Wave directors because his films, as theirs, aspired to be as personal as diary entries. A deeply divided soul, part child and part cynical show-business pro, Mr. Lewis began dramatizing his split personality well before ''The Nutty Professor,'' a comic variation on ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' made the metaphor explicit. Paramount has insightfully included the early Martin and Lewis film ''The Stooge'' (1953), which finds Mr. Lewis imagining his erstwhile partner as his own sinister alter ego, well before he acquired creative control of his work.</p>
        <p>The much-parodied French fascination with Mr. Lewis comes in large part, I suspect, from their habit of seeing Mr. Lewis's sweetly destructive na√Øf as a representation of something essentially American, just as Americans sentimentally (and inaccurately) believe Maurice Chevalier to represent the French soul. But love him or hate him, Mr. Lewis has remained a prodigious form-giver for half a century, and this collection does him honor. An inveterate pack rat and self-documenter, Mr. Lewis has shared dozens of rare clips from his archives as supplements on these discs, most of which also include audio commentaries from Mr. Lewis (with the singer Steve Lawrence acting as his unlikely interlocutor).</p>
        <p>Please, Paramount keep them coming. $14.99. Not rated.</p>
        <p>'The Wire'</p>
        <p>An excellent HBO series that began in 2002, ''The Wire'' departed from most cop shows by contextualizing its good guys and bad guys, placing both cops (a group of Baltimore renegades and misfits assigned to a special investigation of an inner-city drug ring) and robbers (the drug ring, seen as a complexly organized business) within a detailed social context. As the series, created by David Simon, slowly unfolds over the course of the 12 initial episodes on this disc, minor incidents open into major scandals, stereotypical characters (the doltish rookie cop played by Jim True-Frost; the street-level dealer played by Larry Gilliard Jr.) blossom into fully rounded figures, and the field of corruption expands from a housing project courtyard to include state government. By the time the series finishes with its expository episodes (around No.5), it has taken on the dimensions of a Zola novel.</p>
        <p>Following HBO's admirable practice of hiring independent filmmakers who are between projects to direct individual episodes, this first-season disc includes work by Clement Virgo (''Rude''), Milko Manchevski (''Before the Rain'') and Brad Anderson (''The Machinist''). But auteur credit seems to belong to Mr. Simon, who wrote or contributed to each of the episodes. A new season of ''The Wire'' is currently running on Sundays at 9 p.m., Eastern time. HBO Video. $99.98. Not rated.</p>
        <p>'The Ren and Stimpy Show'  'The First and Second Seasons Uncut'</p>
        <p>Created in 1991 by the former Ralph Bakshi assistant John Kricfalusi, ''Ren and Stimpy'' borrowed Tex Avery's anarchic animation style and added new elements of angst and absurdism. The existential struggles of Ren (a moth-eaten Chihuahua whose hyper-nervous demeanor suggests a serious problem with methamphetamines) and Stimpy (a dopey, egg-shaped cat with an unnatural attachment to his litter box) proved to be too much for Nickelodeon, the cable channel that financed the show and then took it away from Mr. Kricfalusi's control.</p>
        <p>A new, three-disc box set from Paramount Home Entertainment suggests that all has been forgiven and that Mr. Kricfalusi has taken the characters back into his own hands. The set presents all 32 cartoons created under Mr. Kricfalusi's watch, including the notorious banned episode ''Man's Best Friend.'' Clearly, Mr. Kricfalusi was a decade ahead of his time, now that ''adult cartoons'' are flourishing on cable, but there is something more than scatological humor at work in these disturbing little movies, the best of which (like the pilot episode, ''Big House Blues'') turn the usual brutal cartoon conventions into paranoid scenarios charged with anger and pain. Definitely not for the kiddies. $38.99. Not rated.</p>
