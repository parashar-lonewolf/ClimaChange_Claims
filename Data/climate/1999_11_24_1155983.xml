        <p>For most of its 17 years, Operation Smile seemed to be a model charity.</p>
        <p>Founded by a charismatic plastic surgeon and his wife, it garnered millions in donations and sheaves of plaudits for the surgeons it sent abroad to fix the cleft palates and lips of children in poor countries.</p>
        <p>Donors from Bill Gates to Goldie Hawn pitched in generously, and the numbers of children granted a pretty smile grew by leaps and bounds. The group won many awards.</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, however, serious allegations of shoddy medical practices and questions about the charity's direction and conduct have stirred bitter struggles within the organization, outside public view.</p>
        <p>One founder dismisses the charges as ''blatantly not true.''</p>
        <p>The most serious allegations focus on the surgeries themselves. Critics charge that the organization has put volume and publicity over safety, leading to high numbers of complications, even deaths.</p>
        <p>Last year alone, four children died during or after surgery, adding to at least 12 other patients that the charity acknowledges losing since it began operations in 1982. Repairing a cleft lip or palate in the developed world is rather low risk and deaths are rare.</p>
        <p>Physicians in China, where Operation Smile has performed many of its operations, have accused the surgeons of ''assembly line'' medicine. In Bolivia, a pediatric surgeon branded the organization's practices ''a form of neo-colonialism.''</p>
        <p>Critics have also said that in 1997, Operation Smile exaggerated its size on the group's tax returns by including the value of the medical services that its volunteer nurses and doctors donated as revenues.</p>
        <p>And some question the charity's priorities for choosing to finance projects like its recent World Journey of Hope, a whirlwind mission around the globe that cost $8.8 million, $910,000 of which went for promotion and public relations.</p>
        <p>The chief executive is leaving, many staff members have quit and seven board members have resigned. Charles B. Wang, the chief executive of Computer Associates International, has pulled back a $10 million donation, which he has promised to a rival charity. Warner-Lambert, which had been contributing at least $1 million a year to the $40 million the charity spends on programs, also retracted its support.</p>
        <p>The founders of Operation Smile, Dr. William P. Magee Jr. and his wife, Kathleen S. Magee, neither of whom have ever taken a salary from the charity, have dismissed much of the criticism as the assertions of those who do not understand what they are trying to do. Their income comes from private practice.</p>
        <p>''What we need to do is put this behind us and not get distracted,'' Dr. Magee said in an interview last week at his headquarters in Norfolk, Va., flanked by the many awards he has won. Without an operation to correct a facial deformity, a child has ''no chance to live a normal life,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Dr. Magee addressed the criticism at a news conference in Manhattan, dismissing the allegations as ''blatantly not true,'' and saying the charity had hired a lawyer, F. Bradford Stillman, to review its operations and report by January.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile is not without its supporters, including Johnson &amp; Johnson. ''I personally, and the organization, believe very strongly in the fine work that Operation Smile has done,'' Robert Darretta, the chief financial officer for Johnson &amp; Johnson, who remains a director, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging the challenges, Mr. Darretta said he and other directors are staying to ''bring about constructive change.''</p>
        <p>The debate over how Operation Smile has pursued its goals exposes a fundamental problem facing many nonprofit organizations: When a charity gets into trouble, who should slam on the brakes?</p>
        <p>Unlike companies that have shareholders who could lobby for change, nonprofits do not usually have stakeholders who can easily complain or regulators who have much muscle. Fearful of the negative publicity involved in trying to force change, even big donors and directors may simply wash their hands.</p>
        <p>''Resigning is the final weapon,'' said F. Warren McFarlan, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied nonprofit boards.</p>
        <p>The board of the charity, while apparently concerned about some of the quality-of-care issues being raised, seem most deeply divided about the founders' role and the increasing view among some directors that their own input was being ignored, one former director said.</p>
        <p>The Procedures  A Death in China Sets Off an Alarm</p>
        <p>As long as Operation Smile remained a modest organization, it could bask in praise. But as it tried to reach its stated goal of treating 10,000 children a year, troubling reports began to surface that the charity was sacrificing safety.</p>
        <p>No surgery is without risk; in poor countries, sanitation might not be up to par, and patients may have complications they do not explain for fear of being rejected for the surgery.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile has had 16 deaths, according to Dr. Magee, about one for every 2,000 cases overseas, which he says is about average. In the last four years, the average has been slightly better, about one death in every 3,200 cases.</p>
        <p>But Interplast, a competing charity in Mountain View, Calif., that also operates on children abroad, had a mortality rate over the last four years of about one death for every 10,000 cases, according to David Dingman, the director of Interplast's medical program. Its own rates had been no better than Operation Smile's until it tightened quality controls and improved its technology about four years ago.</p>
        <p>The death that has caused the most stir at Operation Smile occurred last year in China during a cleft-lip operation. A medical volunteer who was in Beijing sent an anonymous E-mail in November to members of the board that voiced serious criticism about how the death occurred.</p>
        <p>''It was the direct result of a poorly run mission with far too much attention being paid to publicity and not enough to patient safety and standard monoritoring techniques,'' said the volunteer, who was interviewed by The New York Times. ''It is also my impression that Operation Smile not only did not learn from this tragedy in Beijing and make changes to ensure that it did not happen again, but continues to send missions that operate in a similar unsafe, reckless and unprofessional manner.''</p>
        <p>What most troubled the volunteer was the decision not to use carbon dioxide monitoring equipment that was readily available, a decision the charity acknowledges but is at a loss to explain. The exact cause of death may never be determined.</p>
        <p>But if the monitoring equipment had been engaged, doctors might have known that the toddler was responding badly to anesthesia and about to die. ''Why should we not use the same standard of care'' as in the developed world, the volunteer asked. ''The goal is just volume.''</p>
        <p>Medical professionals at the Beijing hospital where Operation Smile conducted the mission were also severely critical, saying there was a high number of serious complications where children suffered from excessive bleeding or had to have emergency surgery because their palates had collapsed.</p>
        <p>The Chinese said many of the volunteers were not skilled and their work was crude. They concluded that about 29 percent of the 169 children with complications needed further treatment.</p>
        <p>According to the Chinese medical professionals, who later wrote a detailed report, Operation Smile conducted an ''assembly line,'' where patients were known by their numbers rather than names and surgeons spent little or no time seeing patients before operating.</p>
        <p>''Even though we only worked together for a few days, we got the impression that the international team prioritized numbers treated at the cost of quality and safety,'' said a translated copy of the report.</p>
        <p>The charity said it has never seen the report.</p>
        <p>Other medical volunteers echo similar concerns. While all charities want to impress donors with large numbers of operations and find it heart-wrenching to turn away patients, Operation Smile seems more concerned than others about the final tally, according to a medical volunteer who has traveled with the group and with comparable charities.</p>
        <p>''The issue of numbers does not seem to be as significant'' with the others, according to the volunteer.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile takes every complication ''extraordinarily seriously,'' said Dr. Magee, and the charity has made changes as a result of the incident in Beijing. For instance, team leaders overseeing anesthesia will be doctors, not nurses, and will be required to use monitoring equipment.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Magee, who personally selects the surgeons, denied in the recent interview that the volunteer physicians, many of whom are not from the United States, were not skilled. While the Chinese saw them for only a few days, he had known them for years, he said, and ''I have no doubt about their work.''</p>
        <p>The trouble in Beijing, however, was hardly an isolated example. In Kenya, a child died last year because the mission ran out of oxygen during the operation -- a mistake that is fatal when additional supplies of oxygen are not necessarily available. A Vietnamese child also died last year when his asthma went undetected.</p>
        <p>In March, after Operation Smile came to Bolivia, several children needed extensive follow-up care at San Gabriel Hospital, according to Dr. Roberto Rosa, a pediatric surgeon there who was sharply critical of Operation Smile and other charities. In one case, the technique used on a little girl was clearly inappropriate, he said.</p>
        <p>''This is a form of neo-colonialism,'' argued Dr. Rosa, who said his hospital had performed about 2,000 of these surgeries. While his hospital would be eager to cooperate with surgeons from the United States, Operation Smile had committed ''surgical safaris against our children,'' who are from poor families who are unlikely to complain, he said.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile said it had no knowledge of complaints from Bolivia and had been invited to provide more operations.</p>
        <p>Dr. Magee, whose background as a surgeon is impressive, has also been criticized for allowing people without medical training to have too large a role. One volunteer said he was once allowed to assist Dr. Magee in surgery -- even to perform minor surgery -- although he had no medical background. ''I shouldn't have even been there,'' the volunteer said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Magee said volunteers may have been allowed to cut sutures from time to time, but he has no memory of this incident and he doubted that it happened.</p>
        <p>One recurring grievance is the lack of independent review. While Interplast has in place a quality-assurance committee of outside medical professionals to investigate unusual outcomes and report to the board, the Magees rely on councils that meet only once a year and are not necessarily privy to all incidents. Dr. Magee is the chairman of the council for plastic surgery.</p>
        <p>The Accounting  Putting a Value On Donated Services</p>
        <p>The quest to impress donors and outsiders alike with its good works seems to have led Operation Smile to exaggerate how many children it has helped.</p>
        <p>While the organization has helped literally tens of thousands of children overseas, its activities at home are less impressive.</p>
        <p>The 20,000 to 25,000 children in the United States that Operation Smile says it has helped represent children cared for by its medical volunteers with little or no involvement by the charity, according to an internal memo written by Dr. Magee in October.</p>
        <p>The charity also appears to have taken steps on a tax return, the only public documents by which charities can be judged, to make itself look much larger and more efficient, according to Daniel Borochoff, the president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a watchdog group in Bethesda, Md.</p>
        <p>In completing its 1997 tax return, the latest available, the charity included the ostensible value of the services donated by its volunteers -- $30.8 million -- as part of its $59.7 million in revenues.</p>
        <p>The Internal Revenue Service instructs charities not to include donated services as revenues.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile appears to have filled out the forms correctly in 1996, only to have Mr. Borochoff criticize the charity for not spending more on its programs.</p>
        <p>By including donated services, the charity can make it appear that each dollar goes farther.</p>
        <p>Interplast, its rival, also improperly included the value of services in its revenues in 1997 but says it is now amending its return.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile officials say they have also decided to amend their return.</p>
        <p>The Goals  'The Smile Train' Runs Off the Track</p>
        <p>Other events over the last two years have also created serious criticism even as the organization seemed to be enjoying great success.</p>
        <p>In early 1998, with much fanfare, Operation Smile announced a program called the Smile Train, to provide training and equipment to Chinese doctors. The charity glowed with a $10 million pledge from Mr. Wang of Computer Associates.</p>
        <p>But the project ended up being sidetracked in favor of the World Journey of Hope, a nine-week tour of 18 countries, from Honduras to Russia to China, to treat 5,300 children.</p>
        <p>Within Operation Smile, the World Journey project was met with heavy criticism. The huge endeavor involved the leasing of a flying hospital from the evangelist Pat Robertson, and the $8.8 million price tag seemed to some to be hard to justify, especially the $910,000 for public relations.</p>
        <p>With concerns growing about the charity's conduct, several board members and large donors began withdrawing support. By the end of 1998, two directors -- Mr. Wang and Brian F. Mullaney, a New York advertising executive -- had resigned. The money Mr. Wang originally pledged for the Smile Train was diverted into a new charity of the same name. (Mr. Wang declined comment.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Magee said Operation Smile was willing to let go of the Smile Train project and all the money earmarked for it because the organization was in danger of becoming too ''China-centric.''</p>
        <p>But tension continued to grow between other directors and the Magees. Operation Smile had experienced huge turnover among its top staff members, and by spring 1999 the founders wanted to oust Operation Smile's chief executive, Thomas Fox, the former chief executive of the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey, who had been brought in to try to run the organization more professionally. But foreshadowing a showdown, the board instead voted to keep Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>In September, the first round of scathing anonymous E-mail began making the rounds to the charity's board and top officers. Later that month, the Magees abruptly cancelled a scheduled board meeting. A few days later, Dr. Fox agreed to leave the charity at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Outraged, board members began to resign: Ann Ziff, a prominent philanthropist; Robert A. Peterson, the vice president of development for Thomas Jefferson University; Stephen O'Conner, the president of New Brunswick Tomorrow, a New Jersey civic group; Nancy Gary, president of Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want to participate in a farce,'' one departing director said.</p>
        <p>Corporate donors were also alarmed. Gregory Johnson, the general counsel for Warner-Lambert, quit, calling for an independent investigation into the allegations in the anonymous E-mails. Warner-Lambert has since cut all its ties.</p>
        <p>Operation Smile denied that Mr. Fox was fired but said that he would not be renewing his contract next year. Mr. Fox declined to comment.</p>
        <p>No one can deny that many of those involved in Operation Smile are upset when a child dies or is hurt. Nor would anyone contend that medical care always has perfect outcomes.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wails,'' said Julia S. Heffernan, director of international missions for the charity, ''and then we move on.''</p>
        <p>But it is exactly this calculus that troubles many of the charity's critics. When Dr. Magee talked about the devastation he felt in 1993 when two children died in China during surgery he supervised, he said he was convinced about the need to go on, given how many more children desperately need his services. He never did determine the causes of the two children's deaths.</p>
        <p>''Somewhere it lost its innocence,'' said one volunteer who has left Operation Smile. Without the Magees, ''there wouldn't be an Operation Smile,'' this person acknowledged, but the couple refused to hear any criticism about how the charity is run.</p>
        <p>''They wouldn't listen,'' the person said. ''It was their vision.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 25, 1999, Thursday  A picture caption yesterday with a front-page article about Operation Smile, the charity that performs reconstructive surgery in developing countries, suggested a reason erroneously for Charles B. Wang's decision to retract his pledge of $10 million. Mr. Wang, chief executive of Computer Associates, declined to comment to The Times on his reasons for diverting the money to another charity. There was no indication of a problem with accounting for the funds.</p>
