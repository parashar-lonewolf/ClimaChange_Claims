        <p>LEAD: When President-elect Bush visited Islamorada in the Florida Keys after his election, he was just ''goin' fishin'.'' When he returns to Islamorada this weekend, he will be ''enjoying the splendors of our great outdoor heritage.''</p>
        <p>When President-elect Bush visited Islamorada in the Florida Keys after his election, he was just ''goin' fishin'.'' When he returns to Islamorada this weekend, he will be ''enjoying the splendors of our great outdoor heritage.''</p>
        <p>Sunday is the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, and the White House is eager to court voters concerned about the environment. So the trip had to have a loftier purpose than sportsmanly pursuit of the wily bonefish and tarpon in the land of Key lime pie and Kon Tiki bars.</p>
        <p>In fact, this whole week is chockablock with what are supposed to be environmentally conscious events, culminating on Sunday in the Everglades, where Mr. Bush will cast his line and discuss conservation with Curt Gowdy for an ''American Sportsman'' television special.</p>
        <p>''Fishing on Earth Day,'' sniffed Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action. ''That's a real commitment.''</p>
        <p>President Bush ordinarily shies away from events designed so baldly for image polishing. But for the environment, one of the few areas where his popularity is slipping, he is making an exception. So, the Administration heads for the Great Outdoors.</p>
        <p>On Monday, children streamed out of the White House Easter egg roll carrying Virginia pine seedlings grown from genetically improved seeds and a booklet called ''Fifty Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth,'' like taking shorter showers and refusing plastic foam cups at fast-food restaurants.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Bush was the host of an 18-nation conference on global warming from pollution. In Florida on Earth Day, he is expected to approve a Coast Guard plan for new shipping lanes to protect the Florida Keys.</p>
        <p>But that is not the ''big announcement'' Florida environmentalists want to hear. They have been waiting for a new oil drilling ban long promised by the White House, and are waiting to pounce.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, even the daily ''points of light'' citations honoring volunteers are devoted to spaceship Earth. In his four-day trip in the South, which started today, Mr. Bush will honor Daniel Keith Odell, a marine biologist from Florida's Sea World Stranded Animals Research Facility.</p>
        <p>In Islamorada he will honor Reef Relief, a group that takes boys out to view the coral without dropping anchors that could damage the reefs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush defends his environmental record with his support for a tougher Clean Air Act, for elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank and for increased Federal money for climate research.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists find him less menacing than his predecessor. This week's global warming conference was supposed to prove he cares.But it turned out to be less than a perfect photo opportunity; Europeans demanded action, not talk.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Boskin, the White House economist, parried, saying the Administration had achieved a ''bold and aggressive and financially and intellectually forceful upgrading of the debate.'' Environmentalists like Dan Becker, lobbyist for the Sierra Club, countered that the emphasis on possible economic disruptions from conservation produced a disturbing clash of Greens and green eyeshades.</p>
        <p>The local chapter of the Sierra Club did more than talk; it announced it would sue the White House for not following the District of Columbia's office wastepaper recycling laws. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, had trouble keeping a straight face as he invoked national security concerns to explain the lack of compliance.</p>
        <p>The week's events, conducted at the President's usual fast pace, have left even Mr. Bush a bit confused and chagrined.</p>
        <p>''Look, I'm down there to have fun,'' Mr. Bush said of his fishing trip. ''If we can help by pointing out the sensitivity of the environment there, the ecological balance in the Everglades, I want to do that.''</p>
        <p>But he said, ''I want some understanding and sympathy when I'm out fishing, because I work like hell around here.''</p>
