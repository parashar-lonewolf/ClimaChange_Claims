        <p>LEAD: IT used to be that the weather was something to talk about casually, in passing, as a prelude to more important topics like the stock market or Presidential politics. We laughingly complained about the heat or the rain but endured them because, after all, they were natural events over which we had no control.</p>
        <p>IT used to be that the weather was something to talk about casually, in passing, as a prelude to more important topics like the stock market or Presidential politics. We laughingly complained about the heat or the rain but endured them because, after all, they were natural events over which we had no control. No more. Our recent weather has not been a laughing matter. The summer of '88 will be remembered as the summer the weather, indeed, the whole environment, turned bad.</p>
        <p>The worst of it is that we have no one and nothing to blame but ourselves. Our chlorofluorocarbons have eaten a hole in the ozone layer. Our fossil fuels are warming, perhaps permanently, the air. Our sewage is suffocating the ocean. The streams are full of chemicals. The soil is full of radon. Heaven's very rain is acid.</p>
        <p>It is as if the mother of us all - nature - has thrown up her hands and, with a sigh, said, ''Enough.'' She won't clean up after us anymore because she can't. She is too sick and too tired.</p>
        <p>It seems we have two choices: either we grow up and clean up after ourselves or we don't. Growing up as a people is no different from, and no easier than, growing up as a person. Adulthood means accountability. It means admitting and accepting responsibility for one's actions. It means recognizing finitude: There are some things you can do, some things you may do, and some things you will never be able to do, like bringing the dead back to life.</p>
        <p>Scientists tell us we can do something about our environment. As with everything else, there are choices to be made here, too. Some of the choices are easy, some are hard. Are we adult enough - can we become adult enough - to make and live by the hard choices?</p>
        <p>The easy way out is to rely on our technology to plug the leaks and patch the holes as they occur. If the ozone is depleting, replace it. Fire ''bullets'' of frozen ozone into the atmosphere or place solar-powered ozone generators in high-altitude balloons. If the air is too warm, cover the oceans with Styrofoam chips, which would reflect more sunlight back into space, or paint the roofs of every house on earth white.</p>
        <p>Legitimate scientists with legitimate scientific credentials are the people coming up with these ideas. Why? Because, in our panicked search for a quick, painless solution, we asked them to.</p>
        <p>There are, I fear, no quick, painless solutions to our environmental problems. Very few things in life are amenable to quick, painless solutions.</p>
        <p>In my household, when my 3-year-old does cartwheels in the living room and breaks a lamp, I don't go out and buy a stronger lamp. Instead, I demand that the cartwheels in the living room stop. The misbehavior must be corrected.</p>
        <p>So, too, with the environment. In the earth's household, the misbehavior - our misbehavior - must be corrected. Unfortunately, a quick, painless correction is not possible on a global scale any more than it is on an individual scale. The solution, if there is one, will be hard to discover and harder to implement, but only individuals, acting together, will be able to achieve it.</p>
        <p>What we need are honesty, courage and self-discipline. We can stop drinking, gambling and smoking. We can stop polluting. Perhaps there should be for all of us an organization called Polluters Anonymous, where we could openly confess our faults and help each other to overcome them.</p>
        <p>I know my faults are legion. I have put disposable diapers on my daughter. I have allowed cashiers at the supermarket to pack my groceries in plastic, rather than paper, bags. I have washed clothes in nonbiodegradable detergent. I have turned on the air conditioner too quickly and too often. I have driven when I could have walked. I have talked about the weather rather than done something about the weather.</p>
        <p>I have abused the environment and I am sorry. I want to stop before it is too late for me, for us, and for our children. I just need some help.</p>
