        <p>ESTHER STORIES</p>
        <p>By Peter Orner.</p>
        <p>227 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Mariner/</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin Company.</p>
        <p>Paper, $12.</p>
        <p>IN Peter Orner's first book, there are no mobile telephones, few televisions and no child abuse; no one mentions the Dow Jones or discusses global warming or drives an S.U.V. But if Orner did choose to write about these things, he would surely address them with the same attention and tenderness that he brings to even the most unconventional subjects in ''Esther Stories'': a girl carving her initials on a burnished mahogany table belonging to a middle-aged sea captain and his wife; a man watching his face change in a bathroom mirror; two actors putting on competing one-man shows about Edgar Allan Poe in the very same small town. But to list these is only to begin to suggest what Orner has accomplished. His real subject is the human spirit in all its vexed yearning. Orner doesn't simply bring his characters to life, he gives them souls.</p>
        <p>The collection is made up of 34 stories, some as short as a page, grouped into four sections. The first two, entitled ''What Remains'' and ''The Famous,'' contain unrelated stories. The last two, called ''Fall River Marriage'' and ''The Waters,'' revolve around two Jewish families, one living in Massachusetts, the other in the Midwest. Over all the stories hover what one might call the twin muses of geography and history. It is their presence, singly and jointly, that enables Orner on the one hand to write about material many authors would shrink from, and on the other to give a crucial sense of his characters living through time. Here, for example, is the setting of a story called ''Thumbs'':</p>
        <p>''Out near New Boston, Ill., floods are so common that the land is soggy no matter what the season. Even so, people say the Mississippi moves slower in their part of the western edge of the state. . . . In 1958, the National Park Service described New Boston as 'a charming old town originally laid out by Abraham Lincoln when he was junior surveyor at New Salem.' Now a single store remains open on Center Street, a Casey's Minimart, and if you want a tour of the museum (on the first floor of what used to be the Lincoln House Hotel) you can call one of two numbers written on a cardboard sign tacked to the front door and ask for either Debbie Shambrock or Eleanor Lloyd.''</p>
        <p>The description continues for almost another full page before we meet the main character, Janet, a high school senior who is determined to find a lightning-charred tree, off in the fields far outside of town, where the authorities have recently discovered the body of a woman teacher, killed by a former student. The occasion of the story is frankly sensational, but such is the authority of the detail that it's impossible to withhold belief. And, as in so much of Orner's work, the real sensation is not in the violence but in the unexpected direction he takes the story as Janet struggles to comprehend why her former classmate killed his teacher and then, using the rusty hinge of a corncrib, broke his own thumbs.</p>
        <p>When it comes to history, almost all of Orner's characters, young or old, feel the heft of the past. Sometimes public events are directly invoked, as in a title like ''Walt Kaplan reads 'Hiroshima,' March 1947,'' or in a scene where an elderly man, dying of throat cancer, dreams that he is General Grant writing his memoirs. More frequently, though, the history is of a private nature: a veteran of World War II remembers a moment when he stood on a bridge and saw a couple emerge from the woods, naked; a woman suddenly glimpses her long-dead brother in the face of a corpse; another woman tells a lover she can hear the previous occupants of rooms talking in the walls.</p>
        <p>The skillful deployment of history and geography has much to do with the success of ''Esther Stories,'' but all would be in vain were it not for Orner's mastery of language. He moves, seemingly effortlessly, between plain speech and more elevated diction, between short, flat sentences and sinuous, long ones. Consider this description of the sea captain and his wife after the girl, a teenager hired to help with the cleaning, carves her initials in their table. ''Yet over the longer years -- when the fish became scarcer, when they'd long since failed their vow to fill that house with children, when the silences between them sometimes lasted hours, when the captain's wife no longer paced the house, waiting for him, or word of him -- an odd thing. They still talked about the letters.''</p>
        <p>Best of all, Orner is a true democrat. Most of his characters struggle to hang onto even one of the fundamental rights -- life, love, the pursuit of happiness -- but every character, young or old, well-to-do or broke, maimed or whole, is worthy of the author's insight and eloquence.</p>
        <p>Walt and Sarah Kaplan, the protagonists of the third section, ''Fall River Marriage,'' are two excellent examples of this generosity of spirit. The owners of Kaplan's Furniture Store, they are overweight, talkative to the point of garrulity, not particularly well educated. Their lives have been somewhat constricted (they eloped to Providence when Sarah was 18 and their daughter was born six months later), but they emerge in these 11 stories as radiant, complex and heartbreaking. Separately and together, we see them during their long -- but not sufficiently long -- marriage: spending a day at the beach, watching the demolition of Walt's store, celebrating their daughter's wedding, talking to old friends.</p>
        <p>The section ends not with the poignant, single-paragraph story of Walt's fatal heart attack but with the couple's exuberant elopement. When the young Walt pulls up outside Sarah's house, she seems to have changed her mind. ''She doesn't bother to shake her head and certainly doesn't need to use her voice to say no again. Her face: Never, never, never, never, never.'' He stares at her desperately, taking in her lipstick, her hat and her knees, ''fat little knees he could eat without mustard,'' until at last Sarah gives in (''Awright already'') and they are on their way. As he drives her toward the justice of the peace, Walt thinks: ''Hasta Luego, woods by the Watupa! Ciao, blankets and trees! A bed, a bed, a bed, a bed, a bed, a bed, a bed, a bed, a bed.''</p>
        <p>Neither here nor elsewhere does Orner offer a single narrative of cause and effect. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that he doesn't believe such a narrative is possible, that he is convinced that life can only be understood and represented in sidelong glances. But through these glances emerges something brooding, mysterious, ineffable, beautiful. At any moment, we have the feeling, everything might become clear. We keep listening for the voices in the walls.</p>
