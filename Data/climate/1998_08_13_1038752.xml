        <p>As nearly as climatologists can tell by studying measurements dating back to the 1850's, the earth's average surface temperature has risen by about one degree over the last century. But measurements made by orbiting satellites have suggested that the lower atmosphere is cooling, leading some skeptics to argue that the world is not warming.</p>
        <p>Now two scientists in California have reanalyzed the two-decade record of satellite data and concluded that it has been distorted by the inevitable decay, or lowering, of the satellites' orbits as they encounter atmospheric resistance.</p>
        <p>Once this error is corrected, the scientists report today in the journal Nature, the satellite record shows the atmosphere has become warmer, but not as much as the surface has.</p>
        <p>The authors of the study, Frank J. Wentz and Dr. Matthias Schabel, atmospheric physicists with Remote Sensing Systems, a private research firm in Santa Rosa, Calif., report an atmospheric warming of about 0.13 of a degree Fahrenheit per decade.</p>
        <p>The finding could signal ''a sea change in the global warming debate,'' Dr. James E. Hansen and four colleagues write in a commentary that is to appear tomorrow in the journal Science. Dr. Hansen, the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, has long been an advocate of the view that emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide are warming the earth.</p>
        <p>If the Wentz-Schabel finding stands up, Dr. Hansen said in an interview, it will make it ''very difficult to deny the reality of global warming,'' though he and his colleagues note in the Science article that the finding is likely to be challenged and possibly revised.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Dr. John R. Christy of the University of Alabama, an originator and keeper of the satellite record, immediately offered a revision.  While Dr. Christy called the report, ''real'' and ''legitimate,'' he said  other corrections involving, for example, east-west drift of the satellites and instrument temperatures had also recently been made. The net result of all the corrections, he said, shows a very slight warming in the lower atmosphere, less than the figures reported in Nature and the reading derived from surface measurements.</p>
        <p>Dr. Christy acknowledged that this does not necessarily contradict the surface record. He and others have long maintained that the temperature profile of the surface and that of the lower atmosphere would not be expected to be identical, since they differ physically. Comparing the two records, many scientists say, is like comparing apples and oranges.</p>
        <p>''The surface is doing something slightly different from the atmosphere above,'' Dr. Christy said, ''and that's just the climate. They do not have to be the same.''</p>
        <p>Even so, he has long noted, the surface and satellite data agree well in many regions, including the Northern Hemisphere continents.</p>
        <p>For the last 10 years, Dr. Christy and a colleague, Dr. Roy W. Spencer of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville have been using data from weather satellites to put together a continuous global temperature record. The surface records have many gaps and inconsistencies resulting from changing methods of measurement.  And although analysts have tried to correct for these, Dr. Christy and Dr. Spencer saw their satellite data as having an advantage.</p>
        <p>A disadvantage, however, has been that the satellite data record goes back only to 1979, and many experts say this is too short a period to detect a meaningful trend. And it has been challenged on its own methodological grounds, most recently in today's Nature article.</p>
        <p>Even before the new corrections of the satellite record, Dr. Christy had calculated that once the short-lived warming effects of El Nino and the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions  were statistically removed, the satellite measurements showed an atmospheric warming trend of about 0.1 degree per decade. Now, with corrections in place, he calculates it at 0.05 degree to 0.18 degree per decade.  This compares with about 0.25 of a degree for the surface record.</p>
        <p>Experts say that over the long century and a half of the surface data record the effects of El Nino and volcanic eruptions tend to cancel each other out and that no adjustment for them is necessary.</p>
        <p>Even with El Nino and the volcanoes included, Dr. Christy said, the short satellite record now showed a warming trend of 0.07 degree per decade.</p>
        <p>This, he said, is because the 1997-98 edition of El Nino warmed the atmosphere so much that it counterbalanced the cooling effects of volcano eruptions in the 1980's and early 1990's, which emitted a haze that reflected sunlight.</p>
