        <p>BLIND MAN'S BLUFF  The Untold Story of American  Submarine Espionage.  By Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew, with Annette Lawrence Drew.  Illustrated. 352 pp. New York:  Public Affairs. $25.</p>
        <p>In 1968, two ballistic missile submarines, one Soviet and one American, died similar deaths. In each case an unexpected explosion set off a series of catastrophic events culminating in a dramatic plunge to depths where submarines collapse from bow to stern like accordions. Entombed in these blocks of steel were 200 men.</p>
        <p>Although the cold war ended less than a decade ago, it is farther away from us emotionally than World War II. There is something about the carnage and moral certainties of that war that makes it accessible even to the notoriously ahistorical Generation X. But the cold war, with the notable exception of the morality play of Vietnam, seems in retrospect a time of contingency plans and unrealized fears, now gratefully dissipated.</p>
        <p>Yet every day for over 40 years, young Russians and Americans went to very difficult jobs not knowing whether that day would be their last. It is fashionable now to play down the fears of the statesmen, to describe as manipulative or insincere Presidential or Kremlin statements of concern. But what is beyond doubt is the fear that the individual sailor, pilot or spy periodically felt in doing his duty.</p>
        <p>In deftly exploring the lives of engineers and sailors who spied on Soviet power from the depths of the world's oceans, Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew have produced an evocative and important look at the cold war. ''Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage'' is also satisfying to read, at times hurtling forward with the speed of a Polaris submarine. The use of submarines to plumb Soviet intentions and capabilities involved some of the most secret, or blackest, American projects of the cold war. Sontag, who has covered government and international affairs for The National Law Journal, and Drew, who is a reporter at The New York Times, cultivated veteran submariners who talked for the first time about spying. With the help of Annette Lawrence Drew and of an intrepid Russian colleague, they tracked down Soviet counterparts where appropriate, and set the sea stories into a wider cold war context.</p>
        <p>The effect is a compelling study of magnificent men and spying machines. Take the case of Capt. James E. Bradley Jr., a diesel submariner with World War II service. One of the frustrating truths of the cold war was that it was always extremely difficult to figure out what the Russians intended to do. Unlike General Eisenhower in World War II, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his successors were rarely presented by their intelligence chiefs with the high-level strategic chatter of their adversary. The Russians took better care with their codes and ciphers than the Nazis.</p>
        <p>Bradley, who by 1966 was director of undersea warfare for the Office of Naval Intelligence, came up with an ingenious partial solution: why not bug transmissions that the Russians would assume could not be bugged? Recalling the signs ''Cable Crossing. Do Not Anchor Cables'' from childhood days on the Mississippi, Bradley assumed that Russian shores would have similar warnings posted for underwater telephone cables. In 1971, with its periscope up, the nuclear submarine Halibut secretly traced the Siberian coastline and confirmed Bradley's hunch. After divers attached the largest telephone tap ever made to a cable on the floor of the Sea of Okhotsk, a stream of useful information about Soviet naval deployments and military exercises flowed to Washington. Had the Russians ever prepared for a first nuclear strike, this tap would have provided critical warning. Code-named ''Ivy Bells,'' this source would remain active for a decade, one of the greatest intelligence hauls of the cold war, until an American, Ronald Pelton, sold the secret to the Russians in 1980.</p>
        <p>The authors also provide simple stories of individual courage, beginning with a thrilling episode from the first days of cold war submarine spying. The diesel submarine was about as inhospitable a place to work as one could imagine. Smelly and moist, these 120-foot long canisters were often buffeted by waves. And they were vulnerable. If they didn't regularly approach the surface to pull fresh air in through a snorkel, their batteries would lose their charge while the crew suffocated from carbon dioxide in the air. With fear growing in 1949 that the Soviet Union would soon deploy its versions of U-boats in the open seas, the Navy sent submarines close to Soviet ports to follow such vessels or listen to their communications. As Sontag and Drew tell it, crews on the Tusk and the Cochino, with newly trained spooks aboard, learned that year that even in the cold war the greatest adversary could be the sea.</p>
        <p>On-board nuclear reactors would eventually scrub submarines of the pervasive ''Eau de Diesel'' and allow them to sail underwater for months at a time, but this progress reduced neither the tension nor the dangers of underwater spying. By the mid-60's, the arms race extended into the seas. Not only were the Russians deploying nuclear tipped ballistic missiles on submarines, but the French and the superpowers were using the ocean as a firing range to test new missiles. Among the new American fleet of nuclear submarines were spy boats with specially designed hulls to permit deep-water investigations, to detect strategic Soviet junk and when necessary to violate Soviet territorial waters.</p>
        <p>The twin submarine disasters of 1968 provided a test of the new American approach to the deep. That year the Russians lost a Golf class diesel submarine in the Pacific, while the American nuclear attack submarine Scorpion disappeared on its way back to Norfolk, Va. In a mark of the sophistication of the naval spy game by that time, neither the White House nor the Kremlin blamed the other for the unexplained disappearance of a ballistic missile submarine. Unlike the United States, however, Moscow had no way of finding its sailors. Soviet submariners were trained to send signals from predetermined points along a tight path from the motherland to their firing positions off the American coast.</p>
        <p>The Russian sub's failure to send its position triggered a desperate search by a dozen Soviet ships. But Moscow lacked the underwater technology to investigate the ocean floor for her dead. Five years earlier, the loss of 129 men on the American nuclear submarine Thresher had inspired the Navy to promote a serious deep-water program to investigate wrecks. In 1968 this program grabbed the attention of the White House by finding the Scorpion 11,000 feet below the surface, and by locating the Soviet sub 1,700 miles northwest of Hawaii, with its complement of cipher machines and nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>This hunt seemed to capture the spirit of the entire cold war. Not only did technological prowess permit Americans to set new standards for the Russians to match, but it also led to costly American overreaching. Learning of the Navy's achievement, the C.I.A. persuaded the White House to finance a joint venture with Howard Hughes to recover the Soviet submarine from the Pacific floor. Warned that the submarine was too fragile and would break apart under the stresses of a climb to the surface, the C.I.A. went ahead anyway -- and 90 percent of the Soviet sub sheared away as it was lifted by the Hughes-designed ship Glomar Explorer in 1974. The C.I.A. found only six Russian corpses in the portion brought to the surface.</p>
        <p>So was all this courage and innovation worth it? The authors are careful not to offer grand theories. However, they suggest that espionage played a significant role. It reduced uncertainties and increased confidence that neither superpower was bent on blowing up the world. But it also increased the tension of the cold war, the need to follow enemy submarines closely, to enter hostile waters and to push old ships beyond their limits. The Russians did not rely as much as the Americans on this highly technological spying, but they enjoyed equally dramatic results. From 1967 until the mid-80's, an American Navy officer, John Walker, and some members of his family gave the Russians the keys to copying our submarine technology and to following changes in our naval doctrine. As Soviet ships got quieter, their payloads more dangerous and their use wiser, the need for American spying increased. Until the very last days of the cold war, in the rarefied world of undersea chess, ignorance seemed the greatest danger. With their book, Sontag and Drew introduce us to one of the least known and most harrowing battlefields of the superpower conflict.</p>
