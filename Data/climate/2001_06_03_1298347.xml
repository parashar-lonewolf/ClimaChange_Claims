        <p>Gardening at our house still feels like a perennial act of reclamation. Perhaps it always will. Every year I imagine that the work we did in the vegetable beds last summer and fall will make it possible to plant that much sooner in the spring, and yet every May and June I feel as though I am retaking territory I had already won, and late in doing so, to boot. The problem isn't usually weeds or the snow-matted cornstalks I thought I'd gathered in November. The problem is ambition and a taste for ingenuity. The area under cultivation is always increasing, and in the established beds I seem to give in to diverging urges -- to garden as intensively and organically as I can and to give more and more formality to the look of the beds themselves. Not long ago, I planted a Union Jack of leeks and salad greens, a pleasingly futile gesture.</p>
        <p>So I've derived a lot of solace this spring from Joan Dye Gussow's THIS ORGANIC LIFE: Confessions of a Suburban Homesteader (Chelsea Green, $22.95). On the surface, Gussow is a hardheaded practitioner of common sense, a respected writer on nutrition and health and a great believer in the necessity, as well as the practice, of eating locally grown foods. But scratch the surface and what you also find in Gussow is an unhesitating romantic. After living in a house in Congers, N.Y., for 36 years, she and her husband, Alan, bought a converted Odd Fellows hall on a narrow lot sloping down to the Hudson River in Piermont. They bought it for the light. Reclaiming the property was a blissful nightmare. Halfway through restoring the house, the Gussows discovered it needed to be torn down. When the vegetable beds were at their height, the Hudson rose and carried them away. In the midst of it all, Alan Gussow died. His death comes as a shock, a measure of the reader's unusual involvement in the lives of this gardening couple.</p>

        <p>Gardening at our house still feels like a perennial act of reclamation. Perhaps it always will. Every year I imagine that the work we did in the vegetable beds last summer and fall will make it possible to plant that much sooner in the spring, and yet every May and June I feel as though I am retaking territory I had already won, and late in doing so, to boot. The problem isn't usually weeds or the snow-matted cornstalks I thought I'd gathered in November. The problem is ambition and a taste for ingenuity. The area under cultivation is always increasing, and in the established beds I seem to give in to diverging urges -- to garden as intensively and organically as I can and to give more and more formality to the look of the beds themselves. Not long ago, I planted a Union Jack of leeks and salad greens, a pleasingly futile gesture.</p>
        <p>So I've derived a lot of solace this spring from Joan Dye Gussow's THIS ORGANIC LIFE: Confessions of a Suburban Homesteader (Chelsea Green, $22.95). On the surface, Gussow is a hardheaded practitioner of common sense, a respected writer on nutrition and health and a great believer in the necessity, as well as the practice, of eating locally grown foods. But scratch the surface and what you also find in Gussow is an unhesitating romantic. After living in a house in Congers, N.Y., for 36 years, she and her husband, Alan, bought a converted Odd Fellows hall on a narrow lot sloping down to the Hudson River in Piermont. They bought it for the light. Reclaiming the property was a blissful nightmare. Halfway through restoring the house, the Gussows discovered it needed to be torn down. When the vegetable beds were at their height, the Hudson rose and carried them away. In the midst of it all, Alan Gussow died. His death comes as a shock, a measure of the reader's unusual involvement in the lives of this gardening couple.</p>
        <p>But Joan Gussow is an indomitable reclaimer. For her, gardening is literally an act of reclamation, restoring an overgrown site to productivity, rebalancing, if only on a small scale, an agriculture that is out of whack, reviving a life that must have faltered sadly when her husband died. It's very rare to be moved by a gardening book, but ''This Organic Life'' has an uncommon depth of feeling, not in the prose, which is plain-speaking, and not in its philosophical aspirations, which are more economic than spiritual. There is something happily, almost chaotically jumbled -- and thus lifelike -- about the way this book proceeds: a flood, a recipe, a death, a recipe, a community garden, a recipe. What ties it all together isn't merely Gussow's passion for making herself useful. It's her understanding that ''the production and consumption of fresh local food is so rich an experience for me that I find it hard to imagine how I would live if I couldn't grow what I eat and eat what I grow.''</p>
        <p>The inspiration for Gussow's style of gardening is a much-venerated book by John Jeavons called HOW TO GROW MORE VEGETABLES: Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine (Ten Speed, paper, $16.95), which is now in its fifth edition. Jeavons's book belongs to an old tradition of systematic advice for vegetable gardeners. Consider, for instance, William Cobbett's ''Journal of a Year's Residence in the United States of America'' (1818), which includes a chapter amiably called ''Ruta Baga Culture.'' Or Jacques-Felix Lelièvre's NEW LOUISIANA GARDENER (Louisiana State University, $29.95), first published in French in 1838 and now immaculately edited and translated into English for the first time by Sally Kittredge Reeves.</p>
        <p>Lelièvre was born in Caen in 1795 and sailed for New Orleans in 1834, where, before long, he owned a bookstore and stationery shop that also sold seeds, fruit trees and ornamentals. ''New Louisiana Gardener'' -- Nouveau Jardinier de la Louisiane'' -- is possessed by a spirit of rationality, quite un-Gallic in its modesty. In Lelièvre's garden almanac and survey of vegetable cultivation, scarcely a word is wasted, and every word is still sound sense. The volume closes with a calendar of all the saints' days, something garden books no longer include. The care with which this old tome has been presented to the modern reader might serve as a model for republishing other forgotten but still deserving gardening manuals. There cannot be too many.</p>
        <p>The pleasure of books like Lelièvre's is getting an intimate glimpse of past gardens. They seem to bloom and bear fruit before your eyes. There's a similar, more complicated pleasure in THE LONDON TOWN GARDEN, 1740-1840 (Yale University, $60), by Todd Longstaffe-Gowan. Making prodigious use of maps, prints and drawings of the period, Longstaffe-Gowan, who is a landscape architect, creates a fascinating portrait of the slender, often brick-walled gardens that lay, and still lie, behind London's town houses, the kind of garden where Lady Bellaston might have tried to entertain a reluctant Tom Jones. London changes almost unbearably in the century this book covers, from a city verged by rural paths and open fields to one paved and squared, all its green encompassed by dwelling walls. As Longstaffe-Gowan portrays him, the 18th- and early-19th-century urban garden designer -- someone like Joseph Spence, professor of poetry at Oxford -- is a botanical sonneteer, determined to do formal wonders in a confined space with plants that can tolerate the famous smoke of London. Through these back gardens, hidden from the street front, we get a rare glimpse of concealed lives.</p>
        <p>Readers seldom have a chance to peer as intimately into gardeners' intentions as we do in A YEAR IN OUR GARDENS: Letters by Nancy Goodwin and Allen Lacy (University of North Carolina, $27.50). In 1997, these two remarkable gardeners -- Goodwin is renowned for establishing Montrose Nursery in the North Carolina Piedmont, Lacy for his garden essays and his newsletter, Homeground -- decided to conduct an epistolary conversation. What begins rather stiffly, as if acknowledging that this is an overheard correspondence, soon relaxes into something fine and leisurely. Before long, Lacy and Goodwin are gossiping in botanical Latin and mulching their gossip with the doings of everyday life. This book is one of the riches in an unusually rich season for literary gardening, which includes Sharman Apt Russell's ANATOMY OF A ROSE: Exploring the Secret Life of Flowers (Perseus Publishing, $24), Joan Marble's NOTES FROM AN ITALIAN GARDEN (Morrow, $25) and John Hanson Mitchell's WILDEST PLACE ON EARTH: Italian Gardens and the Invention of Wilderness (Merloyd Lawrence/Counterpoint, $24).</p>
        <p>But really the weather is too fine to allow a reader much peace indoors. It's hard to resist the more practical volumes published this spring, which get propped up on the potting bench or shelved nearby for easy reference. The chief of them this season is THE BIG BOOK OF HERBS: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference to Herbs of Flavor and Fragrance (Interweave Press, $39.95), by Arthur O. Tucker and Thomas DeBaggio. It's hard to think of anything an herb gardener might want to know that this book doesn't contain, from detailed cultivation advice to an analysis of the chemistry of essential oils derived from each species. This book will get dirty fast. So too will Stefan Buczacki's PLANT PROBLEMS (David &amp; Charles/Sterling, $29.95), which I can imagine carrying out to the garden with me when something goes awry in the potato patch and the culprit needs identifying. Aside from the photograph of the hedgehog (tellingly named Erinaceus europaeus) you needn't worry that this book was written for a British audience. We share many pests.</p>
        <p>On that same shelf of hard-working books, you'll want to have Gordon Hayward's STONE IN THE GARDEN: Inspiring Designs and Practical Projects (Norton, $39.95), easily the best and most useful book on stonework to come along in several years. This spring, too, marks the appearance of a newly designed, newly written series of Taylor's Guides (Houghton Mifflin, $23), including Perennials and Bulbs by Barbara W. Ellis, Shrubs by Kathleen Fisher and Trees by Susan A. Roth. Gardeners of a more exhaustive, not to say eclectic, frame of mind will immerse themselves in two truly definitive works, THE CACTUS FAMILY (Timber Press, $99.95), by Edward F. Anderson, and FERN GROWER'S MANUAL (Timber Press, $59.95), by Barbara Joe Hoshizaki and Robbin C. Moran, which first appeared when Gerald Ford was in the Oval Office but has been revised and expanded to reflect the lapse of so much time and so many presidents.</p>
        <p>Gardeners who wonder if global warming means that Zone 5 is now really Zone 6 should consider GROWING SHRUBS AND SMALL TREES IN COLD CLIMATES (Contemporary Books, $49.95), by Nancy Rose, Don Selinger and John Whitman. Despite some needless redundancies in layout, this is a valuable book. Don't forget FOLIAGE: Dramatic and Subtle Leaves for the Garden (Trafalgar Square, $35), by David Joyce, an extremely useful guide to foliage shapes and textures. The most liberating gardening book this season is ARTISTS IN THEIR GARDENS (Sasquatch, paper, $23.95), by Valerie Easton and David Laskin. There is, of course, a lot of art in the northwestern gardens featured in this book, and you know what they say about the beholder's eye. But the gardens themselves are extraordinary, profoundly personal, paradigmatic of nothing except the thrill of making them and living within them. What else can you say about Johanna Nitzke Marquis's garden, which contains a pyramid of bowling balls, or about Heronswood, the profuse, deeply imaginative woodland garden created by Dan Hinkley? But for readers who also need a dose of the paradigm itself, there is A YEAR IN THE GARDEN: In England, Wales and Northern Ireland (Abrams, $29.95), with photographs by Nick Meers and Stephen Robson and text by John Sales and Margaret Willes. For those who want to extend their horizons farther afield, THE LOOKING-GLASS GARDEN: Plants and Gardens of the Southern Hemisphere (Timber Press, $39.95), by Peter Thompson, will easily do the trick, as will THE HIMALAYAN GARDEN: Growing Plants From the Roof of the World (Timber Press, $34.95), by Jim Jermyn.</p>
        <p>Every spring brings a glut of oversize flower books, which are printed in Cinemascope and suppose that people who like big flower books cannot read. The thing these books are good for is setting seedling flats upon, to protect the finish of your woodwork if, like me, you start seedlings in the library. Don't confuse those books with the one that comes after this colon: FLORA (Abrams, paper, $29.95), by the fashion photographer Nick Knight, with text by Sandra Knapp, a curator at London's Natural History Museum. For one thing, this book has plenty of words. They're in small type at the back. Up front are 46 photographs. They're the end result of three and a half years of searching through six million specimens in the museum's herbarium. The most recent specimen is Amherstia nobilis, collected in 1988. The oldest specimen is either Allium fistulosum or Rosa parvifolia, both collected about the time Joseph Spence was designing gardens. For all these years these specimens have lain obdurately pressed in dark drawers. But in these amazing photographs, shot against a stark white background, light spills through veins and petals and leaf cells, revealing such long repressed color, such vividness of forgotten form, that you're left to conclude that the ephemeral does not vanish, that spring and every other season remain permanent in a plant.</p>
