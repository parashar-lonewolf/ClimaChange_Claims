        <p>Multiple Attacks in Iraq Leave at Least 14 Dead  A civilian airplane was forced into an emergency landing after it was hit by a missile in Baghdad, American military officials said, and suicide attackers exploded bombs at two police stations, killing at least 14 people, including two young girls.</p>

        <p>Bombings Fail Politically  One aim of the bombings in Istanbul was to drive a wedge between the United States and Turkey. But it is not at all clear that they have succeeded in doing so, although the losses suffered by Turkey, Britain and Italy could force some adjustments as President Bush pursues his campaign against terrorism.</p>

        <p>Saudis Contemplate Change  A series of deadly terrorist bombings in Saudi Arabia, combined with rare street protests and the grudging recognition of the involvement of Saudis in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, have forced the country, once among the most isolated of nations, to re-examine the way it is run.</p>

        <p>Georgian President Flees  Protesters in Georgia broke into Parliament, forcing President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, left, to flee. Mr. Shevardnadze declared a state of emergency and said he would not resign, as the main opposition leader pronounced the takeover a ''velvet revolution.''</p>

        <p>U.N. Will Seek Aid for Liberia  The United Nations, despite the drain on donors by Afghanistan and Iraq, hopes to raise at least $300 million at a conference early next year to help with the reconstruction of Liberia after years of civil conflict.</p>

        <p>Comeback for Croatian Party  Croatia's former governing party, the Croatian Democratic Union, ousted almost four years ago in disgrace over allegations of corruption and its hard-line nationalist policies, is making a comeback and is favored to win parliamentary elections.</p>

        <p>Divided House Passes Medicare Drug Bill  A fiercely polarized House approved legislation in an all-night session that would add prescription drug benefits to Medicare. The final version of the bill, a compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators, was adopted by a vote of 220 to 215. The legislation tries to reconcile two often-conflicting goals: expanding Medicare's benefits and making the program more cost-efficient.</p>

        <p>A new tax-free health savings account was included in the Medicare bill. These accounts have long been a goal of conservative lawmakers and academics.</p>

        <p>F.B.I. Tracks Protesters  The F.B.I. has collected extensive information on the tactics, training and organization of antiwar demonstrators and has advised local law enforcement officials to report any suspicious activity at protests to its counterterrorism squads, according to interviews and a confidential bureau memorandum.</p>

        <p>Congress Backs New Museum  Congress has passed legislation to build a national museum in Washington dedicated to the history and culture of African-Americans, nearly 90 years after a similar idea was first advanced by a group of black Civil War veterans.</p>

        <p>Food-Borne Illness on the Rise  The recent outbreaks of hepatitis A linked to contaminated scallions imported from Mexico, which have killed three people and sickened hundreds, are only the latest examples in a sharp rise of food-borne illness from fruits and vegetables.</p>

        <p>Methane Level Stabilizes  Atmospheric levels of methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, have stopped growing, scientists report. Climate experts said the stabilization, probably temporary, is evidence that efforts to curb emissions could slow global warming.</p>
