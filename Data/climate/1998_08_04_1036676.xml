        <p>Peter S. Raven jumps up from the conference table at midsentence and disappears out the door, returning loaded down with a stack of fat books. He picks up the conversation as though he never left.</p>
        <p>''These are my babies,'' he says, patting the latest volumes in ''The Flora of China'' and ''The Flora of North America'' series chronicling  ''survivors and new species.''</p>
        <p>While Dr. Raven, botanist, evolutionary biologist and director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, has not been out there picking all the daisies himself, his ''biopoliticking'' and networking lurk behind the collaborative projects to catalogue and understand plants all over the world.</p>
        <p>The same biopoliticking behind the ''Flora'' series surfaced last month with the announcement that the Missouri Botanical Garden, Washington University, the University of Missouri and Monsanto Company would be partners in a new $146 million Donald Danforth Plant Science Center.</p>
        <p>Supporters say it will be the largest plant science center in the world and turn St. Louis -- already renowned among botanists because of the garden -- into an agricultural Silicon Valley when it opens in 2000.</p>
        <p>''I specialize in networking,'' Dr. Raven said. ''There is an enormous kind of pleasure in working with people, helping them to realize what they want to do. I like to link people.''  Jonathan Kleinbard, a former University of Chicago vice president who recently became the garden's deputy director, said his boss ''likes to have 27 balls in the air.''</p>
        <p>Indeed.</p>
        <p>Since 1971, when he left an associate professorship at Stanford University with no more administrative experience than ''part-time access'' to a secretary, Dr. Raven has turned a rather scruffy patch of real estate in a decaying urban neighborhood into an international center of biodiversity research and activism, a community magnet and one of the nation's largest herbariums.</p>
        <p>And, he quickly added, the fastest expanding collection in the world, with 120,000 specimens added each year and at least a dozen staff taxonomists collecting somewhere in the world at any given time.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Raven arrived at the garden as a 35-year-old Californian with no particular plan in mind, he found 85 employees and a budget of $650,000. Today, he directs a staff of 354, including 55 researchers with Ph.D.'s, and oversees a budget of $20 million. The New York Botanical Garden, by comparison, has a staff of about 100, including 30 Ph.D.'s. Recently, the Missouri garden opened an $8.6 million research center, housing a 122,000-volume library, nearly five million herbarium specimens and the TROPICOS database -- http://mobot.mobot.org/Pick/Search/pick.html, which averages over a million hits a month.</p>
        <p>Known locally as Shaw's Garden, the place was created in 1859 by Henry Shaw, a major landowner who made his fortune selling goods to traders and pioneers headed west.</p>
        <p>An amateur botanist, Shaw worked with George Engleman, a physician and botanist, to create a center for education, research and horticultural display. Shaw also endowed a school of botany at Washington University, a link between garden and university that continues today with the director holding a tenured seat on the faculty, teaching graduate students.</p>
        <p>By the early 20's, the garden had built a national reputation for research and training, but by the time Dr. Raven arrived it was, as he describes it, ''like an art museum with exhibits only in a few rooms.''</p>
        <p>Only 10 acres were laid out in gardens -- most of the 79 acres Henry Shaw had set aside still looked like the treeless prairie it once was. Dr. Raven set to work not only gardening but also building support.</p>
        <p>A 1982 election gave the garden access to property tax revenues, which now make up 28.9 percent of the budget. An additional 30.4 percent comes from contributions, bequests and memberships, now over 30,000.</p>
        <p>Over 250,000 people visit the garden each year, wandering through the living rain forest, feeding giant carp in the Japanese Garden, strolling through the Victorian Garden or the Rock Garden or the English Woodland Garden or simply admiring sculpture by Alexander Calder, Henry Moore, Carl Milles or Frank Stella. Gardeners get tips; jazz and  gospel fans come to concerts. Children troop through on class outings.</p>
        <p>Dr. Raven never misses a chance to get people involved -- in St. Louis and beyond.</p>
        <p>But unlike Candide, he is not content to cultivate his own garden. He travels the world -- Washington, Australia, India, China, the Vatican are ticketed these days -- not to collect plants but to stir others to action, build human networks and promote biodiversity in the face of development. He makes speeches, lobbies politicians and corporate leaders, puts scientists together with research projects.</p>
        <p>Locally, he has been grand marshal of the Veiled Prophet Parade, a St. Louis institution for some 120 years, and served on the University of Missouri board of curators. When he was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame two years ago, he joined Henry Shaw, Ulysses S. Grant, Josephine Baker, Stan Musial as famous folk with roots or other important links to St. Louis.</p>
        <p>And if there is any doubt of his local commitment, Dr. Raven says ''Missour-ah,'' not ''Missour-ee.''</p>
        <p>On the national level he is home secretary of the National Academy of Sciences, chairman of the report review committee of the National Research Council, member of the committee for research and exploration of the National Geographic Society. He also serves on the President's Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology and this year chaired a While House panel on environmental and economic strategies.</p>
        <p>Dr. Raven has been a National Science Foundation fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, a MacArthur Fellow, headed the Botanical Society of America, the Society for the Study of Evolution, the American Society of Naturalists, the American Institute of Biological Sciences and then some. He has written 18 books and more than 450 articles.</p>
        <p>''I have the type of personality that likes to be interrupted constantly,'' he said. ''I like a lot of things in play. I get rejuvenated by noise and interruptions and have a great power of recall.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Raven, born in Shanghai in 1936 into a family of American bankers, counts as ancestors Mayflower pilgrims and a British Redcoat, but the strongest DNA may come from  his maternal grandfather's grandfather: Patrick Breen, who arrived in California in 1847 after spending the winter snowbound with the Donner Party in the Sierra Nevadas. Of the 87 pioneers, only 46 survived, including all 9 of the Breens.</p>
        <p>Now, at 62, Dr. Raven is doing what he began doing at age 6: exploring nature. An only child, he read a book on insects when he was sick in bed and then began growing caterpillars into butterflies. That led to exploring vacant lots around San Francisco in search of plant specimens. At 8, he became the youngest member of the California Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>By 10, he was comparing field notes with Alice Eastwood, the grand old lady of California botany, then 90. At 12, he joined the Sierra Club and ended up sharing a tent with Ledyard Stebbins, who has been called one of the foremost plant evolutionary biologists of the century. At 16, he discovered a Clarkia franciscana, a member of the evening primrose, which had not been seen in Marin County since 1900; a subspecies, Ravenii, was later named in his honor.</p>
        <p>Hardly surprising, he chose academic studies in botany, graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California at Berkeley and obtaining a Ph.D. from the University of California at Los Angeles. He was networking even then.</p>
        <p>''As a graduate student,'' he said, ''I had 15 other graduate students working on the evening primrose. They said I was the only graduate student to have graduate students.''</p>
        <p>At Stanford, after a postdoctoral fellowship, he began looking beyond botany toward evolution and biodiversity. He and a colleague, Dr. Paul Ehrlich, came up with a theory of co-evolution, a process in which species change as the species they interact with change. But they also became increasingly worried about what was going on in the world.</p>
        <p>''We began thinking about population,'' Dr. Raven said. ''In the late 60's, we became concerned about plant extinction. We began to put it all together. The real problem was that the kinds of things we liked to study were disappearing.''</p>
        <p>And he started worrying about how many more species were disappearing than being created and about what was happening to the rain forest before botanists had even started to find out what was there.</p>
        <p>Ticktock, ticktock. At the Garden's Climatron, a flashing electronic bank counts down the disappearing acres of rain forest. Dr. Raven also frets about topsoil, the ozone layer, skin cancer, cutting down forests without replacing them, industrial wastes, global warming. His warnings often have him labeled a pessimist.</p>
        <p>''The 1990's and the first few decades of the 21st century are likely to be the most tumultuous and destructive of the natural resources of our planet that we may ever face,'' he has written.</p>
        <p>''We can either decide to be conservative in dealing with biodiversity -- such species are of such fundamental importance to us, and their loss is absolute and irreversible -- or we can recklessly conclude, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that what we are destroying is not important to us.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone likes the strategies he chooses to save ecological systems. He bets on multinationals.</p>
        <p>''The way I see it,'' Dr. Raven said, ''multinational corporations are one of the best vehicles to achieve global sustainability. Unlike governments, which can pretend there is no global warming because they can live from election to election, the corporations can't live in fantasy. They have to return value to shareholders.''</p>
        <p>He and the garden have been criticized by various groups for working with corporations, particularly Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis. The garden's new research center is named the Monsanto Center and Monsanto is a major donor in the new plant science center, which will explore genetic engineering, leading to commercial applications.</p>
        <p>Dr. Raven dismissed such criticism as he spewed out numbers of things that were disappearing. A man with a cause, he can wear out board directors, committee members, politicians, academics and critics with his enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Now he is after Pope John Paul II. Dr. Raven will be going to Rome three times in the next six months in an effort to persuade the Pope to join his crusade, and he plans to push hard for the concept of ''sustainability,'' or preservation of the earth's resources.</p>
        <p>''If I can get the Pope to put sustainability higher on his agenda, present it as a world problem,'' Dr. Raven said as though talking to himself, ''then I would be very successful and happy.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 7, 1998, Friday  An article in Science Times on Tuesday about Dr. Peter S. Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, misstated the size of the staff of the New York Botanical Garden. The New York garden has 547 employees, not about 100. The Missouri garden has 354.</p>
