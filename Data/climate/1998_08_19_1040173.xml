        <p>It was probably too much to hope that the first line of President Clinton's address to the nation would be: ''Thank you for tuning in to my Presidential dialogue on race.''</p>
        <p>Instead we got a speech, at once mortifying and legalistically hairsplitting, that proved one thing: People do not change their character. The same can be said for the media, which spent two days prior to Mr. Clinton's four-minute speech busily manufacturing entertainment in the guise of ''news.''</p>
        <p>And so there was no catharsis on Monday, no big Shakespearean emotions that follow a tragic fall. If Watergate gave us ''a cancer'' on the Presidency as its metaphor, Clintongate has given us ''wiggle room.'' We don't feel like crying, and we don't feel like laughing (the summer's best semen-stained farce, by popular acclamation, remains ''There's Something About Mary''). We mainly feel like taking a bath.</p>
        <p>Now we're trapped in Groundhog Day. We know the story is over: the public told pollsters its denouement (yes he's a liar, no to impeachment) weeks ago. But the sordid melody will repeat itself with variations for two more years. Kenneth Starr's report will be finessed by both Mr. Clinton and Congress. There will be no dialogue on race, or Social Security, or anything else -- just a lame duck running out a second-term clock. And you know what? The Republic, if not the immediate political prospects of the Democratic Party, will survive.</p>
        <p>The only real suspense is whether Mr. Starr has anything to show for the non-erotic investigations he spent $30 million or so pursuing for three-plus years (Castle Grande, anyone?) before being turned on to sex by Linda Tripp in January, and whether Al Gore, who chose to spend this week checking out global warming in Hawaii firsthand, will return to face the campaign finance music on the mainland. In Mr. Gore's absence, the de facto Vice President has been Jesse Jackson, whose bulletins to the press of his prayerful sessions with the Clintons would be touching if they weren't so reminiscent of the absolution bestowed on the disgraced Richard Nixon by the late, great Rabbi Baruch Korff.</p>
        <p>Compared with the rest of the marathon pre-speech countdown on television, at least Mr. Jackson's lamentations had some news content. CNN posted a digital clock on screen ticking off the ''time elapsed'' of the President's testimony -- a gesture to blood-sport fans that not only was pointless but inaccurate, since the testimony was interrupted by breaks. On MSNBC, a Newsweek journalist did a wrap-up of politicians' bimbos past. On Fox, the figure who is most emblematic of this whole story, Clintonian toe-sucker turned thumb-sucking pundit Dick Morris, retailed innuendo about Orrin Hatch. It was also on Fox that another Newsweek writer's ruminations were framed by rapid-fire graphics on the ''alleged'' scandals of every President, not excepting Taylor (nepotism) and Pierce, Andrew Johnson and Grant (a trifecta of alcoholism).</p>
        <p>Writing in The Los Angeles Times on Sunday, William Schneider noted that in a new Gallup Poll the news media's 74 percent disapproval rating had surpassed Mr. Starr's 58 percent to approach Monica Lewinsky's. ''In the public's view, the press is no different from Monica,'' he wrote. ''They're all tramps!''</p>
        <p>It's days like Monday that have led to this pass. If the biggest lie of 1998 has been ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman,'' the second-biggest lie is a pious talking head on TV saying some version of ''Oh how we hate covering this story about the President's sexual relations with that woman.'' The tone of the coverage has been orgiastic from the moment the Pope was dumped in Cuba; for every factual development there have been days of prurient speculation and open longing for what in the porno biz is called ''the money shot'' (the still-elusive dress). On Monday, even when there was no information to be had about what was going on in the White House Map Room, TV anchors interviewed each other or replayed a recondite piece about cyber-optic cable rather than devote appreciable air time to, say, the ongoing story in Northern Ireland or even the non-erogenous Clinton scandals.</p>
        <p>This saga has soiled everyone who has touched it -- and I certainly don't exclude myself. Only the bipartisan majority of the American people, who have been crying ''Enough!'' for months now and whose number easily dwarfs the Nielsen ratings of the All Monica show, are clean.</p>
