        <p>LEAD:  O'NEILL MEMORABILIA</p>
        <p>O'NEILL MEMORABILIA</p>
        <p>Until Dec. 21, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale will display a comprehensive exhibition of memorabilia, notes, diaries and original manuscripts from its large collection of material by and about Eugene O'Neill.</p>
        <p>Most of it was given to the university by Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, the playwright's wife, with additional items from the Theater Guild, original producers of many of O'Neill's plays on Broadway.</p>
        <p>By exhibiting the details of his private life as well as his literary and theatrical accomplishments, a clear vision emerges of how O'Neill based the characters in his plays on his family. The destructive relationships and addiction to drugs and alcohol at home were woven into several of the plots that won him four Pulitzer Prizes and the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p>
        <p>Among the items on display are photographs of his father, the actor James O'Neill, his mother and brother, and of the Pequot Avenue section of New London where the family cottage still stands as a museum. There is also the original manuscript of ''A Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and unpublished notes for ''Mourning Becomes Electra.''</p>
        <p>The library, at 121 Wall Street in New Haven, is open from 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. weekdays, and 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, free of charge. It will be closed for the Thanksgiving weekend. For more information call 432-2977.  MODEL TRAINS ON DISPLAY</p>
        <p>A free exhibition of model trains for children of all ages opens Saturday through December at the Eli Whitney Museum in Hamden. Taken from the collection of George Graham, a local train buff, the show will primarily consist of Lionel and American Flyer models dating from the early 1930's.</p>
        <p>With controls, visitors will be able tooperate the 10 to 12 cars that form each train. Multi-level settings of New Haven's railroad yards as they were 50 years ago will form the background, with all the requisite bridges, tunnels, buildings, lights, whistles, trees and silhouettes of the surrounding landscape. Several dozen additional trains will be on display, and a gift shop will have train accessories and memorabilia.</p>
        <p>The museum, at 915 Whitney Avenue, is open from 3 to 5 P.M. Wednesday, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. Thursday to Saturday, and noon to 5 P.M. Sunday. Saturday's opening is from 2 to 5 P.M. Call 777-1833 for more information.  BRITISH COMPOSERS TALK</p>
        <p>The Yale Center for British Art is branching out from the visual to the musical, sponsoring a series of concert-discussions featuring contemporary British composers. The second program takes place from 2 to 4 P.M. today in the museum at 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven.</p>
        <p>Richard Rodney Bennett and Nicholas Maw are the composers who will discuss with each other and the audience the state of modern British and American music. Mr. Bennett, who lives in New York City, has composed for the concert hall, opera, chamber ensembles, chorales and jazz groups. His film scores for ''Murder on the Orient Express,'' ''Nicholas and Alexandra,'' and ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' brought him three Oscar nominations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maw, who maintains a residence in Washington, D.C., has also composed a broad range of music and is currently working on commissions for an opera to be presented by the British Broadcasting Company and a piece for the London Sinfonietta. His music may be heard on recordings by the Academy of St. Martin in-the-Fields, the English Chamber Orchestra and the British Broadasting Company Symphony Orchestra, among many others.</p>
        <p>A performance by the Dorian Wind Quintet, an American ensemble formed at Tanglewood in 1961, will follow the discussion. Admission is free. Call 432-2850 for more information.  'GREENHOUSE' EFFECTS</p>
        <p>Eight organizations concerned with the future of the environment have organized a program titled ''Mother Earth Heats Up: The Impact of the Greenhouse Effect on the Environment,'' to be presented at 8 P.M. Tuesday in the Darien Town Hall on Renshaw Road. Dr. J. P. Myers, senior vice president for science and sanctuaries of the National Audubon Society, will be the speaker. He will offer computer projections of the greenhouse effect on food supplies, sea levels, human populations, plant and animal life, and climates throughout the world. He will also review the causes of the greenhouse effect, and discuss the pros and cons of various proposed solutions.</p>
        <p>The program's sponsors include Audubon Societies and Nature Centers in Darien, Greenwich, New Canaan and Westport and the Fairfield County Sierra Club. Admission is free.  STATE ARTISTS</p>
        <p>The trend toward installing art galleries in commercial buildings has spread to Hartford, where the Connecticut Gallery, based in Marlborough, has opened a branch called Art at 100 Pearl. The gallery is on the ground floor of a new office building at that address.</p>
        <p>''A Connecticut Survey'' is the title of the initial show, containing 35 paintings by state artists from 1850 to 1988, many of them from private collections and never before exhibited. Among the early artists represented are Willard Metcalf, John Twachtman, Edward Rook and Ellen Chadwich. Some of the contemporary works are by Reuben Nakian, Peter Poskas, Ilse Getz and Jean Woodman.</p>
        <p>Art Notes at Noon, a series of free talks about the exhibit, will be held on Wednesdays. Gallery hours are from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Friday. Admission is free.  HOLIDAY CRAFTS</p>
        <p>Fine craftsmanship and originality have been the hallmarks of the annual juried Christmas Crafts shows at the Creative Arts Center in New Haven for the last 20 years. One-of-a-kind works by Americanartisans of glass, furniture, clothing, ceramics, jewelry, household accessories, quilts and toys may be seen and purchased until Dec. 23 in the gallery at 80 Audubon Street.</p>
