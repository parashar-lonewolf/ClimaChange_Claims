        <p>MOSH EARLY AND OFTEN -- Eminem's ''Mosh,'' a video screed against President Bush that has been racing around the Internet, may not have prompted a groundswell of youth voting but it created enormous interest in his forthcoming record, ''Encore.'' The Detroit rapper moved up the record's release date four days, to this Friday, in part because the Bush video is not the only thing being downloaded. Much of the new album was on the Web last week, free for the grabbing.</p>

        <p>MOSH EARLY AND OFTEN -- Eminem's ''Mosh,'' a video screed against President Bush that has been racing around the Internet, may not have prompted a groundswell of youth voting but it created enormous interest in his forthcoming record, ''Encore.'' The Detroit rapper moved up the record's release date four days, to this Friday, in part because the Bush video is not the only thing being downloaded. Much of the new album was on the Web last week, free for the grabbing.</p>
        <p>In addition to his rapping-fire assault on the president -- ''Strap him with an AK-47, let him go fight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way'' -- Eminem takes on Michael Jackson, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff and the Olsen twins in ''Encore,'' his fourth record for Interscope, in a career that has produced 50 million in worldwide sales.</p>
        <p>GETTING HOT IN HERE -- A four-year study on global warming commissioned by eight countries with Arctic territory -- dubbed the Arctic Council -- will be out on Tuesday. According to portions of the study provided to The New York Times, it concludes that heat-trapping gases have contributed to significant shrinkage in glaciers, sea ice and permafrost, which have led in turn to changes in the atmosphere and weather.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration acknowledges that global warming may be a problem, but maintains studies of the underlying causes are inconclusive. Some Europeans involved in the study charged that its official release -- originally scheduled for September -- was delayed till after the presidential election, but the Icelandic chairman of the council said the charge was unfounded.</p>
        <p>THE BUCK STOPS -- Late last month, Fidel Castro announced that the United States dollar, a staple of the Cuban economy, would be officially worthless inside Cuba as of Monday. He said he was responding to President Bush's decision to limit the amount of money Cuban-Americans can send back to Cuba, while imposing heavy fines against banks that transfer dollars to Cuba. Cubans will be charged a 10 percent surcharge to exchange dollars for Cuban pesos, which have no value outside Cuba.</p>
        <p>THE FLU BUS -- On Monday, North Dakotans worried about the flu can board a bus in Grand Forks chartered by Paul Emmer, a Winnipeg entrepreneur, to travel to Winnipeg for flu shots. Lunch at the Olive Garden or Red Lobster is included in the $99 price.</p>
        <p>FEDERAL CASE -- Consumers, who are paying more for many good and services, may also be anteing up more for loans after Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the cost of short-term interest rates. The Fed is worried that a rising Consumer Price Index will boost inflation.</p>
        <p>The economy added 337,000 jobs in October, the biggest increase since March, the Labor Department reported. Orders for consumer goods rose in September for the third time in four months, as did sales of new homes. September orders for durable goods also rose-- led by military hardware and business equipment -- according to the Commerce Department.</p>
