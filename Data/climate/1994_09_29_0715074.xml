        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I fail to see why Bela Liptak finds the Environmental Protection Agency's dioxin draft reassessment good news (letter, Sept. 21). If he thinks it vindicates his position on recycling, then I have some bad news for him.</p>
        <p>Metal smelting and refining, particularly the recycling of iron, steel, aluminum and lead scrap, are prime suspects for dioxin. While "trash-to-energy" plants can almost eliminate dioxin emissions, it is well within the realm of possibility that metal recycling is the No. 1 dioxin source in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liptak confuses E.P.A.'s use of the term "known sources." In its reassessment, the agency counted as "known" United States sources only those few sources for which United States data exist. But early in its executive summary, the agency lists data from several European countries that have a more complete data base of dioxin sources.</p>
        <p>According to the 1990 data from West Germany -- the most complete list of dioxin sources -- metal smelting and refining account for roughly half the dioxin emissions for that country, and West Germany burns a larger percentage of trash than the United States does. E.P.A. freely admits that its data contain large gaps, and this is one of them.</p>
        <p>I am in favor of recycling, but we need to clean up metal recyclers and a wide range of other industries. There are some effective, relatively inexpensive technologies for dioxin control that can be applied to older facilities, which constitute the lion's share of the emissions. Some were developed for the "trash-to-energy" industry. How effective are they?</p>
        <p>Plants like the one proposed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard are roughly as clean as boilers that burn oil and natural gas, and emit fewer greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants for the same amount of electricity.</p>
        <p>The draft E.P.A. document hasn't been peer-reviewed. It carries the note "Do Not Quote or Cite" because it admittedly has many errors and omissions. The agency has begun a more comprehensive search for dioxin sources throughout United States industry. We in the environmental engineering community have begun a project to demonstrate effective control measures that can be adopted by older facilities.</p>
        <p>The findings of E.P.A.'s reassessment are not good news or an opportunity to point fingers. They are a call to action for all industries, particularly unregulated industries like recycling.
