        <p>On the Contrary column by Daniel Akst on positive effects of OPEC's reduction in oil production; says benefits include: reduced auto emissions that threaten planet with ruinous global warming, fewer Americans dying on road in accidents, and possibility that people might even start walking again, which would be good for their health; is distressed to hear oil ministers caved in and agreed to increase production; drawing (M) (M)</p>

        <p>AT first I thought it was just a silly infatuation -- you know, the thrill of forbidden love in an age when hardly any love is really forbidden. But I couldn't get it out of my head, and I grew tired of hiding it. Now I want the whole world to know that, for a brief shining moment, I was in love, madly in love, with OPEC.</p>
        <p>I know it seems crazy, a middle-aged American with a gaping gas tank hankering after a profit-hungry oil cartel. Keeping a long-distance relationship vital and fresh is no picnic, and heaven knows OPEC has never been much for sweet talk.</p>
        <p>In the end, of course, my friends were right. The whole thing ended in tears when my beloved oil ministers caved in at their meeting last week and agreed to increase production, leaving shards of my broken heart on the conference table.</p>
        <p>Oh, OPEC, how did I love thee? Let me count the ways.</p>
        <p>Your most endearing quality was your power. You're the only force on earth strong enough to make Americans ease up on a fossil-fuel habit so severe that it threatens the planet with ruinous global warming. (This, though, you dismiss so charmingly on your vain little Web site, www.opec.org.)</p>
        <p>If you had just kept the lid on, higher gas prices might finally have made some of us park our bloated sport utility vehicles and rethink our plans to live in 5,000-square-foot houses. At the very least, you might have inspired enough energy conservation to make a dent in the air pollution that kills 50,000 Americans a year. And by making us drive less, your tough love might have saved some of the 41,000 who die on the roads.</p>
        <p>That is to say nothing of what your tough love might have done for Americans' fitness. I don't mean that we would have worked out and slimmed down just to please you; we're much too lazy to do that for anyone. But if you had made gasoline expensive enough, some of us might at least have started walking more (remember walking?), even if only to McDonald's.</p>
        <p>I dreamed of a long-term commitment. I wanted to be able to trust you to reduce output permanently and thereby help stop all the terrible sprawl we're always complaining about. The whole pattern of land use in this country is based on cheap energy, and whatever we may say about it, we really have no plans to stop randomly replacing bucolic vistas with strip malls. You could have been our knight in shining armor, the one who saved us from the suburbs that ate civilization.</p>
        <p>Your pattern of secretiveness, always thrilling in an affair like ours, was another plus. Love means never having to tell the American people that, adjusted for inflation, gas is actually cheaper today than it was in 1960. Americans need something to get worked up about; faced with seven long months of Bush vs. Gore, pump prices make a wonderful diversion.</p>
        <p>Ah, but dearest OPEC, you have already betrayed my hopes, so I might as well confess. Before I fell for you, my heart used to go pitter-patter for a certain Federal Reserve chairman who seemed to have the whole economy in his hands.</p>
        <p>Sorry, Mr. Greenspan, but you're nothing next to these exotic oil men. All you can do is fiddle with short-term interest rates. By raising oil prices, my favorite cartel can fire a laser-guided smart bomb precisely at the most tax-worthy part of the economy this side of cigarettes. Because we lack the discipline to impose sharply higher taxes on gasoline, the most socially destructive fossil fuel, we were lucky to have OPEC to do the job for us.</p>
        <p>Of course, the cartel kept the money -- it was entitled to something for playing the bad guy, no? But at least we got the economic benefits, which ought to have included the slower economy that you, Mr. Greenspan, have been pining for. If only OPEC had stayed the course. (Sigh.)</p>
        <p>Now it looks like prices will flatten out and that the gas tax will stay as it is. But I haven't given up all hope. Sometimes, when I remember the land yachts of my youth arrayed in block-long gas lines, I think wistfully of what might have been. I dream again that my wild and crazy energy hegemonists will take up the lance anew, twisting down the wellhead valves and rescuing us from our own worst enemies -- ourselves.</p>
