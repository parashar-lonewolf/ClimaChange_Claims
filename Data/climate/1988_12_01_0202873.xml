        <p>LEAD: A study of people who work on the waters of Chesapeake Bay has provided the most definitive evidence yet that prolonged exposure to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight increases the risk of cataracts.</p>
        <p>A study of people who work on the waters of Chesapeake Bay has provided the most definitive evidence yet that prolonged exposure to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight increases the risk of cataracts.</p>
        <p>Extensive exposure to sunlight can triple the risk of a major form of cataracts, the study showed.</p>
        <p>Based on animal studies, scientists previously expected that ultraviolet radiation would cause cataracts, but this is the first confirmation in humans. The finding reinforces recommendations that people who are in the sun frequently wear hats and glasses or sunglasses that filter ultraviolet rays.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that the greatest risk from ultraviolet radiation is skin cancer, but cataracts are emerging as a significant new risk.</p>
        <p>The damaging radiation was ultraviolet B, the kind that causes sunburns and blistering and that is associated with skin cancer. Ultraviolet A, which causes tanning, was not associated with cataracts, the researchers found.</p>
        <p>The study, by Dr. Hugh R. Taylor of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and his colleagues, is published in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. A Problem of Age</p>
        <p>''I think the study is very, very important,'' said Dr. Jack M. Dodick, chairman of the department of ophthalmology at the Manhattan Eye, Ear, and Throat Hosptial. ''We must warn our patients to wear glasses that screen out ultraviolet rays.''</p>
        <p>A cataract is a clouding of the lens. More than a million Americans, mostly older people, have cataract surgery each year.</p>
        <p>''If you live long enough, everyone develops some form of cataract,'' Dr. Dodick said, adding that not all of these cataracts interfere with vision enough to require removal.</p>
        <p>Cataracts are classifeid according to where they occur. The cataract linked to ultraviolet exposure is the cortical cataract and forms in the outer layer of the lens. People with the greatest exposure to ultraviolet radiation were more than three times as likely to have this type of cataract than those with the lowest exposure.</p>
        <p>''If you think of the lens as a peach, nuclear cataracts involve the stone of the peach, cortical cataracts involve the flesh, and posterior subcapsular cataracts involve the skin,'' Dr. Taylor said. Ozone Depletion Cited</p>
        <p>Cataract surgery is about equally divided among the three types of cataracts, Dr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Taylor said the decline in the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere means that people are being exposed to more ultraviolet B radiation.</p>
        <p>''Our data suggest that for every 10 percent increase in ultraviolet B radiation, there will be a 6 percent increase in cortical cataracts,'' he said. But scientists have not found an increase in ultraviolet B radiation despite the ozone depletion.</p>
        <p>People with dark irises are just as suceptible to the effects of ultraviolet radiation as people with light irises, experts said.</p>
        <p>''Eye color does not matter,'' Dr. Dodick said. ''The iris does not shield the lens from ultraviolet rays. Ultraviolet rays pass through the pupil and into the lens.'' On Whys and Wherefores</p>
        <p>The reason that ultraviolet B radiation causes cataracts is not certain.</p>
        <p>''We looked at the wherefore, not the why,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''But there is some evidence that ultraviolet B oxidizes proteins in the lens,'' he said, adding that that chemically alters the proteins so that they stick together, making the clear lens cloudy.</p>
        <p>Experts disagree on how people should protect themselves against ultraviolet radiation damage. Dr. Taylor said that everyone, even children, who are outside ''when there is enough sun to cause a sunburn'' should at least wear a hat, which cuts down ultraviolet radiation exposure to the eyes by 50 percent.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, ''Even cheap plastic sunglasses absorb 85 to 90 percent of ultraviolet B radiation. I am not suggesting you go out and buy special glasses. If you put a hat on top of that, you reduce your exposure by more than 90 percent.'' Specify a Type</p>
        <p>Dr. Dodick and Dr. Lerman, however, suggest that people specifically ask for sunglasses that are coated so that they completely block ultraviolet B radiation. These glasses are available from optometrists, ''but you have to ask for them specifically,'' Dr. Lerman said.  ''People think that if they wear dark glasses, they will be protected from ultraviolet radiation,'' Dr. Lerman said. ''That's not true.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Taylor also said that his study does not establish whether people who are middle-aged or older would benefit from starting now to protect their eyes. But he said he would advise them to do so because they may be able to slow cataract formation, which typically takes many years.</p>
        <p>One result of the study is that the Chesapeake watermen, who have already been told of the results, have begun protecting their eyes, Dr. Taylor said. Before the study began, most did not wear sunglasses. Changing Their Habits</p>
        <p>''Most of the watermen wore hats at least some of the time,'' Dr. Taylor said. ''But by and large they did not like wearing glasses.'' But, he added, ''now that they've heard of our study results, many of them have started wearing glasses.''</p>
        <p>The Johns Hopkins researchers are looking for evidence that exposure to sunlight causes other eye damage.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stuart Fine of Johns Hopkins said in an interview earlier this year that the group found no association between exposure to ultraviolet radiation and macular degeneration. Some experts had speculated that sunlight can lead to this common disorder in the elderly. In this disorder, the macula, the central part of the retina that is responsible for clear vision, degenerates.</p>
        <p>The group expects to publish this result later this year, Dr. Taylor said.  WHEN SUNLIGHT CLOUDS THE EYE  A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye. Doctors theorize that certain types of light and radiation contribute by causing the lens protein to oxidize and change character. They have now found a strong association between sunlight's ultraviolet B radiation and cataracts of the cortex of the lens, but no association with cataracts of the nucleus.</p>
