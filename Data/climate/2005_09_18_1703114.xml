        <p>New Jersey's available transportation money is barely flowing now, a whorl closing in on a drain. If the disappearing Transportation Trust Fund is not pumped up before next summer, it will have next to nothing to buy New Jersey Transit cars or repave the state's highways, half of which are rated ''unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>The acting governor, the gubernatorial candidates and legislative leaders -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- have considered all this carefully and come up with a single response: Let's talk about it later.</p>
        <p>''Later'' has been the word since the gasoline tax, the main source of revenue for the fund, was last raised. It was 1988; Thomas H. Kean Sr. was the governor and a three-bedroom house in downtown Princeton cost $150,000.</p>
        <p>Earlier this summer, political leaders acknowledged that the tax should probably undergo a cost-of-living adjustment. This would take place, they said, after Election Day.</p>
        <p>But last week, as gas prices held firmly above $3 a gallon, it became clear that the lame-duck session -- starting as soon as the new Assembly and governor are safely elected -- will be lamer than expected. And the expectation of a tax increase in November or December unraveled amid promises to discuss it at some, uh, later date -- perhaps after the next governor is elected to a second term.</p>
        <p>Legislators who might reasonably be scared of global warming, crumbling infrastructure or commuter paralysis are apparently more afraid of rising gas prices. It is possible that drivers, many of whom buy $40,000 S.U.V.'s and $500,000 houses, would not be apoplectic by a dollar or two in higher taxes for a tank of gas. But as long as they complain about the cost of feeding their cars, candidates listen.</p>
        <p>When asked about a tax increase, even Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, who is not running for anything, said, ''How do you do it when that's the number one complaint of the people in New Jersey today and in our country is the high price of gasoline?''</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Codey is also the Senate president, he can singlehandedly fend off an increase by refusing to post it for a vote. So can the speaker of the General Assembly, Albio Sires, who since the recent spike in gasoline prices has spoken of the lame-duck plan in the past tense.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Sires, Joseph Donnelly, said last week that ''there's sufficient revenue to pay for a healthy capital program through June of next year, so we have nine months to explore all the options.''</p>
        <p>Some of the troops think that is an awfully casual approach. ''Is it going to take some horrible catastrophe to wake people up?'' asked John S. Wisniewski, the chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee.</p>
        <p>At the least, Mr. Wisniewski said, decrepit transportation systems will turn away commerce and port traffic. ''At some point,'' he said, ''people are going to say it's easier to get stuff into Baltimore or Halifax.''</p>
        <p>The gubernatorial candidates are planning for the future. The Republican, Douglas R. Forrester, has sworn off any increase in the gasoline tax and hounded his opponent, Senator Jon S. Corzine, for hesitating to do the same. Mr. Corzine has not hesitated, though, to say the state should consider everything else first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine favors tax-free ways of refilling the trust fund -- and who wouldn't? -- like selling or leasing the state's toll roads. That proposal is currently Mr. Codey's favorite, too, and everyone wants to study it -- in order to decide what to discuss later.</p>
        <p>The Transportation Trust Fund can start recovering without an increase in the gas tax, though that would require transferring money from the state's general fund and reserving all the trust fund money that is now used for operating expenses -- about $300 million a year -- for capital projects instead. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services calculates that $220 million from the current motor fuels taxes that could go into the fund is now being spent elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wisniewski, a Democrat, and some Republicans, like Assemblyman Peter J. Biondi and Senator Andrew R. Ciesla, are agitating for a legislative fix during the current session -- though none of them advocates a tax increase, until, possibly, later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wisniewski says that selling the Turnpike or the Garden State Parkway is one of the sillier ideas in circulation. Noting that optimistic estimates place the price of a sale or long-term lease of the toll roads at $30 billion, he said, ''Those companies that would come up with $30 billion are not doing it because they're public spirited and feel sorry for us.''</p>
        <p>They would be more like the private operators of the Chicago Skyway, he said, who leased the roadway this year, with a plan to raise tolls 150 percent.</p>
        <p>Many legislators do worry about the borrow-and-spend tradition that shored up the state's pension funds and its school construction program, only to run short while the debt-service costs pile up.</p>
        <p>Leonard Lance, the Senate minority leader, is constantly fretting about the supposition that our descendants will work it out. Senator Lance wanted to include a fix for the Transportation Trust Fund in this year's budget; raising taxes in a lame-duck session, he said, would be wrong.</p>
        <p>Let's talk about it later.</p>
