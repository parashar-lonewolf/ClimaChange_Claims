        <p>A coalition of utilities that is dangling a $30 million carrot before refrigerator makers has selected Whirlpool and Frigidaire as finalists to build an ozone-friendly, super-efficient model.</p>
        <p>The announcement is scheduled to be made today by the Super Efficient Refrigerator Program, which comprises 25 public and private utilities. The ground rules laid out in July call for a refrigerator that has no chlorofluorocarbons, which deplete the ozone layer, and that uses 25 percent less electricity than the Federal standard. The utilities are seeking to save the cost of building new generating stations by lowering demand for power. Refrigerators and freezers consume about 20 percent of the electricity used in American homes.</p>

        <p>A coalition of utilities that is dangling a $30 million carrot before refrigerator makers has selected Whirlpool and Frigidaire as finalists to build an ozone-friendly, super-efficient model.</p>
        <p>The announcement is scheduled to be made today by the Super Efficient Refrigerator Program, which comprises 25 public and private utilities. The ground rules laid out in July call for a refrigerator that has no chlorofluorocarbons, which deplete the ozone layer, and that uses 25 percent less electricity than the Federal standard. The utilities are seeking to save the cost of building new generating stations by lowering demand for power. Refrigerators and freezers consume about 20 percent of the electricity used in American homes.</p>
        <p>The finalists will submit working prototypes by May and will have an opportunity to make a final bid, describing how many of the super-efficient models they will build in exchange for the award. The utilities will make their decision in June or July, and the refrigerators could be in stores by early 1994. They will be sold in the service territories of the member utilities.</p>
        <p>The $30 million pot of gold under the refrigerator led 450 organizations worldwide to ask for a copy of the request for proposals, according to Gary B. Fernstrom, the chief financial officer of the consortium and an energy efficiency supervisor at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which contributed $7 million.</p>
        <p>The utilities expect the winning bid to be for about 300,000 refrigerators, meaning a subsidy of roughly $100 for each refrigerator produced. Mr. Fernstrom said that as Whirlpool and Frigidaire build their prototypes, "We're confident that they will gain confidence in their proposal and may be able to make a better offer."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernstrom said that with the subsidy, the price of the new refrigerators would be kept at or below the cost of current models.</p>
