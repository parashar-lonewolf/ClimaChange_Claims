        <p>SCIENTISTS have been studying lightning ever since Benjamin Franklin demonstrated its electrical nature some two centuries ago, and have generally felt that its nuances were understood. The bolts were white hot, hitting temperatures of 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit and strengths of several hundred million volts. Though dazzling to the eye, lightning as a scientific topic had become rather passe.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that science missed the most bizarre and interesting bolts of all, which materialize above thunderheads and shoot upward, not downward, flickering across great distances. Such wonders were hidden from view until recently, when ground observers, aircraft and spacecraft managed to glimpse their ephemeral dance.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of flashes, some pink or blood red, others dark blue, have now been photographed above electrical storms, the red ones soaring as high as 60 miles above the earth, their wispy tendrils playing along the fringes of outer space, their lower parts turning bluish or purple before disappearing.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, this intriguing new class of lightning is visible to the naked eye if you know where to look.</p>
        <p>The flashes appear to produce strange emanations that are just starting to be measured and are far from being understood. Orbiting satellites have detected gamma-ray bursts of extraordinary intensity coming from thunderheads, and the red flashes have been linked to powerful bursts of radio waves.</p>
        <p>Scientists are now racing around the globe to study the phenomenon and its implications. The high-altitude flashes, they say, might affect the ozone layer in unknown ways and present unforeseen dangers to spy planes arcing unusually high through the sky or space shuttles streaking toward earth for a landing.</p>
        <p>Most important, the flashes promise to reveal fundamental truths about the workings of the earth's global electrical circuit and a region of the high atmosphere once thought of as generally uninteresting.</p>
        <p>"What's neat is that we didn't expect it," said Dr. Gerald J. Fishman, an astrophysicist at the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., who helped track down the gamma flashes. "It's probably been there since the earth began. But our eyes have just been opened."</p>
        <p>Next month a NASA jet loaded with cameras and instruments is to fly across the thunderstorm belt of South America, chasing the high flashes with cameras and trying to analyze their light with a spectrometer, a key step in determining their makeup and atmospheric effects.</p>
        <p>"They're not hard to see if you know what to look for and where to look," said Dr. Eugene M. Wescott, a geophysicist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks who has photographed the flashes and is going on next month's trip. The phenomenon, he said, is "a whole new thing that nobody knew about and may have a lot of implications," adding, "That's exciting."</p>
        <p>Dr. Steven J. Goodman, an atmospheric physicist at the Marshall Space Flight Center, agreed: "It's a new discovery. What's raised the level of excitement is it's much more frequent than anyone suspected and appears to be distributed around the globe."</p>
        <p>One sign of the scientific interest is that about 40 papers and abstracts on the topic were presented at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, the world's largest professional group devoted to earth studies. The authors were from Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Russian Academy of Sciences, among other institutions.</p>
        <p>"It's one of those cases where you thought you knew everything," said Dr. Richard J. Howard, program manager for flash studies at NASA headquarters in Washington. "Then something pops up that you never expected. The theoreticians are going wild."</p>
        <p>It turns out that the mysterious bolts were periodically seen by airline pilots over the decades but never made scientific waves because it was exclusively visual evidence, which is often belittled as fleeting and unreliable.</p>
        <p>For instance, John G. Hammerstrom was flying an American Airlines jet more than six miles up, circumnavigating a dense cloud. Suddenly, lightning within the cloud was followed by a vertical flash of blue light that shot upward from the cloud's top to a height of perhaps 20 miles. At its apex, the blue shaft fanned out before fading from view.</p>
        <p>On that one occasion, Mr. Hammerstrom saw five of the blue flashes. He later wrote the magazine Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, saying it was "the most spectacular and unexpected natural event" he had ever witnessed.</p>
        <p>The baffling flashes were first photographed by accident. In 1989, Dr. John R. Winckler, a retired physicist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was helping a colleague try out a new low-light video camera on a clear summer night. A lightning storm flickered on the dark horizon. Abruptly, the screen of the black-and-white video monitor came alive with the image of a strange double plume flashing upward from the thunderheads.</p>
        <p>"It didn't look like anything I'd ever seen," Dr. Winckler recalled in an interview.</p>
        <p>His paper in the journal Science in 1990 estimated the length of the twin flashes at about 12 miles, which, he noted, was "much greater than that of cloud-to-ground lightning." Whether the upward bolt was a fluke or represented a new class of lightning was unclear, as was its coloration.</p>
        <p>Soon, scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center began hunting through videotapes of lightning storms taken by space shuttles orbiting the earth. They discovered an image taken in April 1990 that showed an intense thunderstorm over northwest Africa, topped by a pronounced vertical flash about 20 miles high. And they quickly found similar images.</p>
        <p>Though suggesting a global phenomenon, these pictures of the upward lightning were tiny and hard to analyze because the space shuttle was usually 1,000 or more miles away.</p>
        <p>Such reports fired up scientists at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, who were old hands at observing the night sky because of their years of auroral studies. Financed by NASA, Dr. David D. Sentman and Dr. Wescott in July 1993 flew a specially equipped jet across the Midwest, closely tracking the intense thunderstorms that produced so much flooding and woe on the ground that exceptionally wet summer.</p>
        <p>"We were looking for things that looked like lightning," Dr. Wescott recalled. "Then we saw the flash and said, 'By God, that's something.' " In all, the scientists were able to capture good images of 19 of the mysterious flashes on black-and-white video.</p>
        <p>The big breakthrough came last summer when the Alaskan team tracked Midwestern thunderstorms with a pair of jets equipped with color cameras, flying when no moon illuminated the night sky. The team recorded strange bolts above every one of 20 observed thunderstorms, and gathered images of more than 500 flashes in all. The work revealed two main varieties of the phenomenon.</p>
        <p>The most common were dubbed sprites because of their elusiveness compared with regular lightning. Pink or blood red and many miles wide, these globular flashes rose to a height of up to 60 miles, stretching through the stratosphere and mesosphere to the ionosphere, the tenuous part of the atmosphere that marks the boundary where the earth's environment ends and space begins. Some sprites had red, blue or purple tendrils hanging downward into the stratosphere, while others had a reddish fuzziness like hair that stretched into the ionosphere.</p>
        <p>The flashes were brightest at their heads, while their lower extremities faded progressively and disappeared about 25 to 15 miles above the earth. The longest ones vanished just above the thunderheads, which at their highest drift 10 miles or so above the earth.</p>
        <p>Curiously, the red sprites often came in groups of two or more, the brightest ones accompanied by increasingly faint echoes.</p>
        <p>The other type of flash was dubbed a blue jet, which, as its name implied, moved quite rapidly. The bursts were cone shaped and narrow at their bases atop giant storm clouds, widening as they flashed upward to heights of perhaps 20 miles.</p>
        <p>In contrast to sprites, which appeared all at once, the blue jets clearly moved upward, often making shock waves. Their speed was clocked at up to 60 miles a second, far faster than the speed of sound but short of that of light or radio waves.</p>
        <p>Though long, both types of flashes turned out to be rarer, faster and fainter than regular lightning, which helps explain how they eluded observation for so long. Regular lightning can flash for a second or more. But red sprites last for thousandths of a second. Moreover, both types appear to be associated only with the most intense thunderstorms.</p>
        <p>Coincident with the airplane work, Dr. Walter A. Lyons, a senior scientist at Mission Research Corporation, in Fort Collins, Colo., made ground-based observations of Midwestern storms from a rise in the Colorado plains east of the Rockies.  During the summers of 1993 and 1994, he used telescopic lenses from his post at an elevation of 5,500 feet to capture black-and-white images of more than 1,000 sprites and other unusual discharges.</p>
        <p>Working with scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studying readings from a national system of lightning ground-strike detectors, Dr. Lyons discovered that red sprites are highly correlated with positively charged ground strikes, which make up only about 10 percent of regular lightning but are many times more powerful than their negatively charged cousins.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the team found that the sprites triggered big low-frequency radio bursts that had been monitored for years globally but whose origin had been a mystery. With a radio receiver in Rhode Island, the M.I.T. researchers talked to Dr. Lyons in Colorado by telephone as he monitored the Midwestern sprites, finding a high correlation between the strange flashes and the big radio bursts.</p>
        <p>"It shows that the ultralarge discharge also causes an electromagnetic transient around the earth," said Dr. Earl R. Williams, an atmospheric physicist at M.I.T. who is part of the team. "It's like a ringing of the earth's entire ionospheric cavity."</p>
        <p>Another part of the puzzle was discovered by NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, in orbit since April 1991. Right from the start, the spacecraft picked up bursts that unexpectedly came right from the earth. "They're unlike anything we've ever seen from the sky," said Dr. Fishman of NASA's Marshall center. "They're extremely high energy, but very short."</p>
        <p>Years of detective work finally allowed the Marshall scientists to link the bursts to thunderheads, and their paper appeared in Science last May. "The most likely origin," the paper said, "is a rare type of high-altitude discharge above thunderstorm regions."</p>
        <p>As sightings of sprites, jets and other riddles have multiplied into a torrent, physicists have vied to explain them, with new theories being advanced all the time. No consensus has emerged.</p>
        <p>However, Dr. Williams of M.I.T. and other scientists have noted that Dr. Charles T. R. Wilson, a British Nobel laureate who invented the cloud chamber for tracking subatomic particles, predicted, in his last paper, published in 1956, that ground strikes might produce a powerful electric field high above a cloud.</p>
        <p>Future research will attempt to get readings of electric fields above thunderheads and spectroscopic analyses of light from the elusive phenomena, which will show how the flashes affect atmospheric chemistry.</p>
        <p>"We need more measurements so we can accept or reject these competing theories," said Dr. Goodman of the Marshall center.</p>
        <p>Such data, he added, should also clarify whether the flashes pose any danger to people or if they might play an unsuspected role in global atmospheric changes that may have been mistakenly linked to pollutants.</p>
        <p>Dr. Howard of NASA headquarters said a scientific assault on the mysteries was taking shape that over the next two years might include observers, balloons, radars, satellites, planes and a wide assortment of cameras and instruments.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people are interested in trying to understand these things," he said. "Right now, there's lots we don't know."</p>
