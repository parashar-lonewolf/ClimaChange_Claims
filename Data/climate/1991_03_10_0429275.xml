        <p>Here aboard the drilling platform Glomar Highland IV, a vibrating cacophony of shouting men and squealing steel, the Mobil Oil Corporation is tapping into one of the largest strikes of natural gas ever made in North America.</p>
        <p>But the size of the gas reserve buried deep beneath the floor of Mobile Bay is only part of the story. Prodded by stringent state law, public sentiment and aggressive enforcement, Mobil and two competitors, Shell and Exxon, have taken extraordinary steps to protect a marine estuary renowned for its rich catches of shrimp, oysters and fish.</p>
        <p>Instead of discharging chemicals and sewage into the water, a practice followed on nearly all the 3,600 offshore drilling platforms in the United States, the companies are collecting thousands of barrels of drilling mud, lubricant, human waste, even rainwater that drips off equipment, and are putting them into barges for treatment and disposal on land. Mobil says it is spending up to $150,000 a week on waste disposal alone.</p>
        <p>As the Bush Administration prepares to open vast undersea tracts off the East Coast, Florida, Southern California and Alaska to exploration for oil and natural gas, such costly measures are becoming the focus of intense debate. The offshore oil industry, though proud of its environmental record here, says requirements like Alabama's are unnecessary and could even prove hazardous. Environmental groups and state officials reply that Alabama has established a model of ecological safety that should be the nationwide standard for drilling operations close to shore.  Many Rules, More Rewards</p>
        <p>In February, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed tightening regulations for discharges from offshore platforms in Federal waters, which begin three miles from shore in most states. The regulations, though not as strict as Alabama's, would require more thorough treatment than currently practiced before wastes could be discharged.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists here and in other states say the experience in Mobile Bay shows how far the oil industry is prepared to go to gain economic rewards from offshore drilling. Mobil's natural gas reserves beneath Mobile Bay are estimated to be worth at least $650 million at current prices.</p>
        <p>Neither Mobil nor the two other oil companies agreed willingly to abide by Alabama's rules. Almost a decade ago, after Mobil was discovered pouring untreated sludge and toxic drilling mud into the bay, the company paid a $2 million penalty to the state and agreed to pay at least $500,000 to dredge up yards of chemical-soaked bay bottom.</p>
        <p>And it agreed to Alabama's zero-discharge rules, which environmentalists say are working well. "It's a pretty clean operation. It really is," said Dr. George F. Crozier, a marine biologist and executive director of the Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory who has been one of the oil industry's sharpest critics in Alabama. "The bay is relatively healthy, and their plans for drilling 12 more wells over the next three years are not likely to have any profound environmental effects." Safeguarding Shrimp</p>
        <p>Aboard the Glomar Highland, an 11-year-old drilling platform, Mobil employees from supervisors to the roughnecks who man the equipment are eager to describe the steps they have taken not to harm "a single little shrimp," as one roughneck put it.</p>
        <p>Each week thousands of gallons of drilling solution, pulverized rock, motor oil, and lubricant are pumped into one of two barges tied to the platform. Rainwater and sewage go into the second barge. Employees caught throwing garbage into the bay have been dismissed, and workers say men even spitting into the bay have been reprimanded.</p>
        <p>Elray Foret, Mobil's 49-year-old drilling superintendent, says it costs the company $58,000 to dispose of each barge of chemical wastes, and $28,000 to treat and dispose of a load on a sewage barge. "It's a lot of money, but we're doing it," said Mr. Foret. "Over in Florida, I can't understand why they don't want us. You can see, this ain't going to hurt the environment. There's nothing here that can hurt the environment."</p>
        <p>The company's engineers say similar controls on discharges from platforms in the ocean are unnecessary and warn that in a heavy storm, waste barges could smash into the steel legs of a deep water platform and threaten the lives of the crew.  The Focus on Natural Gas</p>
        <p>Federal law already requires sewage to be treated on drilling rigs before it is released into the water, and the proposed regulations would tighten those standards. Lubricants and hazardous chemicals are collected in barrels and transported to shore for disposal. Specialists for Mobil say the ocean dilutes other wastes, like drilling mud and pulverized rock, rendering them harmless.</p>
        <p>"Around our deep-water offshore platforms, the fish are doing just fine," said H. Lew Herrin, an environmental engineering adviser for Mobil. "You know, we're required to treat our wastes. But stand out there and watch 150 dolphins swim by. The Government doesn't require treatment of their wastes."</p>
        <p>In other respects, the activities in and around Mobile Bay signal the direction the American offshore industry is likely to take in the 21st century. The prize here is natural gas, a cleaner alternative to oil that can also be processed into liquid methanol and burned as a substitute for gasoline.</p>
        <p>The United States gets 25 percent of its natural gas from offshore wells, and the White House energy plan envisions that at least 60 percent of the fossil fuels recovered offshore in the 21st century will be gas, not oil.  The Gleam of Oil</p>
        <p>Although drilling for gas can be dangerous because of the chance of an explosion, it does not present the same risks to the environment. Gas evaporates into the atmosphere and cannot wash up on shore. Mobil transports gas to shore here through a pipeline buried beneath the bay bottom and beneath the marshes near its new processing plant.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups are not quieted by such assurances. They argue that the Administration and the oil industry also have every intention of tapping the 18 billion barrels of oil believed to lie offshore. At the nation's current rate of demand, 17 million barrels a day, that is about three years' supply -- not worth the risk of a catastrophic oil spill, the environmental groups say.</p>
        <p>"The oil industry would like us to believe they have the technology to acquire these supplies safely," said Robert Sulnick, executive director of the American Oceans Campaign, an environmental group in Santa Monica, Calif. "But this is not a debate about hardware. It's a debate about the future security of the nation."</p>
        <p>Among the most influential supporters of this school of thought are the Governors of Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey and California, who oppose the Administration's offshore drilling plan because of concern about the safety of their states' coasts.</p>
        <p>In the oil industry, there is a strong sense of frustration with the views of coastal governors and residents. Since 1969, when a Chevron well blew out in Santa Barbara, Calif., smothering beaches and birds in 3.25 million gallons of crude oil, the offshore industry has developed new kinds of blowout prevention devices and advanced equipment to monitor oil and gas wells, technology that has largely prevented oil spills from offshore platforms.  Despite Better Safety, Suspicion</p>
        <p>According to a report by the Department of the Interior, the cause of most oil spills is oil tanker accidents, like the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989. Not since 1969 has the offshore industry been responsible for an oil spill that exceeded 800,000 gallons, less than one-tenth the size of the Alaska spill, and the industry says most of the oil was dissipated at sea.</p>
        <p>"I tell you, let me be President and I'd fix the whole thing," said Mr. Foret. "If we didn't give another drop of oil to Florida, or North Carolina, or California, they'd all be begging to let us come to drill. Take no time at all."</p>
        <p>Opposition to the drilling boom that began in 1979 has never been overwhelming along Alabama's coast, but there was a lingering suspicion among residents about the oil industry's willingness to comply with state environmental laws. Fishermen and shoreline homeowners kept a close eye on Mobil's drilling rig, and in 1981, after a fishing crew pulled up a catch of flounder coated in oil, Mobil and the state began an investigation.</p>
        <p>"What these guys were doing was putting the discharge hoses between the barges, and all that lubricating oil and drilling mud was dropping straight into the bay," said Dr. Crozier, who assisted investigators. "I took a state inspector out there one day and we put a probe down and came up with muck drenched in oil.</p>
        <p>"There's always been a resistance to big money in this part of the world, sort of a bit of native spite," he went on. "Once Mobil was caught polluting, the die was cast, and people here simply said the oil industry will not be allowed to proceed without strict controls."</p>
