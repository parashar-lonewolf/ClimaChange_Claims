        <p>The earth was warmer in 1990 than in any other year since people began measuring the planet's surface temperature, separate groups of climatologists in the United States and Britain said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A third group, in the United States, reported record temperatures from one to six miles above the earth's surface. These were recorded from balloons from December 1989 through November 1990.</p>
        <p>Some scientists said the new reports, taken together with the series of very warm years in the 1980's, strengthened the possibility that a feared global warming caused by an increase of heat-trapping atmospheric gases, had already begun.</p>
        <p>These gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons and methane, are increasing, mostly as a result of human activity. This type of greeenhouse warming could cause sharp changes in climate, agriculture and even sea levels.</p>
        <p>Other scientists noted the difficulty of detecting the tiny initial signal of greenhouse warming amid the much greater temperature swings caused by nature.</p>
        <p>"I would agree that it is of concern that we've had these hot periods," said Tim Barnett, a climatologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif. "But at this point you can't attribute it to any single cause. Is it the greenhouse gases, or is it natural variability?" He said it was impossible to draw any conclusion based on the average global temperatures alone.</p>
        <p>The seven warmest years since 1880 all occurred in the last 11 years, according to climatologists at the space agency's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. And six of the seven warmest years since 1850 have all occurred since 1980, according to a somewhat different set of surface measurements by scientists at the University of East Anglia in England and at the British Meteorological Office. The Goddard team analyzed temperatures recorded on land and on oceanic islands; the British team also included temperatures taken by ships at sea.</p>
        <p>"The case for a cause-and-effect relationship" between the recent warming and a human-induced greenhouse effect "is becoming harder to deny," said James E. Hansen of the Goddard Institute. Dr. Hansen made a well-publicized statement in 1988 that the greenhouse effect was probably the cause of the observed rise in global temperatures. A Skeptic Begins to Waver</p>
        <p>His group reported yesterday that 1990, with an average global temperature of 59.8 degrees, was the warmest year globally since the records used by the group began in 1880.</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't disagree with that," James K. Angell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md., said of Dr. Hansen's comment. Dr. Angell reported the balloon measurements. "I've been a skeptic, but as these warmish years come one upon the other, you begin to waver a little bit."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he said, "we still may have to wait a decade longer to make sure."</p>
        <p>The British groups, headed by Phil Jones at East Anglia and David Parker of the meteorological office, reported 1990 to be the warmest year since comparable records were first kept in 1850.</p>
        <p>"Although it is still too early to confirm whether the recent exceptional warmth is related to the greenhouse effect," the British scientists said in a statement, "international scientific opinion strongly supports the reality of this enhanced greenhouse effect, and it is likely that it has played some role in contributing to the recent warmth." Satellites Measure Warmth</p>
        <p>A fourth analysis, of data from satellite measurements of the entire lower atmosphere through the first 11 months of 1990, showed the year could turn out to be the fourth warmest since the satellite measurements began in 1979. The analysis was made by John R. Christy of the University of Alabama and Roy Spencer of the space agency's Marshall Space Flight Center, both in Huntsville.</p>
        <p>The Goddard group found that the record average surface temperature for the globe was eight-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit above the 1951-1980 average of 59 degrees. The British group found it seventh-tenths of a degree higher than the 1951-80 average.</p>
        <p>The warming was particularly pronounced over the eastern United States, where record temperatures were also set in 1990, and across the entire Eurasian land mass, the Goddard team discovered. The only region with temperatures substantially below normal was Greenland and the neighboring Canadian archipelago. The British group found the warmth of 1990 "particularly evident" over Europe, western Siberia, the Far East and most of the United States and southern Canada.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government reported last week that 1990 was the seventh warmest year in the United States since record-keeping began in 1895. In New York City, it was the warmest year recorded since the Government began measuring the temperature in Central Park in 1869.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hansen's group calculated that the 1980's were about one degree warmer, globally, than the 1880's, and that 1990 was about 1.25 degrees warmer. By way of comparison, the world's average temperature is about 9 degrees warmer now than it was in the last ice age. Dr. Hansen said that the figures were corrected to take account of the "urban heat island effect," in which the growth of cities have caused land masses to warm by about about two-tenths of a degree.</p>
        <p>The Goddard analysis also found that the rate of global warming for the past quarter-century was greater than at any other time since 1880. Scientists believe that natural climatic variation may have produced higher global temperatures at other junctures since the last ice age, but they have no reliable way of making comparisons between then and now.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hansen said that if the global climate rises only about another two-tenths of a degree and remains there, the odds of warmer than normal winters and summers will increase substantially, and that this will be readily noticeable. "Seasonal temperature is still a crapshoot," he said, "but the global warming is loading the dice."</p>
        <p>He calculates that with the two-tenths of a degree further warming, the chances for a warmer than normal season will increase from 1 in 3 to 2 in 3 and that the chances for a normal or colder than normal season decrease from 2 in 6 to 1 in 6.</p>
        <p>"We're already close to there," he said.</p>
        <p>While many scientists say it is not possible to conclude that the warming is being caused by increased greenhouse gases emitted as a result of human activity, Dr. Hansen said that the temperature increase "is roughly on the track" of what is predicted by computer models of the climate that try to predict the course of a greenhouse warming.</p>
        <p>An international group of scientists convened under United Nations auspices found last year that if greenhouse gases continued to be emitted at the current rate, the earth's temperature would increase by about 2 degrees by the year 2025 and by more than 5 degrees by the end of the next century.</p>
        <p>Given that range, scientists cannot say whether the warming would be mild or catastrophic, or which regions of the earth might be most affected.</p>
        <p>A group of 16 Senators led by Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, yesterday signed a letter to President Bush citing the findings and saying that the data "illustrates clearly that global climate change is real, that global warming is not a problem that will disappear if we ignore it and that there is an increasingly urgent need for policies that address these issues."</p>
