        <p>ARE the great open vistas of the West becoming hazier, or clearer? When a haze descends, is it more likely to come from nearby vehicle traffic or from faraway factories and power plants? And what should be done to protect a resource as plentiful and as easy to waste as a skyful of emptiness?</p>
        <p>For the past few years, the obscurely named Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission has been examining questions like these, and this summer the commission provided its answers.</p>
        <p>Set up by Congress in 1990, the commission called for a far-reaching regional strategy to protect what are ordinarily the crystal-clear air and spectacular horizons of the Colorado Plateau.</p>
        <p>Among the key recommendatons are aggressive steps to reduce the threat of air pollution wafting in on the wind, by encouraging energy conservation, solar and wind energy, electric and low-emission vehicles, and other new technologies.</p>
        <p>Since Republicans gained control of Congress, Federal financing for these types of technologies has been a prime target of budget reductions. The report of the commission suggests that, quite aside from concerns about global climate change or unhealthy air, tourists' values could become another way of pushing the clean-energy agenda.</p>
        <p>Most people who visit the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion and the area's other national parks and wilderness areas are able to look at the vivid panoramas without concern about air quality, since the region usually can boast some of the clearest air in the nation.</p>
        <p>But for some visitors the horizon is closer than for others, because of air pollution: on days when the air turns somewhat hazy, the deterioration is readily apparent, just as a teaspoon of milk will turn the color of a cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>''For years, I have watched in dismay as the awesome vistas of my childhood faded to a smoky haze,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, 58, who called the commission's recommendations ''courageous.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, until the passage of the Clean Air Act in the 1970's, the air quality in the region was steadily worsening. Since then, it has gotten better, but on the worst days visibility is still noticeably impaired, and the commission's research suggests that in the decades ahead it could worsen as population growth and economic growth invade.</p>
        <p>''Visibility in this region is extremely sensitive to even small increases and decreases in air pollution,'' the commission said in its report.</p>
        <p>It noted optimistically that current Federal pollution control plans, including the latest tightening of the Clean Air Act's requirements, passed by Congress in 1990, should mean continued improvement in the region's air quality until the year 2000, especially in emissions of sulfur dioxide from utilities.</p>
        <p>The problem is that economic growth in later years could bring pollution back up, and visibility back down.</p>
        <p>Looking at four of the clearest areas at national parks in the region, the commission predicted there would be virtually no impairment of visibility from human-caused pollution on the ''best'' days for the foreseeable future -- all the way to the year 2040.</p>
        <p>But on the ''worst'' days -- the 10 percent when visibility is at its worst -- the haze would be twice as bad in the year 2040 as it is on the worst days currently.</p>
        <p>''This is particularly significant because the human eye is more sensitive to changes in the 'worst' visibility conditions than the 'best' conditions,'' the commission said.</p>
        <p>Its goals for turning to solar, wind, and other novel sources of energy were very ambitious: renewable energy should supply 10 percent of the region's power needs by  2005, and 20 percent by 2015, it said. It cited the West's especially high potential for generating electricity from the wind and the sun.</p>
        <p>Such technologies, it said, ''have the potential to become some of the most successful and cost-effective solutions to improved visibility.''</p>
        <p>The panel also considered another obvious source of obscuring smoke: forest fires. One tool for fighting uncontrolled wildfires is to deliberately set controlled fires, but this has raised questions of whether the controlled fires are an unwelcome new source of smoke. The panel acknowledged that just as wildfires will always occur in the West, controlled fires are an appropriate prescription for dealing with them while reducing risks to people and property.</p>
