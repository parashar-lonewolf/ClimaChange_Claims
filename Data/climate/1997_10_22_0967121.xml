        <p>Yeltsin Defuses Threat From the Communist Party  Gennadi Zyuganov, the leader of Russia's Communist Party, backed away from his vow to lead a vote of no confidence against the Government of President Boris Yeltsin.</p>

        <p>Senate Hears Appeal for NATO  Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tried to persuade wary Senators in charge of appropriations to pay for NATO expansion, asserting that the Pentagon's initial estimates on the cost of the plan were too high and assuring members that it would not become a financial morass for the United States. NATO has invited Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join by 1999.</p>

        <p>Thais Protest Political Inertia  Thousands of people took to the streets in Bangkok to protest their Government's infighting and vacillation in the face of a severe economic crisis that began with a currency devaluation in July. Farmers, factory workers, bankers and stock brokers called for the resignation of Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.</p>

        <p>Serbs Beat Gypsy Boy to Death  Three thousand mourners gathered in a cemetery outside of Belgrade and heard a gypsy mother's plaintive farewell as she watched her son's burial. Dusan Jovanovic, 13, was beaten to death over the weekend on a shopping errand in full view of passers-by. There have been an increasing number of violent assaults on Serbia's 150,000 Gypsies.</p>

        <p>Disputed Vote in Montenegro  The man who lost the presidency of Montenegro, one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia, contended that the election had been stolen from him and called on his supporters to protest. The President-elect, Milo Djukanovic, accused the defeated incumbent, Momir Bulatovic, of trying to provoke violence. Mr. Bulatovic is a supporter of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Balkan region's main power broker, whose authority and prestige will suffer if Mr. Djukanovic assumes the Montenegrin presidency.</p>

        <p>New Iraq Sanctions Resisted  The United States is meeting sustained resistance in the Security Council to its plan for imposing new sanctions on Iraq, diplomats on the Council said. The United States, supported by Britain and more than six other Council members, would like to restrict the international travel of high Iraqi officials because of Iraq's ongoing failure to tell the truth about its weapons programs.</p>

        <p>Drying Mud Plagues Acapulco  Although the emergency that began when Hurricane Pauline ravaged Acapulco has been officially declared over, residents of the city still wear surgical masks in the streets against a cloud of brown dust rising from caked mud. Mexican authorities in charge of clean-up and relief have been facing a storm of public rage for inadequate responses to the disaster. Drinking water remains in short supply.</p>

        <p>Clinton to Propose New Emissions Standards  The Clinton Administration, stung by complaints that it is moving too slowly to fight global warming, has devised a set of rewards for those who cut emissions of greenhouse gases faster than required. The proposal, to be outlined in a speech by President Clinton today, is meant to mollify environmental groups and European nations that have been demanding deep, early cuts in emissions. The Clinton Administration has resisted those calls out of fear that aggressive actions might cause too much economic pain.</p>

        <p>Clinton Backs I.R.S. Overhaul  The Clinton Administration reversed itself and said it would support legislation to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service by creating an outside board with broad authority over the agency and strengthening the rights of taxpayers who feel they are being treated unfairly.</p>

        <p>Hubble Sees Crash of Galaxies  New pictures from the Hubble Space Telescope have given astronomers striking views of stellar birth triggered by the collision of two nearby galaxies -- and perhaps a glimpse of what could be in store for the Milky Way galaxy in about five billion years.</p>

        <p>Test Maker to Review Security  Educational Testing Service officials said the company would hire an international corporate investigations firm to conduct the first outside review of its security procedures for tests. E.T.S. administers nine million tests a year, including the S.A.T.</p>

        <p>Hate Sites Grow on Internet  The Anti-Defamation League said the number of sites in cyberspace that celebrate white supremacy, anti-Semitism, anti-Government fervor and denial of the Holocaust had doubled in recent years to 250 or more.</p>

        <p>Pilots Leaving Air Force</p>
        <p>The Air Force is faced with an alarming trend: the resignation of its best trained and most talented pilots who are gravitating to the commercial airlines where the pay is better and the work hours are shorter. In 1994, the Air Force retained more than 81 percent of the pilots who faced a re-enlistment decision that year, a record high. So far this year, fewer than 30 percent of the eligible pilots have made the commitment to stay in.</p>

        <p>A War for Gay Readers  A newspaper war for gay readers and advertisers begins Friday when The New York Blade News makes its debut with 50,000 free copies in Manhattan, taking on the two-and-a-half-year-old LGNY, which is published twice a month. Already, each side is questioning the other's integrity, quality, and politics.</p>
