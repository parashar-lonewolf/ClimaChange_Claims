        <p>SCIENTISTS have determined for the first time that ground-level ozone retards the growth of at least one type of mature forest tree, a widespread timber species called the loblolly pine that contributes billions of dollars to the economy of the South.</p>
        <p>Ozone in the stratosphere shields living organisms from harmful ultraviolet rays. But at ground level, where it is produced mainly by the combustion of gasoline in motor vehicles, ozone has long been known as a human health hazard. It has also been considered a significant threat to forests. Previous studies have found that when closed chambers containing tree seedlings are flooded with ozone, growth is hobbled. But there had been no definitive evidence that ozone in the real environment stunted mature trees.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have now provided this crucial evidence in a study published in the current issue of the journal Nature. The study was commissioned and financed by the Southern Global Change Program of the United States Forest Service.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sandy McLaughlin, a physiological ecologist, and Dr. D. J. Downing, a statistician, studied changes in the stem circumference of 28 mature loblolly pines exposed to naturally varying levels of ozone under a wide range of temperature, rainfall and soil moisture conditions in eastern Tennessee from 1988 through 1992. The site, described by Dr. McLaughlin as typically rural, was within the forested buffer area around the Oak Ridge laboratory, about 25 miles west of Knoxville.</p>
        <p>The researchers placed around each tree trunk a measuring device called a dendrometer, consisting of a metal band attached to a scale in such a way as to detect the expansion rate of the trunk. They also measured ozone levels. Readings were taken once or twice a week.</p>
        <p>Using statistical techniques to separate the effects of ozone and other factors, they determined that ozone levels that frequently occur in the Eastern United States caused growth to slow. The effect was increased under drier soil conditions. When ozone levels were especially high, they found, some trees actually shrank.</p>
        <p>"Ozone and drying conditions interact together to cause more slowing of growth than either one alone," said Dr. McLaughlin. This, he said, suggests that the ozone amplifies stress caused by lack of moisture.  No mechanism through which this might happen has been identified by the research, but other studies have found that periodic episodes of high ozone increase the rate at which trees use water.</p>
        <p>In the driest year of the study, 1988, the combined effect of high ozone levels and weather produced an average reduction in the growth rate of 13 percent compared with a low-ozone environment. In the wettest years, 1989 and 1992, there was virtually no reduction. The five-year average was a 5 percent reduction.  The researchers calculated that in a five-year period of moderately dry soil conditions, the overall reduction would be three times as great as the average.</p>
        <p>"We were very fortunate with the study," Dr. McLaughlin said. "We got a wide range of conditions." Weather conditions appeared to be the major factor determining whether a year was one of high or low ozone exposure: in years when storm systems moved through the area relatively infrequently, air stagnation made conditions drier and allowed ozone to build up. In 1988, the driest year and the one with the highest ozone concentrations, 27 of the 28 trees were adversely affected.</p>
        <p>Trees varied in their sensitivity to the combination of ozone and drought stress. Generally speaking, said Dr. McLaughlin, they started showing adverse effects when the ozone concentration reached 40 parts per billion. This level is reached on most days in the Eastern United States, he said.</p>
        <p>Loblolly pine is a major element in the ecology of much of the South, covering an estimated 60 million acres and contributing, through logging, an estimated $4.5 billion to the regional economy. Declines in loblolly growth were detected in the mid-1980's. Air pollution, especially ozone, was suggested but not proved as a possible cause.</p>
        <p>Dr. McLaughlin said of the new study, "I don't think we should be taking this result and predicting forest growth losses across the region; we are saying the relationship of growth to ozone appears to be a real one and does involve some factors that could be important over the long run."</p>
        <p>The findings might be particularly significant, the researchers wrote in Nature, if climatic changes as a result of rises in heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide materialize as predicted by global climate models. Some models predict warmer and drier conditions in the midlatitudes and this means "there is the potential for ozone problems to be increased by climate change in the future," said Dr. McLaughlin.</p>
        <p>Climatologists generally agree that the models cannot predict the regional effects of climate change with much accuracy. Nevertheless, concentrations of both carbon dioxide and ozone as a result of the modern economy's dependence on fossil fuels like coal and oil are expected to increase globally, raising further questions and concerns about the interacting effect of climate change and pollution on many ecosystems, including forests.</p>
