        <p>AS scientists seek to improve their imperfect understanding of how and why the world's climate is changing, evidence continues to mount that most  of the last 10,000 years -- long thought to be a benign era whose stability was crucial to the rise of civilization -- has in fact been typified by episodes of warmth, cold, drought and flooding more extreme than anything experienced in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>About a thousand years ago, for instance, Europe basked in warmth that nurtured vineyards in Britain and allowed the Norse to colonize Greenland. At roughly the same time, what is now California was baking in centuries-long droughts,  dwarfing the mere seven-year droughts of today. Early South American civilizations literally dried up and blew away. But only a few centuries later, in what is called the Little Ice Age, severe cold gripped much of the world, sending glaciers coursing down mountainsides, freezing European harvests and starving much of the populace.</p>
        <p>Natural variations like these raise important questions in the scientific debate that underlies efforts by the nations of the world, at a conference beginning Dec. 1 in Kyoto, Japan, to cope with the prospect of climate change. How much of the global warming observed in the last century is natural, and how much has been caused by waste industrial gases that trap heat in the atmosphere?  And how might natural climatic fluctuations modify and interact with whatever climate changes caused by people are in store for the future?</p>
        <p>Now an important new element has been added to the emerging picture of pervasive, natural climatic change in the Holocene, the period since the vestiges of the last ice age vanished 10,000 years ago. Centuries-long cold spells much like that of the Little Ice Age have occurred more or less regularly, roughly every 1,400 to 1,500 years, report researchers, led by Dr. Gerard Bond at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, in the current issue of the journal Science. They discovered the oscillations by analyzing climatic signals in ancient ocean sediments in the North Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The quasi-periodic swings were found to persist over the last 32,000 years, which is as far back as it was possible to date the sediments by the radiocarbon method. This means that the 1,500-year cycle also operated in the last ice age.But during that period, the cyclical cold spells were much more severe than in the Holocene. In the ice age spells, Dr. Bond said, the surface temperature of the North Atlantic where the sediment samples were taken dropped by about 9 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit. In the Holocene spells, the drop was about 2 to 3.5 degrees.</p>
        <p>How that translated into changes in the air temperature is unclear.  Scientists believe, on the basis of other evidence, that air temperature dropped by 1 to 3 degrees in the Little Ice Age.</p>
        <p>In the late 19th and 20th centuries, the global temperature has bounced back from the Little Ice Age cold, rising by about 1 degree and suggesting that the world may now be in the early stages of a centuries-long cycle of natural warmth. ''We could be coming out of the colder phase into the warmer phase of the cycle right now,'' Dr. Bond said. On the other hand, he said, the warming of the 20th century could be a relatively temporary warming blip, and the cold of the Little Ice Age might resume. He and his colleagues discovered many such temporary interruptions of previous cold phases.</p>
        <p>The dominant view among climate scientists is that the warming of the 20th century has been caused at least in part by emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which are produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The prevailing view also says that further warming is in store as a result of the emissions and that such warming could seriously disrupt the earth's climate system in the next century. Representatives from some 150 countries are to convene in Kyoto to negotiate cuts in emissions.</p>
        <p>But no one knows how much of the observed warming is attributable to the heat-trapping gases and how much is caused by natural fluctuations in climate. In an attempt to sort things out, scientists have been focusing more on past climates, searching for patterns that might shed light on the present and future.</p>
        <p>While the impact of natural variations on present-day climate cannot yet be pinned down with precision, Dr. Bond said, ''it's probably fair to say that we're seeing a component of natural variability'' in the last century's warming.</p>
        <p>Other recent studies have suggested that the world is in the early stages of a natural warming phase and that, if so, any warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions would come on top of the natural temperature increase, delivering something of a one-two punch.</p>
        <p>That has been suggested most recently by other new research reported in the current issue of Science.  Investigators headed by Dr. Jonathan Overpeck of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colo., examined climatic indicators in lake and ocean sediments, tree rings and glacier ice in the Arctic. They found that from 1840 to the mid-20th century, Arctic temperatures warmed to their highest levels in 400 years, ending the Little Ice Age in those latitudes. The researchers attributed the early part of this bounce-back warming to natural causes but said that greenhouse gas emissions had probably contributed after about 1920.</p>
        <p>All the recent findings say only so much about where the present-day climate fits into the long-term pattern of natural variations. The 1,500-year oscillations discovered by Dr. Bond and his colleagues, said Dr. Delia Oppo, a paleooceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute at Woods Hole, Mass., ''are not perfectly periodic so we don't really know where we are in detail -- it's not that cut and dried.'' But ''if we can nail the timing more clearly,'' she said, ''it really helps us when we're looking at global warming.''  Dr. Oppo wrote a commentary on the Bond team's study in Science.</p>
        <p>The Overpeck team, writing in Science and referring to its study of the Arctic, cautioned against efforts ''to simply extrapolate past patterns of change into the future.'' That will ''ultimately fail to anticipate future Arctic climate change and its impacts,'' the scientists wrote. Reliable predictions, they said, will require computerized climate-system models that simulate the long-ago changes now being reconstructed.</p>
        <p>While precision eludes scientists who are researching ancient climates, a raft of studies in recent years has made it clear that the conventional view of the Holocene as an even, tranquil interval in climatic history is in error.</p>
        <p>Compared with big climatic swings of the past, like the ice ages and the super-warming of the Cretaceous period, which melted almost all the world's ice before ending some 65 million years ago, the Holocene variations are small. But compared with the experience of everyone alive today, they seem large indeed.</p>
        <p>The catalogue of Holocene climatic variability is large and growing.  Several times in the Holocene, for instance, great stretches of the American West have been converted by drought into expanses of windblown sand like the Sahara. Starting about 3,300 years ago, the upper Mississippi Valley experienced a series of what would today be called 500-year floods.</p>
        <p>Archeological and climatological evidence suggest that a number of pre-Inca cultures rose and fell in tune with big droughts. Starting about 1,100 years ago, California experienced droughts lasting 220 years and 140 years, both more intense than present-day droughts lasting less than a decade. The 20th century, scientists say, has actually been part of a California wet period. The droughts a millennium ago coincided with a similar drought that caused the collapse of South America's most advanced pre-Inca empire, a nation-state called Tiwanaku. That was roughly the same period when the Norse colonized Greenland and Britons tended vineyards.</p>
        <p>Drought has also been implicated in the collapse of the classic Maya civilization in Yucatan, and a 300-year drought is believed to have brought the Middle East's earliest known empire, that of the Akkadians, to its knees some 4,200 years ago.</p>
        <p>And now, thanks to the Lamont-Doherty team's study, there is the evidence of semiperiodic cold spells of millennial length. The team analyzed corings taken from ocean sediments off Ireland and southeastern Greenland.</p>
        <p>The corings contained two kinds of evidence. One was grains of sand deposited on the sea floor when cold water north of Iceland periodically moved southward. The water carried ice, and sand was released from the ice when it melted in the more southerly latitudes. More sand at a particular time, the scientists reasoned, signified more sea ice and thus a movement of cold water southward.  That, they inferred, cooled the climate.</p>
        <p>The second kind of evidence involved tiny animals called foraminifera that live in oceanic surface waters. Their calcified shells also fall to the sea floor when they die. Certain kinds of these animals thrive in colder waters, some in warmer ones. The researchers found cold-water foraminifera in the same seabed strata as bigger concentrations of sand grains.</p>
        <p>Together, this evidence indicated the existence of the 1,500-year cycle (1,470 years with a margin of error of plus or minus 500 years) of alternating cold and warm spells. The cycle is independent of, and superimposed on, the longer cycle in which ice ages come and go every 100,000 years or so, the researchers concluded.</p>
        <p>The team's coring record stopped just short of the Little Ice Age, but Dr. Bond said that event appeared to have been the latest in the series of 1,500-year cold cycles. Other studies of ocean sediments have previously demonstrated that the Little Ice Age reached its coldest point about 300 years ago, that an even colder cycle occurred about 8,200 years ago and that there were instances of pronounced rises in temperature, to somewhat higher levels than today's, 1,000 and 2,500 years ago.</p>
        <p>The cause of the 1,500-year oscillations is unclear. It could have to do with changes in the sun's output, some scientists say, but the Bond team favors some sort of mechanism within the climate system involving interactions between the atmosphere and ocean currents.</p>
        <p>Deep ocean currents transport heat around the globe and are particularly important in delivering it to the North Atlantic region. Many scientists believe that interruptions or weakenings of the currents are involved in large-scale climatic changes. In the current issue of the journal Nature, a study headed by Dr. Jess F. Adkins of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology links the beginning and end of the last interglacial period around 120,000 years ago to abrupt changes in these deep currents.</p>
        <p>That interglacial period was similar to the Holocene in that it marked a warm interval between ice ages. Because of the apparently major role of the ocean currents, many scientists express nervousness about the possible effects of greenhouse warming on the currents.</p>
        <p>For example, computerized climate models indicate that global warming would cause more water to evaporate from tropical oceans and be carried northward, where it would condense and fall as rain or snow, said Dr. Scott Lehman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Colorado in Boulder who wrote a commentary on the Adkins study in Nature. The extra influx of fresh water, he said, could dilute the salt content of the heat-transporting current, and the density conferred by salinity affects the capacity to carry heat.</p>
        <p>Less salinity ''tends to weaken the conveyor'' of heat, he said. That could cool the North Atlantic region substantially, but the overall warming exerted by greenhouse gases would probably keep the rest of the world warmer.</p>
        <p>In any event, he said, ''the stability of interglacial climate is delicately poised with respect to the ocean circulation.'' To the extent that climate is governed by natural oscillations, Dr. Lehman said, ''we may excite that process by fossil fuel burning.''</p>
