        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-18</p>
        <p>U.N. Approves Korea Sanctions  The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to impose strict sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear test, overcoming objections from Russia and China by explicitly excluding the threat of military force.  1</p>
        <p>Atomic officials estimate that, in addition to North Korea, as many as 40 other countries have the skill, and in some cases the material, to build a nuclear bomb. That ability, coupled with new nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East, risks a second nuclear age, officials and arms control specialists say.  1</p>
        <p>Israeli Tanks in East Gaza  The Israeli military killed six Hamas militants in predawn fighting as tanks and other armored vehicles rolled into areas east of Gaza City in a stepped-up attempt to halt Palestinian rocket fire.  18</p>
        <p>Russia Plans Salmon Refuges  Fearing extinction of the wild salmon, Russia's government is at work on proposals that would designate seven sprawling tracts of wilderness as salmon protected areas, a network of refuges that would be the first of its kind, encompassing nine entire rivers and more than six million acres.  1</p>
        <p>Iraqi-American Faces Death  An Iraqi-born American citizen who was tried in an Iraqi court on charges that he assisted in the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists last year has been sentenced to death, along with five Iraqi co-defendants, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Baghdad said.  18</p>
        <p>A rural Shiite town northwest of Baghdad exploded in sectarian reprisals after 14 Shiite construction workers were killed and angry residents, many roving the streets in armed packs on the backs of pick-up trucks, killed at least 26 people from a nearby Sunni village, provincial authorities said.  18</p>
        <p>NATIONAL 22-33</p>
        <p>Stricter Rules for Athletes  Seven months after the off-campus party at the heart of the still unresolved rape case involving the Duke University lacrosse team, colleges across the country have changed how they respond to even the most minor indiscretions by athletes.  1</p>
        <p>Voter Enthusiasm Seen as High  Voter intensity is a critical element in politics, especially in midterm elections. Pollsters say enthusiasm among Democrats is particularly high this year than the intensity of Republicans.  1</p>
        <p>Married Couples in Minority  Married couples, whose numbers have been declining for decades as a proportion of American households, have finally slipped into a minority, according to an analysis of new census figures.  22</p>
        <p>Churches Fight Global Warming  Over the last five years, a Michigan priest has sharply reduced his small parish 's energy use and emissions of carbon dioxide, the compound most scientists believe has led to global warming, and he has organized other congregations across his state to do the same.  33</p>
        <p>SPORTSSUNDAY SP 1-14</p>
        <p>Mets Trail Cardinals in Series  The Mets lost to the Cardinals, 5-0, in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, and will head into Game 4 down two games to one in this best-of-seven series.  SP 1</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION 35-40</p>
        <p>Two Views of Spitzer's Past  Eliot Spitzer's supporters say he forced much-needed reforms on entire industries as attorney general, while critics say his bold assaults on corporate America often bordered on the reckless.  35</p>
