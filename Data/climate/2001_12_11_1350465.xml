        <p>No question about it, the seven philanthropists who received the inaugural Andrew Carnegie Medals of Philanthropy yesterday were an august bunch: Leonore Annenberg, Brooke Astor, Irene Diamond, William H. Gates Sr., David Rockefeller, George Soros and Ted Turner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner, the youngest of the lot at 63, seemed slightly stunned at the longevity of those gathered around him. ''It's a good thing they did this when they did,'' he said. ''Some of us won't be here that much longer.''</p>
        <p>The titans of the new philanthropy came to the New York Public Library to celebrate the centennial of a signal moment in the history of American giving: Andrew Carnegie's $480 million sale of United States Steel to J. P. Morgan, the transaction that freed Carnegie to devote the rest of his life to philanthropy on a level never before seen.</p>
        <p>Each of yesterday's honorees has taken that tradition in a new direction. The award-winners represent different approaches to philanthropy, having in common only that each has given away hundreds of millions of dollars, more than $10 billion among them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Astor, who will soon reach her own centennial, has long been the grande dame of New York society, financing local institutions like the public library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Zoological Society. In contrast, many of the others, including Mr. Turner, Mr. Gates and Mr. Soros, work largely at the international level on issues like global warming, child health, and open societies, respectively.</p>
        <p>While it is difficult to generalize, most of the new philanthropists see themselves less as patrons of leading cultural institutions than as problem-solvers tackling profound social ills. Most seem to feel a great sense of urgency about putting their money to work, fast. And where the great philanthropists of the last century tended to use their money to create foundations that would last in perpetuity, -- the 21 Carnegie institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation -- many of the new philanthropists are spending the bulk of their money while they are alive, to have a greater impact and control how their fortunes are used.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to do what would make the biggest difference in the shortest term,'' said Mr. Turner, discussing his decision in 1997 to give $100 million a year to the United Nations in the course of 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros, too, has said he will use his money now, rather than leave it to others to direct.</p>
        <p>As president of the Aaron Diamond Foundation, Ms. Diamond gave away more than $220 million and closed out the foundation five years ago, after a decade as the largest private supporter of AIDS research, playing an important role in discovering protease inhibitors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Astor closed the Vincent Astor Foundation in 1997 after giving away some $200 million. ''You have to try to help everybody, but if they're nuts and stupid, stay away from them,'' she said, advice that won a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Annenberg said that she and her husband, Walter, do not plan to give out all their money in their lifetimes, but they, too, have made large grants to address specific problems, including the $500 million Annenberg Challenge, to reform public education in the United States.</p>
        <p>The tension between spending now and building in perpetuity remains a live one in discussions of philanthropy. Those who work at the Carnegie groups said his continuing legacy proves the value of creating institutions that outlive their founder.</p>
        <p>''The Carnegie institutions are as alive, and as vital, as they were in Andrew Carnegie's time, and they still will be in another century, because Mr. Carnegie had such a broad vision, and trusted the trustees to go forward with the work,'' said Maxine F. Singer, president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which is devoted to science.</p>
        <p>By the time he died in 1919, Carnegie had given away 90 percent of his fortune, founding 21 organizations from Carnegie Hall and the Carnegie Corporation in New York, to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and Dr. Singer's group. His early philanthropy focused on libraries, and 2,500 public libraries around the world were built in his name.</p>
        <p>Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, said that Carnegie, along with the Rockefeller family, set the standards of modern philanthropy, and that he still keeps a picture of  Carnegie in his office. ''Every day, like Mayor Koch, I ask him, 'How'm I doing?' '' Mr. Gregorian said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's honors were a glittering affair, with Tom Brokaw, Barbara Walters and Bill Moyers serving as presenters before an audience of leaders from the city's nonprofit institutions. There were touching moments, as the honorees discussed their passions, with several saying that their philanthropy had been the most satisfying part of their lives. The senior Mr. Gates, the chief executive officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whose $23.5 billion endowment makes it by far the nation's largest, talked of the need to ensure that children in the developing world have access to vaccinations and healthcare, and his delight at being involved in such issues through his son's fortune.</p>
        <p>''I am one really proud father,'' he said, choking up slightly. ''I regret that his mother did not live to see this day.''</p>
