        <p>The drilling began seven years ago, and on Thursday it touched bottom: nearly two miles beneath the surface, the deepest hole ever drilled through ice in the Northern Hemisphere. No wonder the international team of scientists celebrated with Champagne.</p>
        <p>The goal of the drilling -- formally named the North Greenland Ice Core Project, or North GRIP -- was to extract a continuous sample of ice, all the way from Greenland's vast surface ice sheet down to bedrock.</p>
        <p>The team of two dozen European scientists and assistants, led by Danes, are exploring the history of the earth's changing climate and seeking to gain tools to predict future changes, including the possibility that recent global warming will be replaced by rapid cooling.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, the Danish chemist Willi Dansgaard discovered that he could estimate the earth's surface temperature by comparing the ratio of two isotopes of oxygen in water that falls as rain or snow; the ratio changes with temperature but is unaffected by time. In some Greenland cores, individual layers of ice can be dated like tree rings. So preserved in glacier ice is the record of temperatures past.</p>
        <p>Trapped within the ice are also bubbles of ancient air that once filled the spaces between the snowflakes that formed the glacier. The air is released when the samples are melted, permitting researchers to study, for example, the relationship between the earth's temperature and ''greenhouse'' gases like methane and carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>The scientists can also study precipitation, by measuring the thickness of annual layers, and the impact of volcanoes, by examining layers of ash.</p>
        <p>The most recent core is expected to contain ice about 120,000 years old, 10,000 years or so before the dawn of the first ice age. Two other deep ice cores were drilled in the early 1990's, one by Europeans and another by Americans, but the climate record petered out about 100,000 years in the past. Researchers want to study the climate during the warm period, or interglacial, before the last ice age.</p>
        <p>If the past is any indication, the earth is at the end of another such warm period, poised to descend into a new ice age. Earlier ice cores showed that the transition from glacial to interglacial was rocky, marked by a ''flickering'' climate that swung drastically back and forth several times, in some instances 15 degrees Fahrenheit in a decade or less.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows whether similar fluctuations could occur during the next transition from interglacial to glacial. Dr. Sigfus J. Johnsen, a geophysicist at the Niels Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen (and the scientist who popped the Champagne corks), says it is a matter of more than passing interest.</p>
        <p>''If our own warm period ends this way,'' he said, ''we're in big trouble.''</p>
        <p>It will take some time before ice from the deepest part of the core can be analyzed. But the project has already given the researchers at least one big surprise.</p>
        <p>The very last sample from the bottom of the ice sheet included a tan icicle, about the size of a roll of paper towels, hanging from the drill. The researchers think the drill penetrated a pocket of water at the very bottom of the ice sheet.</p>
        <p>They knew the bottom was warm, heated by geothermal energy in the underlying rock, but they did not expect to be able to sample it. But it appears that the liquid spurted up and froze solid to the drill bit, which had passed through much cooler ice on the way down. The pocket of water could have been covered ever since the ice sheet was first formed, millions of years ago.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't believe my eyes,'' said Dr. Dorthe Dahl-Jensen, the project's chief scientist. ''It could contain evidence of ancient life.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 30, 2003, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on July 22 about the completion of a climatology project to drill a hole from the surface of Greenland's ice sheet to bedrock referred incorrectly to the earliest ice recovered. At 120,000 years old, it was formed about 10,000 years before the dawn of the most recent ice age, not the first one.</p>
