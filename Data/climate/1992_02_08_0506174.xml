        <p>A group of experts sponsored by the United Nations is proposing cheaper and more efficient ways to control global air pollution by creating a worldwide market in pollution permits.</p>
        <p>The plan is the most ambitious yet in the effort to control harmful emissions through the forces of the free market. It would for the first time put a worldwide price on one or more of the pollutants blamed for global warming.</p>
        <p>The plan, commissioned by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and released in Geneva last week, would set national quotas on emissions. Those governments or private groups that found it too difficult or too costly to meet their limits could buy pollution allowances abroad. Countries that polluted less than their quota could sell their allowances to other nations.</p>
        <p>Proponents of the plan hope the concept will be approved in June at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. Lawyers, economists and energy specialists have worked for more than a year to prepare the plan.  Global Plan for Global Problem</p>
        <p>The proposal is a break with the common practice of tackling environmental problems through national and local regulations and rules.</p>
        <p>People who prepared the plan acknowledge that a global system for pollution licenses and quotas for rich and poor nations will be difficult to negotiate. But they say that as long as there are clear benefits and incentives, the rapidly growing concern about climatic change does make such a plan possible.</p>
        <p>Supporters note that the world's governments are already moving toward a consensus: limits must be placed on gases that can warm the earth. But there is wide disagreement on the size of the necessary cuts.</p>
        <p>"Everyone recognizes that climate change is a global problem, so this is a first practical mechanism that can work on a global scale," said Frank Joshua, coordinator of the group that produced the plan. Smaller Steps Expected First</p>
        <p>Even if a universal system cannot be put into place in the near future, those who have worked on the plan say they are confident that limited bilateral or multilateral agreements among countries could start in a matter of months.</p>
        <p>Pollution experts say they are encouraged because the concept of trading pollution allowances is already gaining ground among policy makers. The European Community is discussing a 12-country plan for trading sulfur-emissions permits, and the concept is actually working on a small scale in the United States, where the Clean Air Act gave companies the right to trade in sulfur-dioxide allowances to reduce acid rain.</p>
        <p>And last week, regulators in Southern California tentatively approved a plan to let companies trade pollution rights, beginning with emissions of nitrogen oxides. 'An Enormous Change'&gt;</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists have reservations about the United Nations plan because it would effectively grant companies and governments permission to continue polluting. They argue that it would also let sellers of pollution entitlements make money off the fact that people elsewhere kept using so-called dirty energy like coal and oil.</p>
        <p>But proponents, among them several longtime environmentalists, argue that pollution happens anyway and has long been free. By creating permits and credits, the plan would put a price on carbon dioxide, the initial target. Emissions could be valued in units of 100 or 1,000 tons produced.</p>
        <p>"This would be an enormous change," said Tom Tietenberg, an American economist and expert in tradable permits who has worked on the global plan. "This means using the market to pursue environmental objectives rather than just economic objectives. Until now, the market has been seen as a powerful adversary, and environmentalists have wanted to block it at every turn. It's an attempt to make this powerful force work for you rather than against you."  Quotas for Carbon Dioxide</p>
        <p>In its first stage, the United Nations proposal calls for a binding international treaty to set a global limit on carbon dioxide emissions, which makes up the bulk of the so-called greenhouse gases widely thought to be warming the earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Quotas would then be set for how much carbon dioxide each country would be allowed to produce. Countries that produced less than their quotas would earn pollution credits that could be traded or sold to countries wanting to exceed their quotas.</p>
        <p>"The purpose is to reduce waste, to get as much control as possible for the same dollar spent," said Mr. Tietenberg, an economics professor at Colby College in Waterville, Me. "If the U.S. has to cut emissions and it can look only within its own borders, there will be limited opportunities to do this at low cost. In Eastern Europe and other developing countries there are many opportunities to reduce emissions more cheaply."</p>
        <p>Planners recommend starting off with carbon dioxide because, Mr. Joshua said, "its properties are well known; it's the largest proportion of gases produced; it can be measured."</p>
        <p>A nation's output of carbon dioxide can be relatively easily estimated through its energy consumption. Other factors would be considered, like the seasonal fires in some parts of the world to clear fields and forests. If a system works for carbon dioxide, planners envision expanding it to cover other polluting gases.  All Nations May Benefit</p>
        <p>The experts who worked on the plan, which was financed by Norway and the Netherlands, said one basic guideline was that a global pollution-control program would have the best chance for success if all the participants saw benefits. Thus, the authors stress that buying or leasing emission permits can suit rich industrial countries where rules and standards can be very expensive to put into force and may not work anyway.</p>
        <p>For developing countries, on the other hand, the plan would respond to a persistent demand: that the wealthy, industrialized nations, which are the world's greatest polluters, must provide expertise and money if they want the poorer nations to change environmentally harmful practices. Developing countries, which pollute less, would get pollution rights above their current needs and thus build up a surplus.</p>
        <p>This surplus would leave a margin for future use so as not to inhibit industrial growth. But in the meantime they could lease or sell their surplus credits to other nations.</p>
        <p>Some private projects of this kind are already under way. A Dutch utility, which was paying heavy taxes for exceeding its quota of carbon and sulfur emissions, is now financing a $35 million plant in Poland. The utility found that by spending that amount on its already finely tuned Dutch power stations, it could remove only 6,000 tons of sulfur -- just a small percentage. But for the same amount of money in Poland, it can remove 45,000 tons of sulfur a year. To finance this effort, the utility got Government approval to increase its rates to consumers and to use part of its money that would otherwise go toward taxes.</p>
