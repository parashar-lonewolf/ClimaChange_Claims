        <p>CHALK it up to global warming, or to a collective midlife crisis as baby boomers enter their 50's. Or credit the auto industry with improvements that make these fair-weather friends reasonably agreeable even in the driven snow.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reasons, convertibles are having a renaissance.</p>
        <p>Sales were up 20 percent last year, the biggest jump since 1988, according to ASC Inc. of Southgate, Mich., the nation's largest supplier of convertible tops. Slightly fewer than 200,000 convertibles were sold in 1996, just 10,000 short of the record set in 1991.</p>
        <p>Nearly four dozen open-top models are now available in the United States, ranging from around $16,000 to nearly half a million dollars, with plenty of choices in between. A trio of jaunty two-seat roadsters from Europe -- the BMW Z3, the Mercedes-Benz SLK230 and the Porsche Boxster -- have helped to kindle interest. But the best-selling convertible is the Chrysler Sebring, which last year replaced the LeBaron, a car that almost single-handedly revived the moribund convertible market in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The Sebring, which starts at $20,685, is priced for the mainstream. But what about the top and bottom of the convertible spectrum? If your objective is only to feel the wind in your hair and the sun on your brow while motoring along a country lane, how much pleasure does an extra $300,000 add?</p>
        <p>To find an answer, I set out to drive convertibles that are among the least and most expensive available.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the list of open-air cars, in price if not in fun, is the Honda del Sol, which starts at $15,475. The del Sol, based on the Civic compact, has a roof panel that lifts off for storage in the trunk and is technically not a convertible. It is also nearing the end of its production run. (Also inexpensive are some small sport utility vehicles with folding tops, including the two-door Geo Tracker and the most basic Jeep Wrangler. But in their rawest forms, these vehicles are too primitive for most buyers and have nothing in common -- except four wheels -- with the hand-built convertibles at the top.)</p>
        <p>One step up from the del Sol, at a base price of $17,188, is a real car and a real convertible, and it is new for 1997: the Toyota Paseo. A soft-top version of the Paseo subcompact, it is aimed at young people on tight budgets, and it provides basic open-air transportation. Its engine, a 1.5-liter four cylinder, puts out an underwhelming 92 horsepower.</p>
        <p>Having settled on the Paseo to represent the low end of the market, I set out to find its top-down counterpoint. At the extreme top of the scale is the Ferrari F50, a very-limited-production model that costs $487,000. It is, essentially, a street-legal Formula One car, and figured to be impossible to lay my hands on. But a couple notches down the list -- and a relative bargain at less than half the price of the F50 -- is the Lamborghini Diablo Roadster VT.</p>
        <p>The VT, which has a removable roof, costs $275,100 (including a $6,400 gas-guzzler penalty but not $20,000 in luxury taxes). It also proved difficult to obtain. Lamborghini's factory in Sant'Agata, Italy, will build a mere 50 Diablo VT Roadsters this year for the American market.</p>
        <p>No test models were available. Lamborghini's top United States dealer, in Sterling Heights, Mich., reported that his last VT Roadster had just left the showroom, and that its new owner -- an intensely private person, like many of Lamborghini's well-heeled buyers -- was unlikely to allow me to ride in it, much less drive it.</p>
        <p>A telephone search for Diablo roadsters turned up one at the Nelson Auto Group here in Marysville, a small Ohio city northwest of Columbus that is best known as the home of Honda's original American assembly plant. Nelson's only VT was sold but had not yet been delivered, and the owner of the dealership, Gregory Nelson, said I could take it for a spin with one small stipulation: I could not put more than three miles on the odometer.</p>
        <p>And so it came to pass that I ended up at the wheel of my Paseo test car, driving 234 miles each way from Detroit to complete my shortest test-drive ever.</p>
        <p>As I neared my destination, I saw acres and acres of newly plowed ground and fields of grazing cattle. It seemed an unlikely location to sell Lamborghinis. Given the huge manufacturing operations churning out Accords and Civics just up the road, a Honda dealership would have seemed more logical.</p>
        <p>The Nelson Auto Group actually specializes in a full line of Chrysler Corporation products. Its lot was packed with Jeeps, Dodge Ram pickups and assorted Dodge and Chrysler cars for Middle America. But sure enough, displayed in the showroom were two Lamborghini coupes. Nelson is the only Lamborghini dealer in this part of the Midwest, and it is within a two-  to-three-hour drive of five major metropolitan areas.</p>
        <p>A salesman at the dealership cautiously wheeled the Diablo Roadster around the building from its hiding place. The car was breathtaking, with a wedge-shaped, angular silhouette and side air intakes that gave it an aggressive, race car appearance. The lower body panels were so low that they nearly touched the ground. A short, sloping nose hid the trunk. A long engine compartment behind the seats contained a monstrous 48-valve V12 engine displacing 5.7 liters and producing 492 horsepower.</p>
        <p>In every respect, the Diablo provided a sharp, exotic contrast to the Paseo I had driven from Michigan. The diminutive Toyota has a gently rounded shape and uncomplicated lines. Parked side by side, the Paseo and Diablo had only two features in common: their color -- red -- and their topless passenger compartments.</p>
        <p>Removing and installing the Diablo's top was an easy two-person operation. The roof panel weighs a mere 17 pounds. For open-air motoring, the panel fits over the engine cover, or it can be stored in a garage.</p>
        <p>By contrast, dropping the Paseo's top took more muscle than I expected, and I had to manhandle it even more to align the hooks when I raised it back up. The car was dreadfully noisy with the top up, a flaw I traced to a missing seal that was supposed to run along the top of the driver's side window. Nor was the fit of the top up to Toyota's usually high standards. (ASC rebuilds Paseo coupes into convertibles in California.)</p>
        <p>While getting in and out of the two-door Paseo is nothing out of the ordinary, boarding the Diablo is like stepping into a spaceship. Push a button and the gull-wing doors float gracefully skyward. If the windows are up, the glass lowers automatically, and when the door is shut, the windows close.</p>
        <p>Inside the Diablo, the rich, cream-colored leather seats -- trimmed in red piping for an extra $445 -- are contoured like those in race cars. And the control buttons are unapologetically square, in contrast to those of most modern cars, with their curvy shapes and soft lines. Lamborghini's famous emblem of a raging bull is everywhere -- on the steering wheel hub, the speedometer, the tachometer, the vents. The ambiance is intimate, though conversation is nearly impossible once you fire up the engine.</p>
        <p>Inside the Paseo, the atmosphere is spartan. There is a rear seat that can accommodate a couple of children, in contrast to the Diablo, but the Toyota still feels cozy. The seats, with a colorful fabric obviously aimed at a young crowd, remained comfortable throughout my lengthy trip.</p>
        <p>The two cars' driving experiences were as far apart as their prices.</p>
        <p>''Drive friendly,'' a friend had advised me before I left for Ohio in the Paseo. In other words, don't take any risks. Indeed, the Paseo, which weighs just over 2,000 pounds, was whipped about by the wind and passing tractor-trailers. I kept both hands tightly on the steering wheel, and I didn't try to drive faster than Michigan's 70-mile-an-hour limit. It wasn't that the Paseo couldn't go faster, it just didn't feel comfortable doing so. Still, the little Toyota was fun to zip through the five speeds of the manual transmission. (An automatic is a $800 option.)</p>
        <p>As I climbed behind the wheel of the Diablo, I recalled my first drive in an early Dodge Viper, when my short legs were unable to depress the clutch fully. What if I had driven all this way and couldn't reach the Diablo's clutch pedal? My concern proved groundless. I fit perfectly behind the wheel.</p>
        <p>But I did ''drive friendly'' in the Diablo, for different reasons. For one thing, a driver is very conspicuous, especially to the police, in this raucous red beauty. Besides, it was a customer's car, and it is worth more than my five-bedroom Colonial house.</p>
        <p>The sticker on the windshield put the total at $284,000, which included the extra $445 for the red piping as well as $3,455 for the custom leather luggage made to fit perfectly in the 5.3-cubic-foot trunk. (And, yes, you can deal on a Lambo, perhaps whittling the price by $10,000 or so, Mr. Nelson said.)</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I traveled 2.5 miles at the wheel of the Diablo Roadster, and I stayed just shy of 70 m.p.h., or about 130 m.p.h. below its top speed, which it can achieve in a quarter of a mile. I ran through all the gears, though I didn't need to. The Diablo proved to be surprisingly easy to drive.</p>
        <p>I wanted more. But, alas, my 2.5-mile test drive came quickly -- so quickly -- to an end. (Had I pushed the Diablo, which zooms to 60 m.p.h. in 4 seconds, I could have covered the same distance in a minute or so.)</p>
        <p>I climbed back into the plebeian Paseo for the ride home. In one day, I had covered nearly as many miles in the Paseo as Nelson's typical customer puts on a Lamborghini in a year. (Most Lambos sit in pristine garages and appreciate in value; few ever provide daily transportation.)</p>
        <p>Which of these cars would I pick if I were shopping for a convertible? Neither. At the low end, I'd go for a Volkswagen Cabrio, which is only a few hundred dollars more than the Paseo, is more powerful and has far more personality. If price was no object, I'd probably opt for the well-engineered, easy-to-live-with Porsche 911 Cabriolet. And I'd spend the $200,000 I'd save on something else -- perhaps a weekend house to which I could drive, top-down, in my racy ragtop.</p>
