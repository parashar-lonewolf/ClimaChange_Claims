        <p>The canals that the 19th-century astronomer Percival Lowell believed he saw on Mars were thought to be evidence of an active civilization. Their existence was long ago disproved, of course, but Mars has been shown to be an active place nonetheless. It's just nature, not little green men, that is raising a ruckus.</p>
        <p>A recent series of photographs, pictured here from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, shows a huge storm system near the north pole at the end of the Martian summer. The reddish cloud swirling down from the pole consists mostly of dust; it is shown evolving over six hours on June 30. It is hundreds of miles long.</p>
        <p>The spacecraft, which finally reached its mapping orbit in April, a year behind schedule, has spotted shifting sand dunes and dust devils, vertical plumes of dust that arise from spinning winds and occur over several hours in the late afternoons, when the air is hottest. The dust devils are similar to their counterparts in desert and farm areas on Earth, only the Martian ones are monstrous: up to five miles high.</p>
        <p>The mission has also given scientists some understanding of how the polar caps retreat. The caps consist mostly of frozen carbon dioxide, which goes from solid to gas directly (a process known as sublimation) as winter ends in each hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Photographs of dunes in the polar regions show that thawing occurs simultaneously in spots, which steadily enlarge until all the frost is gone and only the permanent ice cap is left.</p>
        <p>Global Surveyor will remain in its circular polar orbit, 250 miles high, photographing the surface over a Martian year, 687 Earth days.</p>
        <p>Already, the trove of images it has sent back has been remarkable, said Michael Ravine, advanced projects director for Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, the builder and operator of the craft's camera. ''It's providing the kind of data we never really had access to before,'' he said.</p>
