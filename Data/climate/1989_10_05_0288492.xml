        <p>LEAD: The Congressional compromise reached this week on automobile emissions is one of the most significant indications of how far American industry has been forced to retreat from unbending opposition to tougher Federal clean air laws.</p>
        <p>The Congressional compromise reached this week on automobile emissions is one of the most significant indications of how far American industry has been forced to retreat from unbending opposition to tougher Federal clean air laws.</p>
        <p>The House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment's unanimous vote on Monday to end 12 years of stalemate and tighten pollution controls reflects the impact that concern over environmental problems has had on Capitol Hill. In acquiesing to such a measure, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the auto makers' major supporter in the House, accepted what he apparently thought was the best deal he could get for the industry.</p>
        <p>From the outset of debate this year on strengthening the Clean Air Act of 1970, automobile and other industrial lobbyists accepted that more stringent anti-pollution legislation was almost certain. Indeed, representatives of basic industries like steel have told Congress, with varying levels of enthusiasm, that they support new air pollution laws. But at the same time they have been lobbying to minimize the extent, and thus the cost, of change.</p>
        <p>''If no bill passed, we would not be heartbroken, but the opportunity to stop the bill isn't there,'' said Robert A. Beck, clean air issues manager for the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington trade group representing electric companies. ''We want to fix the bill in the best possible way for the industry.'' Billions in Extra Cost</p>
        <p>The pending legislation, which includes controls on smog, acid rain and airborne toxic substances like formaldehyde, would add $14 billion to $19 billion a year to the $35 billion that industry spends annually on pollution control, according to Government estimates. Electric utilities alone estimate $5 billion to $7 billion in new costs beginning in the year 2000.</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates say industry would simply pass along these costs to customers, and industry spokesmen agree that at least some would be.</p>
        <p>Given the expected costs, industry has been lobbying Congress with an intensity that rivals that on tax bills. The campaign is made more difficult because industry, which has hung together for years to fight a tougher Clean Air Act, is divided about who should pay the higher costs.</p>
        <p>Throughout the Reagan years auto makers and coal-related interests, aided by sympathetic lawmakers, succeeded in blocking new clean air legislation. But the political climate changed dramatically after both Presidential candidates in the 1988 campaign endorsed a stronger Clean Air Act. And opinion polls have shown growing public concern about the environment and a willingness to pay more to clean it up.</p>
        <p>President Bush's support for stronger clean air laws set the stage for Congressional action and helped to force industry lobbyists to adopt a legislative approach different from the past one of trying to rally public opinion against tougher pollution standards with threats of higher consumer prices.</p>
        <p>But even in the new climate, the auto companies were jolted by Monday's vote in the House subcommittee to require new cars to carry equipment that would sharply reduce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide and to have pollution control equipment that would last 100,000 miles, twice as long as now mandated. Auto makers say the cost of meeting the new standards far outweighs the reduction in pollution they would bring.</p>
        <p>''What they have done is taken tailpipe standards to the knife-edge of technological feasibility,'' said Ronald R. Boltz, vice president of advanced product and operations planning at the Chrysler Corporation. Costly Lobbying Program</p>
        <p>In the past, auto companies and other industries have allotted millions of dollars to try to influence pollution legislation. One industry-financed lobbying organization, Citizens for Sensible Control of Acid Rain, spent more than $5 million from 1983 to 1988 to block legislation to control acid rain, according to figures gathered by the Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization.</p>
        <p>In addition, political action committees connected to electric utilities, coal, chemical, oil and auto industries gave $23 million to House and Senate candidates from 1981 to 1988, the group said.</p>
        <p>''Industry is going to fight tooth and nail all the way down the line,'' said Casey Padgett, legislative counsel for Environmental Action, a Washington-based advocacy group. But ''Congress doesn't feel comfortable doing something that can be read as weakening standards or adopting industry's position.''</p>
        <p>Industry wants to give the impression of unity in its effort to hold down the cost of a tougher Clean Air Act. One role of the Clean Air Working Group, the main industry lobbying organization, is to keep its disparate membership from cutting separate deals with Congress that could hurt other businesses, said William D. Fay, the group's administrator.</p>
        <p>But the clean air legislation offers ample opportunity for conflict between and within industries. The natural gas industry is expected to benefit at the expense of the coal industry because gas is a cleaner burning fuel than coal. And within the coal business, producers of low-sulfur coal would benefit at the expense of high-sulfur coal, the dirtier source of fuel.</p>
        <p>''I think these guys are pulling out all the stops, but I don't think they are going to succeed,'' said William G. Rosenberg, an assistant Environmental Protection Administration administrator.</p>
