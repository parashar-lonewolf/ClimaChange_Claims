        <p>LEAD: In Brazil's great undeveloped Amazon basin, the national Government spent $600 million in tax credits to subsidize the development - between 1965 and 1983 - of 469 cattle ranches averaging 23,000 hectares each (about 57,500 acres).</p>
        <p>In Brazil's great undeveloped Amazon basin, the national Government spent $600 million in tax credits to subsidize the development - between 1965 and 1983 - of 469 cattle ranches averaging 23,000 hectares each (about 57,500 acres).</p>
        <p>At first, the land reclaimed from tropical rainforest supported one animal per hectare. But neither the ranchers nor the Government invested in weed control or soil fertility so that within five years the stocking rate fell to one animal on four hectares.</p>
        <p>With tax incentives available for clearing the land, but not for maintaining its productivity, the ranchers soon abandoned their holdings. As the soil wore out, they moved on to clear the forest for other subsidized ranch developments.</p>
        <p>The cost was far more than $600 million (of which the Brazilian Government recovered only a fraction). Indiscriminate depletion of forests meant the loss of watershed protection and species habitat as well as potentially valuable forest products; and it vastly increased net emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide -a major contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect that's heating up the earth's climate.</p>
        <p>Thus, Brazil's ''development'' efforts not only worsened that nation's economic plight and hindered its ability to repay its huge international debt -both matters of concern to the developed world. They also endangered the environment of other nations, including the United States.</p>
        <p>For many such reasons, some detailed in earlier columns, global environmental problems are a major -perhaps the major - threat to U.S. security, and to the security of mankind. Yet, amid all the talk of President-elect Bush's staff and Cabinet choices and his budget policies, scarcely a word has been heard about the ozone layer, acid rain, deforestation, soil depletion, population control, and other disasters happening or waiting to happen.</p>
        <p>The world's resources now support five to six billion people. The United Nations projects, however, that world population will exceed eight billion by 2025. That means rising demand for food, firewood and timber, hence more deforestation, soil depletion and erosion. More and more land will become desert and the atmosphere less breathable; millions will move to unmanageably crowded urban areas; poverty and starvation will inexorably stalk their miserable streets.</p>
        <p>On this vital matter, Mr. Bush's campaign positions are not encouraging; but the growth of the world's population is a crisis he cannot responsibly evade: every two seconds, five people are added to it. Everywhere he looks, if he bothers to see, he will find such questions intruding upon, even overriding, the usual concerns of government.</p>
        <p>In Central America, for example, 38 percent of forest cover has been lost since 1950, with far more trees still being cut than replanted. An ecological deterioration of that magnitude works against societal stability - and can't be remedied by any amount of aid to the contras in Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>International environmental problems deserve to be among the Bush administration's highest priorities for at least three hardly disputable reasons:</p>
        <p>First, ozone depletion, acid rain, ocean pollution and the like are clear and present threats to all nations, respecting no national boundaries.</p>
        <p>Second, these problems demand international cooperation and promise the kind of joint international efforts that can promote understanding and peace among nations. Finally, a better life for the millions in the undeveloped world is in the interests of U.S. security - and obviously is a target for professed U.S. idealism.</p>
        <p>Since global problems requiring global solutions will have to be addressed at the Presidential and Cabinet level, the appointment of James Baker as Secretary of State could be crucial. As Treasury Secretary, he sometimes mitigated the international banks' tendencies to support environmentally destructive third world projects, such as Amazonian cattle ranches. If he will, he can use his new role to save natural resources, as he onced worked to lower the value of the dollar.</p>
        <p>But only George Bush can set the necessary overall policy - that all international relations, including trade, debt payment and development assistance, be conducted in explicit recognition of environmental issues, and attuned to their resolution. If the planet's rush to self-destruction is to be slowed in time, Mr. Bush may be the last President to have that opportunity.</p>
